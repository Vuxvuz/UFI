They are brimming with antioxidants, flavonoids, and other biologically active substances that may be good for health.\n\n**Coffee**\n\nThe takeaway on coffee: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia.\n\n* Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake.\n* Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight.\n\nBecause of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\n\n**Tea**\n\nThe takeaway on tea: Tea is the simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. Herbal teas are not made from the Camellia plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas.\n\nAnimal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\n\n* However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (130-140° F).\n* Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea.\n\nSo pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Drinks to Consume in Moderation", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation/", "content": "**Drinks to Consume in Moderation**\n\n*   **Artificially Sweetened Drinks**: Research suggests that artificially sweetened drinks may contribute to weight gain. Because sweet “diet” drinks may condition you to crave other sweet drinks and foods, drinking “diet” drinks has the possibility of leading to weight gain.\n*   **100% Fruit Juice**: Fruit juice has vitamins, but it is high in calories from concentrated fruit sugars, so stick to no more than a small glass (four to six ounces) a day. If you’re in the mood for fruit, enjoy a whole piece of fruit which is much lower in sugars than its juice equivalent and contains the added benefit of fiber.\n*   **Milk**: There’s no need to drink more than a glass or two of low fat or skim milk a day.

This includes soda, pop, cola, tonic, fruit punch, lemonade (and other “ades”), sweetened powdered drinks, as well as sports and energy drinks.\n\n*   There are 4.2 grams of sugar in a single teaspoon.\n*   Imagine scooping up 7 to 10 teaspoons full of sugar and dumping it into your 12-ounce glass of water. Does that sound too sweet? You may be surprised to learn that’s how much added sugar is in the typical can of soda.\n\n**Sugary Drinks and Health**\n\n When it comes to ranking beverages best for our health, sugary drinks fall at the bottom of the list because they provide so many calories and virtually no other nutrients. People who drink sugary beverages do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food, and research indicates they also don’t compensate for the high caloric content of these beverages by eating less food.\n\n*   The average can of sugar-sweetened soda or fruit punch provides about 150 calories, almost all of them from added sugar.\n*   If you were to drink just one of these sugary drinks every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 5 pounds in a year.\n\n**The Role of Sugary Drink Marketing**\n\n Beverage companies spend billions of dollars marketing sugary drinks, yet generally rebuffs suggestions that its products and marketing tactics play any role in the obesity epidemic. In 2013, Coca-Cola launched an “anti-obesity” advertisement recognizing that sweetened soda and many other foods and drinks have contributed to the obesity epidemic.\n\n*   The company advertised its wide array of calorie-free beverages and encouraged individuals to take responsibility for their own drink choices and weight.\n*   Responses to the advertisement were mixed, with many experts calling it misleading and inaccurate in stating the health dangers of soda.\n\n**Cutting Back on Sugary Drinks**\n\n When it comes to our health, it’s clear that sugary drinks should be avoided. There is a range of healthier beverages that can be consumed in their place, with water being the top option.\n\n*   If you’re a frequent soda drinker, this is easier said than done.\n*   If it’s the carbonation you like, give sparkling water a try.\n*   If the taste is too bland, try a naturally flavored sparkling water.\n*   If that’s still too much of a jump, add a splash of juice, sliced citrus, or even some fresh herbs.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Public Health Concerns: Sugary Drinks", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/beverages-public-health-concerns/", "content": "**Public Health Concerns: Sugary Drinks**\n\nAmericans consume on average more than 200 calories each day from sugary drinks (58,59)—four times what they consumed in 1965 (60)—and strong evidence indicates that our rising thirst for “liquid candy” has been a major contributor to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. (41,46,52-54,61)\n\n**Reducing Our Preference for Sugary Drinks**\n\nResearch shows that sugary drinks are one of the major determinants of obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence indicates that high consumption of sugary drinks increases the risk for heart disease, the number one killer of men and women in the U.S. Reducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels—from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government.\n\n**Steps to Address the Issue**\n\n*   Beverage manufacturers: Create beverages that have much less sugar. A good target: Beverages that have no more than 1 gram of sugar per ounce, and are free of non-caloric sweeteners (such as sucralose, aspartame, or stevia).\n*   Individuals: Make healthy drinking your personal priority. Start by choosing beverages with few or no calories. Water is best.\n*   Food shoppers for the family: Don’t stock sugary drinks at home.\n*   Schools and workplaces: Offer students and workers several healthy beverage choices.\n*   Government: Require better labeling on sugary drinks, and scrap sugar subsidies.\n\n**New York City’s Soda Ban**\n\nIn June of 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City proposed a ban on drinks sweetened with sugar that contain more than 25 calories per 8 fluid ounces. The ban would impact “super-sized” sodas larger than 16 ounces.\n\n**Boston’s Traffic-Light Campaign**\n\nThe city has also unveiled a “traffic-light” style promotional campaign to help consumers choose healthier beverages based on their sugar and nutrient content. The campaign, which groups beverages into “red” (limit), “yellow” (drink occasionally), and “green” (best choice) categories, is similar to the “How Sweet Is It” beverage guidelines developed by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Nutrition in 2009.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Vartanian LR, Schwartz MB, Brownell KD.

[1] Some brands also contain B vitamins associated with increased energy (not to be confused with energy drinks, which are a different product entirely).\n\n*   Sports drinks contain carbohydrate in the form of sugar (e.g., glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose) or contain no sugar and are flavored instead with low-calorie sweeteners.\n*   The specific amount of sugar and electrolytes in sports drinks is intended to allow for quick hydration and absorption.\n\nThis type of nutrient depletion generally occurs only with high-intensity exercise that lasts an hour or more. For the non-athlete, a sports beverage is just another sugary drink.\n\nSports Drinks and Health\n\nResearch has shown benefit of sports drinks in adult athletes (though not conclusive as some studies show no benefit), but research in children is lacking. [2] Children sweat at highly variable rates, so it is more difficult to establish an amount of exercise time that the drinks may be useful. [1]\n\nHowever, with monitoring by coaches or parents, providing these drinks to children and adolescents who are exercising vigorously for more than 60 minutes may help to prevent dehydration. For children who are engaged in routine or play-based physical activity, these drinks are usually unnecessary. [1]\n\nEstimates show that sports drinks comprise about 26% of total sugar-sweetened beverage intake in adolescents. [2] Sports drinks contain less sugar than soda and energy drinks, but still contain simple sugars.\n\nFor example, a nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, compared with 21 grams of sugar in a popular sports drinks. Drinking too many of these, especially when not performing vigorous exercise, can increase the risk of overweight obesity and other health problems such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout.\n\nThere is also a risk of dental caries. A study following more than 4,100 females and 3,400 males for 7 years as part of the Growing Up Today Study II found that the more frequently sports beverages were consumed, the greater the association with an increased body mass index leading to overweight obesity, especially in boys.\n\nThe authors cited endorsements of the drinks by sports celebrities as a strong influencer in young male athletes. The drinks may also be perceived as healthy because they are allowed to be sold in schools and sporting events, so may be consumed in excess.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWater that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. A sports drink may be used by people engaging in exercise of vigorous intensity for more than one hour, especially if sweating heavily.\n\nPerhaps of greater importance in athletes of any age, but especially youth, is to encourage a balanced diet, snacks as needed, and adequate water that will best enhance physical and mental performance. Pediatricians should discuss the use of sports drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully.

Though sometimes confused with sports beverages, energy drinks are a different product entirely.\n\n**What Are Energy Drinks?**\n\nThey are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts of caffeine and as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee. Other substances purported to increase energy may be added, like B vitamins and herbs such as ginseng and guarana.\n\n**Concerns with Energy Drinks**\n\nMost concerning is a lack of regulation about the safety of these drinks, as well as aggressive marketing tactics geared toward adolescents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2007, 1,145 adolescents ages 12 to 17 went to the emergency room for an energy drink-related emergency. In 2011 that number climbed to 1,499.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nA typical energy drink may contain:\n\n* Carbonated water\n* Around 40 grams of sugar (from sucrose and or glucose)\n* 160 mg or more of caffeine\n* Artificial sweetener\n* Herbs substances associated with mental alertness and performance but that lack scientific evidence with controlled trials (taurine, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartarate, guarana seed extract, B vitamins)\n\n**Special Concerns**\n\nAmplified negative health effects in adolescents. Children and teens may experience heightened effects from the high amounts of caffeine, added sugars including high fructose corn syrup, low-calorie sweeteners, and herbal stimulants, partly due to their smaller body size.\n\nMarketing tactics towards youth. Estimates show more than a 240% increase in U.S. and worldwide sales of energy drinks. It is a $21 billion industry, with marketing campaigns targeting youth and being sold in places that are easily accessed by this age group.\n\n**Negative Health Outcomes**\n\nEmerging evidence has linked energy drink consumption with negative health consequences in youth like risk-seeking behaviors, poor mental health, adverse cardiovascular effects, and metabolic, renal, or dental problems.\n\n**Excessive Caffeine**\n\nToo much caffeine from any beverage, particularly when several are taken in one day in sensitive individuals, can lead to anxiety, insomnia, heart problems like irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure, and in rare cases seizures or cardiac arrest. Some energy drinks may contain as much as 500 mg per can (the amount in 14 cans of cola).\n\n**High Sugar Content**\n\nBecause of the excessive sugar content in some energy drinks, they carry the same health risks associated with other sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\n**Dangers with Alcohol**\n\nA greater danger is introduced if energy drinks are combined with alcohol, a trend largely seen in underage drinkers and associated with binge drinking.

However, too much sodium in the diet can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.\n\n**Recommended Amounts**\nThe U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes state that there is not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance or a toxic level for sodium (aside from chronic disease risk). The Tolerable Upper intake Level (UL) has not been established; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.\n\n**Guidelines for Adequate Intakes (AI) of Sodium**\nFor men and women 14 years of age and older and pregnant women, the AI is 1,500 milligrams a day. A Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) Intake has also been established, based on the evidence of benefit of a reduced sodium intake on the risk of cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure.\n\n**Types of Salt**\nFinely ground salts are dense, so they tend to contain more sodium than coarser salts. Note that sodium content can vary widely among brands, so check the Nutrition Facts label for exact amounts.\n\n*   Iodized table salt, fine: 2,300 mg\n*   Kosher salt, coarse: 1,920 mg\n*   Kosher salt, fine, Diamond Crystal†: 1,120 mg\n*   Sea salt, fine: 2,120 mg\n*   Sea salt, coarse: 1,560 mg\n*   Pink (Himalayan) salt: 2,200 mg\n*   Black salt: 1,150-2,200 mg\n*   Fleur de sel: 1,560-2,320 mg\n*   Potassium salt (salt substitute): 0 mg (contains 2,760-3,180 mg potassium)\n\n† The inclusion of brand-names on this list is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.\n\n**Sodium and Health**\nIn most people, the kidneys have trouble keeping up with excess sodium in the blood. As sodium accumulates, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium. This increases both the amount of fluid surrounding cells and the volume of blood in the bloodstream. Increased blood volume means more work for the heart and more pressure on blood vessels.\n\n**Food Sources**\nSodium isn’t generally a nutrient that you need to look for; it finds you. Almost any unprocessed food like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, meats, and dairy foods is low in sodium. Most of the salt in our diets comes from commercially prepared foods, not from salt added to cooking at home or even from salt added at the table before eating.\n\n**Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity**\nA deficiency of sodium in the U.S. is rare because it is so commonly added to a wide variety of foods and occurs naturally in some foods. Hyponatremia is the term used to describe abnormally low amounts of sodium in the blood. This occurs mainly in older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities or hospitals who take medications or have health conditions that deplete the body of sodium, leading to hyponatremia.\n\n*   Symptoms of hyponatremia can include:\n    *   Nausea\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Headaches\n    *   Altered mental state\n    *   Confusion\n    *   Lethargy\n    *   Seizures\n    *   Coma\n\nToo much sodium in the blood is called hypernatremia. This acute condition can happen in older adults who are mentally and physically impaired who do not eat or drink enough, or who are sick with a high fever, vomiting, or infection that causes severe dehydration.\n\n*   Symptoms of hypernatremia can include:\n    *   Nausea\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Weakness\n    *   Loss of appetite\n    *   Intense thirst\n    *   Confusion\n    *   Kidney damage", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Take Action: How to Reduce Your Sodium Intake", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/salt-and-sodium/take-action-on-salt/", "content": "**Take Action: How to Reduce Your Sodium Intake**\n\nStart Early\nHigh blood pressure can start developing in childhood, and becoming conditioned to high-salt tastes early in life can make it more difficult to cut back later. Childhood is an important time to focus on preventing the development of high blood pressure, but cutting back on salt and sodium can have a significant impact for people of all ages.\n\n**Cut Back on Prepared Foods**\nAbout 70% of the sodium Americans eat comes from processed, prepared foods such as crackers, cheese, and canned foods, and restaurant meals. [1] Even processed foods that don’t taste “salty”—like breakfast cereal—can have surprisingly high sodium levels. Additionally, foods consumed numerous times a day, such as bread, can add up to higher sodium intake even though an individual serving is not high in sodium.\n\n**Eat Smaller Portions of Salty Foods**\nThere’s no need to completely eliminate favorite high-sodium foods or traditional cultural cuisines such as soy sauce (China), salted pickles and fish (Japan), or salty cheese and olives (Greece, Italy). Instead, it’s best to enjoy such foods in smaller amounts.\n\n**Discover Reduced or No-Sodium Alternatives**\nSalt substitutes, including herbs and spices, and citrus like lemon can provide more flavor with less sodium. For example, citrus and sodium activate the same taste sensors so that less sodium can be used when they are combined.\n\n**Cook Your Own Meals**\nInstead of eating processed foods and restaurant meals, focus on cooking with fresh ingredients. Cooking with fresh unprocessed ingredients allows you to control the amount of salt (if any) you decide to add to your meals.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Public Health Concerns: Salt and Sodium", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/salt-and-sodium/sodium-public-health-concerns/", "content": "**Public Health Concerns: Salt and Sodium**\n\nThe Nutrition Source Search for: Home Nutrition News What Should I Eat? expand child menu Healthy Eating Plate & Pyramid expand child menu Healthy Eating Plate Translations Kid’s Healthy Eating Plate Whole Grains Protein Vegetables and Fruits Fats and Cholesterol expand child menu Types of Fat Cholesterol Dietary Fat and Disease Vitamins and Minerals Healthy Drinks expand child menu Water Other Healthy Beverage Options Drinks to Consume in Moderation Sugary Drinks expand child menu Sports Drinks Energy Drinks Public Health Concerns: Sugary Drinks Low-Calorie Sweeteners Salt and Sodium expand child menu Take Action: How to Reduce Your Intake\n\n**Burden on Public Health and Health Care Spending**\n\nNine out of 10 U.S. men and women will develop hypertension at some point in their lives. [1] This epidemic places a huge burden on the healthcare system and on our economy, estimated at $73.4 billion in direct and indirect costs for 2009 alone. [2]\n\n**Reducing Sodium Intake**\n\nResearchers estimate that reducing the average daily sodium intake in the U.S. to 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) per day would prevent 11 million cases of hypertension and would save $18 billion in health care costs each year. [3] Another study estimates that cutting average daily sodium consumption by 1,200 milligrams (about ½ teaspoon of salt) would prevent up to 99,000 heart attacks and 66,000 strokes, and would save up to 92,000 lives a year.\n\n**Regulating the Amount of Salt in Prepared Foods**\n\nGiven that processed foods contribute to a large portion of people’s sodium intake in the US and Europe, governments have started working with the food industry to lower sodium levels. US Initiatives Currently, there is no limit on the amount of sodium allowed in foods, because salt has long been considered to be “generally recognized as safe” (or GRAS)—a regulatory designation called into question by 40 years of research on the hazards of eating too much salt.\n\n**Industry Cutbacks and Government Action**\n\nMany players in the food industry have already taken the lead in reducing sodium, but broad-scale sodium reduction may also require action from the government and political sectors. Regulating the Amount of Salt in Prepared Foods Given that processed foods contribute to a large portion of people’s sodium intake in the US and Europe, governments have started working with the food industry to lower sodium levels.\n\n**New FDA Guidance**\n\n2021 update: FDA releases voluntary sodium-reduction goals The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released new voluntary guidance on October 13, 2021, encouraging the food industry to gradually reduce sodium in commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods over the next two and a half years—with the aim of helping Americans reduce their average levels of sodium from 3,400 to 3,000 mg day.\n\n**Other Key Recommendations**\n\nUpdating food labels to match a Daily Value for sodium of 1,500 milligrams a day (instead of 2,300 milligrams). This would help consumers have a better idea of the level of salt in their foods—and manufacturers would have more of an incentive to cut back on the amount of salt in their products.\n\n**International Initiatives**\n\nFinland and the United Kingdom have led successful sodium reduction efforts. [7] In Finland, a government-led program of education, salt-labeling legislation, and pressure on the food industry has led to a 30 percent reduction in salt intake, from 12,000 milligrams a day to around 9,000 milligrams today.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Carbohydrates", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/", "content": "**Carbohydrates**\n\nThe Nutrition Source does not recommend or endorse any products.\n\nWhat’s most important is the type of carbohydrate you choose to eat because some sources are healthier than others.

Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity.\n\n**Carbohydrate Quality**\n\nThe healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans—promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients. Unhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.\n\nThese items contain easily digested carbohydrates that may contribute to weight gain, interfere with weight loss, and promote diabetes and heart disease.\n\n**The Healthy Eating Plate**\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate recommends filling most of your plate with healthy carbohydrates – with vegetables (except potatoes) and fruits taking up about half of your plate, and whole grains filling up about one fourth of your plate.\n\nTry these tips for adding healthy carbohydrates to your diet:\n\n* Start the day with whole grains. Try a hot cereal, like steel cut or old fashioned oats (not instant oatmeal), or a cold cereal that lists a whole grain first on the ingredient list and is low in sugar.\n* Use whole grain breads for lunch or snacks. Confused about how to find a whole-grain bread? Look for bread that lists as the first ingredient whole wheat, whole rye, or some other whole grain —and even better, one that is made with only whole grains, such as 100 percent whole wheat bread.\n* Also look beyond the bread aisle. Whole wheat bread is often made with finely ground flour, and bread products are often high in sodium. Instead of bread, try a whole grain in salad form such as brown rice or quinoa.\n* Choose whole fruit instead of juice. An orange has two times as much fiber and half as much sugar as a 12-ounce glass of orange juice.\n* Pass on potatoes, and instead bring on the beans. Rather than fill up on potatoes – which have been found to promote weight gain – choose beans for an excellent source of slowly digested carbohydrates. Beans and other legumes such as chickpeas also provide a healthy dose of protein.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Carbohydrates and Blood Sugar", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/carbohydrates-and-blood-sugar/", "content": "**Carbohydrates and Blood Sugar**\n\nWhen people eat a food containing carbohydrates, the digestive system breaks down the digestible ones into sugar, which enters the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that prompts cells to absorb blood sugar for energy or storage. As cells absorb blood sugar, levels in the bloodstream begin to fall. When this happens, the pancreas start making glucagon, a hormone that signals the liver to start releasing stored sugar.\n\nThis interplay of insulin and glucagon ensure that cells throughout the body, and especially in the brain, have a steady supply of blood sugar. Carbohydrate metabolism is important in the development of type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body can’t make enough insulin or can’t properly use the insulin it makes.\n\n**Glycemic Index**\n\nIn the past, carbohydrates were commonly classified as being either “simple” or “complex,” and described as follows:\n\n*   Simple carbohydrates: These carbohydrates are composed of sugars (such as fructose and glucose) which have simple chemical structures composed of only one sugar (monosaccharides) or two sugars (disaccharides).\n*   Complex carbohydrates: These carbohydrates have more complex chemical structures, with three or more sugars linked together (known as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides).\n\nHowever, dividing carbohydrates into simple and complex does not account for the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar and chronic diseases. To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the glycemic index was developed.\n\n**Glycemic Load**\n\nA food’s glycemic load is determined by multiplying its glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate the food contains. In general, a glycemic load of 20 or more is high, 11 to 19 is medium, and 10 or under is low.\n\nHere are some examples of foods with different glycemic loads:\n\n*   Low glycemic load (10 or under):\n    *   Bran cereals\n    *   Apple\n    *   Orange\n    *   Kidney beans\n    *   Black beans\n    *   Lentils\n    *   Wheat tortilla\n    *   Skim milk\n    *   Cashews\n    *   Peanuts\n*   Medium glycemic load (11-19):\n    *   Pearled barley: 1 cup cooked\n    *   Brown rice: 3/4 cup cooked\n    *   Oatmeal: 1 cup cooked\n    *   Bulgur: 3/4 cup cooked\n    *   Rice cakes: 3 cakes\n*   High glycemic load (20+):\n    *   Baked potato\n    *   French fries\n    *   Refined breakfast cereal: 1 oz\n    *   Sugar-sweetened beverages: 12 oz\n    *   Candy bars: 1/2-oz bar or 3 mini bars\n    *   Couscous: 1 cup cooked\n    *   White basmati rice: 1 cup cooked\n    *   White-flour pasta: 1 1/4 cup cooked\n\n**References**\n\n*   de Munter JS, Hu FB, Spiegelman D, Franz M, van Dam RM.

Achieving a healthy and sustainable food future is an urgent matter that depends on global collaborative efforts.\n\n**Why Is a Sustainable Food Supply Important?**\n\nToday, more than three billion people are malnourished and many of our planet’s 7 billion inhabitants eat diets low in quality. At the same time, the world’s population is rapidly expanding, and it is estimated there will be close to 10 billion people on our planet by 2050.\n\n**Healthy Diets From Sustainable Food Systems**\n\nDespite substantial scientific evidence linking diets with human health and environmental sustainability, historically there’s been a lack of globally-agreed upon targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production. However, in 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission assessed existing evidence and developed global scientific targets that define a “safe operating space” for food systems.\n\n**A Great Food Transformation Is Necessary**\n\nTransitioning to a sustainable food system that can deliver healthy diets for an estimated 10 billion people by 2050 is an unprecedented challenge. However, the Commission emphasizes that “data are both sufficient and strong enough to warrant immediate action, and delay will increase the likelihood of serious, even disastrous, consequences.”\n\n**Key Strategies**\n\nTo begin this process, the Commission proposes five strategies as general starting points for national, regional, city, and local change:\n\n*   Seek international and national commitment to shift toward healthy diets.\n*   Reorient agricultural priorities from producing high quantities of food to producing healthy food.\n*   Sustainably intensify food production to increase high-quality output.\n*   Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans.\n*   Reduce food loss and waste in food production and consumption phases by 50%.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nAchieving a healthy and sustainable food system is an urgent matter that depends on collaborative efforts from governments, the private and public sectors, as well as individuals. Supply and demand work both ways—a shift in the food production landscape depends on a shift in our diets.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Fiber", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/fiber/", "content": "**Fiber**\n\nFiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can’t digest. Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body’s use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check.\n\n* Children and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day.\n* Great sources are whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts.\n\n**Types of Fiber**\n\nFiber comes in two varieties, both beneficial to health:\n\n* Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, chia seeds, nuts, beans, lentils, apples, and blueberries.\n* Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include whole wheat products (especially wheat bran), quinoa, brown rice, legumes, leafy greens like kale, almonds, walnuts, seeds, and fruits with edible skins like pears and apples.\n\n**Benefits of Fiber**\n\nFiber appears to lower the risk of developing various conditions, including:\n\n* Heart disease\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Breast cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Constipation\n* Diverticular disease\n\n**Should I Avoid Nuts and Seeds with Diverticulosis?**\n\nResearch has shown that eating nuts and seeds may actually help prevent diverticulitis, rather than exacerbating it. A high-fiber intake with a focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables has been found to have a strong association with decreased risk of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\n\n**Increasing Fiber Intake**\n\nSome tips for increasing fiber intake:\n\n* Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices.\n* Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with minimally processed brown rice and other whole grains like barley, millet, amaranth, farro, and quinoa.\n* Add high-fiber foods to current meals: 1-2 tablespoons of almonds, ground flaxseeds, or chia seeds to cereals; diced vegetables to casseroles, stir-fried dishes, and soups.\n* Choose cereals that have a whole grain as their first ingredient.\n* Snack on crunchy raw vegetables or a handful of almonds instead of chips and crackers.\n* Substitute beans or legumes for meat two to three times a week in chili and soups.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Added Sugar", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/", "content": "**Added Sugar**\n\nThe body doesn’t need to get any carbohydrate from added sugar. That’s why the Healthy Eating Pyramid says sugary drinks and sweets should be used sparingly, if at all, and the Healthy Eating Plate does not include foods with added sugars.\n\n* 4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoon\n* Keep this tip in mind when reading nutrition labels to better visualize just how much added sugar the product contains. For example, one 12-ounce can of cola contains 39 grams–almost 10 teaspoons of sugar!\n\nThe average American adult, teenager, and child consumes about 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, or about 270 calories.\n\nWhile we sometimes add sugar or sweeteners like honey to food or beverages, most added sugar comes from processed and prepared foods. The leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks like ice cream, pastries, and cookies.\n\nLess obvious yet significant contributors are breakfast cereals and yogurt.\n\n* The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 advise that all Americans 2 years and older limit added sugars in the diet to less than 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie day diet, that translates into 200 calories or 50 grams of sugar daily (about 12 teaspoons of sugar).\n* Toddlers and infants younger than 2 years should not be given solids or beverages with any added sugars.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that Americans drastically cut back on added sugar to help slow the obesity and heart disease epidemics. The AHA suggests a stricter added-sugar limit of no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) for most adult women and no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar) for most men.\n\n* For children ages 2-18, the AHA recommends a lower daily limit of added sugars to less than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams per day.\n* Sugary beverages should be limited to no more than 8 ounces a week.\n\n**Spotting Sugar on a Food Label**\n\nThe updated Nutrition Facts label now lists both “Total Sugars” and underneath “Added Sugars.” The percent Daily Value (DV) for added sugars is based on the recommended limit from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans of less than 50 grams a day (about 12 teaspoons) for an average 2,000 calorie diet.\n\n* A lower amount for a lower-calorie diet, and higher for a higher-calorie diet.\n* The DV can be an easy way to compare food products for added sugars: 5% DV or less of added sugars per serving is considered low; 20% DV or more of added sugars per serving is considered high.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nIngredients are listed in descending order by weight, so where sugar is listed in relation to other ingredients can indicate how much sugar a particular food contains. Added sugars go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories.\n\n* Some other names for sugar that you may see on food labels:\n\t+ Agave nectar\n\t+ Dextrose\n\t+ Maltose\n\t+ Brown sugar\n\t+ Evaporated cane juice\n\t+ Malt syrup\n\t+ Cane crystals\n\t+ Fructose\n\t+ Maple syrup\n\t+ Cane sugar\n\t+ Fruit juice concentrates\n\t+ Molasses\n\t+ Coconut sugar\n\t+ Glucose\n\t+ Raw sugar\n\t+ Corn sweetener\n\t+ High-fructose corn syrup\n\t+ Sucrose\n\t+ Corn syrup\n\t+ Honey\n\t+ Syrup\n\t+ Crystalline fructose\n\t+ Invert sugar\n\n**Key Sources of Added Sugar**\n\n* Sugary drinks: prime source of extra calories that can contribute to weight gain and provide no nutritional benefits.\n* Studies indicate that liquid carbohydrates such as sugar-sweetened beverages are less filling than solid food, causing people to continue to feel hungry after drinking them despite their high calories.\n\nThe average 20-ounce bottle of sugar-sweetened soda, lemonade, or iced tea contains about 65 grams of added sugar, often from high-fructose corn syrup. That’s the equivalent of 16 teaspoons of table sugar.\n\n* If you were to drink just one 12-ounce can of a sugar-sweetened soft drink every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 15 pounds over three years.\n* Be careful to read serving sizes of bottled beverages. Many are sold in 20-ounce bottles, but what is considered one serving of that beverage may still vary among manufactures.\n\n**Choosing Minimally Processed Foods**\n\n* Choosing minimally processed breakfast foods—such as whole grain toast with nut butter, or a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned oatmeal—that don’t have lengthy ingredient lists is a great way to avoid added sugars.\n* Unfortunately, many common breakfast foods such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, cereal bars, instant oatmeal with added flavoring, and pastries can contain high amounts of added sugars.\n\nSome ingredient lists mask the amount of sugar in a product. To avoid having “sugar” as the first ingredient, food manufacturers may use multiple forms of sugar—each with a different name—and list each one individually on the nutrient label.\n\n* But don’t be fooled; your body metabolizes all added sugars the same way as it doesn’t distinguish between “brown sugar,” “molasses,” “honey,” and other caloric sweeteners.\n* When reading a label, make sure to spot all sources of added sugars even if they’re not listed as the first few ingredients.\n\n**Reducing Added Sugar Intake**\n\n* Choose plain yogurt with no added sugar and stir in fresh or frozen fruit or unsweetened applesauce and a dash of cinnamon.\n* Choose cereals with 5% of the Daily Value or less of added sugars and add sliced ripe banana or berries.\n* Choose water, seltzer, herbal tea, coffee and other beverages with no added sugar. Add a slice of orange, lemon, lime, or cucumber for a subtle flavor boost.\n\nWhen a sweets craving hits, try one of these first:\n\n* 1/4 cup of unsweetened dried fruit\n* 1 cup of ripe fresh fruit\n* or a 1-ounce square of 75% dark chocolate\n\nWhen baking, reduce the amount of added sugar by 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Or reduce the sugar by substituting half the amount with unsweetened applesauce or mashed ripe banana; for example, instead of 1 cup of sugar, use ½ cup sugar and ½ cup mashed fruit.\n\n* If you choose to enjoy a favorite treat high in sugar, practice eating a smaller portion than usual. Enjoy it fully by chewing slowly and savoring it.\n* Your taste buds can adjust to sweetness levels! As you consistently reduce your total sugar intake, you may notice your sweets cravings lessen or that certain foods now taste too sweet.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Body Fat", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/measuring-fat/", "content": "**Title**\nFat Tissue: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n\n**Overview**\n\nFat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. Some are necessary for good health. Types of body fat include:\n\n*   Brown fat – Infants carry the most brown fat, which keeps them warm.\n*   White fat – These large round cells are the most abundant type and are designed for fat storage, accumulating in the belly, thighs, and hips.\n*   Beige fat – This type of white fat can be converted to perform similar traits as brown fat, such as being able to generate heat with exposure to cold temperatures or during exercise.\n*   Pink fat – This type of white fat is converted to pink during pregnancy and lactation, producing and secreting breast milk.\n*   Essential fat – This type may be made up of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally.\n\n**Location**\n\nSubcutaneous fat sits directly underneath the skin’s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It’s the body’s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs.\n\nVisceral fat accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart. Having a lot of visceral fat is linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\n**How to Measure Body Fat**\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing weight in pounds by height in inches, then multiplying the answer by 703. BMI can be used as a screening tool for potential weight-related problems rather than to diagnose certain conditions.\n\nWaist circumference is considered a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance.\n\nThe waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is calculated by measuring the waist and the hip, then dividing the waist by the hip measurement. It’s a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality.\n\n**Additional Measures of Body Fat**\n\nOther methods for measuring body fat include:\n\n*   Skinfold thickness\n*   Bioelectric impedance (BIA)\n*   Underwater weighing (densitometry or hydrostatic weighing)\n*   Air-displacement plethysmography\n*   Dilution method (hydrometry)\n*   Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)\n*   Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Healthy Weight", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/", "content": "**What Is a Healthy Weight?**\n\nA healthy weight is a number that is associated with a low risk of weight-related diseases and health issues. Although healthy weight guidelines have been developed at population levels, each person’s healthy weight range will vary and depend on factors such as age, sex, genetics, body frame, existing medical history, lifestyle habits, and weight as a young adult.\n\n**How useful are the MET Life Height-Weight Tables?**\n\nThere are many reasons for weight gain including certain medications (corticosteroids, antidepressants, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, insulin), pregnancy, chronic stress, chronically poor sleep, an excessive calorie intake, and lack of adequate exercise.\n\n*   Maintain, Don’t Gain\n    Maintaining a healthy weight can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, and many different cancers.\n*   Benefits of Even Modest Weight Loss\n    If you have gained more than 25 pounds in adulthood, losing that weight may seem daunting. And when the extra weight doesn’t feel good, you may be tempted to start a drastic weight loss plan. But the good news is that even a modest weight loss of 5% of your current body weight is likely to produce several health benefits, including improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood sugars, physical mobility, and quality of life.\n\n**Tips to lose weight safely:**\n\n*   Keep it slow and steady.\n    People who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. This allows the body to adjust to the change and can lower the risk of developing strong cravings and feelings of deprivation that often accompany more rapid weight loss.\n*   Include self-management and monitoring.\n    This includes setting goals such as with the SMART acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Start by creating 2-3 short-term SMART goals. Self-monitoring such as with daily or weekly food journaling or using behavior apps can provide insight and accountability to eating behaviors.\n*   Create a support system.\n    Research suggests that having frequent contact with others for support (e.g., trusted family member or friend, physician, health coach, registered dietitian, or a fellow friend or coworker on a similar healthy weight journey) can be valuable in providing encouragement and accountability.\n*   Develop healthy eating patterns.\n    Although some researchers have questioned the usefulness of energy balance (calories eaten versus calories expended), current evidence indicates that calorie reduction remains the most effective approach for weight control. There are many dietary strategies (e.g., high-carb low-fat vs. low-carb high-fat vs. intermittent fasting vs. a Mediterranean diet), but research has not consistently shown greater weight loss with one plan over another in the long-term.\n*   Practice mindfulness.\n    Do you eat too fast or while distracted watching television or scrolling through your phone? Do you stress-eat or snack even when not hungry? Mindful eating addresses these behaviors that are associated with weight gain. Increasing awareness and appreciation of food can provide greater satisfaction, physically and mentally, that may help reduce overeating.\n*   Stay active.\n    Exercise is one component in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight gain, but it also plays a key role in wellbeing and mental health. The National Weight Control Registry, which follows people who have lost and maintained a 30-pound loss for at least one year, shows that participants include about one hour of moderate-vigorous exercise daily such as brisk walking.\n*   Prioritize self-care.\n    In a rushed society with never-ending demands, taking care of our bodies can quickly fall to the bottom of our priority list.

Research strongly supports its benefits across a range of physical and mental health conditions for people of all ages. However, busy lifestyles and an environment that encourages being sedentary for many hours of the day (driving door-to-door, sitting at an office desk, relaxing for the evening in front of a television) have led to exercise ranking low as a priority for many people.\n\n**Types of Exercise**\n\nAll types of exercises offer health benefits. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further. But it is important to remember that some exercise is better than none, and that most everyone can participate in some form of exercise safely.\n\n*   Aerobic Cardiovascular physical activity. These are activities that are intense enough and performed long enough to maintain or improve one’s heart and lung fitness.\n*   Muscle-strengthening activity. This may be referred to as resistance training. These activities maintain or increase muscle strength, endurance, and power.\n*   Flexibility training. This may be referred to as stretching. It lengthens or flexes a skeletal muscle to the point of tension, and holds for several seconds to increase elasticity and range of motion around a joint.\n\n**Measures of Exercise Intensity**\n\nAlthough just moving more and sitting less offers health benefits, how much energy you use while exercising can increase those health benefits further. This is referred to as energy intensity.\n\n*   Borg Scale The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion measures your exercise intensity by rating how you feel.\n*   Target heart rate Calculating your heart rate and target heart rate can be used to measure exercise intensity.\n*   METs MET stands for the metabolic equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy used while sitting quietly.\n\n**Exercise Safety**\n\nSafety should be a major priority when exercising. Any physical activity carries the risk of injury, whether you are just starting an exercise regimen or are a seasoned fitness buff. But don’t let this stop you from moving because the health benefits of being active far outweigh any risks.\n\n*   Common workout injuries include:\n    *   Strained or pulled muscles\n    *   Ankle sprain\n    *   Knee strain\n    *   Inflamed tendons or ligaments\n    *   Rotator cuff (shoulder) injury\n    *   Overuse injuries caused by repetitive movements using mainly one part of the body\n\n**10 Tips to Keep Moving**\n\n1.

A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and the repair of damaged cells.\n*   It provides the extra energy needed to cope with stressful events.\n*   Early research suggests that certain foods like polyunsaturated fats including omega-3 fats and vegetables may help to regulate cortisol levels.\n*   If you frequently rely on fast food because you are tired or too busy to prepare meals at home, consider meal planning, a practice that can help save time in the long run, ensure more balanced healthful meals, and prevent weight gain.\n\n**Mindful Eating**\n\n*   When we “stress-eat,” we eat quickly without noticing what or how much we’re eating, which can lead to weight gain.\n*   Mindful eating practices counteract stress by encouraging deep breaths, making thoughtful food choices, focusing attention on the meal, and chewing food slowly and thoroughly.\n*   This increases enjoyment of the meal and improves digestion.\n\n**Regular Exercise**\n\n*   Physical activity will help to lower blood pressure and stress hormone levels.\n*   Aerobic exercise like walking and dancing increases breathing and heart rate so that more oxygen reaches cells throughout the body.\n*   This reduces tension in muscles, including the heart.\n\n**Meditation or Deep Breathing Techniques**\n\n*   Fast, shallow breathing and erratic thoughts occur in response to stress.\n*   Therefore, take slow deep breaths to reduce muscular tension, lower the heart rate, and calm the mind.\n*   Whenever you feel stressed, breathe slowly, focusing on each in- and out-breath.\n\n**Mental Health Counseling or Other Social Support**\n\n*   Feeling alone can add to stress.\n*   It can help to talk through feelings and concerns with a trusted individual.\n*   Often, just realizing that you are not alone and that your feelings are not unusual can help lower stress.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Sleep", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sleep/", "content": "**Sleep**\n\nSleep is as essential to our daily needs as food and water. Although we may feel that sleep simply rests our tired bodies, our brain remains active throughout the night. Sleep plays a critical role in brain as well as physical functioning.\n\n### What Happens When We Sleep?\n\nOur internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime.\n\n### Phases of Sleep\n\nThere are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles.\n\n*   **Non-REM Sleep**\n    *   Stage 1: You transition from being awake to a restful state.\n    *   Stage 2: You are in a light sleep state. Your breathing, heart rate, and muscle movements slow down. Brain activity also slows, and your body temperature drops.\n    *   Stage 3: You are in a deep sleep state. This stage often occurs early in the sleep cycle immediately following light sleep. Your heart rate and breathing are the slowest during this phase, and you are not easily awakened.\n\n*   **REM Sleep**\n    *   During REM, your pupils twitch and move quickly from side to side underneath closed eyelids.\n    *   Brain activity rises as you breathe faster and your heart rate increases.\n    *   It is the phase of sleep when dreams are most common, and certain nerves signal your limbs to become temporarily paralyzed so you do not act out the dream.\n\n### Hormones that Regulate Sleep Cycles\n\nThere are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness. GABA is a neurotransmitter that decreases nerve cell activity, playing a major role in allowing the body to sleep.\n\n### Immediate Effects of Sleep Deprivation\n\nAbout one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems.\n\n### Sleep Deficiency and Disease Risk\n\nIf you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.\n\n### Medical Conditions that Interfere with Sleep\n\n*   **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)**\n    *   Symptoms of OSA include snoring or gasping for air that causes interruptions in sleep and prevention of good-quality sleep.\n    *   Sleep apnea also causes oxygen levels to drop during sleep, which can pose a stress on the heart, brain, and other organs.\n*   **Restless Leg Syndrome**\n    *   This condition is associated with discomfort in the legs accompanied by an urge to move, which disrupts sleep.\n    *   It is believed that abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine may be responsible, so medications are given to correct this.\n*   **Insomnia**\n    *   This condition is defined as the inability to sleep or stay asleep.\n    *   An individual may have a hard time falling asleep, or may sleep but then awaken in the early morning and be unable to return to sleep.\n\n### What if I work the night shift?\n\nPeople who work overnight shifts, early morning shifts, or rotating shifts (both day shifts and night shifts) may develop something called shift work disorder (SWD). Studies show that those with SWD have poorer sleep quality than day workers. They may take longer to fall asleep, experience insomnia, and feel excessive sleepiness while awake.\n\n### Sleep Deficiency and Eating Behaviors\n\nEpidemiological studies show that insufficient sleep is independently associated with a higher risk of obesity. Clinical studies of sleep-restricted adults show an increased hunger and calorie intake when participants are allowed free access to food.\n\n### How Much Sleep Do We Need?\n\nSleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps.\n\n### What about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep?\n\n*   **Herbal Supplements**\n    *   Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality.\n    *   Valerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep.\n*   **Sleep Medicines**\n    *   Common medicines prescribed for sleep include sedatives such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan).\n    *   They help with falling asleep initially, but tend to reduce the amount of deeper sleep.\n*   **Other Therapies**\n    *   Randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia.\n\n### Sleep Hygiene Tips\n\n1.  Set a sleep schedule and stick to it.\n2.  Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same times, even on weekends.\n3.  Exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training or HIIT) one hour before bedtime.\n4.  Avoid large meals, heavy snacking, or alcohol 2-3 hours before bed.\n5.  Stop using electronic devices an hour before bed, especially those emitting blue light such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Healthy Longevity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-longevity/", "content": "**Healthy Longevity**\n\nRegular exercise lowers the risk of several chronic conditions that increase with age including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and cognitive decline. Exercise also helps to lower anxiety and blood pressure, and improve sleep quality.\n\n*   Healthy diet – The prevalence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and dementia increases with age. Eating patterns such as those from the DASH, MIND, and Mediterranean diets can lower the risk of these and other chronic conditions that accompany older ages.\n*   Regular exercise – Regular physical activity lowers the risk of several chronic conditions that increase with age including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and cognitive decline. Exercise also helps to lower anxiety and blood pressure, and improve sleep quality.\n*   Healthy weight – Determining one’s healthy weight range is unique for each person. Factors to consider include reviewing current health conditions, family history, weight history, and genetically inherited body type.\n*   Not smoking – Smoking is a strong risk factor for cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, and earlier death as it promotes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (a condition that can damage cells and tissues).\n*   Moderate alcohol – Research finds that moderate drinking, defined as 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and early death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nAdditional Factors for Healthy Longevity\n\nBeyond the five core lifestyle habits mentioned above, a growing body of research is identifying additional factors that may be key to increasing our healthspans:\n\n*   Having life purpose meaning. Research shows that having a sense of meaning or purpose in daily life is associated with better sleep, healthier weight, higher physical activity levels, and lower inflammation in some people.\n*   Social connections. Studies of adults 50 years and older show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with a higher risk of disease, disability, and mortality.\n*   Brain stimulation. Stressing the brain or doing activities that entail strenuous mental effort, such as learning a new skill, language, or exercise format during leisure time may reduce the risk of cognitive decline.\n*   Improving sleep quality. Research is still inconclusive, but some reports suggest that insomnia is associated with higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline.\n*   Intermittent fasting. Animal research shows that caloric restriction over a lifetime, such as with intermittent fasting, increases lifespan.\n\nHow sensory changes with aging affect how we eat\n\nWe know that taste is key when enjoying a meal, but what about the smell, texture, appearance, colorfulness, mouthfeel, and even the sound of food (how it crunches in the mouth or sizzles when cooking)? These are the human senses that contribute to the eating experience and influence our food choices.\n\nSpotlight on longevity in Japan\n\nJapanese women and men currently live five to six years longer than Americans, so their practices are of great interest. In Japanese families, elders are highly revered and households are intergenerational. Japanese elders are generally healthier than Western elders, but is this the chicken or the egg? Does better health from good lifestyle habits allow them to stay physically active and involved in society so they remain a valuable asset and reap psychosocial benefits, or is it the culture that reveres elders so they have better mental health, less loneliness, and better healthcare so that they stay healthier longer?\n\nJapan has also largely avoided the epidemic of obesity that the U.S. is experiencing; for example, the prevalence of obesity among U.S. women is about 37% but among Japanese women is less than 5%. This difference is certainly an important contributor to differences in life expectancy, but raises questions about how the Japanese have been able to control their weight.\n\nIn recent years, diets in Japan have become more similar to those in the U.S. but they still eat smaller portions, more fermented foods, less sweets, and less red meat.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIdentifying additional factors that improve and extend our healthspans is an active area of scientific inquiry. In the meantime, current research findings are encouraging, and underscore the importance of following healthy lifestyle habits throughout one’s life course. That said, sticking to these behaviors is easier said than done, and public policies must support and promote these habits by improving the food and physical environments that surround us.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Disease Prevention", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/", "content": "**Disease Prevention**\n\n*   Chronic diseases —including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer— account for some of the most common health problems in the United States, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n*   Yet many of these chronic diseases are preventable, as they’re linked to poor diet and lifestyle choices including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity.\n*   The CDC reports some sobering statistics about Americans:\n    *   Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability.\n    *   70% of annual deaths are due to chronic diseases.\n    *   These preventable conditions not only compromise quality of life, they add to rising health care costs—75% of our health care dollars are devoted to treat these diseases.\n*   Among adults ages 20 to 74, diabetes remains the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations.\n*   The good news is that you have the power to help prevent chronic disease, as making positive diet and lifestyle changes can help reduce risk.\n*   Eating healthy foods, getting enough exercise, and refraining from tobacco and excessive alcohol use confer numerous health benefits—including possibly preventing the onset of chronic diseases.", "category": "general"},{"title": "Preventing Obesity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/", "content": "**Preventing Obesity**\n\nEat well\nNutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and a healthy eating pattern is crucial to good health.

Body mass index (BMI) is one of the most widely used screening tools for estimating excess body fat.\n\n**Health Impacts**\n\nThere are negative health impacts associated with excess body fat. The WHO estimates that in 2019, 5 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes were caused by a high BMI, and rates of obesity continue to grow globally in children and adults.\n\n* Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults and the associated risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.\n* With the five leading causes of death – heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, and unintentional injuries – obesity is a major risk factor for the first four.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nObesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion annually. This includes money spent directly on medical care and prescription drugs related to obesity.\n\n* In the workplace, research has shown that the number of sick days, short-term disability, and workers’ compensation days increase with increasing BMI.\n* Compared with an employee with a BMI of 25, an employee with a BMI of 35 has nearly double the risk of a disability or workers’ compensation claim.\n\n**Trends**\n\nAccording to the WHO, worldwide obesity rates are rising with 1 in 8 people, or more than 1 billion people, around the world living with obesity. A Lancet review showed that global adult obesity doubled from 1990 to 2022, and adolescent obesity quadrupled.\n\n* Specific regions including Polynesia, Micronesia, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and north Africa showed the greatest increases in obesity, as well as higher-income countries such as Chile.\n* Increased eating out of home, access to ultra-processed low-nutrient-dense foods, and sedentariness (e.g., sitting at work, driving instead of walking or bicycling) have contributed.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nVarious factors can influence body weight or greater weight gain in specific areas of the body. Some of these cannot be changed, but others may be modified:\n\n* Non-modifiable risk factors: age, gender, genes, ethnic origin, and sometimes medications that change how energy is processed in the body leading to weight gain.\n* Modifiable risk factors: food and beverages consumed, level of physical activity, daily screen time (increased screen time is associated with reduced physical activity time and also increases exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods beverages), poor sleep hygiene, uncontrolled negative stress.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nObesity is complex and not just about being born with a certain body size, taking in more calories than the body needs, or burning extra calories through exercise to lose weight.

However, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals.\n\n**Applying Precision Nutrition to Disease Management**\n\nThere are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: a gluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU).\n\n**Precision Nutrition Examines How a Person’s DNA May Be Associated with Their Response to Food**\n\nOne example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup? Coffee beans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations**\n\nThe field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges—a lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual’s DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease.\n\n**Related Precision Nutrition and Type 2 Diabetes Management: Is It Ready for Prime Time**\n\nPrecision nutrition would see if there is an association between a person’s metabolic “signature” created by dietary patterns and their risk of developing T2DM. The metabolic testing used with precision nutrition might help to determine how a person’s body would respond to a specific diet.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Oral Health", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/", "content": "**Oral Health**\n\nThe health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.\n\n### What Is a Healthy Mouth?\n\nA healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free.\n\n### Oral Health and Nutrition: What You Eat and Drink Affects Your Teeth\n\nJust like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. A balanced diet with adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being.\n\n*   Minerals like calcium and phosphorus contribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel.\n*   Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such as cheese, milk, plain yogurt, calcium-fortified tofu, leafy greens, and almonds may help tooth health.\n*   Fruits and vegetables are also good choices since they are high in water and fiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth.\n\n### How snacking can affect your dental health\n\nWhat you eat and how often you eat can affect your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth and, unless removed daily, this plaque builds up.\n\n*   Excess intake of added sugars leads not only to tooth decay but is also associated with other health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.\n*   Learning about where sugar may be hiding and how to identify these added sugars can help you win this game of hide and seek.\n\n### Nutrition and oral health\n\nNutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and or nutrients.\n\n*   Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition.\n*   Lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing.\n\n### Oral Health and General Health\n\nWhile it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health.\n\n*   Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions.\n*   Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and respiratory diseases.\n\n### Certain conditions that impact oral health\n\nCertain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:\n\n*   Anxiety and stress. Stress is a normal human reaction that everyone experiences at one point or another. However, stress that is left unchecked can contribute to many health problems including oral health issues.\n*   Osteoporosis and Paget’s Disease.\n\n### Bottom Line – There Is No Health Without Oral Health\n\nAs growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn’t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Nutrition and Immunity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition-and-immunity/", "content": "**Nutrition and Immunity**\n\n**What Is Our Immune System?**\n\nOur immune system is a network of intricate stages and pathways in the body that protects us against harmful microbes and diseases. It recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites and takes immediate action. Humans possess two types of immunity: innate and adaptive.\n\n*   Innate immunity is a first-line defense from pathogens that try to enter our bodies.\n*   Adaptive or acquired immunity is a system that learns to recognize a pathogen.\n\n**Factors That Can Depress Our Immune System**\n\n1.  Older age\n2.  Environmental toxins (smoke and other particles contributing to air pollution, excessive alcohol)\n3.  Excess weight\n4.  Poor diet\n5.  Chronic diseases\n6.  Chronic mental stress\n7.  Lack of sleep and rest\n\n**Does an Immune-Boosting Diet Exist?**\n\nEating enough nutrients as part of a varied diet is required for the health and function of all cells, including immune cells. Certain dietary patterns may better prepare the body for microbial attacks and excess inflammation.\n\n*   Examples of nutrients that have been identified as critical for the growth and function of immune cells include:\n    *   Vitamin C\n    *   Vitamin D\n    *   Zinc\n    *   Selenium\n    *   Iron\n    *   Protein (including the amino acid glutamine)\n\n**The Microbiome**\n\nThe microbiome is an internal metropolis of trillions of microorganisms or microbes that live in our bodies, mostly in the intestines. It plays a key role in immune function.\n\n*   A high-fiber plant-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes appears to support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microbes.\n*   Certain helpful microbes break down fibers into short chain fatty acids, which have been shown to stimulate immune cell activity.\n\n**Chicken Soup as Medicine?**\n\nA warm bowl of chicken soup is a popular go-to when we’re feeling under the weather. While there isn’t any clinical evidence that it aids in healing, its ingredients do provide various nutrients involved in the immune system:\n\n*   Protein and zinc from the chicken\n*   Vitamin A from carrots\n*   Vitamin C from celery and onions\n*   Antioxidants in the onions and herbs\n\n**Vitamin or Herbal Supplements**\n\nA deficiency of single nutrients can alter the body’s immune response. Animal studies have found that deficiencies in zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E can alter immune responses.\n\n*   Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the immune system.\n*   Certain herbal supplements like echinacea, garlic, and tea catechins have been suggested to boost immune function. However, more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness.\n\n**8 Steps to Help Support a Healthy Immune System**\n\n1.  Eat a balanced diet with whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of water.\n2.  Don’t smoke (or stop smoking if you do).\n3.  Drink alcohol in moderation.\n4.  Perform moderate regular exercise.\n5.  Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly.\n6.  Try to keep a sleep schedule.\n7.  Aim to manage stress.\n8.

Beans in their various forms (kidney, black, pinto, navy, chickpeas, etc.) are just one type of pulse.\n\nLegumes are emphasized by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines (about 3 cups a week) and the DASH Eating Plan of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (4-5 half-cup servings a week). [2] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations declared the International Year of Pulses in 2016, focusing on the contribution of pulses in food production and nutritional diversity to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition. [3]\n\n**Source Of Protein**\n\n*   Folate\n*   Fiber (both insoluble and soluble)\n*   Iron\n*   Phosphorus\n*   Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids including linoleic and oleic acids\n\n**Legumes and Health**\n\nLegumes contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases:\n\n*   Cardiovascular disease\n*   Cancer\n*   Digestive health\n*   Diabetes\n*   Obesity\n\nWhat about products made from legumes? Because of their texture, flavor, and nutritional profile, legumes are found in numerous products throughout the supermarket. While these can include classic options such as tofu, peanut butter, and hummus, legumes and their components are also a key ingredient in a wide range of plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nBecause this product mix relies on varying degrees of processing, consumers should be on the lookout for added sodium, sugar, saturated fat from tropical oils, or other additives. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a processed food in the diet.\n\n**For Your Health and The Planet’s Health**\n\nFood production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination. However, along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also have differing impacts on the environment.\n\nGenerally, the production of plant-based foods tends to have lower greenhouse gas emissions, and use less land and water than producing animal-based foods. In transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems—especially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050—legumes are slated to play a key role.\n\nThe 2019 EAT-Lancet report that outlines a “planetary health diet” recommends 50 grams of legumes (about ¼ cup) in the daily diet. [14] Legumes have a range of characteristics that make them a relatively sustainable crop.\n\nFor example, legumes release up to seven times less greenhouse gas emissions per area compared to other crops, and can sequester carbon in soils. They can also make their own nitrogen from the atmosphere, thus reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers. This leaves nitrogen-rich residues in the soil after harvesting; a benefit for the next crop planted in its place. [1]\n\nAccording to the FAO, drought-resistant species of legumes can be of particular benefit to dry environments where food security is often a challenge. They can also help minimize food waste, since pulses can be dried and stored for relatively long periods of time without losing their nutritional value. [15]\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nDespite their wide variety, legumes share many common benefits. They are relatively sustainable and inexpensive, a low glycemic index food, rich in protein and fiber, and satiating.\n\nBecause of their “meaty” texture, legumes can even stand in for animal-based protein foods in a variety of preparations. Additionally, their generally neutral flavor makes them versatile to blend well with other ingredients and pair easily with a variety of seasonings.\n\nLearn more about some specific legumes, including a variety of ways to incorporate them into your meals:\n\n*   **Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans)**\n*   **Lentils**\n*   **Soy**", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Nuts for the Heart", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nuts-for-the-heart/", "content": "**Nuts for the Heart**\n\nMany people think of nuts as just another junk food snack.

But for many people, low-fat diets don’t work. In fact, dozens of studies have found that low-fat diets are no better for health than moderate-or high-fat diets—and for many people, they may be worse.\n\n**Are “fat free” foods healthy?**\n\nAmy Myrdal Miller: Some foods in their natural state contain little or no fat—for example, most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dried beans. And of course these are healthy choices. But processed foods billed as “low fat” and “fat free” are often higher in salt, sugar, or starch than their full-fat counterparts, to make up for the flavor and texture that’s lost when food manufacturers slash fat.\n\n**Will eating fat make me get fat?**\n\nWillett: No, it’s a myth that eating specifically high-fat foods makes you fat. Eating or drinking more calories than you need from any source, whether it’s fat, carbohydrate, protein, or alcohol can lead to weight gain.\n\n**Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet?**\n\nWillett: It’s possible to lose weight on any diet. But carefully-conducted clinical trials find that following a low-fat diet doesn’t make it any easier to lose weight or keep it off.\n\n**Are all kinds of fat equally healthy?**\n\nWillett: Some types of fats are healthier than others. Unsaturated fat is the healthiest type of fat. Plant oils, such as olive, canola, corn, peanut and other nut oils; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pistachios; avocados; and fish, especially oily fish such as salmon and canned tuna, are excellent sources of unsaturated fat.\n\n**How can I cut back on trans fats?**\n\nWillett: Many food manufacturers are already removing trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthy fats. Similarly, many restaurants are removing trans fat from their menu items, so this is a big help. But you still need to pay attention to nutrition labels, to make sure that the food you buy does not contain any trans fats.\n\n**Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy?**\n\nWillett: Coconut oil and palm oil are higher in saturated fat than other plant oils. They are less harmful than partially hydrogenated oil, which is high in trans fats. But they are less beneficial for the heart than plant oils that are rich in unsaturated fats — olive, canola, sunflower, and other oils.\n\n**Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods?**\n\nWillett: It’s okay to eat fried foods, as long they are prepared with frying oil that doesn’t have any trans fats. It’s also important to look at the types of foods being fried.\n\n**Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat?**\n\nWillett: No. When you cook or read nutrition labels, don’t fixate on fat percentages. As long as you use healthy fats, and your keep your portion sizes modest, it doesn’t matter if your dish or meal has 30 percent, 40 percent, or more of its calories from fat.\n\n**What’s better than a low-fat diet?**\n\nWillett: Try following a healthy fat, healthy carb diet, using two nutrition tools from Harvard School of Public Health as your guide: The Healthy Eating Plate and the Healthy Eating Pyramid.\n\n**Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats?**\n\nMyrdal Miller: Here’s a few ideas for how to use healthy fats in your kitchen:\n\n* Cook with healthy oils. Olive, canola, soy, peanut, sunflower, corn, and other oils from plants are the best choices, since they are high in healthy unsaturated fat.\n* Bake with healthy oils. You can replace the butter in many baked goods with vegetable oils.\n* Serve healthy fats at the table.

The debate still simmers today, with a lively back-and-forth over whether alcohol is good for you or bad for you.\n\n**What’s Moderate Alcohol Intake? What’s a Drink?**\nLoose use of the terms “moderate” and “a drink” has fueled some of the ongoing debate about alcohol’s impact on health. In some studies, the term “moderate drinking” refers to less than 1 drink per day, while in others it means 3-4 drinks per day.\n\n**The Downside of Alcohol**\nHeavy drinking can take a toll on the body. It can cause inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis) and lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), a potentially fatal disease. It can increase blood pressure and damage heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). Heavy alcohol use has also been linked with several cancers: The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research indicate that there is convincing evidence linking alcohol to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast, liver, colon, and rectum.\n\n**Possible Health Benefits of Alcohol**\nMore than 100 prospective studies show an inverse association between light to moderate drinking and risk of heart attack, ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, peripheral vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, and death from all cardiovascular causes. The effect is fairly consistent, corresponding to a 25-40% reduction in risk.\n\n**Genes Play a Role**\nTwin, family, and adoption studies have firmly established that genetics plays an important role in determining an individual’s preferences for alcohol and his or her likelihood for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Shifting Benefits and Risks**\nThe benefits and risks of moderate drinking change over a lifetime.

It encourages them to limit red meat and avoid processed meat, since eating even small quantities of these foods on a regular basis raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and weight gain.\n\n*Read more about the benefits of choosing healthy protein.*\n\nMyPlate’s protein section could be filled by a variety of sources, including a hamburger or hot dog. Though the plate has been revised to suggest that adult consumers eat at least 8 ounces of cooked seafood per week, it still offers no indication that red and processed meat are especially harmful to health.\n\n**Vegetables**\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate encourages an abundant variety of vegetables, since Americans are particularly deficient in their vegetable consumption—except for potatoes and French fries. Potatoes are chock full of rapidly digested starch, and they have the same effect on blood sugar as refined grains and sweets, so limited consumption is recommended.\n\n*Read more about the benefits of vegetables.*\n\nMyPlate does not distinguish between potatoes and other vegetables.\n\n**Fruits**\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate recommends eating a colorful variety of fruits. *Read more about the benefits of fruits.*\n\nMyPlate also recommends eating fruits.\n\n**Healthy Oils (Not included in MyPlate)**\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate depicts a bottle of healthy oil, and it encourages consumers to use olive, canola, and other plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table.

It advises consumers to avoid sugary drinks, since these are major contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics.\n\nIt recommends limiting milk and dairy to one to two servings per day, since high intakes are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and possibly ovarian cancer; it recommends limiting juice, even 100% fruit juice, to just a small glass a day, because juice contains as much sugar and as many calories as sugary soda.\n\n*Read more about water and other healthy drinks, and learn about calcium, milk and health.*\n\nMyPlate recommends dairy at every meal, even though there is little if any evidence that high dairy intakes protect against osteoporosis, and there is considerable evidence that too-high intakes can be harmful.

However, potatoes don’t count as a vegetable on Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate because they are high in the type of carbohydrate that the body digests rapidly, causing blood sugar and insulin to surge and then dip (in scientific terms, they have a high glycemic load). For example, a cup of potatoes has a similar effect on blood sugar as a can of cola or a handful of jelly beans.\n\nThe roller-coaster-like effect of a high dietary glycemic load can result in people feeling hungry again soon after eating, which may then lead to overeating. Over the long term, diets high in potatoes and similarly rapidly-digested, high carbohydrate foods can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\n\nPotatoes seem to be a particular culprit for weight gain and diabetes: A 2011 study by Mozaffarian et al. that tracked the diet and lifestyle habits of 120,000 men and women for up to 20 years looked at how small food-choice changes contributed to weight gain over time. People who increased their consumption of French fries and baked or mashed potatoes gained more weight over time—an extra 3.4 and 1.3 pounds every four years, respectively.\n\nPeople who decreased their intake of these foods gained less weight, as did people who increased their intake of other vegetables. A similar long-term study found that high potato and French fry intakes were linked to a greater risk of diabetes in women, and that replacing potatoes with whole grains could lower diabetes risk.\n\nPotatoes do contain important nutrients—vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin B6, to name a few. But the potato is not the only source of these nutrients, nor is it the best: Broccoli, for example, has nearly nine times as much vitamin C as a potato. White beans have about double the potassium.\n\nWhat to eat instead of potatoes? Whole grains are an excellent choice, especially minimally processed grains such as brown rice and quinoa. Beans can also stand in as a “starchy” side dish; they are high in fiber and protein, and cause less of a spike in blood sugar than processed grains. If you’re looking for that mashed-potato texture, try this recipe that uses cauliflower instead.\n\nIf you want to swap sweet potatoes for white potatoes, you’ll still need to go easy on the portions: Though sweet potatoes are a rich source of beta carotene, they have a high glycemic index and glycemic load—almost as high as that of a white potato. Most people don’t eat sweet potatoes in the same over-sized quantities as they do white potatoes, which is perhaps why research studies haven’t found sweet potatoes to be a major culprit for obesity and diabetes.", "category": "general"},{"title": "Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/", "content": "**Title**\nDiet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet\n\n**Overview**\n\nAn anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that “inflammation” is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by our immune system.\n\n*   Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state.\n*   Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body’s immune system to constantly attack cells.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAn anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes.

It is the sole treatment for 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, a serious condition where the body attacks a protein called gluten, naturally found in many whole grains, causing a spectrum of symptoms that range from bloating to intestinal damage.\n\nUp to 6% of people have a related stomach-upsetting but less threatening condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity. With such a small number truly needing this diet, why have sales of gluten-free products topped $12 billion according to market research?\n\nWhat is new—and driving these sales upward—is the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss, partly fueled by celebrity endorsements and personal testimonies of not only pounds quickly shed, but increased energy, improved digestion, and even clearer skin.\n\nConsumer surveys reveal that people perceive gluten-free products to be healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts, and almost a third of Americans are now avoiding or reducing their intake of gluten.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nA gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. Gluten is largely ubiquitous in foods, found as a main ingredient (in wheat, rye, barley, triticale, cross-contaminated oats), in sauces (soy sauce, malt vinegar, flour), and as additives or fillers (maltodextrin, wheat starch).\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\n\nGluten-free foods wear a health halo, a belief that a food product is healthful even when it may not offer special health benefits for most people. Research has shown that if one aspect of a food is advertised as healthy or people believe it to be healthy (in this case, the term “gluten-free”), there is a tendency to eat more of it.\n\nThis may promote weight gain. Also, an overreliance on processed gluten-free products may lead to a decreased intake of certain nutrients like fiber and B vitamins that are protective against chronic diseases.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nAlthough a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease and may help to alleviate symptoms in various conditions related to gluten sensitivity, there is currently no evidence showing that a gluten-free diet is effective for weight loss or for general health benefits. For individuals who don’t have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no need to restrict gluten consumption.\n\nA healthy dietary pattern typically includes higher amounts of whole grains and lower amounts of refined grains and added sugar.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Diet Review: DASH", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/dash-diet/", "content": "**Diet Review: DASH**\n\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure. Blood pressure is the amount of pressure that blood places against the walls of arteries. It will normally vary throughout the day but if it remains too high, this is called high blood pressure or hypertension.\n\n**What Is DASH?**\n\nThe DASH trial randomly assigned 456 people to different diets to test the effects of dietary patterns on lowering blood pressure. The authors surmised that eating a diet with many different foods with blood pressure-lowering nutrients would show a greater effect on blood pressure than eating single nutrients, such as found in supplements or in a limited diet.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nDASH is based on the following foods: fruits, vegetables, low fat milk, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, and nuts. It recommends reducing sodium, foods and beverages with added sugars, and red meat. The diet is heart-friendly as it limits saturated and trans fat, while increasing the intake of potassium, magnesium, calcium, protein, and fiber, nutrients believed to help control blood pressure.\n\n**Sample Meal Plan**\n\nThe NHLBI guide provides many tips on how to incorporate DASH foods and to lower sodium intake; a one-day sample menu following a 2300 mg sodium restriction and a 1500 mg sodium restriction; and one week’s worth of recipes. The NHLBI also publishes an online database of “heart healthy” recipes.\n\n**The Research So Far**\n\nNumerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of the DASH diet. A consistent body of research has found that DASH lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure but also normal blood pressure even without lowering sodium intake.\n\n*   **Lower Blood Pressure**: The DASH diet was found to lower cardiovascular risk in a controlled 8-week trial looking at participants randomized to consume either a DASH diet (low in total saturated fat with whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, fruits and vegetables), a fruit and vegetable-rich diet (more fruits vegetables than control diet but same amount of fat), or control diet (standard American diet high in fat and cholesterol).\n*   **Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases**: The researchers estimated a 10-year reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease based on the participants’ blood pressure and cholesterol levels before and after the diet intervention.\n*   **Reduce Risk of Diabetes and Kidney Disease**: Adherence to the DASH-style pattern may also help prevent the development of diabetes, as analyzed in a recent meta-analysis, and kidney disease as found in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort that followed more than 3700 people who developed kidney disease.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\n\nDASH requires each person to plan their own daily menus based on the allowed servings.

It is promoted to change body composition through loss of fat mass and weight, and to improve markers of health that are associated with disease such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\n**How It Works**\nThe most common methods are fasting on alternate days, for whole days with a specific frequency per week, or during a set time frame. Alternate-day fasting—Alternating between days of no food restriction with days that consist of one meal that provides about 25% of daily calorie needs. Whole-day fasting—1-2 days per week of complete fasting or up to 25% of daily calorie needs, with no food restriction on the other days.\n\n**The Research So Far**\nPhysiologically, calorie restriction has been shown in animals to increase lifespan and improve tolerance to various metabolic stresses in the body. Although the evidence for caloric restriction in animal studies is strong, there is less convincing evidence in human studies. Proponents of the diet believe that the stress of intermittent fasting causes an immune response that repairs cells and produces positive metabolic changes (reduction in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, fat mass, blood glucose).\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\nThis type of dietary pattern would be difficult for someone who eats every few hours (e.g., snacks between meals, grazes).

The contents of this website are for educational purposes only.\n\n**What Is It?**\nIntuitive eating (IE) is not so much a diet plan as an approach to eating based on one’s internal needs, whether physical, emotional, or other influencers. When these needs are recognized, they may determine one’s food choices.\n\n**How It Works**\nIE is the antithesis of restrained eating that demands rigid control. Many commercial diets follow a restrained eating model, with meal plans that include specific foods and or measured portions. In contrast, IE focuses on body cues such as hunger and fullness, which may be physical hunger and fullness from an empty or filled stomach, or cues caused by emotional or external triggers.\n\n**Signs of Physical Hunger**\n\n* Fatigue\n* Lightheadedness\n* Irritability\n* Headache\n* Stomach is grumbling\n* Hunger gradually intensifies\n* No specific cravings; any type of food will satisfy\n\n**Signs of Emotional Hunger**\n\n* Stomach is quiet\n* Desire for food occurs suddenly (e.g., because of an emotion such as anger or stress, or from external cues such as viewing a television commercial or other food advertising)\n* Cravings are for a specific food or flavor, whether salty, sweet, crunchy, creamy, etc.\n* Guilt is associated with eating\n\n**Examples of Intuitive Eating Strategies**\n\n* Acknowledge hunger. Recognize physical hunger cues and respond to them.\n* Recognize and respond to fullness. As you identify true hunger, you will also learn to identify a comfortable degree of fullness after eating, and respond by stopping eating.\n* Don’t fear negative feelings. Accept that negative emotions like stress, anger, and boredom will come and go. Learn to cope with these feelings without using food: talk to a friend, go for a walk, take a shower, pray, or meditate.\n* Honor and respect your body regardless of size and ability.\n\n**How is Intuitive Eating Different from Mindful Eating?**\nOften used interchangeably, many intuitive eating and mindful eating concepts overlap but there are some key differences.

In the 19th century, the ketogenic diet was commonly used to help control diabetes. In 1920 it was introduced as an effective treatment for epilepsy in children in whom medication was ineffective.\n\n**How It Works**\nThe premise of the ketogenic diet for weight loss is that if you deprive the body of glucose—the main source of energy for all cells in the body, which is obtained by eating carbohydrate foods—an alternative fuel called ketones is produced from stored fat (thus, the term “keto”-genic).\n\n**The Diet**\nThere is not one “standard” ketogenic diet with a specific ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat). The ketogenic diet typically reduces total carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day—less than the amount found in a medium plain bagel—and can be as low as 20 grams a day.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\nFollowing a very high-fat diet may be challenging to maintain. Possible symptoms of extreme carbohydrate restriction that may last days to weeks include hunger, fatigue, low mood, irritability, constipation, headaches, and brain “fog.”\n\n**Bottom Line**\nAvailable research on the ketogenic diet for weight loss is still limited.

Mindfulness is an intentional focus on one’s thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the present moment. Mindfulness targets becoming more aware of, rather than reacting to, one’s situation and choices.\n\n**How It Works**\nMindful eating focuses on your eating experiences, body-related sensations, and thoughts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment. Attention is paid to the foods being chosen, internal and external physical cues, and your responses to those cues.\n\nSeven practices of mindful eating:\n\n* Honor the food. Acknowledge where the food was grown and who prepared the meal.\n* Eat without distractions to help deepen the eating experience.\n* Engage all senses. Notice the sounds, colors, smells, tastes, and textures of the food and how you feel when eating.\n* Pause periodically to engage these senses.\n* Serve in modest portions. This can help avoid overeating and food waste.\n* Use a dinner plate no larger than 9 inches across and fill it only once.\n* Savor small bites, and chew thoroughly.\n\n**The Research So Far**\nThe opposite of mindful eating, sometimes referred to as mindless or distracted eating, is associated with anxiety, overeating, and weight gain. Examples of mindless eating are eating while driving, while working, or viewing a television or other screen (phone, tablet).\n\nInterest in mindful eating has grown as a strategy to eat with less distractions and to improve eating behaviors. Intervention studies have shown that mindfulness approaches can be an effective tool in the treatment of unfavorable behaviors such as emotional eating and binge eating that can lead to weight gain and obesity.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\nMindful eating is not intended to replace traditional treatments for severe clinical conditions such as eating disorders. Neurochemical imbalances are a risk factor for developing eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, and although mindfulness may be an effective component of a treatment plan, it should not be used as a sole treatment.\n\n**Bottom Line**\nMindful eating is an approach to eating that can complement any eating pattern. Research has shown that mindful eating can lead to greater psychological wellbeing, increased pleasure when eating, and body satisfaction. Combining behavioral strategies such as mindfulness training with nutrition knowledge can lead to healthful food choices that reduce the risk of chronic diseases, promote more enjoyable meal experiences, and support a healthy body image.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Kale", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/kale/", "content": "**Kale**\n\nKale has early roots in Greek and Roman culture, but it remained a relatively minor commercial crop in the U.S. until recent years.

However, there's no scientifically based definition for superfood, but generally, a food is promoted to superfood status when it offers high levels of desirable nutrients, is linked to the prevention of a disease, or is believed to offer several simultaneous health benefits beyond its nutritional value.\n\nThe term \"superfood\" originated from a marketing strategy in the early 20th century. The United Fruit Company initiated an enthusiastic advertising campaign to promote bananas as a superfood due to their high nutritional value and ease of digestion. Bananas were initially marketed as a practical food, but later became associated with health benefits such as treating conditions like celiac disease and diabetes.\n\nToday, new superfoods seem to appear on a monthly basis, driven by scientific research, catchy headlines from the popular press, and marketing campaigns from involved food industries. Superfoods often translate into super sales that have created a billion-dollar industry. Consumers are willing to pay more for foods perceived as healthy, and health claims on labels seem to help.\n\nSome examples of sensationalized superfoods include:\n\n* Açai\n* Almond\n* Avocado\n* Broccoli\n* Cacao\n* Chia seeds\n* Eggs\n* Garlic\n* Goji\n* Green tea\n* Kale\n* Kefir\n* Mangosteen\n* Pomegranate\n* Salmon\n* Seaweed\n* Wheatgrass\n\nThe bottom line is that while superfoods can be nutritious, the term is more useful for driving sales than it is for providing optimal nutrition recommendations.

So what changed? While it’s true that just one large egg yolk has 200 mg of cholesterol—making it one of the richest sources of dietary cholesterol—eggs also contain additional nutrients that may help lower the risk for heart disease.\n\nIn addition, the moderate amount of fat in an egg, about 5 grams, is mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. It’s also crucial to distinguish between dietary cholesterol and cholesterol in the blood, which are only weakly related. The focus on dietary cholesterol alone was de-emphasized as more attention was placed on the influence of saturated and trans fat on blood cholesterol.\n\nAccordingly, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 removed the prior recommendation to limit consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day.\n\nGiven their history, “are eggs healthy?” has become a frequently asked nutrition question. To answer this, it’s important to look at eggs not only on their own, but in context of the entire diet, especially when compared to foods they may replace (and vice-versa).\n\n**Source Of Cholesterol**\n\n* Protein\n* Choline\n* Biotin – Vitamin B7\n* Vitamin A\n* Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin\n\nEggs and Health\n\nResearch on moderate egg consumption in two large prospective cohort studies (nearly 40,000 men and over 80,000 women) found that up to one egg per day is not associated with increased heart disease risk in healthy individuals.\n\nEggs were previously associated with heart disease risk as a result of their high cholesterol content. However, a solid body of research shows that for most people, cholesterol in food has a smaller effect on blood levels of total cholesterol and harmful LDL cholesterol than does the mix of fats in the diet.\n\nOf course, this research doesn’t give a green light to daily three-egg omelets. While a 2008 report from the Physicians’ Health Study supports the idea that eating an egg a day is generally safe for the heart, it also suggests that going much beyond that could increase the risk for heart failure later in life.\n\nYou also need to pay attention to the “trimmings” that come with your eggs. To your cardiovascular system, scrambled eggs, salsa, and a 100% whole-wheat English muffin is a far different meal than scrambled eggs with cheese, sausages, home fries, and white toast.\n\nPeople who have difficulty controlling their total and LDL cholesterol may also want to be cautious about eating egg yolks and instead choose foods made with egg whites. The same is true for people with diabetes.\n\nIn studies including the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, heart disease risk was increased among men and women with diabetes who ate one or more eggs a day. For people who have diabetes and heart disease, it may be best to limit egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week.\n\nFurthermore, to truly assess eggs and heart health, we need to examine how they stack-up to foods we might choose in their place—the classic nutrition substitution analysis.\n\nUsing some common breakfast options as an example:\n\nWhile eggs may be a much better choice than sugary, refined grain-based options like sweetened breakfast cereals, pancakes with syrup, muffins, or bagels, they may fall short of other options. A bowl of steel-cut oats with nuts and berries, for example, will be a much better choice for heart health than an egg-centric breakfast.\n\nConsumption of whole grains and fruit predict lower risk of heart disease, and when it comes to protein, plant sources like nuts and seeds are related to lower cardiovascular and overall mortality, especially when compared to red meat or eggs.\n\nThe bottom line: While eggs may not be the optimal breakfast choice, they are certainly not the worst, falling somewhere in the middle on the spectrum of food choice and heart disease risk. For those looking to eat a healthy diet, keeping intake of eggs moderate to low will be best for most, emphasizing plant-based protein options when possible.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Seaweed", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/seaweed/", "content": "**Seaweed**", "category": "drug&supplement"},{"title": "Sweet Potatoes", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sweet-potatoes/", "content": "**Sweet Potatoes**\n\n*   **Source Of Vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene**\n    *   Vitamin B6\n    *   Vitamin C\n    *   Potassium\n    *   Fiber\n\n**Sweet potatoes with orange flesh are richest in beta-carotene.

They are more perishable than you might think, so it is best to use them within a week of purchase. Before cooking, scrub the skins well as these are edible and nutritious. Pierce the potato with a fork 4-5 times, which allows steam to escape. If cooking in an oven, place on a lined baking sheet in a preheated oven to 400 F. Bake for 45-60 minutes or until flesh is tender. Allow potatoes to cool a few minutes before slicing. If microwaving, place on a microwave-safe dish and heat on high 8-10 minutes. Turn potatoes bottom side up halfway through cooking to ensure even heating. Allow potatoes to cool a few minutes before slicing. If boiling on the stove, peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Rinse well in a colander. Transfer potatoes to a pot and add water until cubes are completely covered.

Butternut squash, for example, has almost half the amount of carbohydrate of a sweet potato. Squash also contains polysaccharides, a type of indigestible fiber that can prevent blood sugar from rising after eating, as shown in animal studies.\n\n Cancer: Certain compounds in squash like beta-carotene and lutein are classified as flavonoids that may help to protect human cells from the damaging effects of oxygen. Flavonoids have been researched extensively for their possible role in affecting or inhibiting cancer cell growth.\n\n Heart health: Winter squash is rich in potassium (about 500 mg in 1 cup of cooked butternut or acorn squash), which can help to counteract the deleterious effects of sodium on blood pressure. Decreased cholesterol was observed when giving pumpkin polysaccharides to healthy and diabetic mice.\n\n Select Choose squash that has a firm exterior and no soft spots, or cracks. Unlike some fruits that develop a softer exterior as they ripen, the rind of winter squashes becomes even firmer as they mature.\n\n Prepare If you are new to cooking squash and feel the thick surface, you might wonder “How do I get into it?” The hard rinds of winter squash allow them to be stored for up to several months, but they also present a challenge when attempting to safely slice with a knife. Rinse winter squash under cold running water before cutting.\n\n Make Squash is versatile and retains its flavor whether roasting, boiling, steaming, microwaving, or simmering in a stew. Dry heat as with roasting helps to caramelize the natural sugars in the squash. The dense textures of all squash types will add heartiness with whatever cooking method is used.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Workout Supplements", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/workout-supplements/", "content": "**Pre-Workout Supplements**", "category": "drug&supplement"},{"title": "How Meat Is Cooked May Affect Risk of Type 2 Diabetes", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2018/03/23/how-meat-is-cooked-may-affect-risk-of-type-2-diabetes/", "content": "**How Meat Is Cooked May Affect Risk of Type 2 Diabetes**\n\nYou may have heard that grilling and barbecuing meats may create cancer-causing substances. You may have also heard that eating a lot of red meat—especially processed meats—may be linked to certain cancers. Now, new research suggests a possible connection between high-heat meat cooking and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe study, published in Diabetes Care by researchers from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health’s Department of Nutrition, found that frequent use of high-heat cooking methods (such as broiling, barbecuing grilling, and roasting) to prepare beef and chicken increased the risk of type 2 diabetes. [1] Based on data from three large cohorts followed for 12 to 16 years—including more than 289,000 men and women from the Nurses’ Health Studies and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study—researchers found that participants who most frequently ate meats and chicken cooked at high temperatures were 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those who ate the least.\n\nThere was also an increased risk of weight gain and developing obesity in the frequent users of high-temperature cooking methods, which may have contributed to the development of diabetes. Of note, this research demonstrated that cooking methods might contribute to diabetes risk beyond the effects of meat consumption alone.\n\nOther key highlights from the study:\n\n* Participants who ate red meat and chicken that were cooked to a well-done or charred level showed a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those who ate meat and chicken that were lightly browned.\n* There was no association found between broiling fish and type 2 diabetes risk, although the authors noted that there were fewer data available overall on cooking methods for fish intake, so the smaller number of people may have made it difficult to see an association.\n* Information was also not available on cooking methods of other meats like lamb and pork.\n\nAccording to the authors, the exact mechanisms contributing to the increased risk are not known, but they cite the potential role of harmful chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and nitrosamines (from nitrates and nitrites added to meats as a preservative) formed during high-heat cooking. These chemicals may spur an inflammatory response, interfere with the normal production of insulin, or promote insulin resistance in which the body cannot use insulin properly to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nIt has been established that a high intake of red and especially processed meats can increase the risk of conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, certain cancers, and early death. Possible reasons include the presence of heme iron, a type of iron found in all animal foods, and the processing of meats (e.g., curing, smoking), both of which may promote the formation of cancer-causing compounds during high-heat cooking methods.\n\nThis study found that certain cooking methods—regardless of how much meat was eaten—increased disease risk; and chicken as well as red meat cooked at high temperatures increased risk. Those who have or are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes who eat meat, chicken, and fish regularly may choose cooking methods that use lower temperatures, or brief periods of high heat, such as with slow cookers, baking, sous-vide, boiling, steaming, stewing, and stir-frying, while avoiding high-heat and open-flame methods like grilling, barbecuing, broiling, and roasting.\n\n“Our research suggests that not only the amount and types of meat but also the cooking methods can make a difference in diabetes risk,” said Gang Liu, a Research Fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Department of Nutrition and lead author of the study. “To lower diabetes risk, it is important to reduce red and processed meat consumption, which can be replaced by other protein sources such as chicken, fish, and plant-protein foods. This study further suggests that when cooking meats, chicken, or fish, it may be better to avoid high-temperature cooking methods including grilling or barbecuing, and instead choose moderate-temperature cooking methods such as stir-frying, sautéing, boiling, or steaming.”", "category": "general"},{"title": "Substituting healthy plant proteins for red meat lowers risk for heart disease", "url": "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/substituting-healthy-plant-proteins-for-red-meat-lowers-risk-for-heart-disease/", "content": "**Red Meat vs. Plant Protein Sources: A New Study**\n\nThe study was published in the journal Circulation.\n\nPrevious findings from randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of red meat on cardiovascular disease risk factors have been inconsistent. But our new study, which makes specific comparisons between diets high in red meat versus diets high in other types of foods, shows that substituting red meat with high-quality protein sources lead to more favorable changes in cardiovascular risk factors,” said Marta Guasch-Ferré, research scientist in the Department of Nutrition and lead author of the study.\n\n*   The study included data from 36 randomized controlled trials involving 1,803 participants.\n*   The researchers compared people who ate diets with red meat with people who ate more of other types of foods (i.e. chicken, fish, carbohydrates, or plant proteins such as legumes, soy, or nuts), looking at blood concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and blood pressure—all risk factors for CVD.\n*   The study found that when diets with red meat were compared with all other types of diets combined, there were no significant differences in total cholesterol, lipoproteins, or blood pressure, although diets higher in red meat did lead to higher triglyceride concentrations than the comparison diets.\n\nHowever, researchers found that diets higher in high-quality plant protein sources such as legumes, soy, and nuts resulted in lower levels of both total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat. The results are consistent with long-term epidemiologic studies showing lower risks of heart attacks when nuts and other plant sources of protein are compared to red meat, the authors said.\n\nThe findings also suggest that the inconsistencies found in prior studies regarding the effects of red meat on cardiovascular risk factors may be due, in part, to the composition of the comparison diet. They recommended that future studies take specific comparisons into account.\n\n“Asking ‘Is red meat good or bad?’ is useless,” said Meir Stampfer, professor of epidemiology and nutrition and senior author of the study. “It has to be ‘Compared to what?’ If you replace burgers with cookies or fries, you don’t get healthier. But if you replace red meat with healthy plant protein sources, like nuts and beans, you get a health benefit.”\n\nThe authors recommended adherence to healthy vegetarian and Mediterranean-style diets, both for their health benefits and to promote environmental sustainability.", "category": "general"},{"title": "WHO report says eating processed meat is carcinogenic: Understanding the findings", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2015/11/03/report-says-eating-processed-meat-is-carcinogenic-understanding-the-findings/", "content": "**WHO report says eating processed meat is carcinogenic: Understanding the findings**\n\n**Title**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO)’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) announced that consumption of processed meat is “carcinogenic to humans (Group I ),” and that consumption of red meat is “probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).”\n\n**Overview**\nThe report differentiates the two meats as follows: Processed meat – meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation Red meat – unprocessed mammalian muscle meat such as beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse and goat meat\n\n**Recommendations**\nTo help further explain the report findings we spoke with Kana Wu, a member of the IARC Monograph Working Group for this report and a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H.

It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a “stretchy” quality—think of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily.\n\n**Gluten and Health Benefits**\nGluten is most often associated with wheat and wheat-containing foods that are abundant in our food supply. Negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet. There is little published research to support these claims; in fact, published research suggests the opposite.\n\nIn a 2017 study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease, researchers found no association between long-term dietary gluten consumption and heart disease risk. In fact, the findings also suggested that non-celiac individuals who avoid gluten may increase their risk of heart disease, due to the potential for reduced consumption of whole grains.\n\nMany studies have linked whole grain consumption with improved health outcomes. For example, groups with the highest intakes of whole grains including wheat (2-3 servings daily) compared with groups eating the lowest amounts (less than 2 servings daily) were found to have significantly lower rates of heart disease and stroke, development of type 2 diabetes, and deaths from all causes.\n\nGluten may also act as a prebiotic, feeding the “good” bacteria in our bodies. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharide is a prebiotic carbohydrate derived from wheat bran that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon.\n\n**When Gluten Is a Problem**\nWhat’s not great about gluten is that it can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one’s immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation.\n\nThe side effects can range from mild (fatigue, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea) to severe (unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, intestinal damage) as seen in the autoimmune disorder celiac disease. Estimates suggest that 1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease, or about 1% of the population, but about 83% of them are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions.\n\nResearch shows that people with celiac disease also have a slightly higher risk of osteoporosis and anemia (due to malabsorption of calcium and iron, respectively); infertility; nerve disorders; and in rare cases cancer. The good news is that removing gluten from the diet may reverse the damage.\n\n**What Is a “Gluten-Free Diet”?**\nThis is essentially a diet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients including B vitamins, magnesium, and iron, it’s important to make up for these missing nutrients.\n\nAlong with consuming naturally gluten-free foods in their whole form like fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, fish, eggs, and poultry, the following whole grains are also inherently gluten-free:\n\n* Quinoa\n* Brown, black, or red rice\n* Buckwheat\n* Amaranth\n* Millet\n* Corn\n* Sorghum\n* Teff\n\nIt’s also key not to rely on processed gluten-free foods that may be high in calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and low in nutrients, such as gluten-free cookies, chips, and other snack foods.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "A healthy summer cookout", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2017/06/29/healthy-summer-picnic/", "content": "**A Healthy Summer Cookout**\n\n*   **Tips for a Healthy Summer Picnic**\n    *   Fuel your family with summertime meals that are both nutritious and safe.\n    *   Whether you’re hosting a backyard cookout, or planning a picnic on the go, be sure to use this visual guide as a blueprint.", "category": "general"},{"title": "News", "url": "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/red-meat-consumption-associated-with-increased-type-2-diabetes-risk", "content": "**Title**\nSexual minorities more likely to terminate pregnancies\nPeople who self-identified as a sexual minority were nearly twice as likely to have a pregnancy that ended in abortion than their heterosexual peers—and thus may be disproportionately impacted by abortion restrictions, according to a study from Harvard Chan School.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    People who self-identified as a sexual minority were nearly twice as likely to have a pregnancy that ended in abortion than their heterosexual peers—and thus may be disproportionately impacted by abortion restrictions, according to a study from Harvard Chan School.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   **Nutrition Facts**\n    *   \n*   **Preparation**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nNewly discovered mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity may drive insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes\nA newly discovered mechanism that leads to liver dysfunction may be a key factor in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders in individuals with obesity, according to a new study led by Harvard Chan School.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    A newly discovered mechanism that leads to liver dysfunction may be a key factor in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders in individuals with obesity, according to a new study led by Harvard Chan School.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   **Nutrition Facts**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nPioneering nutrition and chronic disease risk research may soon be lost\nThere are just weeks left to save the frozen biological samples that have powered major advances in nutrition and chronic disease risk research.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    There are just weeks left to save the frozen biological samples that have powered major advances in nutrition and chronic disease risk research.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nGraduation 2025: Award winners\nEach year, awards are presented to graduating students, faculty, and staff.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    Each year, awards are presented to graduating students, faculty, and staff.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nNew COVID vaccine policy limits choice, could raise risk for younger groups\nBill Hanage discusses the implications of a new FDA policy that will limit the COVID-19 vaccine to people over age 65 and those with certain medical conditions.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    Bill Hanage discusses the implications of a new FDA policy that will limit the COVID-19 vaccine to people over age 65 and those with certain medical conditions.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nNew approach to preventing malaria transmission holds promise\nAlexandra Probst, PhD ’25, has been part of a team using an innovative approach to develop compounds that can prevent malaria transmission by targeting the parasite inside the mosquitoes responsible for passing the disease to people.\n\n*   **Overview**\n    Alexandra Probst, PhD ’25, has been part of a team using an innovative approach to develop compounds that can prevent malaria transmission by targeting the parasite inside the mosquitoes responsible for passing the disease to people.\n*   **Recommendations**\n    *   \n*   <br>\n*   **Title**\nStudents help bolster mental health, epilepsy care at Ugandan clinic\nTeguo Djoyum, Erin McGuinness, and Olabiyi Olaniran earned the Gareth M.
