Translations of the Healthy Eating Plate are also available in over 25 languages. Building a Healthy and Balanced Diet Make most of your meal vegetables and fruits \u2013 \u00bd of your plate. Aim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don\u2019t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar. Go for whole grains \u2013 \u00bc of your plate. Whole and intact grains\u2014whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta\u2014have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains. Protein power \u2013 \u00bc of your plate. Fish, poultry, beans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources\u2014they can be mixed into salads, and pair well with vegetables on a plate. Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage. Healthy plant oils \u2013 in moderation. Choose healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember that low-fat does not mean \u201chealthy.\u201d Drink water, coffee, or tea. Skip sugary drinks, limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, and limit juice to a small glass per day. Stay active. The red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate\u2019s placemat is a reminder that staying active is also important in weight control. The main message of the Healthy Eating Plate is to focus on diet quality: The type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate\u2014like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans\u2014are healthier than others. The Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoid sugary beverages, a major source of calories\u2014usually with little nutritional value\u2014in the American diet. The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to use healthy oils, and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA. Your Plate and the Planet Just as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment.

At a glance, the graphic features examples of best-choice foods to inspire the selection of healthy meals and snacks, and it emphasizes physical activity as part of the equation for staying healthy. Building a healthy and balanced diet Eating a variety of foods keeps our meals interesting and flavorful. It\u2019s also the key to a healthy and balanced diet because each food has a unique mix of nutrients\u2014both mac\u00adronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate provides a blueprint to help us make the best eating choices. Along with filling half of our plate with colorful vegetables and fruits (and choosing them as snacks), split the other half between whole grains and healthy protein: The more veggies \u2013 and the greater the variety \u2013 the better. Potatoes and French fries don\u2019t count as vegetables because of their negative impact on blood sugar. More on vegetables > Eat plenty of fruits of all colors. Choose whole fruits or sliced fruits (rather than fruit juices; limit fruit juice to one small glass per day). More on fruits > Go for whole grains or foods made with minimally processed whole grains. The less processed the grains, the better. Whole grains\u2014whole wheat, brown rice, quinoa, and foods made with them, such as whole-grain pasta and 100% whole-wheat bread\u2014have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than white rice, bread, pizza crust, pasta, and other refined grains. More on whole grains > Choose beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and other plant-based healthy protein options, as well as fish, eggs, and poultry. Limit red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and avoid processed meats (bacon, deli meats, hot dogs, sausages). More on healthy protein > It\u2019s also important to remember that fat is a necessary part of our diet, and what matters most is the type of fat we eat. We should regularly choose foods with healthy unsaturated fats (such as fish, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils from plants), limit foods high in saturated fat (especially red meat), and avoid unhealthy trans fats (from partially hydrogenated oils): Use healthy oils from plants like extra virgin olive, canola, corn, sunflower, and peanut oil in cooking, on salads and vegetables, and at the table. Limit butter to occasional use. More on healthy oils and healthy fats > Dairy foods are needed in smaller amounts than other foods on our plate: Choose unflavored milk, plain yogurt, small amounts of cheese, and other unsweetened dairy foods. Milk and other dairy products are a convenient source of calcium and vitamin D, but the optimal intake of dairy products has yet to be determined and the research is still developing. For children consuming little or no milk, ask a doctor about possible calcium and vitamin D supplementation. More on dairy > Water should be the drink of choice with every meal and snack, as well as when we are active: Water is the best choice for quenching our thirst. It\u2019s also sugar-free, and as easy to find as the nearest tap. Limit juice\u2014which can have as much sugar as soda\u2014to one small glass per day, and avoid sugary drinks like sodas, fruit drinks, and sports drinks, which provide a lot of calories and virtually no other nutrients. Over time, drinking sugary drinks can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other problems. More on water and choosing healthy drinks > Finally, just like choosing the right foods, incorporating physical activity into our day by staying active is part of the recipe for keeping healthy: Trade inactive \u201csit-time\u201d for \u201cfit-time.\u201d Children and adolescents should aim for at least one hour of physical activity per day, and they don\u2019t need fancy equipment or a gym\u2014The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggest choosing unstructured activities for children such as playing tug-of-war, or having fun using playground equipment. More on staying active > Overall, the main message is to focus on diet quality. The type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate\u2014like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans\u2014are much healthier than sugar, potatoes, and foods made from white flour. The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate does not include sugary drinks, sweets, and other junk foods. These are not everyday foods and should be eaten only rarely, if ever. The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate encourages the use of healthy oils in place of other types of fat. About the Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate was created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, based on the best available science, to enhance the visual guid\u00adance provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s MyPlate icon. The Kid\u2019s Plate reflects the same important messages as the Healthy Eating Plate, with a primary focus on diet quality, but is designed to further facilitate the teaching of healthy eating behaviors to children.

Whole grains offer a \u201ccomplete package\u201d of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process. All whole grain kernels contain three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is the fiber-rich outer layer that supplies B vitamins, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals. These components have various effects on our bodies: Bran and fiber slow the breakdown of starch into glucose\u2014thus maintaining a steady blood sugar rather than causing sharp spikes. Fiber helps lower cholesterol as well as move waste through the digestive tract. Fiber may also help prevent the formation of small blood clots that can trigger heart attacks or strokes. Phytochemicals and essential minerals such as magnesium, selenium and copper found in whole grains may protect against some cancers. The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat\u2019s B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced. A growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out our Carbohydrate Guide. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1] However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains: Amaranth Kamut Spelt Barley Millet Teff Brown Rice Quinoa Triticale Buckwheat Rye Wheat Berries Bulgur Oats Wild Rice Corn Sorghum Be careful when choosing foods labeled as whole grains: \u201cWhole grain\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean healthy. One study revealed that inconsistent food labeling means that foods identified as \u201cwhole grain\u201d are not always healthy. [2] The study assessed five USDA criteria that identify whole grains in a food product: 1) any whole grain as the first ingredient, 2) any whole grain as the first ingredient, and added sugars not being one of the first three ingredients in the ingredient list, 3) the word \u201cwhole\u201d before any grain ingredient, 4) a carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio of less than 10:1, and 5) the industry-sponsored Whole Grain Stamp. The Whole Grain Stamp is a widely used marker on food products. The stamp, while designed to steer consumers towards healthy whole grains, identified products with more fiber and less sodium and trans fat but that were higher in sugar and calories than whole grain foods without the stamp. The other three USDA criteria had mixed results in identifying healthier whole grain products, but (criterion 4) the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio of less than 10:1 proved to be the most effective measure of healthfulness. However, it is unclear whether this ratio is more predictive of chronic disease risk than other measures of carbohydrate quality\u2014such as the amount/type of fiber or overall dietary glycemic index/load. Foods that met this criterion were higher in fiber and less likely to contain trans fats, sodium, and sugar. Because calculating the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio may be difficult and not readily available for a consumer reading a label, the study suggests that labeling guidelines appearing on whole-grain foods should be improved. Consumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their whole forms\u2014such as brown rice, barley, oats, corn, and rye\u2014are healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients. Whole Grains and Disease As researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning that the quality of the carbohydrates you eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health. [3] A report from the Iowa Women\u2019s Health Study linked whole grain consumption with fewer deaths from inflammatory and infectious causes, excluding cardiac and cancer causes. Examples are rheumatoid arthritis, gout, asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. Compared with women who rarely or never ate whole-grain foods, those who had at least two or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have died from an inflammation-related condition over a 17-year period. [4] A meta-analysis combining results from studies conducted in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries (which included health information from over 786,000 individuals), found that people who ate 70 grams/day of whole grains\u2014compared with those who ate little or no whole grains\u2014had a 22% lower risk of total mortality, a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, and a 20% lower risk of cancer mortality. [5] Cardiovascular disease Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels. In the Harvard-based Nurses\u2019 Health Study, women who ate 2 to 3 servings of whole-grain products each day were 30% less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease over a 10-year period than women who ate less than 1 serving per week. [6] A meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21% less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week. [7] Type 2 diabetes Replacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8] In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients. In a study of more than 160,000 women whose health and dietary habits were followed for up to 18 years, those who averaged 2 to 3 servings of whole grains a day were 30% less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains. [9] When the researchers combined these results with those of several other large studies, they found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21%. A follow-up to that study including men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found that swapping white rice for whole grains could help lower diabetes risk. Those who ate the most white rice\u2014five or more servings a week\u2014had a 17% higher risk of diabetes than those who ate white rice less than one time a month. Those who ate the most brown rice\u2014two or more servings a week\u2014had an 11% lower risk of diabetes than those who rarely ate brown rice. Researchers estimate that swapping whole grains in place of even some white rice could lower diabetes risk by 36%. [10] A large study of more than 72,000 postmenopausal women without diabetes at the start of the study found that the higher the intake of whole grains, the greater the risk reduction of type 2 diabetes. A 43% reduced risk was found in women eating the highest amount of whole grains (2 or more servings daily) as compared with those who ate no whole grains. [11] Cancer The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13] A large five-year study among nearly 500,000 men and women suggests that eating whole grains, but not dietary fiber, offers modest protection against colorectal cancer. [14,15] A review of four large population studies also showed a protective effect of whole grains from colorectal cancer, with a cumulative risk reduction of 21%. [16] Digestive health By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines. [17] A study of 170,776 women followed for more than 26 years looked at the effect of different dietary fibers, including that from whole grains, on Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Though a reduced risk of Crohn\u2019s disease was found in those eating high intakes of fruit fiber, there was no reduced risk of either disease found from eating whole grains. [18] Some grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives\u2014without any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims.

Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods. Jump to: \u2013What is protein? \u2013How much protein do I need? \u2013It\u2019s all about the protein \u201cpackage\u201d \u2013Research on protein and human health \u2013Protein foods and the planet \u2013The bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods \u2013[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge! What Is Protein? Protein is found throughout the body\u2014in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way. Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don\u2019t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids\u2014histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine\u2014known as the essential amino acids, must come from food. How Much Protein Do I Need? The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, or just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1] For a 140-pound person, that means about 50 grams of protein each day. For a 200-pound person, that means about 70 grams of protein each day. The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake\u2014anywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there\u2019s relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one\u2019s individual protein needs. In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important. What are \u201ccomplete\u201d proteins, and how much do I need? It\u2019s important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don\u2019t get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreased immunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death. However, it\u2019s uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there\u2019s an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3] It\u2019s All About the Protein \u201cPackage\u201d When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It\u2019s this protein \u201cpackage\u201d that\u2019s likely to make a difference for health. The table below shows a sample of food \u201cpackages\u201d sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it. Table: Comparing protein packages To call out a few examples: A 4-ounce broiled sirloin steak is a great source of protein\u2014about 33 grams worth. But it also delivers about 5 grams of saturated fat. A 4-ounce ham steak with 22 grams of protein has only 1.6 grams of saturated fat, but it\u2019s loaded with 1,500 milligrams worth of sodium. 4 ounces of grilled sockeye salmon has about 30 grams of protein, naturally low in sodium, and contains just over 1 gram of saturated fat. Salmon and other fatty fish are also excellent sources of omega-3 fats, a type of fat that\u2019s especially good for the heart. A cup of cooked lentils provides about 18 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber, and it has virtually no saturated fat or sodium. What about protein powders? Powdered protein can come from a variety of sources, including eggs, milk (e.g., casein, whey), and plants (e.g., soybeans, peas, hemp). Some protein powders contain protein from multiple sources; for instance, a vegan option might include protein derived from peas, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and alfalfa. Like other dietary supplements, protein powders are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety. They can often contain non-protein ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, thickeners, added sugars, non-caloric sweeteners, and artificial flavoring. If you choose to consume protein powder, it is important to read the nutrition and ingredient labels beforehand, as products may contain unexpected ingredients and large amounts of added sugars and calories. LEARN MORE ABOUT PROTEIN POWDERS AND OTHER WORKOUT SUPPLEMENTS Research on Protein and Health Available evidence indicates that it\u2019s the source of protein (or, the protein \u201cpackage\u201d), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here\u2019s the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death. Heart disease Diabetes Cancer Premature death Bone health Weight control Other considerations involving protein New research highlight: Red meat and diabetes risk People who eat just two servings of red meat per week may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who eat fewer servings, and the risk increases with greater consumption, according to a new study led by researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They also found that replacing red meat with healthy plant-based protein sources, such as nuts and legumes, or modest amounts of dairy foods, was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. READ MORE Protein Foods and the Planet Just as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Agriculture is a major contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, the accumulation of which is driving climate change at a rate unprecedented in human history. However, not all foods have an equal impact. Production of animal-based foods tends to have higher GHG emissions than producing plant-based foods\u2014and dairy and especially red meat (particularly beef, lamb, and goat) stand out for their disproportionate impact. Source: World Resources Institute, www.wri.org/proteinscorecard To give you an idea, this \u201cscorecard\u201d from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it\u2019s also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT FOODS ON YOUR PLATE. Bottom Line Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein \u201cpackages\u201d are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it\u2019s important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That\u2019s why the Healthy Eating Plate encourages choosing healthy protein foods. Choose fish, poultry, beans, and nuts; limit red meat and cheese; avoid bacon, cold cuts, and other processed meats. EXPLORE THE HEALTHY EATING PLATE Building off this general guidance, here are some additional details and tips for shaping your diet with the best protein choices: Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no \u201cessential\u201d components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match. Here are some examples for each category: Legumes: lentils, beans (adzuki, black, fava, chickpeas/garbanzo, kidney, lima, mung, pinto etc.), peas (green, snow, snap, split, etc.), edamame/soybeans (and products made from soy: tofu, tempeh, etc.), peanuts. Nuts and Seeds: almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans, hemp seeds, squash and pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, chia seeds. Whole Grains: kamut, teff, wheat, quinoa, rice, wild rice, millet, oats, buckwheat, Other: while many vegetables and fruits contain some level of protein, it\u2019s generally in smaller amounts than the other plant-based foods. Some examples with higher protein quantities include corn, broccoli, asparagus, brussels sprouts, and artichokes. Prioritize hearty and savory plant-based preparations Simple strategies for creating filling, delicious, and even budget-friendly plant-based dishes. Upgrade your sources of animal protein. Considering the protein package is particularly important when it comes to animal-based foods: Generally, poultry (chicken, turkey, duck) and a variety of seafood (fish, crustaceans, mollusks) are your best bet. Eggs can be a good choice, too. If you enjoy dairy foods, it\u2019s best to do so in moderation (think closer to 1-2 servings a day; and incorporating yogurt is probably a better choice than getting all your servings from milk or cheese). Red meat\u2014which includes unprocessed beef, pork, lamb, veal, mutton, and goat meat\u2014should be consumed on a more limited basis. If you enjoy red meat, consider eating it in small amounts or only on special occasions. Processed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, and cold cuts should be avoided. Although these products are often made from red meats, processed meats also include items like turkey bacon, chicken sausage, and deli-sliced chicken and ham. (Processed meat refers to any meat that has been \u201ctransformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation.\u201d [18]) Looking to reduce red and processed meats, but unsure where to start? Here are a few approaches to cutting-back while keeping your meals satiating and flavorful. Simply find your \u201cstarting point\u201d and move forward with the strategies that work for you: Eat a little less red meat, any way you can Assess how often you eat red meat, and see if one of these strategies can help you find a way to cut back a bit.

No single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy. Eat plenty every day. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar, which can help keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote weight loss. [1] Their low glycemic loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase hunger. At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of beneficial plant chemicals but also creates eye-appealing meals. Tips to eat more vegetables and fruits each day Keep fruit where you can see it. Place several ready-to-eat washed whole fruits in a bowl or store chopped colorful fruits in a glass bowl in the refrigerator to tempt a sweet tooth. Explore the produce aisle and choose something new. Variety and color are key to a healthy diet. On most days, try to get at least one serving from each of the following categories: dark green leafy vegetables; yellow or orange fruits and vegetables; red fruits and vegetables; legumes (beans) and peas; and citrus fruits. Skip the potatoes. Choose other vegetables that are packed with different nutrients and more slowly digested carbohydrates. Make it a meal. Try cooking new recipes that include more vegetables. Salads, soups, and stir-fries are just a few ideas for increasing the number of tasty vegetables in your meals. 5 common questions about fruits and vegetables. Have you hesitated to fill your grocery cart with colorful produce because of concerns that pop up in online articles and discussions? HERE\u2019S A LOOK AT SOME COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS, AND WHAT THE CURRENT RESEARCH SAYS. Vegetables, fruits, and disease Cardiovascular disease There is compelling evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. A meta-analysis of cohort studies following 469,551 participants found that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, with an average reduction in risk of 4% for each additional serving per day of fruit and vegetables. [2] The largest and longest study to date, done as part of the Harvard-based Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, included almost 110,000 men and women whose health and dietary habits were followed for 14 years. The higher the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables, the lower the chances of developing cardiovascular disease. Compared with those in the lowest category of fruit and vegetable intake (less than 1.5 servings a day), those who averaged 8 or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have had a heart attack or stroke. [3] Although all fruits and vegetables likely contributed to this benefit, green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and mustard greens, were most strongly associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, and kale; and citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit (and their juices) also made important contributions. [3] When researchers combined findings from the Harvard studies with several other long-term studies in the U.S. and Europe, and looked at coronary heart disease and stroke separately, they found a similar protective effect: Individuals who ate more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day had roughly a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease [4] and stroke, [5] compared with individuals who ate less than 3 servings per day. Blood pressure The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study [6] examined the effect on blood pressure of a diet that was rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and that restricted the amount of saturated and total fat. The researchers found that people with high blood pressure who followed this diet reduced their systolic blood pressure (the upper number of a blood pressure reading) by about 11 mm Hg and their diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) by almost 6 mm Hg\u2014as much as medications can achieve. A randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart) showed that this fruit and vegetable-rich diet lowered blood pressure even more when some of the carbohydrate was replaced with healthy unsaturated fat or protein. [7] In 2014 a meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies found that consumption of a vegetarian diet was associated with lower blood pressure. [8] Cancer Numerous early studies revealed what appeared to be a strong link between eating fruits and vegetables and protection against cancer. Unlike case-control studies, cohort studies, which follow large groups of initially healthy individuals for years, generally provide more reliable information than case-control studies because they don\u2019t rely on information from the past. And, in general, data from cohort studies have not consistently shown that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables prevents cancer. For example, over a 14-year period in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, men and women with the highest intake of fruits and vegetables (8+ servings a day) were just as likely to have developed cancer as those who ate the fewest daily servings (under 1.5). [3] A meta-analysis of cohort studies found that a higher fruit and vegetable intake did not decrease the risk of deaths from cancer. [2] A more likely possibility is that some types of fruits and vegetables may protect against certain cancers. A study by Farvid and colleagues followed a Nurses\u2019 Health Study II cohort of 90,476 premenopausal women for 22 years and found that those who ate the most fruit during adolescence (about 3 servings a day) compared with those who ate the lowest intakes (0.5 servings a day) had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer. There was a significant reduction in breast cancer in women who had eaten higher intakes of apples, bananas, grapes, and corn during adolescence, and oranges and kale during early adulthood. No protection was found from drinking fruit juices at younger ages. [9] Farvid and colleagues followed 90, 534 premenopausal women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II over 20 years and found that higher fiber intakes during adolescence and early adulthood were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer later in life. When comparing the highest and lowest fiber intakes from fruits and vegetables, women with the highest fruit fiber intake had a 12% reduced risk of breast cancer; those with the highest vegetable fiber intake had an 11% reduced risk. [10] After following 182,145 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II for 30 years, Farvid\u2019s team also found that women who ate more than 5.5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day (especially cruciferous and yellow/orange vegetables) had an 11% lower risk of breast cancer than those who ate 2.5 or fewer servings. Vegetable intake was strongly associated with a 15% lower risk of estrogen-receptor-negative tumors for every two additional servings of vegetables eaten daily. A higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of other aggressive tumors including HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors. [11] A report by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research suggests that non-starchy vegetables\u2014such as lettuce and other leafy greens, broccoli, bok choy, cabbage, as well as garlic, onions, and the like\u2014and fruits \u201cprobably\u201d protect against several types of cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, and stomach. Fruit probably also protects against lung cancer. [12] Specific components of fruits and vegetables may also be protective against cancer. For example: A line of research stemming from a finding from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study suggests that tomatoes may help protect men against prostate cancer, especially aggressive forms of it. [12] One of the pigments that give tomatoes their red hue\u2014lycopene\u2014could be involved in this protective effect. Although several studies other than the Health Professionals Study have also demonstrated a link between tomatoes or lycopene and prostate cancer, others have not or have found only a weak connection. [14] Taken as a whole, however, these studies suggest that increased consumption of tomato-based products (especially cooked tomato products) and other lycopene-containing foods may reduce the occurrence of prostate cancer. [12] Lycopene is one of several carotenoids (compounds that the body can turn into vitamin A) found in brightly colored fruits and vegetables, and research suggests that foods containing carotenoids may protect against lung, mouth, and throat cancer. [12] But more research is needed to understand the exact relationship between fruits and vegetables, carotenoids, and cancer. Diabetes Some research looks specifically at whether individual fruits are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. While there isn\u2019t an abundance of research into this area yet, preliminary results are compelling. A study of over 66,000 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 85,104 women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, and 36,173 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study\u2014who were free of major chronic diseases\u2014found that greater consumption of whole fruits\u2014especially blueberries, grapes, and apples\u2014was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Another important finding was that greater consumption of fruit juice was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. [15] Additionally a study of over 70,000 female nurses aged 38-63 years, who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, showed that consumption of green leafy vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower risk of diabetes. While not conclusive, research also indicated that consumption of fruit juices may be associated with an increased risk among women. (16) A study of over 2,300 Finnish men showed that vegetables and fruits, especially berries, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. [17] Weight Data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies and the Health Professional\u2019s Follow-up Study show that women and men who increased their intakes of fruits and vegetables over a 24-year period were more likely to have lost weight than those who ate the same amount or those who decreased their intake. Berries, apples, pears, soy, and cauliflower were associated with weight loss while starchier vegetables like potatoes, corn, and peas were linked with weight gain. [1] However, keep in mind that adding more produce into the diet won\u2019t necessarily help with weight loss unless it replaces another food, such as refined carbohydrates of white bread and crackers. Gastrointestinal health Fruits and vegetables contain indigestible fiber, which absorbs water and expands as it passes through the digestive system. This can calm symptoms of an irritable bowel and, by triggering regular bowel movements, can relieve or prevent constipation. [18] The bulking and softening action of insoluble fiber also decreases pressure inside the intestinal tract and may help prevent diverticulosis. [19] Vision Eating fruits and vegetables can also keep your eyes healthy, and may help prevent two common aging-related eye diseases\u2014cataracts and macular degeneration\u2014which afflict millions of Americans over age 65. [20-23] Lutein and zeaxanthin, in particular, seem to reduce risk of cataracts. [24] References Bertoia ML, Mukamal KJ, Cahill LE, Hou T, Ludwig DS, Mozaffarian D, Willett WC, Hu FB, Rimm EB.

Contrary to past dietary advice promoting low-fat diets, newer research shows that healthy fats are necessary and beneficial for health. When food manufacturers reduce fat, they often replace it with carbohydrates from sugar, refined grains, or other starches. Our bodies digest these refined carbohydrates and starches very quickly, affecting blood sugar and insulin levels and possibly resulting in weight gain and disease. (1-3) Findings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (4) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (5) show that no link between the overall percentage of calories from fat and any important health outcome, including cancer, heart disease, and weight gain. Rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it\u2019s more important to focus on eating beneficial \u201cgood\u201d fats and avoiding harmful \u201cbad\u201d fats. Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. Choose foods with \u201cgood\u201d unsaturated fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid \u201cbad\u201d trans fat. \u201cGood\u201d unsaturated fats \u2014 Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats \u2014 lower disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish. \u201cBad\u201d fats \u2014 trans fats \u2014 increase disease risk, even when eaten in small quantities. Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Fortunately, trans fats have been eliminated from many of these foods. Saturated fats, while not as harmful as trans fats, by comparison with unsaturated fats negatively impact health and are best consumed in moderation. Foods containing large amounts of saturated fat include red meat, butter, cheese, and ice cream. Some plant-based fats like coconut oil and palm oil are also rich in saturated fat. When you cut back on foods like red meat and butter, replace them with fish, beans, nuts, and healthy oils instead of refined carbohydrates.

Unsaturated fats are predominantly found in foods from plants, such as vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds. There are two types of \u201cgood\u201d unsaturated fats: 1. Monounsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in: Olive, peanut, and canola oils Avocados Nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans Seeds such as pumpkin and sesame seeds 2. Polyunsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in Sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils Walnuts Flax seeds Fish Canola oil \u2013 though higher in monounsaturated fat, it\u2019s also a good source of polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3 fats are an important type of polyunsaturated fat. The body can\u2019t make these, so they must come from food. An excellent way to get omega-3 fats is by eating fish 2-3 times a week. Good plant sources of omega-3 fats include flax seeds, walnuts, and canola or soybean oil. Higher blood omega-3 fats are associated with lower risk of premature death among older adults, according to a study by HSPH faculty. Read more about omega-3 fats in our Ask the Expert with Dr. Frank Sacks. Most people don\u2019t eat enough healthful unsaturated fats. The American Heart Association suggests that 8-10 percent of daily calories should come from polyunsaturated fats, and there is evidence that eating more polyunsaturated fat\u2014up to 15 percent of daily calories\u2014in place of saturated fat can lower heart disease risk. (7) Dutch researchers conducted an analysis of 60 trials that examined the effects of carbohydrates and various fats on blood lipid levels. In trials in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats were eaten in place of carbohydrates, these good fats decreased levels of harmful LDL and increased protective HDL. (8) More recently, a randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart) showed that replacing a carbohydrate-rich diet with one rich in unsaturated fat, predominantly monounsaturated fats, lowers blood pressure, improves lipid levels, and reduces the estimated cardiovascular risk. (9) Saturated Fats All foods containing fat have a mix of specific types of fats. Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream. Saturated fat is mainly found in animal foods, but a few plant foods are also high in saturated fats, such as coconut, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends getting less than 10 percent of calories each day from saturated fat. (10) The American Heart Association goes even further, recommending limiting saturated fat to no more than 7 percent of calories. (11) Cutting back on saturated fat will likely have no benefit, however, if people replace saturated fat with refined carbohydrates. Eating refined carbohydrates in place of saturated fat does lower \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, but it also lowers the \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and increases triglycerides. The net effect is as bad for the heart as eating too much saturated fat. In the United States, the biggest sources of saturated fat (12) in the diet are Pizza and cheese Whole and reduced fat milk, butter and dairy desserts Meat products (sausage, bacon, beef, hamburgers) Cookies and other grain-based desserts A variety of mixed fast food dishes Though decades of dietary advice (13, 14) suggested saturated fat was harmful, in recent years that idea has begun to evolve. Several studies suggest that eating diets high in saturated fat do not raise the risk of heart disease, with one report analyzing the findings of 21 studies that followed 350,000 people for up to 23 years. Investigators looked at the relationship between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Their controversial conclusion: \u201cThere is insufficient evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD.\u201d(13) A well-publicized 2014 study questioned the link between saturated fat and heart disease, but HSPH nutrition experts determined the paper to be seriously misleading. In order to set the record straight, Harvard School of Public Health convened a panel of nutrition experts and held a teach-in, \u201cSaturated or not: Does type of fat matter?\u201c The overarching message is that cutting back on saturated fat can be good for health if people replace saturated fat with good fats, especially, polyunsaturated fats. (1, 15, 22) Eating good fats in place of saturated fat lowers the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, and it improves the ratio of total cholesterol to \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart disease. Eating good fats in place of saturated fat can also help prevent insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. (16) So while saturated fat may not be as harmful as once thought, evidence clearly shows that unsaturated fat remains the healthiest type of fat. Percentage of Specific Types of Fat in Common Oils and Fats* Trans Fats Trans fatty acids, more commonly called trans fats, are made by heating liquid vegetable oils in the presence of hydrogen gas and a catalyst, a process called hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenating vegetable oils makes them more stable and less likely to become rancid. This process also converts the oil into a solid, which makes them function as margarine or shortening. Partially hydrogenated oils can withstand repeated heating without breaking down, making them ideal for frying fast foods. For these reasons, partially hydrogenated oils became a mainstay in restaurants and the food industry \u2013 for frying, baked goods, and processed snack foods and margarine. Partially hydrogenated oil is not the only source of trans fats in our diets. Trans fats are also naturally found in beef fat and dairy fat in small amounts. Trans fats are the worst type of fat for the heart, blood vessels, and rest of the body because they: Raise bad LDL and lower good HDL Create inflammation, (18) \u2013 a reaction related to immunity \u2013 which has been implicated in heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic conditions Contribute to insulin resistance (16) Can have harmful health effects even in small amounts \u2013 for each additional 2 percent of calories from trans fat consumed daily, the risk of coronary heart disease increases by 23 percent. The long road to phasing-out artificial trans fats For years, only true diet detectives knew whether a particular food contained trans fat. This phantom fat was found in thousands of foods, but only those familiar with the \u201ccode words\u201d partially hydrogenated oil and vegetable shortening knew when it was present. Fortunately, after a large body of research in the 1990s sounded the alarm on its deleterious health effects, a series of policy initiatives led to the near elimination of artificial trans fat in the U.S. food supply by 2018. However, the road to eliminating trans fat was not so straightforward, and outside the U.S. there\u2019s still more work to be done. In many developing nations, trans fat intake remains high.

Although it remains important to limit the amount of cholesterol you eat, especially if you have diabetes, for most people dietary cholesterol is not as problematic as once believed. The body uses cholesterol as the starting point to make estrogen, testosterone, vitamin D, and other vital compounds. Cholesterol in the bloodstream, specifically the bad LDL cholesterol, is what\u2019s most important in determining health risk. How Fat Moves from Food to the Bloodstream Fat and cholesterol can\u2019t dissolve in water or blood. Instead, the body packages fat and cholesterol into tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins can transport a lot of fat; they mix easily with blood and flow with it. Some of these particles are big and fluffy, while others are small and dense. The most important ones are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL) , and triglycerides. Low Density lipoproteins Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body. Cells latch onto these particles and extract fat and cholesterol from them. When there is too much LDL cholesterol in the blood, these particles can form deposits in the walls of the coronary arteries and other arteries throughout the body. Such deposits, called plaque, can narrow arteries and limit blood flow. When plaque breaks apart, it can cause a heart attack or stroke. Because of this, LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad, or harmful, cholesterol. High-density lipoproteins High-density lipoproteins (HDL) scavenge cholesterol from the bloodstream, from LDL, and from artery walls and ferry it back to the liver for disposal. Think of HDL as the garbage trucks of the bloodstream. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as good, or protective, cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglycerides make up most of the fat that you eat and that travels through the bloodstream. As the body\u2019s main vehicle for transporting fats to cells, triglycerides are important for good health, though high levels of triglycerides can be unhealthy. In general, the lower your LDL and the higher your HDL, the better your chances of preventing heart disease and other chronic conditions. How Fat and Cholesterol in Food Affect Blood Cholesterol Levels The types of fat in the diet help determine the amount of total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. The types and amount of carbohydrate in the diet also play a role. Cholesterol in food matters, too, but not nearly as much. The discovery half a century ago that high blood cholesterol levels were strongly associated with an increased risk for heart disease triggered numerous warnings to avoid foods that contain cholesterol, especially eggs and liver. However, scientific studies show a weak relationship between the amount of cholesterol a person consumes and his or her blood cholesterol levels (22) In studies of more than 80,000 female nurses, Harvard researchers found that consuming about an egg a day was not associated with higher risk of heart disease. (4, 23) However, people who have heart disease or diabetes should monitor egg consumption. For most people, the amount of cholesterol eaten has only a modest impact on the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood. (24) For some people, though, blood cholesterol levels rise and fall very strongly in relation to the amount of cholesterol eaten. For these \u201cresponders,\u201d avoiding cholesterol-rich foods can have a substantial effect on blood cholesterol levels. Unfortunately, at this point there is no way other than by trial and error to identify responders from non-responders to dietary cholesterol. References 4.

However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat. Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K) dissolve in fat and tend to accumulate in the body. Water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate) must dissolve in water before they can be absorbed by the body, and therefore cannot be stored. Any water-soluble vitamins unused by the body is primarily lost through urine. Minerals are inorganic elements present in soil and water, which are absorbed by plants or consumed by animals. While you\u2019re likely familiar with calcium, sodium, and potassium, there is a range of other minerals, including trace minerals (e.g. copper, iodine, and zinc) needed in very small amounts. In the U.S., the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) develops nutrient reference values called the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins and minerals. [1] These are intended as a guide for good nutrition and as a scientific basis for the development of food guidelines in both the U.S. and Canada. The DRIs are specific to age, gender, and life stages, and cover more than 40 nutrient substances. The guidelines are based on available reports of deficiency and toxicity of each nutrient.

What About Multivitamins? A diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, good protein packages, and healthful fats should provide most of the nutrients needed for good health. But not everyone manages to eat a healthful diet. Multivitamins can play an important role when nutritional requirements are not met through diet alone. Learn more about vitamin supplementation. Did You Know? Vitamins and their precise requirements have been controversial since their discovery in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It was the combined efforts of epidemiologists, physicians, chemists, and physiologists that led to our modern day understanding of vitamins and minerals. After years of observation, experiments, and trial and error, they were able to distinguish that some diseases were not caused by infections or toxins\u2014a common belief at the time\u2014but by vitamin deficiencies. [2] Chemists worked to identify a vitamin\u2019s chemical structure so it could be replicated. Soon after, researchers determined specific amounts of vitamins needed to avoid diseases of deficiency. In 1912, biochemist Casimir Funk was the first to coin the term \u201cvitamin\u201d in a research publication that was accepted by the medical community, derived from \u201cvita\u201d meaning life, and \u201camine\u201d referring to a nitrogenous substance essential for life. [3] Funk is considered the father of vitamin therapy, as he identified nutritional components that were missing in diseases of deficiency like scurvy (too little vitamin C), beri-beri (too little vitamin B1), pellagra (too little vitamin B3), and rickets (too little vitamin D). The discovery of all vitamins occurred by 1948. Vitamins were obtained only from food until the 1930s when commercially made supplements of certain vitamins became available. The U.S government also began fortifying foods with specific nutrients to prevent deficiencies common at the time, such as adding iodine to salt to prevent goiter, and adding folic acid to grain products to reduce birth defects during pregnancy. In the 1950s, most vitamins and multivitamins were available for sale to the general public to prevent deficiencies, some receiving a good amount of marketing in popular magazines such as promoting cod liver oil containing vitamin D as bottled sunshine.

Good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in liquid vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds, can help ward off type 2 diabetes (16), whereas trans fats do the opposite. (6, 17) If you already have diabetes, eating fish can help protect you against a heart attack or dying from heart disease. (25) Eating omega-3 fats from fish does not protect against diabetes, even though there is much evidence that these marine omega-3 fats help prevent fatal heart disease. (26) Heart Disease In a randomized controlled trial (27) a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, both rich sources of unsaturated fat, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with diabetes or other risk factors over a 4.8-year follow-up. This study highlighted that low-fat diets are continuing to lose credibility, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 can improve heart health. There isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes can incorporate the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern including: \u2013 High intake of olive oil, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and mainly whole grain cereals \u2013 Moderate intake of fish and poultry \u2013 Low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets \u2013 Wine in moderation, consumed with meals Cancer Researchers once suspected an association between dietary fat and common cancers. However, in adults, the percentage of calories consumed from total fat appears to have no significant association with cancer risk, and there is currently no clear evidence linking any specific type of fat with cancer incidence. Breast cancer In the early 1980s, most nutrition experts believed that dietary fat was a major cause of breast cancer. (28, 29) This thinking was largely based on international comparisons showing higher breast cancer rates in countries with higher per capita fat intake. But as more prospective studies and randomized controlled trials were performed over the next couple of decades, the apparent link between total fat intake and breast cancer has faded. (30) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, which was specifically designed to examine the effect of a low-fat diet on the development of breast cancer, showed similar rates of breast cancer in women eating a low-fat diet and in those eating a \u201cregular\u201d diet. (31) One study from the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP Diet and Health Study found a very weak positive association between fat and postmenopausal breast cancer, (32) but when combined with the many other studies detailed above, the overall evidence does not support a relationship between total fat intake and breast cancer. In a recent study, saturated fat was weakly associated with one form of breast cancer, but this could have been due to differences in physical activity and needs confirmation. (citation below) Although studies of different types of fat have largely failed to find a link with breast cancer, some evidence suggests that animal fat intake in young women may be linked to higher risk of breast cancer. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, premenopausal women who ate diets high in animal fat had a 40 to 50 percent higher risk of breast cancer, compared to women who ate the least animal fat. (33) Because vegetable fat was not related to risk of breast cancer, these findings suggest that red meat and high-fat dairy products may contain other factors, such as hormones, that increase risk of breast cancer. Some European studies have reported suggestive findings of lower breast cancer risk among women with a high intake of monounsaturated fats (mainly in the form of olive oil). (34, 35) Colon cancer As with breast cancer, international comparisons initially suggested an association between total dietary fat intake and colon cancer risk. But later and better studies contradicted these earlier findings and revealed no significant association. Women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial who ate a low-fat diet developed colon cancer at the same rate as women who didn\u2019t. (36) Although fat intake doesn\u2019t seem to increase colon cancer risk, there is strong evidence that high consumption of red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and especially processed meat (hot dogs, bacon, and deli meats) does increase colon cancer risk. (37) Based on this evidence and other studies related to heart disease and diabetes, it\u2019s best to limit red meat consumption to no more than twice a week, and to avoid processed meats. Prostate cancer Although the exact connection between dietary fat and prostate cancer is unclear, there is some evidence that diets high in animal fat and saturated fat may increase prostate cancer risk. However, other studies have shown no association, while others have implicated unsaturated fats. More research is needed to elucidate any possible links between dietary fat and prostate cancer. Other cancers Preliminary research has also linked the intake of certain kinds of fat with other cancers, though more research is needed to confirm these results. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Harvard researchers found that a high intake of trans fats was associated with risk for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. (38) Other Chronic Conditions There is a small but growing body of work on the effects of dietary fats on conditions such as depression, (39) osteoporosis, (40) age-related memory loss, (41) cognitive decline, (42) macular degeneration, (43) multiple sclerosis, (44) infertility and endometriosis, (45, 46) and other chronic conditions. The preliminary findings do not offer sufficient evidence to suggest modifying dietary fat recommendations. References 6. Hu, F.B., J.E. Manson, and W.C.

Humans relied on it as the only beverage for millions of years. Milk was introduced with the advent of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Then came beer and wine and coffee and tea, all consumed for taste and pleasure as much as for the fluids they provide. The newcomers\u2014sugary beverages including soda, sports drinks, and energy drinks\u2014offer hydration but with a hefty dose of unnecessary calories that the body may have a hard time regulating. Alternatively, \u201cdiet\u201d drinks offer sweetness without the calories, but does that make them a healthy choice? With so many options, it\u2019s easy to be confused about which beverages are best for our health. Follow the links below for an in-depth look at each, but if you\u2019re short on time, here\u2019s the takeaway: Water is the best choice for quenching your thirst. Coffee and tea, without added sweeteners, are healthy choices, too. Some beverages should be limited or consumed in moderation, including fruit juice, milk, and those made with low-calorie sweeteners, like diet drinks. Alcohol in moderation can be healthy for some people, but not everyone. It\u2019s generally best to avoid sugary drinks like soda, sports beverages, and energy drinks.

It is calorie-free and as easy to find as the nearest tap. Water helps to restore fluids lost through metabolism, breathing, sweating, and the removal of waste. It helps to keep you from overheating, lubricates the joints and tissues, maintains healthy skin, and is necessary for proper digestion. It\u2019s the perfect zero-calorie beverage for quenching thirst and rehydrating your body. Contents hide How Much Water Do You Need?

Healthy Hydration Tips Infused water Sparkling water with a splash of juice Ditch single-use plastic water bottles Are seltzers and other fizzy waters safe and healthy to drink? About This Page Explore More How Much Water Do You Need? Water is an essential nutrient at every age, so optimal hydration is a key component for good health. Water accounts for about 60% of an adult\u2019s body weight. We drink fluids when we feel thirst, the major signal alerting us when our body runs low on water. We also customarily drink beverages with meals to help with digestion. But sometimes we drink not based on these factors but on how much we think we should be drinking. One of the most familiar sayings is to aim for \u201c8 glasses a day,\u201d but this may not be appropriate for every person. General recommendations for daily water intake The National Academy of Medicine suggests an adequate intake of daily fluids of about 13 cups and 9 cups for healthy men and women, respectively, with 1 cup equaling 8 ounces. Higher amounts may be needed for those who are physically active or exposed to very warm climates. Lower amounts may be needed for those with smaller body sizes (the chart below lists daily water intake based on age group from the National Academy of Medicine). It\u2019s important to note that these amounts are not a daily target, but a general guide. In the average person, drinking less will not necessarily compromise one\u2019s health as each person\u2019s exact fluid needs vary, even day-to-day. Age Daily Adequate Intake 1-3 years 4 cups, or 32 ounces 4-8 years 5 cups, or 40 ounces 9-13 years 7-8 cups, or 56-64 ounces 14-18 years 8-11 cups, or 64-88 ounces men, 19 and older 13 cups, or 104 ounces women, 19 and older 9 cups, or 72 ounces pregnant women 10 cups, or 80 ounces breastfeeding women 13 cups, or 104 ounces Other considerations for daily water intake About 20% of our total water intake comes not from beverages but from water-rich foods, particularly fruits and vegetables including lettuce, leafy greens, cucumbers, bell peppers, summer squash, celery, berries, and melons. Fever, exercise, exposure to extreme temperature climates (very hot or cold), and excessive loss of body fluids (such as with vomiting or diarrhea) will increase fluid needs. The amount and color of urine can provide a rough estimate of adequate hydration. Generally the color of urine darkens the more concentrated it is (meaning that it contains less water). However, foods, medications, and vitamin supplements can also change urine color. [1] Smaller volumes of urine may indicate dehydration, especially if also darker in color. Alcohol can suppress anti-diuretic hormone, a fluid-regulating hormone that signals the kidneys to reduce urination and reabsorb water back into the body. Without it, the body flushes out water more easily. Enjoying more than a couple of drinks within a short time can increase the risk of dehydration, especially if taken on an empty stomach. To prevent this, take alcohol with food and sips of water. Although caffeine has long been thought to have a diuretic effect, potentially leading to dehydration, research does not fully support this. The data suggest that more than 180 mg of caffeine daily (about two cups of brewed coffee) may increase urination in the short-term in some people, but will not necessarily lead to dehydration. Therefore, caffeinated beverages including coffee and tea can contribute to total daily water intake. Are there benefits to drinking alkaline water? Like most trends of the moment, alkaline water has become popular through celebrity backing with claims ranging from weight loss to curing cancer. The theory behind alkaline water is the same as that touting the benefits of eating alkaline foods, which purportedly counterbalances the health detriments caused by eating acid-producing foods like meat, sugar, and some grains. From a scale of 0-14, a higher pH number is alkaline; a lower pH is acidic. The body tightly regulates blood pH levels to about 7.4 because veering away from this number to either extreme can cause negative side effects and even be life-threatening. However, diet alone cannot cause these extremes; they most commonly occur with conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, kidney disease, chronic lung disease, or alcohol abuse. Alkaline water has a higher pH of about 8-9 than tap water of about 7, due to a higher mineral or salt content. Some water sources can be naturally alkaline if the water picks up minerals as it passes over rocks. However, most commercial brands of alkaline water have been manufactured using an ionizer that reportedly separates out the alkaline components and filters out the acid components, raising the pH. Some people add an alkaline substance like baking soda to regular water. Scientific evidence is not conclusive on the acid-alkaline theory, also called the acid-ash theory, stating that eating a high amount of certain foods can slightly lower the pH of blood especially in the absence of eating foods supporting a higher alkaline blood pH like fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Controlled clinical trials have not shown that diet alone can significantly change the blood pH of healthy people. Moreover, a direct connection of blood pH in the low-normal range and chronic disease in humans has not been established. BOTTOM LINE: If the idea of alkaline water encourages you to drink more, then go for it! But it\u2019s likely that drinking plain regular water will provide similar health benefits from simply being well-hydrated\u2014improved energy, mood, and digestive health Preventing Dehydration: Is Thirst Enough? A healthy body is designed to send thirst signals when the body becomes depleted of fluids. Thirst is the desire to drink, and is not only driven by physiological cues but behavioral cues. An example of a behavioral prompt is water temperature; research suggests that people tend to drink the most water when it is served at room temperature even though cooler drinks are rated as most pleasing to taste. We are also often influenced to drink (and eat) more in social settings. As we age, however, the body\u2019s regulation of fluid intake and thirst decline. Research has shown that both of these factors are impaired in the elderly. A Cochrane review found that commonly used indicators of dehydration in older adults (e.g., urine color and volume, feeling thirsty) are not effective and should not be solely used. Certain conditions that impair mental ability and cognition, such as a stroke or dementia, can also impair thirst. People may also voluntarily limit drinking due to incontinence or difficulty getting to a bathroom. In addition to these situations, research has found that athletes, people who are ill, and infants may not have an adequate sense of thirst to replete their fluid needs. Even mild dehydration may produce negative symptoms, so people who cannot rely on thirst or other usual measures may wish to use other strategies. For example, aim to fill a 20-ounce water bottle four times daily and sip throughout the day, or drink a large glass of water with each meal and snack. Symptoms of dehydration These symptoms of dehydration may occur with as little as a 2% water deficit: Fatigue Confusion or short-term memory loss Mood changes like increased irritability or depression Risks of dehydration Dehydration can increase the risk of certain medical conditions: Urinary tract infections Kidney stones Gallstones Constipation Is It Possible To Drink Too Much Water? There is no Tolerable Upper Intake Level for water because the body can usually excrete extra water through urine or sweat. However, a condition called water toxicity is possible in rare cases, in which a large amount of fluids is taken in a short amount of time, which is faster than the kidney\u2019s ability to excrete it. This leads to a dangerous condition called hyponatremia in which blood levels of sodium fall too low as too much water is taken. The excess total body water dilutes blood sodium levels, which can cause symptoms like confusion, nausea, seizures, and muscle spasms. Who is most at risk for hyponatremia? Hyponatremia is usually only seen in ill people whose kidneys are not functioning properly or under conditions of extreme heat stress or prolonged strenuous exercise where the body cannot excrete the extra water. Very physically active people such as triathletes and marathon runners are at risk for this condition as they tend to drink large amounts of water, while simultaneously losing sodium through their sweat. Women and children are also more susceptible to hyponatremia because of their smaller body size. Healthy Hydration Tips Water is an excellent calorie-free, sugar-free choice. For some people who are accustomed to drinking sweet beverages, water can initially taste bland. To increase water consumption without losing flavor or to spice up your daily water intake, try these refreshing water-based beverages: Infused water Instead of purchasing expensive flavored waters in the grocery store, you can easily make your own at home. Try adding any of the following to a cold glass or pitcher of water: Sliced citrus fruits or zest (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit) Crushed fresh mint Peeled, sliced fresh ginger or sliced cucumber Crushed berries Sparkling water with a splash of juice Sparkling juices may have as many calories as sugary soda. Instead, make your own sparkling juice at home with 12 ounces of sparkling water and just an ounce or two of juice. For additional flavor, add sliced citrus or fresh herbs like mint. Ditch single-use plastic water bottles For the health of the planet, reconsider relying on single-use plastic water bottles and purchase a colorful 20-32 ounce refillable water thermos that is easy to wash and tote with you during the day. Are seltzers and other fizzy waters safe and healthy to drink? Water becomes bubbly through the process of carbonation and is sometimes suggested as a healthier alternative to soda. Carbonation involves dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water under high pressure; when the pressure is released, bubbles form. This process lowers the pH of water from 7 to 4, which is more acidic. The acid level has raised concerns that seltzer and soda water may harm dental enamel or bone health. However, research has not shown that carbonated beverages are associated with dental decay unless they also contain sugar or other sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup. Furthermore, studies have not found that carbonated beverages are associated with decreased bone mineral density; the culprit is more likely the high phosphorus content specific to dark cola soft drinks than the carbonation. BOTTOM LINE: Carbonated waters, if unsweetened, are safe to drink and a good beverage choice. They are not associated with health problems that are linked with sweetened, carbonated beverages like soda. However, while it is great to replace soda with carbonated water, for oral health, it should not be used as a replacement for water with fluoride.

They are brimming with antioxidants, flavonoids, and other biologically active substances that may be good for health. Coffee The takeaway on coffee: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE RESEARCH BEHIND COFFEE AND HEALTH Tea The takeaway on tea: Tea is the simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. Herbal teas are not made from the Camellia plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas. Animal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. [2] However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (130-140\u00b0 F). [2,3] Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea. So pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!

Because sweet \u201cdiet\u201d drinks may condition you to crave other sweet drinks and foods, drinking \u201cdiet\u201d drinks has the possibility of leading to weight gain. Moreover, the other health effects of artificially sweetened diet drinks remains largely unknown. It\u2019s best to limit them if you drink them at all, and for a refreshing drink with flavor try adding a squeeze of lemon juice to plain water. Learn more about artificial sweeteners. 100% Fruit Juice Fruit juice has vitamins, but it is high in calories from concentrated fruit sugars, so stick to no more than a small glass (four to six ounces) a day. If you\u2019re in the mood for fruit, enjoy a whole piece of fruit which is much lower in sugars than its juice equivalent and contains the added benefit of fiber. Milk There\u2019s no need to drink more than a glass or two of low fat or skim milk a day. Less milk is fine if you get your calcium from other sources. For children, milk is a key source of calcium and vitamin D, protein and other essential micronutrients. The ideal amount of milk and calcium isn\u2019t exactly clear, but no more than two glasses per day appears to provide sufficient nutrition without being excessive. Learn more about milk and other dairy products. Alcohol Moderate drinking can be healthy\u2014but not for everyone. You must weigh the benefits and risks; that\u2019s why it\u2019s not included on the Healthy Eating Plate. Non-drinkers shouldn\u2019t feel that they need to start drinking. Isn\u2019t alcohol supposed to be good for you in small amounts? For some people, alcohol consumption can offer health benefits, whereas for others alcohol may pose risks. Learn more about the risks and benefits of alcohol. Do some types of alcohol offer greater benefits than others? Some studies have suggested that red wine\u2014particularly when consumed with a meal\u2014offers more cardiovascular benefits than beer or spirits. Despite the healthful compounds identified in red wine, epidemiological studies have not confirmed that a specific type of alcoholic drink, whether wine, beer, or spirits, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

This includes soda, pop, cola, tonic, fruit punch, lemonade (and other \u201cades\u201d), sweetened powdered drinks, as well as sports and energy drinks. As a category, these beverages are the single largest source of calories and added sugar in the U.S. diet. [1,2] In other parts of the world, particularly developing countries, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3] How sweet is it? There are 4.2 grams of sugar in a single teaspoon. Now, imagine scooping up 7 to 10 teaspoons full of sugar and dumping it into your 12-ounce glass of water. Does that sound too sweet? You may be surprised to learn that\u2019s how much added sugar is in the typical can of soda. This can be a useful tip to visualize just how much sugar is in your drink. To get you started, we\u2019ve prepared a handy guide to the amount of sugar and calories in popular beverages. Aside from soda, energy drinks have as much sugar as soft drinks, enough caffeine to raise your blood pressure, and additives whose long-term health effects are unknown. For these reasons, it\u2019s best to skip energy drinks. The guide includes sports beverages as well. Although designed to give athletes carbohydrates, electrolytes, and fluid during high-intensity workouts that last one hour or more, for everyone else they\u2019re just another source of calories and sugar. Drinks naturally high in sugar like 100% fruit juices are also featured. While juice often contains healthful nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, it should also be limited as it contains just as much sugar (though from naturally occurring fruit sugars) and calories as soft drinks. Sugary Drinks and Health When it comes to ranking beverages best for our health, sugary drinks fall at the bottom of the list because they provide so many calories and virtually no other nutrients. People who drink sugary beverages do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food, and research indicates they also don\u2019t compensate for the high caloric content of these beverages by eating less food. [4] The average can of sugar-sweetened soda or fruit punch provides about 150 calories, almost all of them from added sugar. If you were to drink just one of these sugary drinks every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 5 pounds in a year. Beyond weight gain, routinely drinking these sugar-loaded beverages can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic diseases. Furthermore, higher consumption of sugary beverages has been linked with an increased risk of premature death. [5] Body weight and obesity Diabetes Heart disease Gout Bone health Liver cancer Mortality Sugary Drink Supersizing and the Obesity Epidemic There is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases. [29] Unfortunately, sugary beverages are a regular drink of choice for millions around the world, and a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. Compounding the problem is that sugary drink portion sizes have risen dramatically over the past 40 years, leading to increased consumption among children and adults: Before the 1950s, standard soft-drink bottles were 6.5 ounces. In the 1950s, soft-drink makers introduced larger sizes, including the 12-ounce can, which became widely available in 1960. [30] By the early 1990s, 20-ounce plastic bottles became the norm. [31] Today, contour-shaped plastic bottles are available in even larger sizes, such as 1-liter. In the 1970s, sugary drinks made up about 4% of U.S. daily calorie intake; by 2001, that had risen to about 9%. [32] Children and youth in the US averaged 224 calories per day from sugary beverages in 1999 to 2004\u2014nearly 11% of their daily calorie intake. [33] From 1989 to 2008, calories from sugary beverages increased by 60% in children ages 6 to 11, from 130 to 209 calories per day, and the percentage of children consuming them rose from 79% to 91%. [34] In 2005, sugary drinks (soda, energy, sports drinks) were the top calorie source in teens\u2019 diets (226 calories per day), beating out pizza (213 calories per day). [2] Although consumption of sugary drinks in the U.S. has decreased in the past decade, [35] half of the population consumes sugary drinks on a given day; 1 in 4 people get at least 200 calories from such drinks; and 5% get at least 567 calories\u2014equivalent to four cans of soda. [36] These intake levels exceed dietary recommendations for consuming no more than 10% of total daily calories from added sugar [37] Globally, and in developing countries in particular, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3] The Role of Sugary Drink Marketing Beverage companies spend billions of dollars marketing sugary drinks, yet generally rebuffs suggestions that its products and marketing tactics play any role in the obesity epidemic. [38] In 2013, Coca-Cola launched an \u201canti-obesity\u201d advertisement recognizing that sweetened soda and many other foods and drinks have contributed to the obesity epidemic. The company advertised its wide array of calorie-free beverages and encouraged individuals to take responsibility for their own drink choices and weight. Responses to the advertisement were mixed, with many experts calling it misleading and inaccurate in stating the health dangers of soda. Adding to the confusion, studies funded by the beverage industry are four to eight times more likely to show a finding favorable to industry than independently-funded studies. [39] It\u2019s also important to note that a significant portion of sugary drink marketing is typically aimed directly at children and adolescents. [40] A 2019 analysis by the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that kids ages 2-11 saw twice as many ads for sugary drinks than for other beverages, and they also saw four times as many ads for certain drinks than adults did. [41] Researchers also analyzed nearly 70 \u201cchildren\u2019s drinks\u201d (those marketed to parents and/or directly to children), and found that sweetened drinks contributed 62% of children\u2019s drink sales in 2018, including $1.2 billion in fruit drinks (90% of children\u2019s sweetened drink sales) and $146 million in flavored, sweetened water sales. Cutting Back on Sugary Drinks When it comes to our health, it\u2019s clear that sugary drinks should be avoided. There is a range of healthier beverages that can be consumed in their place, with water being the top option. Of course, if you\u2019re a frequent soda drinker, this is easier said than done. If it\u2019s the carbonation you like, give sparkling water a try. If the taste is too bland, try a naturally flavored sparkling water. If that\u2019s still too much of a jump, add a splash of juice, sliced citrus, or even some fresh herbs. You can do this with home-brewed tea as well, like this sparkling iced tea with lemon, cucumber, and mint. What about \u201cdiet\u201d sodas or other drinks with low-calorie sweeteners? Low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) are sweeteners that contain few to no calories but have a higher intensity of sweetness per gram than sweeteners with calories. These include artificial sweeteners, such as Aspartame and Sucralose, as well as extracts from plants like steviol glycosides and monk fruit. Beverages containing LCS sometimes carry the label \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201cdiet.\u201d The health effects of LCS are inconclusive, with research showing mixed findings. A 2018 scientific advisory by the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association noted that further research on the effects of LCS beverages on weight control, cardiometabolic risk factors, and risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases is needed. That said, they also note that for adults who are regular high consumers of sugary drinks, LCS beverages may be a useful temporary replacement strategy to reduce intake of sugary drinks. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE RESEARCH ON LCS IN FOODS AND BEVERAGES. Beyond the Individual Reducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels\u2014from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government. We must work together toward this worthy and urgent cause: alleviating the cost and the burden of chronic diseases associated with the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the U.S. and around the world. Fortunately, sugary drinks are a growing topic in policy discussions both nationally and internationally. Learn more about how different stakeholders can take action against sugary drinks.

(41,46,52-54,61) Taking Action Against Sugary Drinks Research shows that sugary drinks are one of the major determinants of obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence indicates that high consumption of sugary drinks increases the risk for heart disease, the number one killer of men and women in the U.S. Reducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels\u2014from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government. We must work together toward this worthy and urgent cause: alleviating the cost and the burden of chronic diseases associated with the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the United States. Here are steps that each of these groups can take to address the issue: Beverage manufacturers: Create beverages that have much less sugar. Beverage manufacturers can make it easier for everyone to drink more healthfully by creating beverages that are less sweet. A good target: Beverages that have no more than 1 gram of sugar per ounce, and are free of non-caloric sweeteners (such as sucralose, aspartame, or stevia). This is about 70 percent less sugar than a typical soft drink. We also encourage beverage manufacturers to offer smaller (8 ounce) single-serving bottles of sugary drinks, and encourage their sales channels to stock these smaller-sized bottles. If you read the fine print on the Nutrition Facts label, you\u2019ll see that a standard serving of soft drink is 8 ounces, and that each 20-ounce bottle contains 2.5 servings. Individuals: Make healthy drinking your personal priority. Start by choosing beverages with few or no calories. Water is best. You can also: Ask food companies to make sugar-reduced beverages, by calling their customer service numbers, or sending them a message on their Web site comment forms. Ask schools and workplaces to offer filtered water or functioning water fountains. Ask your local stores, schools, and workplaces to carry 8-ounce or 12-ounce containers of sugary drinks, to make it easier for you to choose a smaller serving. It is also wise to wean yourself off of artificial sweeteners because of the unanswered questions about the relationship between diet drinks and obesity. Food shoppers for the family: Don\u2019t stock sugary drinks at home. Nationwide data show that children and teens drink most of their sugary calories at home, so parents can help kids cut back by not stocking soda, fruit punch, or other sugary drinks in the house, and making them an occasional treat rather than a daily beverage. Schools and workplaces: Offer students and workers several healthy beverage choices. Healthy choices for school and workplaces include water and reduced-sugar beverages, as well as single-serving or 12-ounce containers. Schools and workplaces should also make sure that they have functioning water fountains or filtered water available. Government: Require better labeling on sugary drinks, and scrap sugar subsidies. The FDA should consider requiring companies to list the number of calories per bottle or can\u2014not per serving\u2014on the front of beverage containers. It should also consider creating a new labeling category for low-sugar beverages. Under current labeling regulations, a beverage can be marketed as \u201creduced sugar\u201d if it contains 25 percent fewer calories than the standard version of that beverage. (62) A better threshold for low sugar beverages would be 1 gram of sugar per ounce, which is about 70 percent less sugar than a typical soft drink. Sugar-added beverages with more than 50 calories in an 8-ounce serving should carry a warning label about obesity and diabetes. Government: Implement a soda tax. Sugared beverages are categorized as food under the food stamp program and thus not taxed in some states. Yale researcher Kelly Brownell makes a strong argument for taxing sugary drinks in the New England Journal of Medicine. (63) Since sugared beverages carry no nutritional value and pose health risks to a consumer, many public health advocates have argued that it is logical to tax them like cigarettes or alcohol. Government: Regulation of marketing to children. Regulating advertising of sugary drinks targeted towards children \u2013 a vulnerable population \u2013 through television, the internet or other media is an important strategy in reducing consumption. US Initiatives to Ban Sugary Beverages New York City In June of 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City proposed a ban on drinks sweetened with sugar that contain more than 25 calories per 8 fluid ounces. The ban would impact \u201csuper-sized\u201d sodas larger than 16 ounces. The mayor cited the staggering rates of obesity in his proposed ban. Many public health officials and health professionals supported the mayor on his bold stand against soda, a major contributor to obesity. Others, however, argued that individuals must take personal responsibility for their beverage choices and their health, and that regulation would be ineffective because large quantities of soda could still be purchased in a few small containers, and the soda ban would not impact all vendors. For example, since the ban would only apply to movie theaters, fast food establishments, and food trucks, a consumer could still purchase an oversized soda at any food mart or grocery store. Over the course of the summer and fall of 2012, the debate about Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban raged on. In July, protestors of the ban marched \u2013 many while sipping large sodas \u2013 in City Hall Park. New York City\u2019s Board of Health approved Bloomberg\u2019s plan, and the new rules were set to take effect in March of 2013, but in the meantime the beverage industry and many restaurant owners filed a lawsuit. The proposed law was subsequently struck down in court in March 2013, and Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s subsequent appeal was rejected by a state appeals courts on July 30, 2013. The large sugary drink ban and subsequent debate raises many important public health questions surrounding access to foods and drinks that have been proven to increase obesity and disease risk. Skeptics remain wary that bans such as Bloomberg\u2019s take away an individual\u2019s right to make personal diet related decisions. Some believe that taking away this right may actually backfire by drawing excess attention to unhealthy items like large sodas and spurring a purchasing spree before they are possibly taken away. Despite this opposition, there may be significant health benefits to limiting the sale of large sugary drinks. Sugar sweetened beverages are associated with obesity and many related health risks such as type 2 diabetes. New research also suggests that consuming sugar sweetened beverages also amplifies the genetic risk of obesity. We support bans like this because the obesity epidemic causes serious health consequences to individuals and places a large burden \u2013 both socially and economically \u2013 on aspects of our society such as healthcare. By limiting access to foods and drinks that have been proven to increase obesity and disease risk, individual consumers may be less likely to purchase these items and may instead shift towards healthier foods and drinks. Boston In a move to trim Boston\u2019s rising obesity rates, Mayor Thomas Menino banned the sale and advertising of sugary drinks from city-owned buildings and city-sponsored events. The executive order, signed in 2011, calls for city departments to phase out regular sodas, sports drinks, and other high-sugar beverages from their vending machines, cafeterias, and concessions. (64) In their place, the city will offer healthier beverage options\u2014among them, water, flavored seltzer, unsweetened coffee and tea, and diet drinks. Sugary drink marketing, from logos on vending machines to banners at events, will also be barred. Boston, which barred soda and junk food from public school vending machines in 2004, is not alone in its broader beverage ban effort. Boston\u2019s Carney Hospital also announced in 2011 that it would ban high sugar beverages from hospital grounds, making it the first hospital in the city to do so. (65) Cleveland Clinic banned high sugar drinks from its vending machines and cafeterias in August 2010. (66) San Francisco, (67) Los Angeles County, (68), and other cities have also curtailed sugary drink sales on municipal property. The goal of these bans is to make healthy drinks easy choices\u2014and to counter the billions of dollars beverage manufacturers spent each year on soft drink marketing. That\u2019s just the type of environmental support Americans need to curb their taste for sugar-loaded drinks, public health experts say\u2014and in turn, potentially curb the obesity epidemic. \u201cThere is abundant evidence that the huge increase in soda consumption in the past 40 years is the most important single factor behind America\u2019s obesity epidemic,\u201d says Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Dept. of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, who joined Mayor Menino at the soda ban\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese steps will greatly assist in creating a new social norm, in which healthier beverages are the preferred choice.\u201d The city has also unveiled a \u201ctraffic-light\u201d style promotional campaign to help consumers choose healthier beverages based on their sugar and nutrient content. The campaign, which groups beverages into \u201cred\u201d (limit), \u201cyellow\u201d (drink occasionally), and \u201cgreen\u201d (best choice) categories, is similar to the \u201cHow Sweet Is It\u201d beverage guidelines developed by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition in 2009.

[1] Some brands also contain B vitamins associated with increased energy (not to be confused with energy drinks, which are a different product entirely). Sports drinks contain carbohydrate in the form of sugar (e.g., glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose) or contain no sugar and are flavored instead with low-calorie sweeteners. The specific amount of sugar and electrolytes in sports drinks is intended to allow for quick hydration and absorption. This type of nutrient depletion generally occurs only with high-intensity exercise that lasts an hour or more. For the non-athlete, a sports beverage is just another sugary drink. Sports Drinks and Health Research has shown benefit of sports drinks in adult athletes (though not conclusive as some studies show no benefit), but research in children is lacking. [2] Children sweat at highly variable rates, so it is more difficult to establish an amount of exercise time that the drinks may be useful. [1] However, with monitoring by coaches or parents, providing these drinks to children and adolescents who are exercising vigorously for more than 60 minutes may help to prevent dehydration. For children who are engaged in routine or play-based physical activity, these drinks are usually unnecessary. [1] Estimates show that sports drinks comprise about 26% of total sugar-sweetened beverage intake in adolescents. [2] Sports drinks contain less sugar than soda and energy drinks, but still contain simple sugars. For example, a nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, compared with 21 grams of sugar in a popular sports drinks. Drinking too many of these, especially when not performing vigorous exercise, can increase the risk of overweight/obesity and other health problems such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout. There is also a risk of dental caries. A study following more than 4,100 females and 3,400 males for 7 years as part of the Growing Up Today Study II found that the more frequently sports beverages were consumed, the greater the association with an increased body mass index leading to overweight/obesity, especially in boys. [2] The authors cited endorsements of the drinks by sports celebrities as a strong influencer in young male athletes. The drinks may also be perceived as healthy because they are allowed to be sold in schools and sporting events, so may be consumed in excess. Bottom Line Water that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. A sports drink may be used by people engaging in exercise of vigorous intensity for more than one hour, especially if sweating heavily. Perhaps of greater importance in athletes of any age, but especially youth, is to encourage a balanced diet, snacks as needed, and adequate water that will best enhance physical and mental performance. Pediatricians should discuss the use of sports drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully.

Though sometimes confused with sports beverages, energy drinks are a different product entirely. They are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts of caffeine and as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee. Other substances purported to increase energy may be added, like B vitamins and herbs such as ginseng and guarana. Most concerning is a lack of regulation about the safety of these drinks, as well as aggressive marketing tactics geared toward adolescents. [1] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2007, 1,145 adolescents ages 12 to 17 went to the emergency room for an energy drink-related emergency. In 2011 that number climbed to 1,499. [2] After water, sugar is the main ingredient in energy drinks. A nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, 41 grams of sugar in an energy drink. Research has found that consuming high-sugar drinks of any kind can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout. Because of the amount of sugar and stimulant ingredients, there is concern that these beverages may not be helpful, and even worse, harmful to adolescents and people with certain health conditions. Energy Drinks and Health Sipping a beverage that offers quick energy may appeal to people who feel fatigued or who believe the caffeine can provide an edge when exercising or playing competitive sports. Although statements on the websites of energy drinks warn that these beverages may not be suitable for children, youth are among their largest consumers. An energy drink may be used by adolescents or college students cramming for exams through the night, or by a young athlete before an important game. While it is true that some controlled trials have shown temporary improved alertness and reversal of fatigue after taking energy drinks, as well as enhanced physical performance in young athletes, the majority of studies show an association with negative health effects. These include increased stress, aggressive behaviors like fighting, alcohol/cigarette abuse, increased blood pressure, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, poor sleep quality, and stomach irritation. [1] A typical energy drink may contain the following: carbonated water, around 40 grams of sugar (from sucrose and/or glucose), 160 mg or more of caffeine, artificial sweetener, and herbs/substances associated with mental alertness and performance but that lack scientific evidence with controlled trials (taurine, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartarate, guarana seed extract, B vitamins). Special concerns with energy drinks: Amplified negative health effects in adolescents. Children and teens may experience heightened effects from the high amounts of caffeine, added sugars including high fructose corn syrup, low-calorie sweeteners, and herbal stimulants, partly due to their smaller body size. [3] Marketing tactics towards youth. Estimates show more than a 240% increase in U.S. and worldwide sales of energy drinks. It is a $21 billion industry, with marketing campaigns targeting youth and being sold in places that are easily accessed by this age group. [1,4] Youth are exposed to energy drink advertising on children\u2019s websites, computer games, television, supermarkets, and sporting events. [5] Research has shown that adolescents lack maturity in key areas of the brain and are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior, making them vulnerable to risky behaviors sometimes portrayed in energy drink marketing. Youth are attracted to energy drinks due to effective marketing, influence from peers, and lack of knowledge about their potential harmful effects. [4] Negative health outcomes. Emerging evidence has linked energy drink consumption with negative health consequences in youth like risk-seeking behaviors, poor mental health, adverse cardiovascular effects, and metabolic, renal, or dental problems. [1] Excessive caffeine. Too much caffeine from any beverage, particularly when several are taken in one day in sensitive individuals, can lead to anxiety, insomnia, heart problems like irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure, and in rare cases seizures or cardiac arrest. Some energy drinks may contain as much as 500 mg per can (the amount in 14 cans of cola). [4.6] High sugar content. Because of the excessive sugar content in some energy drinks, they carry the same health risks associated with other sugar-sweetened beverages. See Sugary Drinks. Dangers with alcohol. A greater danger is introduced if energy drinks are combined with alcohol, a trend largely seen in underage drinkers and associated with binge drinking. Studies suggest that drinking this type of cocktail leads to a greater alcohol intake than if just drinking alcohol alone. This may be because energy drinks increase alertness that masks the signs of inebriation, leading one to believe they can consume even more alcohol. [1] In case reports, high consumption of energy drinks\u2014especially when mixed with alcohol\u2014has been linked to adverse cardiovascular, psychological, and neurologic events, including fatal events. [2] Lack of regulation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate energy drinks but enforces a caffeine limit of 71 mg per 12 ounces of soda; energy drinks typically contain about 120 mg per 12 ounces. However, energy drink manufacturers may choose to classify their product as a supplement to sidestep the caffeine limit. For companies that classify their energy drinks as beverages, the American Beverage Association published voluntary guidelines that advise accurate listings of caffeine content, restriction of marketing to children, and reporting of adverse events to the FDA. However, compliance to these guidelines has been found to be low. [1] Athletic performance. Caffeine is the primary ingredient in energy drinks shown in adults to enhance physical performance by increasing endurance and strength, improving reaction time, and delaying fatigue, though the effects are highly variable among persons. (6) These effects have not been studied in children and adolescents. There is a risk of caffeine abuse or toxicity in youth, so the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a limit of less than 100 mg caffeine daily for ages 12-18 years. [1] The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) issued a position statement on energy drinks after analyzing their safety and efficacy. (8) They concluded that consuming energy drinks 10-60 minutes before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance, and endurance in adults, largely through the effects of caffeine. However, other ingredients in these drinks require more study to demonstrate their safety and effects on performance. ISSN cautioned that higher-calorie energy drinks can lead to weight gain, and that their high glycemic load could negatively affect blood glucose and insulin levels. They discouraged use of energy drinks for children and adolescents unless under careful parental monitoring, and for people with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who could be negatively affected by the stimulant ingredients. The American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Nutrition and the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness encourage pediatric health care providers to discourage the use of and discuss potential health risks of stimulant ingredients in energy drinks with youth and parents, and to limit or avoid sugar-sweetened beverages of any kind in youth due to risk of excessive calorie intake and weight gain, as well as dental erosion. [7] Bottom Line Water that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. Energy drinks are a source of caffeine that people may choose as an alternative to coffee or tea. However, they also contain high amounts of sugar, vitamins, and herbs that may not be necessary for the average person. Energy drinks can pose a health risk in vulnerable groups including children, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with medical conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adults who choose to consume energy drinks should check the label for caffeine content and avoid high consumption (over 200 mg of caffeine per drink); consumption in combination with alcohol should be avoided. [9] Pediatricians should discuss the use of energy drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully.

Low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) are sweeteners that contain few to no calories but have a higher intensity of sweetness per gram than sweeteners with calories\u2014like table sugar, fruit juice concentrates, and corn syrups. Other names for LCS are non-nutritive sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, sugar substitutes, and high-intensity sweeteners. LCS are found in many beverages and foods like frozen desserts, yogurt, candies, baked goods, chewing gum, breakfast cereals, gelatins, and puddings. Foods and beverages containing LCS sometimes carry the label \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201cdiet.\u201d Some LCS can be used as general purpose sweeteners. Because LCS are many times sweeter than table sugar, they can be used in smaller amounts to achieve the same level of sweetness as sugar. People may use LCS in place of sugar to consume fewer calories or less sugar or to better control their blood glucose if they have diabetes or prediabetes. There are six LCS approved as food additives by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [1] Numerous studies have been conducted on each type to identify possible toxic effects. They are all sweeter than table sugar (sucrose) but contain few or no calories. They include: Low-Calorie Sweetener Brand Names\u2020 Sweetness as compared with sugar Acceptable Daily Intake* (maximum number of tabletop sweetener packets per day) Aspartame Equal\u00ae, NutraSweet\u00ae, Sugar Twin\u00ae 200 times sweeter than sugar 75** Acesulfame-K Sunett\u00ae, Sweet One\u00ae 200 times sweeter than sugar 23 Saccharin Sweet\u2019N Low\u00ae, Sweet Twin\u00ae, Necta Sweet\u00ae 200-700 times sweeter than sugar 45 Sucralose Splenda\u00ae 600 times sweeter than sugar 23 Neotame Newtame\u00ae 7,000-13,000 times sweeter than sugar 23 Advantame No brand names 20,000 times sweeter than sugar 4,920 *An Acceptable Daily Intake is the maximum amount of a substance that can be consumed daily over the course of a person\u2019s lifetime with no appreciable health risk, and is based on the highest intake that does not lead to observable adverse effects. Calculations are based on a 132 pound individual. **People with a rare hereditary disease known as phenylketonuria (PKU) have difficulty breaking down phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, and should limit their intake of phenylalanine from all sources, including aspartame. \u2020The inclusion of brand-names on this list is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands. Two other LCS are permitted for specific conditions of use in the food supply through the FDA\u2019s GRAS (\u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d) notification program: Certain Steviol Glycosides, which come from the South American Stevia plant, Stevia rebaudiana. Steviol glycosides are found in foods and beverages in the U.S. under the names Rebaudioside A (or Reb A), Stevioside, Rebaudioside D, or steviol glycoside mixtures that contain Rebaudioside A and/or Stevioside as the main ingredients. Commercial brand names include Truvia\u00ae and PureVia\u00ae. At 200-400 times sweeter than sugar, the Acceptable Daily Intake is 9 packets daily. Stevia leaf and unrefined stevia extracts are not considered GRAS and are not allowed in the U.S. for use as sweeteners. Monk Fruit, also known as luo han guo or Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle fruit extract (SGFE), comes from a plant native to Southern China. Monk fruit is 100-250 times sweeter than sugar. An Acceptable Daily Intake has not yet been determined. Sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols, or polyols, are not classified as LCS but have slightly less calories than table sugar. The sweetness of sugar alcohols varies from 25-100% as sweet as sugar. They do not promote tooth decay or cause sharp rises in blood glucose. Examples are sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol. They are found in sugar-free candies, cookies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. They are also used in toothpastes and medicines like cough syrups. In some people, eating high quantities of certain sugar alcohols can cause loose stools or diarrhea. They are absorbed slowly and may cause extra water to be drawn into the intestines. [2] With continued use, people may improve their tolerance. More research is needed on the longer-term use of sugar alcohols. An observational three-year study found an association between erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as stroke and heart attack, in patients with heart disease or risk factors for CVD (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure). [3] When comparing patients with the lowest and highest blood levels of erythritol, the latter had twice the risk of developing a CVD event. It is noted that the researchers only checked blood erythritol once at the start of the study. They further investigated with a separate lab study, and found that exposing human platelets to erythritol increased the risk of blood clot formation. Erythritol occurs naturally in small amounts in fruits, wine, and beer. But the amount of erythritol used as an additive in low-calorie beverages, ice cream, chewing gums, and candies is much higher. Low-Calorie Sweeteners and Health The health effects of LCS are inconclusive, with research showing mixed findings. Research is also looking at potential differences in effects from the various types of LCS. The following reviews research specific to LCS beverages. A large observational study of French women showed that both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and LCS beverages were linked with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [4] The authors noted that a high intake of SSBs has been associated with weight gain, possibly due to lower satiety and increased blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance. LCS beverages may also cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and a sweet preference in some people. With observational studies, it should be noted that the theory of reverse causation is also possible (for example, when people who are overweight or have prediabetes begin drinking LCS beverages to improve their blood sugar control, which produces a false association between higher LCS beverage intake and future risk of developing diabetes). Reverse causation may explain the finding from a meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies showing an 18% higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with SSBs and 25% higher incidence with LCS beverages, compared with no intake of these drinks. [5] In a detailed analysis of data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the positive association observed between LCS beverage intake and type 2 diabetes incidence was largely explained by higher baseline BMI and metabolic conditions, which might have led to increased use of LCS beverages in the first place. [6] In three large prospective cohort studies of U.S. men and women, intake of SSBs was associated with an average 3-pound weight gain within each 4-year time period. Substituting the same amount of SSBs with water or LCS beverages was associated with less weight gain (about 1 pound) within each 4-year time span. [7] For adults trying to wean themselves from sugary soda, diet soda is a possible short-term substitute, best used in small amounts over a short period of time. For children, the long-term effects of consuming LCS beverages are unknown, so it\u2019s best for kids to limit their intake. [8] Weight control Long-term observational studies show that regular consumption of LCS beverages reduces calorie intake and promotes less weight gain or weight maintenance, but other research shows no effect, and some studies even show weight gain. [9] Randomized controlled trials also show mixed findings, although most have shown a modest reduction in weight. [10] Most of these studies are short-term with a small number of participants, making it difficult to provide definitive conclusions on LCS beverages and weight control. Different comparisons among studies may also produce different results; for example, was LCS beverage intake being compared with SSBs, juice, or water? The human brain responds to sweetness with signals to eat more. By providing a sweet taste without any calories, however, LCS beverages may cause us to crave more sweet foods and drinks, which can add up to excess calories. Although hypothetical and not proven in human studies, research is actively looking at proposed mechanisms of LCS beverages that may affect appetite and weight: Do repeated exposures to the sweet taste of LCS promote a preference for sweets in the diet? Does the sweet taste of LCS stimulate an insulin response even though blood glucose does not change, leading to an increased appetite and food intake? If LCS beverages (as compared with SSBs) do not release hormones in the stomach that signal satisfaction, may a person increase their food intake due to hunger? Animal studies have shown that LCS can change gut microbiota, leading to weight gain and increased blood glucose levels. Would a similar effect be found in human studies? At the University of California-San Diego, researchers performed functional MRI scans as volunteers took small sips of water sweetened with sugar or sucralose. Sugar activated regions of the brain involved in food reward, while sucralose didn\u2019t. [11] It is possible, the authors say, that sucralose \u201cmay not fully satisfy a desire for natural caloric sweet ingestion.\u201d So, while sugar signals a positive feeling of reward, LCS may not be an effective way to manage a craving for sweets. LCS and cancer? Scientific advisory A 2011 statement from the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association concluded that when used judiciously, non-nutritive sweeteners (including low-calorie sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, and non-caloric sweeteners) might help with weight loss or control, and could also have beneficial metabolic effects. The statement also points out, however, that these potential benefits will not be fully realized if there is a compensatory increase in energy intake from other sources\u2014ultimately saying that at this time there is insufficient data to make a conclusive determination about using non-nutritive sweeteners; more research is needed. [18] The American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association followed this with a 2018 scientific advisory specific to LCS beverages and cardiometabolic health. [8] The report cited the decline in consumption of both SSBs and LCS beverages in the United States, suggesting that it is possible to reduce SSBs without necessarily increasing LCS beverage intake. The advisory outlined the following summary points: Children should not drink LCS beverages in the long-term because of unknown effects. If there is a potential increased risk in adults of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events with diet beverage intake, the risk could be heightened in a child due to their smaller body size and earlier exposure. For adults who are regular high consumers of SSBs, LCS beverages may be a useful temporary replacement strategy to reduce intake of SSBs. This may be particularly helpful for those who are used to a sweet-tasting beverage and for whom water, at least initially, is an undesirable option. Alternatives to LCS beverages and SSBs, such as plain, carbonated, or unsweetened flavored waters, should be encouraged for all. The potential benefits from LCS beverages as replacements for SSBs will not be fully realized if their use is offset by an increase in calorie intake from other foods or beverages. Additionally, an overall healthful dietary pattern is recommended. Further research on the effects of LCS beverages on weight control, cardiometabolic risk factors, and risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases is needed.

It flavors food and is used as a binder and stabilizer. It is also a food preservative, as bacteria can\u2019t thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The human body requires a small amount of sodium to conduct nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and maintain the proper balance of water and minerals. It is estimated that we need about 500 mg of sodium daily for these vital functions. But too much sodium in the diet can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. It can also cause calcium losses, some of which may be pulled from bone. Most Americans consume at least 1.5 teaspoons of salt per day, or about 3400 mg of sodium, which contains far more than our bodies need. Recommended Amounts The U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes state that there is not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance or a toxic level for sodium (aside from chronic disease risk). Because of this, a Tolerable Upper intake Level (UL) has not been established; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. Guidelines for Adequate Intakes (AI) of sodium were established based on the lowest levels of sodium intake used in randomized controlled trials that did not show a deficiency but that also allowed for an adequate intake of nutritious foods naturally containing sodium. For men and women 14 years of age and older and pregnant women, the AI is 1,500 milligrams a day. A Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) Intake has also been established, based on the evidence of benefit of a reduced sodium intake on the risk of cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Reducing sodium intakes below the CDRR is expected to lower the risk of chronic disease in the general healthy population. The CDRR lists 2,300 milligrams a day as the maximum amount to consume for chronic disease reduction for men and women 14 years of age and older and pregnant women. Most people in the U.S. consume more sodium than the AI or CDRR guidelines. [1] Types of Salt Finely ground salts are dense, so they tend to contain more sodium than coarser salts. Note that sodium content can vary widely among brands, so check the Nutrition Facts label for exact amounts. Type Approximate amount of sodium in 1 teaspoon Iodized table salt, fine 2,300 mg Kosher salt, coarse 1,920 mg Kosher salt, fine, Diamond Crystal\u00ae\u2020 1,120 mg Sea salt, fine 2,120 mg Sea salt, coarse 1,560 mg Pink (Himalayan) salt 2,200 mg Black salt 1,150-2,200 mg Fleur de sel 1,560-2,320 mg Potassium salt (salt substitute) 0 mg (contains 2,760-3,180 mg potassium) \u2020 The inclusion of brand-names on this list is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands. Sodium and Health In most people, the kidneys have trouble keeping up with excess sodium in the blood. As sodium accumulates, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium. This increases both the amount of fluid surrounding cells and the volume of blood in the bloodstream. Increased blood volume means more work for the heart and more pressure on blood vessels. Over time, the extra work and pressure can stiffen blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. It can also lead to heart failure. There is some evidence that too much salt can damage the heart, aorta, and kidneys without increasing blood pressure, and that it may be bad for bones, too. Learn more about the health risks and disease related to salt and sodium: Cardiovascular disease Chronic kidney disease Osteoporosis Cancer Food Sources Sodium isn\u2019t generally a nutrient that you need to look for; it finds you. Almost any unprocessed food like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, meats, and dairy foods is low in sodium. Most of the salt in our diets comes from commercially prepared foods, not from salt added to cooking at home or even from salt added at the table before eating. [1,18] According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the top 10 sources of sodium in our diets include: breads/rolls; pizza; sandwiches; cold cuts/cured meats; soups; burritos, tacos; savory snacks (chips, popcorn, pretzels, crackers); chicken; cheese; eggs, omelets. Are \u201cnatural\u201d salts healthier than table salt? Salt is harvested from salt mines or by evaporating ocean water. All types of salt are made of sodium chloride, and the nutrient content varies minimally. Although less processed salts contain small amounts of minerals, the amount is not enough to offer substantial nutritional benefit. Different salts are chosen mainly for flavor. The most widely used, table salt, is extracted from underground salt deposits. It is heavily processed to remove impurities, which may also remove trace minerals. It is then ground very fine. Iodine, a trace mineral, was added to salt in 1924 to prevent goiter and hypothyroidism, medical conditions caused by iodine deficiency. Table salt also often contains an anticaking agent such as calcium silicate to prevent clumps from forming. Kosher salt is a coarsely grained salt named for its use in traditional Kosher food preparation. Kosher salt does not typically contain iodine but may have an anti-caking agent. Sea salt is produced by evaporating ocean or sea water. It is also composed mostly of sodium chloride, but sometimes contains small amounts of minerals like potassium, zinc, and iron depending on where it was harvested. Because it is not highly refined and ground like table salt, it may appear coarser and darker with an uneven color, indicating the remaining impurities and nutrients. Unfortunately, some of these impurities can contain metals found in the ocean, like lead. The coarseness and granule size will vary by brand. Himalayan pink salt is harvested from mines in Pakistan. Its pink hue comes from small amounts of iron oxide. Similar to sea salt, it is less processed and refined and therefore the crystals appear larger and contain small amounts of minerals including iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Larger, coarser salt granules do not dissolve as easily or evenly in cooking, but offer a burst of flavor. They are best used sprinkled onto meats and vegetables before cooking or immediately after. They should not be used in baking recipes. Keep in mind that measurements of different salts are not always interchangeable in recipes. Generally, sea salt and table salt can be interchanged if the granule size is similar. However, table salt tends to have more concentrated, saltier flavor than kosher salt, so the substitution is one teaspoon of table salt for about 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of kosher salt depending on the brand. Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency A deficiency of sodium in the U.S. is rare because it is so commonly added to a wide variety of foods and occurs naturally in some foods. Hyponatremia is the term used to describe abnormally low amounts of sodium in the blood. This occurs mainly in older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities or hospitals who take medications or have health conditions that deplete the body of sodium, leading to hyponatremia. Excess vomiting, diarrhea, and sweating can also cause hyponatremia if salt is lost in these fluids that are expelled from the body. Sometimes too much fluid abnormally collecting in the body can lead to hyponatremia, which might stem from diseases such as heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In rare cases, simply drinking too much fluid can lead to hyponatremia if the kidneys can\u2019t excrete the excess water. Symptoms of hyponatremia can include: nausea, vomiting, headaches, altered mental state/confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma. Toxicity Too much sodium in the blood is called hypernatremia. This acute condition can happen in older adults who are mentally and physically impaired who do not eat or drink enough, or who are sick with a high fever, vomiting, or infection that causes severe dehydration. Excessive sweating or diuretic medications that deplete the body of water are other causes. When sodium accumulates in the blood, water is transferred out of cells and into the blood to dilute it. This fluid shift and a build-up of fluid in the brain can cause seizures, coma, or even death. Extra fluid collecting in the lungs can cause difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of hypernatremia can include: nausea, vomiting, weakness, loss of appetite, intense thirst, confusion, kidney damage. The interplay of sodium and potassium Sodium and potassium are closely interconnected but have opposite effects in the body. Both are essential nutrients that play key roles in maintaining physiological balance, and both have been linked to the risk of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease. High salt intake increases blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, while high potassium intake can help relax blood vessels and excrete sodium while decreasing blood pressure. Our bodies need far more potassium than sodium each day, but the typical U.S. diet is just the opposite: Americans average about 3,300 milligrams of sodium per day, about 75% of which comes from processed foods, while only getting about 2,900 milligrams of potassium each day. [19,20] A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that: People who ate high-sodium, low-potassium diets had a higher risk of dying from a heart attack or any cause. In this study, people with the highest sodium intakes had a 20% higher risk of death from any cause than people with the lowest sodium intakes. People with the highest potassium intakes had a 20% lower risk of dying than people with the lowest intakes. But what may be even more important for health is the relationship of sodium to potassium in the diet. People with the highest ratio of sodium to potassium in their diets had double the risk of dying of a heart attack than people with the lowest ratio, and they had a 50% higher risk of death from any cause. [21] People can make a key dietary change to help lower their risk: Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits, which are naturally high in potassium and low in sodium, but eat less bread, cheese, processed meat, and other processed foods that are high in sodium and low in potassium.

Childhood is an important time to focus on preventing the development of high blood pressure, but cutting back on salt and sodium can have a significant impact for people of all ages. Cut Back on Prepared Foods About 70% of the sodium Americans eat comes from processed, prepared foods such as crackers, cheese, and canned foods, and restaurant meals. [1] Even processed foods that don\u2019t taste \u201csalty\u201d\u2014like breakfast cereal\u2014can have surprisingly high sodium levels. Additionally, foods consumed numerous times a day, such as bread, can add up to higher sodium intake even though an individual serving is not high in sodium. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, top sources of sodium in the American diet include breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, fresh and processed chicken, soups, sandwiches, cheese, egg dishes, and packaged savory snacks. Prepared sauces, salad dressings, and gravies also tend to be high in sodium. Choosing foods with lower sodium doesn\u2019t mean losing flavor. Human taste buds aren\u2019t sensitive enough to notice a minor reduction in salt of about 30%, and for many types of foods, salt reductions of up to 30% won\u2019t taste noticeably different. This means that home cooks, professional chefs, and the food industry can make significant sodium reductions with minimal impact on flavor. Eat Smaller Portions of Salty Foods There\u2019s no need to completely eliminate favorite high-sodium foods or traditional cultural cuisines such as soy sauce (China), salted pickles and fish (Japan), or salty cheese and olives (Greece, Italy). Instead, it\u2019s best to enjoy such foods in smaller amounts. Discover Reduced or No-Sodium Alternatives Salt substitutes, including herbs and spices, and citrus like lemon can provide more flavor with less sodium. For example, citrus and sodium activate the same taste sensors so that less sodium can be used when they are combined. Explore your supermarket for low-sodium versions of traditional high-salt products, or experiment with new alternatives. The Food and Drug Administration requires a \u201clow-sodium\u201d labeled food to contain less than 140 mg per serving. However, in foods where salt is a key component, such as soy sauce or cold cuts, the best a manufacturer can do is reduce the amount. In this case, the label can say \u201cless sodium\u201d or \u201clower sodium\u201d although it may still be a high-sodium food. For example, one tablespoon of \u201cless-sodium\u201d soy sauce contains about 550 mg, as compared with 1,000 mg in the regular version. One serving of \u201clower-sodium\u201d deli turkey breast contains about 380 mg\u2014not much different from 450 mg in regular deli-sliced turkey. Sodium-free substitutes contain 100% potassium chloride, while \u201clite\u201d salts replace up to half of the table salt with potassium chloride. Potassium chloride (also called potassium salt) tastes much like sodium chloride, but it has a bitter aftertaste when heated so it is not recommended for cooking. However, check with your doctor before trying a potassium salt, because extra potassium can be dangerous for people who have trouble eliminating excess amounts or who are taking medications that can increase potassium levels in the bloodstream. This includes people with diabetes or kidney disease, those who have had a blocked urinary flow, or those taking a potassium-sparing diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. Cook Your Own Meals Instead of eating processed foods and restaurant meals, focus on cooking with fresh ingredients. Cooking with fresh unprocessed ingredients allows you to control the amount of salt (if any) you decide to add to your meals.

[1] This epidemic places a huge burden on the healthcare system and on our economy, estimated at $73.4 billion in direct and indirect costs for 2009 alone. [2] Researchers estimate that reducing the average daily sodium intake in the U.S. to 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) per day would prevent 11 million cases of hypertension and would save $18 billion in health care costs each year. [3] Another study estimates that cutting average daily sodium consumption by 1,200 milligrams (about \u00bd teaspoon of salt) would prevent up to 99,000 heart attacks and 66,000 strokes, and would save up to 92,000 lives a year. Researchers also estimated that such sodium reductions would save $24 billion in health costs [4]. Smaller cutbacks would save also save lives and be cost-effective, and this is true for developed countries as well, where excess salt is an even greater problem, could have a more substantial impact. Many players in the food industry have already taken the lead in reducing sodium, but broad-scale sodium reduction may also require action from the government and political sectors. Regulating the Amount of Salt in Prepared Foods Given that processed foods contribute to a large portion of people\u2019s sodium intake in the US and Europe, governments have started working with the food industry to lower sodium levels. US Initiatives Currently, there is no limit on the amount of sodium allowed in foods, because salt has long been considered to be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (or GRAS)\u2014a regulatory designation called into question by 40 years of research on the hazards of eating too much salt. A committee appointed by the Institute of Medicine recommended that the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate the amount of salt in commercially prepared food. The committee\u2019s report, Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States, released on April 20, 2010, urges the FDA to work with food companies to ratchet back the amount of salt consumed by Americans, 75 percent of which comes from commercially prepared foods. [5] The IOM is not recommending a ban on salt\u2014it is, after all, an essential part of the human diet \u2013 nor immediate changes. What the IOM report calls for is a gradual reduction in salt that would make the changes imperceptible to consumers\u2019 palates. This would entail having the FDA work with the food industry to set limits on the amount of salt in prepared food, with the limit lowering over time. The Washington Post quoted sources at the FDA saying that it could take ten years to phase in these changes. \u201cInvolving the FDA would help create and maintain a level playing field for food companies,\u201d says Dr. Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition and chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health. Salt is such an inexpensive ingredient that, if sodium limits were voluntary, it would be easy for food companies to make products stand out by boosting their salt content compared to those who were voluntarily reducing salt. \u201cRegulation by the FDA would make such end runs difficult and protect the responsible companies that are reducing the sodium content of their products,\u201d says Dr. Willett. 2021 update: FDA releases voluntary sodium-reduction goals The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released new voluntary guidance on October 13, 2021, encouraging the food industry to gradually reduce sodium in commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods over the next two and a half years\u2014with the aim of helping Americans reduce their average levels of sodium from 3,400 to 3,000 mg/day. Frank Sacks, professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, was the principal investigator in the landmark Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Sodium-Trial, which rigorously examined the effect of sodium intake on blood pressure, concluding that the relation is strong and causal. He recently spoke about the new FDA guidance, and offered tips for eating a lower-sodium diet without sacrificing taste. READ THE Q&A WITH DR. SACKS Other Key Recommendations: Updating food labels to match a Daily Value for sodium of 1,500 milligrams a day (instead of 2,300 milligrams). This would help consumers have a better idea of the level of salt in their foods\u2014and manufacturers would have more of an incentive to cut back on the amount of salt in their products. Launching a nationwide campaign to help consumers change their salt-consumption habits. Industry cutbacks in salt will help lower everyone\u2019s sodium intake, but consumers also need to do their part by choosing healthful foods. Although the recommendations come from the highly regarded Institute of Medicine\u2014an independent, nonprofit organization that provides evidence-based information and advice to the federal government and the public on matters of diet, health, and health care\u2014there is no guarantee that they will be put into practice. The salt industry has long resisted outside intervention and continues to argue that salt has little influence on blood pressure. New York City Encouragingly, some manufacturers have voluntarily agreed to cut back on sodium as part of New York City\u2019s National Salt Reduction Initiative. [6] The aim of this initiative is to guide a voluntary reduction of salt levels in packaged and restaurant foods, with the primary goal of cutting the salt in packaged and restaurant foods by 25% over five years \u2013 which would reduce the nation\u2019s salt intake by 20% and prevent thousands of deaths. International Initiatives Finland and the United Kingdom have led successful sodium reduction efforts. [7] In Finland, a government-led program of education, salt-labeling legislation, and pressure on the food industry has led to a 30 percent reduction in salt intake, from 12,000 milligrams a day to around 9,000 milligrams today. In the United Kingdom, a partnership between a scientific action group called Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH) and the U.K. Department of Health has led to a 20 to 30 percent reduction in the salt content of processed foods bought in supermarkets.

The amount of carbohydrate in the diet \u2013 high or low \u2013 is less important than the type of carbohydrate in the diet. For example, healthy, whole grains such as whole wheat bread, rye, barley and quinoa are better choices than highly refined white bread or French fries. (1) Many people are confused about carbohydrates, but keep in mind that it\u2019s more important to eat carbohydrates from healthy foods than to follow a strict diet limiting or counting the number of grams of carbohydrates consumed. What are Carbohydrates? Carbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods\u2014bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches. Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others: The healthiest sources of carbohydrates\u2014unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans\u2014promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients. Unhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods. These items contain easily digested carbohydrates that may contribute to weight gain, interfere with weight loss, and promote diabetes and heart disease. The Healthy Eating Plate recommends filling most of your plate with healthy carbohydrates \u2013 with vegetables (except potatoes) and fruits taking up about half of your plate, and whole grains filling up about one fourth of your plate. Try these tips for adding healthy carbohydrates to your diet: 1. Start the day with whole grains. Try a hot cereal, like steel cut or old fashioned oats (not instant oatmeal), or a cold cereal that lists a whole grain first on the ingredient list and is low in sugar. A good rule of thumb: Choose a cereal that has at least 4 grams of fiber and less than 8 grams of sugar per serving. 2. Use whole grain breads for lunch or snacks. Confused about how to find a whole-grain bread? Look for bread that lists as the first ingredient whole wheat, whole rye, or some other whole grain \u2014and even better, one that is made with only whole grains, such as 100 percent whole wheat bread. 3. Also look beyond the bread aisle. Whole wheat bread is often made with finely ground flour, and bread products are often high in sodium. Instead of bread, try a whole grain in salad form such as brown rice or quinoa. 4. Choose whole fruit instead of juice. An orange has two times as much fiber and half as much sugar as a 12-ounce glass of orange juice. 5. Pass on potatoes, and instead bring on the beans. Rather than fill up on potatoes \u2013 which have been found to promote weight gain \u2013 choose beans for an excellent source of slowly digested carbohydrates. Beans and other legumes such as chickpeas also provide a healthy dose of protein. References 1. Mozaffarian D, Hao T, Rimm EB, Willett WC, Hu FB.

As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that prompts cells to absorb blood sugar for energy or storage. As cells absorb blood sugar, levels in the bloodstream begin to fall. When this happens, the pancreas start making glucagon, a hormone that signals the liver to start releasing stored sugar. This interplay of insulin and glucagon ensure that cells throughout the body, and especially in the brain, have a steady supply of blood sugar. Carbohydrate metabolism is important in the development of type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body can\u2019t make enough insulin or can\u2019t properly use the insulin it makes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops gradually over a number of years, beginning when muscle and other cells stop responding to insulin. This condition, known as insulin resistance, causes blood sugar and insulin levels to stay high long after eating. Over time, the heavy demands made on the insulin-making cells wears them out, and insulin production eventually stops. Glycemic Index In the past, carbohydrates were commonly classified as being either \u201csimple\u201d or \u201ccomplex,\u201d and described as follows: Simple carbohydrates: These carbohydrates are composed of sugars (such as fructose and glucose) which have simple chemical structures composed of only one sugar (monosaccharides) or two sugars (disaccharides). Simple carbohydrates are easily and quickly utilized for energy by the body because of their simple chemical structure, often leading to a faster rise in blood sugar and insulin secretion from the pancreas \u2013 which can have negative health effects. Complex carbohydrates: These carbohydrates have more complex chemical structures, with three or more sugars linked together (known as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides). Many complex carbohydrate foods contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, and they take longer to digest \u2013 which means they have less of an immediate impact on blood sugar, causing it to rise more slowly. But other so called complex carbohydrate foods such as white bread and white potatoes contain mostly starch but little fiber or other beneficial nutrients. Dividing carbohydrates into simple and complex, however, does not account for the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar and chronic diseases. To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the glycemic index was developed and is considered a better way of categorizing carbohydrates, especially starchy foods. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 based on how quickly and how much they raise blood sugar levels after eating. Foods with a high glycemic index, like white bread, are rapidly digested and cause substantial fluctuations in blood sugar. Foods with a low glycemic index, like whole oats, are digested more slowly, prompting a more gradual rise in blood sugar. Low-glycemic foods have a rating of 55 or less, and foods rated 70-100 are considered high-glycemic foods. Medium-level foods have a glycemic index of 56-69. Eating many high-glycemic-index foods \u2013 which cause powerful spikes in blood sugar \u2013 can lead to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, (2) heart disease, (3), (4) and overweight, (5,6) (7). There is also preliminary work linking high-glycemic diets to age-related macular degeneration, (8) ovulatory infertility, (9) and colorectal cancer. (10) Foods with a low glycemic index have been shown to help control type 2 diabetes and improve weight loss. A 2014 review of studies researching carbohydrate quality and chronic disease risk showed that low-glycemic-index diets may offer anti-inflammatory benefits. (16) The University of Sydney in Australia maintains a searchable database of foods and their corresponding glycemic indices. Many factors can affect a food\u2019s glycemic index, including the following: Processing: Grains that have been milled and refined\u2014removing the bran and the germ\u2014have a higher glycemic index than minimally processed whole grains. Physical form: Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested than coarsely ground grain. This is why eating whole grains in their \u201cwhole form\u201d like brown rice or oats can be healthier than eating highly processed whole grain bread. Fiber content: High-fiber foods don\u2019t contain as much digestible carbohydrate, so it slows the rate of digestion and causes a more gradual and lower rise in blood sugar. (17) Ripeness: Ripe fruits and vegetables tend to have a higher glycemic index than un-ripened fruit. Fat content and acid content: Meals with fat or acid are converted more slowly into sugar. Numerous epidemiologic studies have shown a positive association between higher dietary glycemic index and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. However, the relationship between glycemic index and body weight is less well studied and remains controversial. Glycemic Load One thing that a food\u2019s glycemic index does not tell us is how much digestible carbohydrate \u2013 the total amount of carbohydrates excluding fiber \u2013 it delivers. That\u2019s why researchers developed a related way to classify foods that takes into account both the amount of carbohydrate in the food in relation to its impact on blood sugar levels. This measure is called the glycemic load. (11,12) A food\u2019s glycemic load is determined by multiplying its glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate the food contains. In general, a glycemic load of 20 or more is high, 11 to 19 is medium, and 10 or under is low. The glycemic load has been used to study whether or not high-glycemic load diets are associated with increased risks for type 2 diabetes risk and cardiac events. In a large meta-analysis of 24 prospective cohort studies, researchers concluded that people who consumed lower-glycemic load diets were at a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who ate a diet of higher-glycemic load foods. (13) A similar type of meta-analysis concluded that higher-glycemic load diets were also associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease events. (14) Here is a listing of low, medium, and high glycemic load foods. For good health, choose foods that have a low or medium glycemic load, and limit foods that have a high glycemic load. Low glycemic load (10 or under) Bran cereals Apple Orange Kidney beans Black beans Lentils Wheat tortilla Skim milk Cashews Peanuts Carrots Medium glycemic load (11-19) Pearled barley: 1 cup cooked Brown rice: 3/4 cup cooked Oatmeal: 1 cup cooked Bulgur: 3/4 cup cooked Rice cakes: 3 cakes Whole grain breads: 1 slice Whole-grain pasta: 1 1/4 cup cooked High glycemic load (20+) Baked potato French fries Refined breakfast cereal: 1 oz Sugar-sweetened beverages: 12 oz Candy bars: 1 2-oz bar or 3 mini bars Couscous: 1 cup cooked White basmati rice: 1 cup cooked White-flour pasta: 1 1/4 cup cooked (15) Here\u2019s a list of the glycemic index and glycemic load for the most common foods.

Achieving a healthy and sustainable food future is an urgent matter that depends on global collaborative efforts. What Is Sustainability, and What Does It Have To Do With Food? \u201cSustainability\u201d can be hard to define as it can mean different things based on the context in which it\u2019s discussed. However, the concept is much more than a trending buzzword. The most frequently quoted definition was put forth by the U.N.\u2019s Brundtland Commission on sustainable development in 1987: \u201cSustainable development [meets] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d [1] Jeffrey D. Sachs, an expert on sustainable development and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, wrote: \u201cLike all living species, humanity depends on nature for food and water, materials for survival, and safety from dire environmental threats, such as epidemics and natural catastrophes. Yet for a species that depends on the beneficence of nature, or on what the scientists call \u2018environmental services,\u2019 we are doing a poor job of protecting the physical basis of our very survival!\u201d [2] Indeed, sustainability encompasses the environment, economics, health, nutrition, and other related dimensions. This interconnectedness can be observed in the FAO\u2019s definition of sustainable diets: Sustainable Diets are those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources. [3] As we refer to it here, sustainability means the enactment of practices that fulfill the needs of society while protecting the physical basis of our long-term survival, our environment. We cannot have a secure food supply unless that food supply is sustainable. Why Is a Sustainable Food Supply Important? Today, more than three billion people are malnourished and many of our planet\u2019s 7 billion inhabitants eat diets low in quality. At the same time, the world\u2019s population is rapidly expanding, and it is estimated there will be close to 10 billion people on our planet by 2050. [4] When considering sustainable food development, the goal is to ensure a future when this expanded population has both enough food available to eat and access to high quality, nutritious foods. Thinking about a successful food future must focus on the earth system as a whole, rather than local levels. The \u201cAnthropocene\u201d is a term used to describe the current geological epoch, a time period defined by humanity being the dominating driver of change in atmospheric, geologic, hydrologic, biospheric and other earth systems. In other words, humanity\u2019s influence is at its greatest point in the history of our planet. The term \u201canthropogenic\u201d is an adjective that denotes \u201coriginating in human activity.\u201d In terms of anthropogenic activities, agriculture is the largest cause of global environmental change. Examples of global environmental change include climate change, deforestation, desertification, and damage to coastal reefs and marine ecosystems. Food production: Contributes approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the livestock sector alone represents almost half (14.5%) of these emissions [5, 6] Occupies about 40% of global land [7] Uses 70% of freshwater [8] Is the largest factor threatening species with extinction [9] Causes eutrophication (nutrient overload) and dead zones in lakes and coastal areas [10] Has led to a majority (~60%) of the world fish stocks to be fully fished or overfished (33%) \u2013 only 7% are underfished [11] Such global environmental change increases the risk of irreversible and catastrophic shifts in the Earth system marked by rising human mortality, morbidity, conflict, and food insecurity. [12] Agriculture in its current form is simultaneously a driver of global environmental change and a victim of shifting environmental conditions. [13] Without action, the world risks failing to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. Simply put: global food systems are not sustainable. We need to rethink how we eat and rethink the way we produce food in the process. Healthy Diets From Sustainable Food Systems Despite substantial scientific evidence linking diets with human health and environmental sustainability, historically there\u2019s been a lack of globally-agreed upon targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production. However, in 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission (a group of 37 scientists from 16 countries working in the fields of human health, nutrition, economics, agriculture, political sciences, and environmental sustainability) assessed existing evidence and developed global scientific targets that define a \u201csafe operating space\u201d for food systems. [14] These targets focus on two key areas that apply to all people and the planet: Target 1: Healthy diets Based on extensive research on foods, dietary patterns, and health outcomes, the Commission defines a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d with consumption ranges for each food group. Despite its name, this is not a specific diet but rather a flexible dietary pattern that largely consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils; includes a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry; and includes no or a low quantity of red meat, processed meat, added sugar, refined grains, and starchy vegetables. According to the Commission, global adoption of this pattern of eating would provide major health benefits, including a large reduction in total mortality. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PLANETARY HEALTH DIET AND HOW TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE Target 2: Sustainable food production With current food production driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and unsustainable changes in water and land use, the Commission also identifies a set of boundaries that global food production should stay within to \u201cdecrease the risk of irreversible and potentially catastrophic shifts in the Earth system.\u201d These boundaries relate to six key earth system processes: climate change (based on greenhouse gas emissions), land system change (based on cropland use), use of freshwater, biodiversity loss (based on extinction rate), and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling (based on the application of these fertilizers). A \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d Is Necessary Transitioning to a sustainable food system that can deliver healthy diets for an estimated 10 billion people by 2050 is an unprecedented challenge. However, the Commission emphasizes that \u201cdata are both sufficient and strong enough to warrant immediate action, and delay will increase the likelihood of serious, even disastrous, consequences.\u201d Fortunately, their analysis found this transition would be doable through a combination of substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns, dramatic reductions in food losses and waste, and major improvements in food production practices. Of course, such a \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d will not happen without widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action guided by scientific targets. To begin this process, the Commission proposes five strategies as general starting points for national, regional, city, and local change: Seek international and national commitment to shift toward healthy diets. Transitioning to a planetary health diet will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes must double. Policies are needed to improve the availability, access, and affordability of healthy foods while disincentivizing the consumption of unhealthy and unsustainable foods. Reorient agricultural priorities from producing high quantities of food to producing healthy food. Shift the emphasis in food and agricultural policy from high volumes of a few crops to greater diversity of nutrient-rich crops. Sustainably intensify food production to increase high-quality output. Use technology and system innovation to farm existing land with fewer inputs in order to experience better yields, sequester carbon, and conserve existing biodiversity and ecosystem services. Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans. Protect natural ecosystems and biodiversity by collectively acting, at local and global levels, to halt the expansion of agricultural land and harvested marine areas. At least halve food losses and waste, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Reduce food loss and waste in food production and consumption phases by 50% using a mix of technological solutions, consumer campaigns, and public policies. For more information and specifics on these strategies, read the Commission\u2019s full report, Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems. Or, read the Commission\u2019s briefs for cities, policymakers, farmers, food service professionals, healthcare professionals, and everyone. WATCH: Creating a sustainable and healthy food future This FORUM discussion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health explores how to avert dire consequences for human and planetary health through best practices and new technologies. Key questions were how to amplify nutritious food production, prevent waste and secure supplies, while protecting our environment in the process. VIEW THE RECORDED EVENT The Bottom Line Achieving a healthy and sustainable food system is an urgent matter that depends on collaborative efforts from governments, the private and public sectors, as well as individuals. Supply and demand work both ways\u2014a shift in the food production landscape depends on a shift in our diets. We must be aware that our food choices ultimately impact more than just ourselves, and primarily plant-based diets are best for both health outcomes and the environment. In the end, what\u2019s good for the planet is good for us too. Related Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment (C-CHANGE) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Key terms for understanding sustainable food systems Anthropocene: A proposed new geological epoch which is characterized by humanity being the dominating force of change on the planet. The Anthropocene began in the mid-20th century and continues through today. Planetary boundaries: Nine boundaries, each representing a system or process that is important for regulating and maintaining the stability of the planet. They define global biophysical limits that humanity should operate within to ensure a stable and resilient earth system\u2014ie, conditions that are necessary to foster prosperity for future generations. Earth system: Earth\u2019s interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes consisting of land, oceans, atmosphere, and poles, and includes earth\u2019s natural cycles\u2014 i.e., carbon, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other cycles. Life, including human society, is an integral part of the earth system and affects these natural cycles. Biodiversity: The diversity and richness of all living organisms on land and in water. Biodiversity contributes to the stability of ecosystems, enhances ecosystem services, and promotes the resilience of food production systems. Biosphere: All parts of the earth where life exists, including the lithosphere (solid surface layer), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The biosphere plays an important part in regulating the earth system by driving energy and nutrient flow between components. Boundaries: Thresholds set at the low end of the scientific uncertainty range that serve as guides for decision makers on acceptable levels of risk. Boundaries are baselines, unchanging, and not time-bound. Desertification: the process by which fertile land becomes desert, typically as a result of a drought, unsustainable agriculture, or land clearing. Eutrophication: the process by which a body of water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients that stimulate growth of aquatic plant life usually resulting in the depletion of dissolved oxygen. In agriculture, this can result from fertilizer runoff, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, into water bodies. Food system: All elements and activities that relate to production, processing, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food. Safe operating space for food systems: A space that is defined by scientific targets for human health and environmentally sustainable food production set by the EAT-Lancet Commission. [14] Operating within this space allows humanity to feed healthy diets to about 10 billion people within biophysical limits of the earth system. Great Food Transformation: The unprecedented range of actions taken by all food system sectors across all levels that aim to normalize healthy diets from sustainable food systems.

Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body\u2019s use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check. Children and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day. Great sources are whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts. Types of Fiber Fiber comes in two varieties, both beneficial to health: Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, chia seeds, nuts, beans, lentils, apples, and blueberries. Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include whole wheat products (especially wheat bran), quinoa, brown rice, legumes, leafy greens like kale, almonds, walnuts, seeds, and fruits with edible skins like pears and apples. Further defining fiber Under the umbrella terms of insoluble and soluble fibers, you may see fiber described in other ways. It can be viscous with a gel-like quality, or fermentable because it acts as food for gut bacteria that break down and ferment it. Fibers that are not broken down by bacteria, called nonfermentable, travel intact to the colon and can add bulk and weight to stool so it is easier to pass. These properties offer health benefits such as slowing down digestion, delaying blood sugar rises after meals, promoting healthy colonies of bacteria, or having a laxative effect. In addition, there are many subtypes of soluble and insoluble fibers, some of which occur naturally in plant foods and others that are synthetically made. The National Academy of Medicine defines fiber as: 1) dietary fibers (nondigestible carbohydrates and lignans) that occur naturally in plants, and 2) functional fibers that are extracted from plants or synthetically made and are nondigestible with a beneficial health effect in humans. [1] Some types of fiber fall into both categories, such as oligosaccharides and resistant starches that may be naturally occurring or synthetically made. Naturally occurring plant fibers: Cellulose, hemicellulose \u2013 Insoluble fiber found in cereal grains and the cell walls of many fruits and vegetables. It absorbs water and adds bulk to stool, which can have a laxative effect. Lignins \u2013 Insoluble fiber found in wheat and corn bran, nuts, flaxseeds, vegetables, and unripe bananas that triggers mucus secretion in the colon and adds bulk to stools. Has laxative effect. Beta-glucans \u2013 Soluble highly fermentable fiber found in oats and barley that is metabolized and fermented in the small intestine. Acts as a prebiotic. Can add bulk to stool but does not have a laxative effect. May help to normalize blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Guar gum \u2013 Soluble fermentable fiber isolated from seeds. Has a viscous gel texture and is often added to foods as a thickener. It is metabolized and fermented in the small intestine. Does not have a laxative effect. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Inulin, oligofructose, oligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides \u2013 Soluble fermentable fibers found in onions, chicory root, asparagus, and Jerusalem artichokes. May help to bulk stool with a laxative effect, normalize blood glucose, and act as a prebiotic. People with irritable bowel syndrome may be sensitive to these fibers that can cause bloating or stomach upset. Pectins \u2013 Soluble highly fermentable fiber found in apples, berries, and other fruits. Minimal bulking or laxative effect. Due to its gelling properties, it may slow digestion and help normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Resistant starch \u2013 Soluble fermentable fiber found in legumes, unripe bananas, cooked and cooled pasta, and potatoes that acts as a prebiotic. Adds bulk to stools but has minimal laxative effect. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Manufactured functional fibers, some of which are extracted and modified from natural plants: Psyllium \u2013 Soluble viscous nonfermentable fiber extracted from psyllium seeds that holds onto water and softens and bulks stools. Has laxative effect and is an ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives and high-fiber cereals. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Polydextrose and polyols \u2013 Soluble fiber made of glucose and sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. It can increase stool bulk and have a mild laxative effect. Minimal effect on blood sugar or cholesterol levels. It is a food additive used as a sweetener, to improve texture, maintain moisture, or to increase fiber content. Inulin, oligosaccharides, pectins, resistant starch, gums \u2013 Soluble fibers derived from plant foods as listed above, but are isolated or modified into a concentrated form that is added to foods or fiber supplements. Fiber and Disease Fiber appears to lower the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. Fiber\u2019s beneficial role in the gut microbiome may produce anti-inflammatory effects that alleviate the chronic inflammation associated with these conditions. [2] Heart disease Type 2 diabetes Breast cancer Colorectal cancer Constipation Diverticular disease Should I avoid nuts and seeds with diverticulosis? If you have diverticulosis, chances are you\u2019ve heard that maybe you should avoid certain foods with small hard-to-digest particles: nuts, seeds, popcorn, corn, and fruits and vegetables with seeds like raspberries, strawberries, cucumber, or tomatoes. The reasoning is that these small undigested food particles might become trapped in the diverticular pouches and become inflamed from bacterial infection, causing the uncomfortable condition called diverticulitis. People who have experienced intense symptoms of diverticulitis often change their diets to avoid these foods in hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, evidence has shown this practice to be more of an urban legend than helping to reduce recurrences, and can deter people from eating foods that may actually help their condition in the future. Although the role of diet with diverticular disease has long been debated, a high-fiber intake with a focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables has been found to have a strong association with decreased risk of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. [18] When it comes to nuts and popcorn, research following more than 47,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study actually found a lower risk of diverticulitis when eating these foods. [25] Including these foods also did not increase the risk of developing new diverticulosis or diverticular complications. Bottom Line There are many types of dietary fibers that come from a range of plant foods. It\u2019s important to not hyperfocus on a particular fiber because of its specific proposed action, as each type offers some level of health benefit. Therefore, eating a wide variety of plant foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to reach the fiber recommendation of 25-35 grams daily best ensures reaping those benefits. Some tips for increasing fiber intake: Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices. Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with minimally processed brown rice and other whole grains like barley, millet, amaranth, farro, and Add high-fiber foods to current meals: 1-2 tablespoons of almonds, ground flaxseeds, or chia seeds to cereals; diced vegetables to casseroles, stir-fried dishes, and soups. For breakfast, choose cereals that have a whole grain as their first ingredient. Another tip is to look on the Nutrition Facts label and choose cereals with 20% or higher of the Daily Value (DV) for fiber. Snack on crunchy raw vegetables or a handful of almonds instead of chips and crackers. Substitute beans or legumes for meat two to three times a week in chili and soups. If it is difficult to eat enough fiber through food, a fiber supplement such as psyllium or methylcellulose powders or wafers can be used. They can help bulk and soften stool so it is easier to pass. However, fiber supplements are not intended to completely replace high-fiber foods.

That\u2019s why the Healthy Eating Pyramid says sugary drinks and sweets should be used sparingly, if at all, and the Healthy Eating Plate does not include foods with added sugars. 4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoon Keep this tip in mind when reading nutrition labels to better visualize just how much added sugar the product contains. For example, one 12-ounce can of cola contains 39 grams\u2013almost 10 teaspoons of sugar! The average American adult, teenager, and child consumes about 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, or about 270 calories. [1] While we sometimes add sugar or sweeteners like honey to food or beverages, most added sugar comes from processed and prepared foods. The leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks like ice cream, pastries, and cookies. [1] Less obvious yet significant contributors are breakfast cereals and yogurt. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 advise that all Americans 2 years and older limit added sugars in the diet to less than 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie/day diet, that translates into 200 calories or 50 grams of sugar daily (about 12 teaspoons of sugar). Toddlers and infants younger than 2 years should not be given solids or beverages with any added sugars. [1] The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that Americans drastically cut back on added sugar to help slow the obesity and heart disease epidemics. [2] The AHA suggests a stricter added-sugar limit of no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) for most adult women and no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar) for most men. The AHA also recommends a lower daily limit of added sugars for children ages 2-18 to less than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams per day, and sugary beverages should be limited to no more than 8 ounces a week. [3] For more info, visit Healthy kids \u2018sweet enough\u2019 without added sugars. Spotting sugar on a food label Spotting added sugars in processed foods is easier since the rollout of the updated Nutrition Facts label. Previously, food and beverage manufacturers in the U.S. were required to list a product\u2019s total amount of sugar per serving on the label, but did not need to disclose how much of that was from added sugars versus naturally occurring. This was confusing for foods such as plain unsweetened milk or yogurt that listed 12 grams or more of \u201cSugars,\u201d but all of which was naturally occurring lactose sugar. Lactose does not impact blood glucose or carry the same health risks as white \u201ctable\u201d sugar and other caloric sweeteners. The updated Nutrition Facts label now lists both \u201cTotal Sugars\u201d and underneath \u201cAdded Sugars.\u201d The percent Daily Value (DV) for added sugars is based on the recommended limit from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans of less than 50 grams a day (about 12 teaspoons) for an average 2,000 calorie diet. The percent DV will vary: a lower amount for a lower-calorie diet, and higher for a higher-calorie diet. The DV can be an easy way to compare food products for added sugars: 5% DV or less of added sugars per serving is considered low 20% DV or more of added sugars per serving is considered high Ingredient list Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, so where sugar is listed in relation to other ingredients can indicate how much sugar a particular food contains. Added sugars go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories. Food makers can also use sweeteners that aren\u2019t technically sugar\u2014a term which is applied only to table sugar, or sucrose\u2014but these other sweeteners are in fact forms of added sugar. Below are some other names for sugar that you may see on food labels: Agave nectar Dextrose Maltose Brown sugar Evaporated cane juice Malt syrup Cane crystals Fructose Maple syrup Cane sugar Fruit juice concentrates Molasses Coconut sugar Glucose Raw sugar Corn sweetener High-fructose corn syrup Sucrose Corn syrup Honey Syrup Crystalline fructose Invert sugar Key Sources of Added Sugar Sugary drinks Sugary drinks are a prime source of extra calories that can contribute to weight gain and provide no nutritional benefits. Studies indicate that liquid carbohydrates such as sugar-sweetened beverages are less filling than solid food, causing people to continue to feel hungry after drinking them despite their high calories. [4] They are coming under scrutiny for their contributions to the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. [5] The average 20-ounce bottle of sugar-sweetened soda, lemonade, or iced tea contains about 65 grams of added sugar, often from high-fructose corn syrup. That\u2019s the equivalent of 16 teaspoons of table sugar. If you were to drink just one 12-ounce can of a sugar-sweetened soft drink every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 15 pounds over three years. [6] Be careful to read serving sizes of bottled beverages. Many are sold in 20-ounce bottles, but what is considered one serving of that beverage may still vary among manufactures. For example, a popular cola drink may list the whole 20-ounce bottle as one serving containing 65 grams of added sugar. Another 20-ounce bottle of lemonade may seem a better choice, showing only 27 grams of added sugar per serving\u2014but the label states that one bottle contains 2.5 servings! Therefore, guzzling the whole bottle would give you almost 68 grams of sugar. To reduce some confusion, the updated Nutrition Facts label mandates that manufacturers list serving sizes based on what people typically consume, rather than how much they should consume. The \u201ctypical\u201d beverage serving is now considered 12 ounces (increased from 8 ounces), so hopefully in the near future all beverage labels will list the same standard serving size. Cereals and other foods Choosing minimally processed breakfast foods\u2014such as whole grain toast with nut butter, or a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned oatmeal\u2014that don\u2019t have lengthy ingredient lists is a great way to avoid added sugars. Unfortunately, many common breakfast foods such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, cereal bars, instant oatmeal with added flavoring, and pastries can contain high amounts of added sugars. Some ingredient lists mask the amount of sugar in a product. To avoid having \u201csugar\u201d as the first ingredient, food manufacturers may use multiple forms of sugar\u2014each with a different name\u2014and list each one individually on the nutrient label. But don\u2019t be fooled; your body metabolizes all added sugars the same way as it doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cbrown sugar,\u201d \u201cmolasses,\u201d \u201choney,\u201d and other caloric sweeteners. When reading a label, make sure to spot all sources of added sugars even if they\u2019re not listed as the first few ingredients. Also be careful of foods that wear a \u201chealth halo.\u201d For example, one popular cereal advertises that it contains whole grains, fiber, and several antioxidant vitamins like C, E, and beta-carotene. But it also contains 18 grams of added sugar (4.5 teaspoons) in just one small bowl. Keep in mind serving sizes as well. A crunchy granola bar may contain two bars per pack; just one provides 6 grams of added sugar but if the whole pack is eaten, that number doubles to 12 grams. So you can see how added sugars may add up quickly! Bottom Line The body does not need carbohydrates from added sugars to function. A good rule of thumb is to avoid products that have a lot of added sugar, including skipping foods that list \u201csugar\u201d as the first or second ingredient. However, the products may use a variety of sweeteners so be sure to scan the full ingredient list. Fortunately, the updated Nutrition Facts label in the U.S. now features a separate line for \u201cadded sugar\u201d so it easier to know just how much is added versus naturally occurring. Some tips for reducing added sugar intake: Choose plain yogurt with no added sugar and stir in fresh or frozen fruit or unsweetened applesauce and a dash of cinnamon. Choose cereals with 5% of the Daily Value or less of added sugars and add sliced ripe banana or berries. Choose water, seltzer, herbal tea, coffee and other beverages with no added sugar. Add a slice of orange, lemon, lime, or cucumber for a subtle flavor boost. When a sweets craving hits, try one of these first: 1/4 cup of unsweetened dried fruit; 1 cup of ripe fresh fruit; or a 1-ounce square of 75% dark chocolate. When baking, reduce the amount of added sugar by 1/4-1/3 cup. Or reduce the sugar by substituting half the amount with unsweetened applesauce or mashed ripe banana; for example, instead of 1 cup of sugar, use \u00bd cup sugar and \u00bd cup mashed fruit. If you choose to enjoy a favorite treat high in sugar, practice eating a smaller portion than usual. Enjoy it fully by chewing slowly and savoring it. Your taste buds can adjust to sweetness levels! As you consistently reduce your total sugar intake, you may notice your sweets cravings lessen or that certain foods now taste too sweet.

But fat is an important source of stored energy when we can\u2019t get to food for an extended time. Within the matrix of body fat, also called adipose tissue, there is not only fat cells but nerve and immune cells and connective tissue. [2] Fat tissue releases hormones that control metabolism and appetite (i.e., leptin, adiponectin) and that affect insulin sensitivity (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6). Macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils are some of the immune cells found in fat tissue that play a role in inflammation\u2014both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory. Fat cells also secrete proteins and build enzymes involved with immune function and the creation of steroid hormones. Fat cells can grow in size and number. The amount of fat cells in our bodies is determined soon after birth and during adolescence, and tends to be stable throughout adulthood if weight remains fairly stable. [3] But eating too many calories in the long-term can cause fat cells to increase in size and be stored in various areas throughout the body, which leads to a risk of chronic inflammation and glitches in healthy metabolism, with the potential for new fat cells to grow. These larger fat cells become resistant to insulin, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can reduce the size of fat cells but not the number. Obesity, defined as an excessive amount of body fat, is a common and expensive medical condition in the U.S., strongly associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, as well as premature deaths from these diseases. [1] Learning about the actions and different types of body fat may increase understanding of this condition. Types of Body Fat Fat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. [2] Some are necessary for good health. Types Brown fat \u2013 Infants carry the most brown fat, which keeps them warm. It is stimulated by cold temperatures to generate heat. The amount of brown fat does not change with increased calorie intake, and those who have overweight or obesity tend to carry less brown fat than lean persons. White fat \u2013 These large round cells are the most abundant type and are designed for fat storage, accumulating in the belly, thighs, and hips. They secrete more than 50 types of hormones, enzymes, and growth factors including leptin and adiponectin, which helps the liver and muscles respond better to insulin (a blood sugar regulator). But if there are excessive white cells, these hormones are disrupted and can cause the opposite effect of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Beige fat \u2013 This type of white fat can be converted to perform similar traits as brown fat, such as being able to generate heat with exposure to cold temperatures or during exercise. Pink fat \u2013 This type of white fat is converted to pink during pregnancy and lactation, producing and secreting breast milk. Essential fat \u2013 This type may be made up of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally. It is found in most organs, muscles, and the central nervous system including the brain. It helps to regulate hormones like estrogen, insulin, cortisol, and leptin; control body temperature; and assist in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. When a person\u2019s body fat dips below a certain level (about less than 5% in men and less than 10% in women), there may not be enough essential fat to perform these functions. Location Subcutaneous \u2013 You can pinch this layer of fat that sits directly underneath the skin\u2019s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It\u2019s the body\u2019s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs. Very high amounts of subcutaneous fat can increase the risk of disease, though not as significantly as visceral fat. Visceral \u2013 An excess of this type of white fat is sometimes referred to as \u201cbelly fat\u201d or \u201ccentral obesity,\u201d as it accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart. Having a lot of visceral fat is linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It may secrete inflammatory chemicals called cytokines that promote insulin resistance. How do I get rid of belly fat? It\u2019s a popular question by both men and women. Unfortunately, doing extra sit-ups or drinking apple cider vinegar won\u2019t help spot-tone this stubborn area. Losing weight can help, though people tend to lose weight pretty uniformly throughout the body rather than in one place. However, a long-term commitment to following exercise guidelines along with eating balanced portion-controlled meals can help to reduce dangerous visceral fat. Also effective is avoiding sugary beverages that are strongly associated with excessive weight gain in children and adults. And don\u2019t discount other lifestyle factors such as poor sleep and elevated cortisol levels from chronic stress that are both strongly associated with increased belly fat and weight gain. Learn more about maintaining a healthy weight. Measuring Body Fat Obesity, or body fatness, is calculated with various methods that range in accuracy and have limitations. Combining two or more methods, if possible, may better predict if someone has increased health risks related to weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) Why use BMI? One of the most widely used tools for estimating excess fat is the body mass index (BMI). BMI only measures excess weight, calculating a ratio of one\u2019s weight to height. [4] However, research has shown that BMI often correlates with \u201cgold standard\u201d direct measures of fat mass and fat-free mass such as underwater weighing (hydrostatic weighing) and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). In comparison with these methods that require expensive equipment, BMI is noninvasive, easy to calculate, and can be used anywhere. Because of its simplicity and widespread use, BMI is often used when studying populations. Researchers can compare the BMI of groups of people over time in different areas, to screen for obesity and its related health risks. BMI does have several limitations. It can\u2019t measure location of fat (e.g., belly fat is linked with greater health risks), muscle mass, or bone mass\u2014all of which contribute to weight. One\u2019s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI. [4] For example, when comparing two people with the same BMI: Women genetically have more body fat and less muscle mass than men. Highly trained athletes may have a high BMI from increased muscle mass but little body fat. Older adults tend to carry more body fat than younger adults. While BMI and weight tend to decline in the elderly, visceral abdominal fat may continue to increase. [5] Men and women with larger body frames may have a higher weight from greater (heavier) bone mass rather than fat mass. Some studies have found that Black individuals have less body fat and more lean muscle than other ethnicities at the same BMI. However, Blacks and Hispanics have the highest rates of obesity in the U.S., so the overall burden of obesity-related diseases is still higher in these groups. For these reasons, BMI might be used as a screening tool for potential weight-related problems rather than to diagnose certain conditions. The accuracy of BMI in predicting health risk may vary across different individuals and racial and ethnic groups. Some populations have higher rates of obesity but that do not have corresponding rates of metabolic diseases like diabetes, and vice versa. [3] For instance, Southeast Asians can have a normal BMI but be metabolically unhealthy. BMI might be supplemented with other measures such as waist circumference or waist-hip ratio that better assess fat distribution. How to determine BMI Divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches. Divide the answer by your height in inches. Multiply the answer by 703. You can also use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\u2019s online BMI calculator or simple BMI tables. Interpreting the BMI number The World Health Organization defines a \u201cnormal\u201d weight as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, \u201coverweight or pre-obesity\u201d as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, and \u201cobesity\u201d as a BMI of 30 or higher. It further classifies levels of obesity as Class I (BMI 30.0 to 34.9), Class II (BMI 35.0 to 39.9), and Class III (BMI 40 or higher). (6) At a population level, a high BMI is generally associated with an increased risk of disease and early death. Many studies have shown that a BMI above 25 increases the chances of dying early compared to those with normal weight: A meta-analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a clear relationship between BMI and mortality, where both people with underweight (BMI <18.5) and with overweight and obesity (BMI >25) had greater mortality. [7] The lowest death rate from any cause was associated with the BMI range between 22.5 and 24.9. To address some methodological flaws in previous studies, this study excluded smokers who tend to have lower weight due to smoking, individuals with cancer and heart disease who might have lost weight due to these conditions, and individuals over the age of 85 who could have a normal BMI but suffer from frailty or other age-related unhealthy weight loss. Another large meta-analysis in The Lancet that looked at data across four continents found that for every five units higher of a BMI above 25, risk of premature death increased by about 31%. [8] The study also looked at specific causes of death, and found that for each 5-unit increase in BMI above 25, the corresponding increases in risk were 49% for cardiovascular mortality, 38% for respiratory disease mortality, and 19% for cancer mortality. This meta-analysis also excluded participants who were current or former smokers, those who had chronic diseases at the beginning of the study, and any who died in the first five years of follow-up (a combined 1.6 million deaths were recorded across these studies where participants were followed for an average of 14 years). When examining the relationship between BMI and mortality, failure to adjust for these variables can lead to reverse causation (where a low body weight is the result of underlying illness, rather than the cause) or confounding by smoking (because smokers tend to weigh less than non-smokers and have much higher mortality rates). Experts say these methodological flaws have led to paradoxical, misleading results that suggest a survival advantage to being overweight. Waist Circumference Some researchers consider waist circumference to be a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance. [3,9] It is a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality, and provides a clearer picture of health, as abdominal fat can increase even if total weight remains the same. An increasing waist size can be an important \u201cwarning sign\u201d that prompts a closer look at potentially unhealthy lifestyle habits. In people who do not have overweight, increasing waist size over time may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI alone. [5,10] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study looked at the relationship between waist size and death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause in middle-aged women. [10] At the start of the study, more than 44,000 healthy volunteers measured their waist and hip sizes. After 16 years, women who reported the highest waist sizes\u201435 inches or larger\u2014had nearly double the risk of dying from heart disease, compared with women who reported the lowest waist sizes (<28 inches). Women in the group with the largest waists had a similarly high risk of death from cancer or any cause, compared with women with the smallest waists. The risks increased steadily with each additional inch around the waist. Yet even women with a \u201cnormal weight\u201d (BMI <25) were at higher risk, if they carried more of that weight around their waist. Normal-weight women with a waist of 35 inches or higher had three times the risk of death from heart disease, compared with normal-weight women whose waists were smaller than 35 inches. The Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study found a similar relationship between increasing waist size and risk of death from any cause in normal-weight women. [11] How to measure and interpret waist size Wear thin clothing or no clothing. Stand up straight and wrap a flexible measuring tape around your midsection, laying the tape flat so it crosses your navel (belly button). The tape should be snug but not pinched too tightly around the waist. Inhale and exhale regularly, and then read the measurement (in other words, don\u2019t inhale deeply and hold your breath while measuring!). You can repeat the measurement 2-3 times to ensure a consistent reading. According to an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health, a waist size larger than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women increases the chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases. [12,13] Waist-to-Hip Ratio Like the waist circumference, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is used to measure abdominal obesity. It\u2019s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement. It is inexpensive and simple to use, and a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality. Some believe that WHR may be a better indicator of risk than waist circumference alone, as waist size can vary based on body frame size, but a large study found that waist circumference and WHR were equally effective at predicting risk of death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause. [10] Still, WHR can be more complex to interpret than waist circumference, since a higher WHR reading can be caused by excess abdominal fat and/or decreased lean muscle mass around the hips. The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity. For example, Asians appear to show higher metabolic risk when carrying higher body fat at a lower BMI; therefore the cut-off value for a healthy WHR in Asian women is 0.80 or less, compared with 0.85 or less in Caucasian women. [14] How to measure and interpret WHR Stand up straight and follow the directions for measuring waist circumference. Then wrap the tape measure around the widest part of the buttocks. Divide the waist size by the hip size. The WHO defines abdominal obesity in men as a WHR more than 0.90; for women, more than 0.85. [14] Waist-to-Height Ratio Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a simple, inexpensive screening tool that measures visceral abdominal fat. It has been supported by research to predict cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, and early death, even when BMI falls within a healthy range. [15,16] When the waist circumference is less than half one\u2019s height, it is considered lower risk. To determine WHtR, divide waist circumference in inches by height in inches. A measurement of 0.5 or higher is an indicator of health risks related to visceral obesity. Additional Measures of Body Fat Although less commonly used, here are some other methods for measuring body fat. Skinfold Thickness Bioelectric Impedance (BIA) Underwater Weighing (Densitometry or Hydrostatic Weighing) Air-Displacement Plethysmography Dilution Method (Hydrometry) Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Is it healthier to carry excess weight than being too thin? It\u2019s certainly possible to be dangerously thin. Individuals with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia\u2014and those with wasting diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and heart failure\u2014can lose so much weight that they don\u2019t have enough energy or basic building blocks to keep themselves alive. What about people who are thin but don\u2019t have an eating disorder or serious illness? Some studies suggest that the connection between body mass index and premature death follows a U-shaped curve. This means that weighing too much\u2014or too little\u2014isn\u2019t as healthy as weighing somewhere in the middle. The problem is that most of these studies included smokers and individuals with early, but undetected, chronic and fatal diseases. Cigarette smokers as a group weigh less than nonsmokers, in part because smoking deadens the appetite. Potentially deadly chronic diseases such as cancer, emphysema, kidney failure, and heart failure can cause weight loss even before they cause symptoms and have been diagnosed. So low weights don\u2019t necessarily cause early death. Instead, low weight is often the result of illnesses or habits that may be fatal. Many epidemiologic studies confirm that increasing weight is associated with increasing disease risk. The American Cancer Society fielded two large long-term Cancer Prevention Studies that included more than one million adults who were followed for at least 12 years. [18,19] They excluded people who smoked and others who could experience secondary weight loss from an illness such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, or who developed a chronic disease in the first few years of follow-up. Both studies showed a clear pattern of increasing mortality with increasing weight. The data confirmed similar observations from a 27-year follow-up of more than 19,000 middle-aged men in the Harvard Alumni Health Study, [20] a 16-year follow-up of more than 115,000 middle-aged women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, [21] a 12-year follow-up of nonsmoking Seventh-day Adventists, [22] and a 10-year follow-up of more than 500,000 middle-aged men and women in the National Institutes of Health/AARP study. [23] Another analysis of the Cancer Prevention Study cohort found that increased weight was tied to increased mortality from all cancers and specific cancers; [24] in fact, study investigators estimated that overweight and obesity is responsible for 14% of all cancer deaths in women and 20% of all cancer deaths in men. According to the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans a body mass index below 18.5 falls outside the healthy range. But some people live long, healthy lives with a low body mass index. Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If you\u2019ve always had a low body mass index and your weight and health condition doesn\u2019t change much, don\u2019t worry. But if you start losing weight without trying, discuss with your doctor the reasons why this could be happening. Learn more about maintaining a healthy weight.

A healthy weight is a number that is associated with a low risk of weight-related diseases and health issues. Although healthy weight guidelines have been developed at population levels, each person\u2019s healthy weight range will vary and depend on factors such as age, sex, genetics, body frame, existing medical history, lifestyle habits, and weight as a young adult. Weight is only one of many determinants of health. Body mass index (BMI), which measures weight standardized for height, is often used as a measure of health risk. Although it does not measure body fat or body composition directly, research has shown BMI to correlate closely with other methods that directly measure body fat. How useful are the MET Life Height-Weight Tables? There are many reasons for weight gain including certain medications (corticosteroids, antidepressants, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, insulin), pregnancy, chronic stress, chronically poor sleep, an excessive calorie intake, and lack of adequate exercise. [3,4] It is beneficial to keep a steady weight as much as possible and control excessive weight gain over time, which is strongly associated with health risks. Maintain, Don\u2019t Gain Maintaining a healthy weight can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, and many different cancers. [5] Your weight, waist size, and the amount of weight gained since your mid-20s can have health implications. These factors may strongly influence your chances of developing the following diseases and conditions: Cardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke Diabetes Cancer Arthritis Gallstones Asthma Cataracts Infertility Snoring Sleep apnea Most adults gain on average 1-2 pounds each year. [6] Gaining weight as you age increases the chances of developing one or more chronic diseases. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer. [7-11] Those who gained more than 22 pounds had an even larger risk of developing these diseases. Another analysis of Nurses\u2019 Health Study data found that adult weight gain can increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, even after menopause. [12] Encouragingly, for women who had never used hormone replacement therapy, losing weight after menopause\u2014and keeping it off\u2014cut their risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in half. Does having overweight reduce mortality? What Causes Weight Gain? Diet. The quantity and quality of food in your diet has a strong impact on weight. Genes. Some people are genetically predisposed to gain weight more easily than others or to store fat around the midsection. Genes do not have to become destiny, however, and studies suggest that eating a healthy diet, staying active, and avoiding unhealthy habits like drinking soda can prevent the genetic predisposition to risk for obesity. [16] Read more about genetic risk for obesity on the Obesity Prevention Source. Physical inactivity. Exercise has a host of health benefits, including reducing the chances of developing heart disease, some types of cancer, and other chronic diseases. [17] Physical activity is a key element of weight control and health. Stress. Chronic stress can lead to unhealthy eating habits, such as elevated cortisol levels causing cravings for \u201ccomfort\u201d foods of highly processed snacks or sweets, having lower motivation to prepare balanced meals or even forgetting to eat, and disrupting sleep that can lead to higher intakes of caffeine or high-calorie sugary snacks to boost energy. Inadequate sleep. Research suggests that there\u2019s a link between how much people sleep and how much they weigh. In general, children and adults who get too little sleep tend to weigh more than those who get enough sleep. [18,19] The influence of our environments As important as individual choices are when it comes to health, no one person behaves in a vacuum. The physical and social environment in which people live plays a huge role in the food and activity choices they make. And unfortunately, in the U.S. and increasingly around the globe, our environments are not optimized for healthy living. From the persistent marketing and availability of unhealthy foods and sugary drinks, to time and safety constraints for staying active, individuals are faced with a variety of challenges. Obesity and its causes have, in many ways, become woven into the fabric of our society. To successfully disentangle them will take a multifaceted approach that not only gives people the skills to make healthier choices but also sets in place policy and infrastructure that support those choices. Benefits of Even Modest Weight Loss If you have gained more than 25 pounds in adulthood, losing that weight may seem daunting. And when the extra weight doesn\u2019t feel good, you may be tempted to start a drastic weight loss plan. But the good news is that even a modest weight loss of 5% of your current body weight is likely to produce several health benefits, including improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood sugars, physical mobility, and quality of life. [20,21] Tips to lose weight safely: Keep it slow and steady. People who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. [20] This allows the body to adjust to the change and can lower the risk of developing strong cravings and feelings of deprivation that often accompany more rapid weight loss. Include self-management and monitoring. This includes setting goals such as with the SMART acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Start by creating 2-3 short-term SMART goals. Self-monitoring such as with daily or weekly food journaling or using behavior apps can provide insight and accountability to eating behaviors. This category also includes problem solving, such as having a plan for \u201crelapses\u201d if weight is regained due to stressful life changes, holidays, or job demands. [6] Create a support system. Research suggests that having frequent contact with others for support (e.g., trusted family member or friend, physician, health coach, registered dietitian, or a fellow friend or coworker on a similar healthy weight journey) can be valuable in providing encouragement and accountability. [6] Develop healthy eating patterns. Although some researchers have questioned the usefulness of energy balance (calories eaten versus calories expended), current evidence indicates that calorie reduction remains the most effective approach for weight control. There are many dietary strategies (e.g., high-carb low-fat vs. low-carb high-fat vs. intermittent fasting vs. a Mediterranean diet), but research has not consistently shown greater weight loss with one plan over another in the long-term. The Healthy Eating Plate model that provides balanced nutrition and portion control is a good place to start. Practice mindfulness. Do you eat too fast or while distracted watching television or scrolling through your phone? Do you stress-eat or snack even when not hungry? Mindful eating addresses these behaviors that are associated with weight gain. Increasing awareness and appreciation of food can provide greater satisfaction, physically and mentally, that may help reduce overeating. Stay active. Exercise is one component in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight gain, but it also plays a key role in wellbeing and mental health. The National Weight Control Registry, which follows people who have lost and maintained a 30-pound loss for at least one year, shows that participants include about one hour of moderate-vigorous exercise daily such as brisk walking. However there is variation among participants, with some requiring more exercise and some less to keep the weight off. How much is needed will depend on one\u2019s genes and lifestyle factors. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further. Prioritize self-care. In a rushed society with never-ending demands, taking care of our bodies can quickly fall to the bottom of our priority list. Dedicating time to care for one\u2019s emotional, physical, and spiritual needs can promote a healthy weight. Many of the factors listed above are examples of self-care; others could be discovering a new hobby, practicing daily meditation, or allowing time to just do nothing. Self-care may help improve mood and a sense of wellbeing, and increase motivation and energy levels. It also cultivates self-compassion and resilience, as one learns to accept their mistakes and move on. Should I try a health and nutrition app? Smartphone or mobile health apps are self-monitoring easily-accessible tools people can use to track their weight and dietary intake. Self-monitoring is closely associated with self-efficacy, defined as a person having confidence in their ability to improve one\u2019s health by changing behaviors. [22] People can use these apps to assess their nutritional intake by logging specific foods and eating patterns. Apps may provide a food database from which to search, a photo function to take pictures of meals, a scanning tool to find food products using barcodes, or food icons. Other apps monitor eating behaviors such as stress-related or emotional eating, eating quickly or on-the-run, and overeating. A major benefit of these tools is increased awareness of types of foods eaten and eating behaviors that could be contributing to weight gain or changes in metabolic parameters such as high blood glucose or cholesterol. The number of health-related apps targeting behavior change has boomed, with more than 325,000 apps commercially available in 2017. [22] Health apps are often low-cost or free, and can be effective at-home monitoring tools that complement traditional care such as in-person visits to a doctor or dietitian. For example, if a healthcare provider advises a patient to lose weight to improve a chronic health condition, a nutritional app can provide tracking, accountability, and interaction that engages the patient until the next healthcare provider visit. This may be especially useful for certain groups; one study found that rural men were more likely to successfully use health apps for weight loss/nutrition programs than to participate in face-to-face programs, due to cultural norms of self-reliance. [23] Meta-analyses show that people who use apps can experience greater weight loss, decreased waist circumference, and lower calorie intake compared with controls, in the short-term. [24,25] Other studies have shown benefits in improving nutrition behaviors, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. [25] However, there are limitations to these meta-analyses that made comparisons difficult: the studies used different commercial apps with varying functions, and participants used the apps at varying levels (e.g., daily versus weekly). Also, most of the studies were of short duration at less than 6 months. [22,25] Generally the more often the app was used, the greater adherence there was to nutritional goals and achieving weight loss. [26] Unfortunately many of the studies suggested that app use generally declined over time. Still, health apps are worth a try for anyone starting a healthy lifestyle plan and for those who might not have easy access to other support systems.

Reasons include losses from mold, pests, or inadequate climate control; losses from cooking; and intentional food waste. [1] This waste is categorized differently based on where it occurs: Food \u201closs\u201d occurs before the food reaches the consumer as a result of issues in the production, storage, processing, and distribution phases. Food \u201cwaste\u201d refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases. Wasted food has far-reaching effects, both nationally and globally. In the U.S., up to 40% of all food produced goes uneaten [2], and about 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills [3]. It is the largest component of municipal solid waste at 21%. [1] In 2014, more than 38 million tons of food waste was generated, with only 5% diverted from landfills and incinerators for composting. [3] Decomposing food waste produces methane, a strong greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Worldwide, one-third of food produced is thrown away uneaten, causing an increased burden on the environment. [4] It is estimated that reducing food waste by 15% could feed more than 25 million Americans every year. [5] Benefits of Less Food Waste Cost savings on labor through more efficient handling, preparation, and storage of food that will be used. Cost savings when purchasing only as much food as needed, and avoiding additional costs of disposal. Reduced methane emissions from landfills and a lower carbon footprint. Better management of energy and resources, preventing pollution involved in the growing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling of food. Community benefits by providing donated, untouched, and safe food that would otherwise be thrown out. [6] Proposed Solutions to Food Waste Globally, reducing wasted food has been cited as a key initiative in achieving a sustainable food future. Sustainable Development Goal 12 addresses responsible consumption and production, which includes two indicators to measure (in order to ultimately reduce) global food loss and food waste. [7] In the U.S, on June 4, 2013, the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, calling on entities across the food chain, including farms, agricultural processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, universities, schools, and local governments. [1] The goals are to: Reduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods. Recover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger relief organizations like food banks and pantries. Recycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy, and natural fertilizers. On September 16, 2015, both agencies also announced for the first time a national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 to improve overall food security and conserve natural resources. The National Resources Defense Council issued a summary paper providing guidelines on how to reduce waste throughout the food production chain. [2] The following are some focal points: State and local governments can incorporate food waste prevention and education campaigns, and implement municipal composting programs. Governments can provide tax credits to farmers who donate excess produce to local food banks. Proposed bills are currently in place in California, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado. Businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services can evaluate the extent of their food waste and adopt best practices. Examples include supermarkets selling damaged or nearly expired produce at discounted prices, or offering \u201chalf-off\u201d promotions instead of \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free\u201d promotions. Restaurants can offer smaller portions and donate excess ingredients and prepared uneaten food to charities. Schools may experiment with concepts that allow children to create their own meals to prevent less discarded food, such as with salad bars or build-your-own burritos. Farms can evaluate food losses during processing, distribution, and storage and adopt best practices. Farmers markets can sell \u201cugly\u201d produce, which are discarded, misshapen fruits and vegetables that do not meet the usual standards for appearance. Farms can sell fresh but unmarketable produce (due to appearance) to food banks at a reduced rate. Consumers can learn when food is no longer safe and edible, how to cook and store food properly, and how to compost. See Tackling Food Waste at Home. The Environmental Protection Agency provides the \u201cFood Recovery Hierarchy\u201d graphic to explain ways to handle excess food. [8] From the most preferred at the top of the pyramid to the least preferred at the bottom tip, the methods include: Source reduction: Earliest prevention by reducing the overall volume of food produced Feed hungry people: Donating excess food to community sites Feed animals: Donating food scraps and waste to local farmers who can use them for animal feed Industrial uses: Donating used fats, oils, and grease to make biodiesel fuel Composting: Food waste that is composted to produce organic matter that is used to fertilize soil Landfill/Incineration: A last resort for unused food Read Next: Tackling Food Waste at Home \u00bb Related Sustainability The Food Law and Policy Clinic of Harvard Law School References HEALTHY OILS WATER VEGETABLES FRUITS HEALTHY PROTEIN WHOLE GRAINS Create healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.

Shifting towards a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d can nurture both people and planet. Human diets inextricably link health and environmental sustainability, and have the potential to nurture both. [1] Increased food production over the past 50 years has helped improve life expectancy and reduce hunger, infant and child mortality rates, and global poverty. However, such benefits are now being offset by shifts towards unhealthy diets. Globally, as nations have urbanized and citizen incomes have increased, traditional diets (typically higher in quality plant-based foods), have transitioned to a \u201cWestern-style dietary pattern,\u201d characterized by high consumption of calories, highly processed foods (refined carbohydrates, added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats), and high amounts of animal products. [2,3] Along with the negative human health impacts associated with this nutrition transition, this dietary pattern is also unsustainable. Current food production is already driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and drastic changes in land and water use. Different food, different impact Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also have differing impacts on the environment. As shown in the figure below, the production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions (orange bars) than producing plant-based foods\u2014and dairy and red meat (especially beef) stand out for their disproportionate impact. Beyond emissions, it\u2019s also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination (in this figure, these impacts are represented by land use [green bars] and freshwater consumption [blue bars]). (Source: World Resources Institute. [4] Details about the data used to produce this figure available here.) Foodprint calculator Want to know the environmental impact of your diet? Take this quick five minute survey to find your carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints! Transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems\u2014especially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050\u2014poses an unprecedented challenge. However, research by an international working group of scientists shows this \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d could be achievable through a combination of dramatic reductions in food losses and waste, major improvements in food production practices, and substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns. [1] Defining a \u201cPlanetary Health Diet\u201d In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission developed the world\u2019s first scientific targets for healthy and sustainable food systems, including a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d with defined daily consumption ranges for each food group. This dietary pattern\u2014characterized by a variety of high-quality plant-based foods and low amounts of animal-based foods, refined grains, added sugars, and unhealthy fats\u2014is designed to be flexible to accommodate local and individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences. Scientific targets for a planetary health diet Created to meet nutritional requirements and promote health, all while staying within \u201cplanetary boundaries,\u201d the Commission found that global adoption of this planetary health diet would provide major health benefits. Modeling studies show that between 10.9 to 11.6 million early deaths could be averted each year\u2014a 19% to 23.6% reduction from current adult mortality rates. [1] Compared with current diets, this shift will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes must double. That said, the Commission emphasizes the importance of tailoring these targets to local situations. For example, while North American countries currently consume almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, countries in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. [1] Undoubtedly, making such a radical shift to the global food system is unprecedented, and will depend on widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action. Alongside dramatic reductions in food waste and major improvements in food production practices, the Commission\u2019s report calls for \u201cinternational and national commitment\u201d through a range of policy measures and actions needed to make healthy and sustainable foods more available, accessible, and affordable. From governments and policymakers to marketers, industry, the media, educational institutions, farmers, chefs, physicians, and consumers\u2014everyone has an important role to play in this Great Food Transformation. Plant-forward for planetary health The term plant-forward is defined as \u201ca style of cooking and eating that emphasizes and celebrates, but is not limited to, foods from plant sources\u2014fruits and vegetables (produce), whole grains, legumes (pulses), nuts and seeds, plant oils, and herbs and spices\u2014and reflects evidence-based principles of health and sustainability.\u201d Created through Menus of Change (a joint initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition), plant-forward describes a broad set of dietary patterns and approaches to menu design that deliver both personal and planetary health but also preserve a wide range of choices. LEARN MORE ABOUT PLANT-FORWARD APPROACHES AND TRENDS Preparing a Planetary Health Plate It\u2019s clear that what we put on our plates has a major impact on the environment. Eating more healthfully and more sustainably go hand-in-hand, meaning we can develop sustainable eating practices that improve our own health while also benefiting the health of the planet. If you\u2019re interested in practicing a planetary health diet, but confused by the specific targets in the table above, here are some tips that may help: First of all, be sure to note that these ranges are based on daily energy intake of 2,500 calories for an average adult. That means your individual optimal intake will depend on age, body size, and level of physical activity. (The Commission\u2019s report includes special considerations for young children, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.) This dietary pattern is also intended to be flexible enough to accommodate individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences. Animal products are minimized, not completely excluded, so there is a range of options for omnivores as well as those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets. Seeing certain foods listed in grams per day may be unfamiliar. For example, how to eat only 13 grams of eggs per day when a single large egg is about 50 grams? You might be able to stick to this amount if you scramble a single egg into a stir-fry serving for multiple people, however it\u2019s easier to think about your egg consumption on a weekly basis, where this equates to around 2 eggs. The same goes for other animal products. Eating even the upper-limit of 14 grams per day of red meat (a fraction of a single hamburger patty) may not be as realistic as thinking about saving this daily amount for one day during the week (e.g. eating one whole hamburger patty). Aim to consume no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry, and 196 grams of fish per week. Understandably, if you\u2019ve grown up (or have grown accustomed to) having beef, pork, and other red meats on your plate at most meals, such a change may seem daunting. But remember you don\u2019t have to completely cut it out to make a difference for your health and the health of the planet. If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, here are four key approaches to cutting back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. To get a sense of implementing this dietary pattern over the course of a week, here is a sample of what someone eating a varied, Western diet (of 2,500 calories) might select: Sample 7-Day Meal Plan It also helps to see these targets visualized as a complete plate\u2014half of which would be filled with fruits and vegetables (starchy vegetables, like potatoes, are limited), while the other half should consist of primarily whole grains and plant-based protein foods, with unsaturated oils and modest amounts of animal-based protein foods. Look familiar? This guidance is closely aligned with the Healthy Eating Plate. A planetary health plate. (Source: EAT, Summary Report of the EAT-Lancet Commission [5]) What Else Can I Do? Alongside a shift to a planetary health diet, moving towards a more sustainable food future will also require major improvements in food production practices and significant reductions in food losses and waste.

Curious about \u201cquick fixes\u201d like diet pills and gastric bypass surgery? Check out our tips for how to reach a winning weight. Low-Fat Fails While low-fat was once the diet du jour, subsequent research has shown that low-fat diets are ineffective, and moreover, that eating healthy fats is beneficial for health. In the United States, obesity has become increasingly common even as the percentage of fat in the American diet has declined from 45 percent in the 1960s to about 33 percent in the late 1990s. So, cutting fat is not shrinking waistlines. (27, 28) Experimental studies lasting one year or longer have not shown a link between dietary fat and weight. (29, 30) In the eight-year Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, women assigned to a low-fat diet didn\u2019t lose or gain more weight than women eating their usual fare. (31) Low-Carbohydrate and Mediterranean Diets Can Be Effective While many \u201cdiets\u201d are fads meant to be followed for short periods of time, research shows that some approaches, including some low-carbohydrate diets and Mediterranean diets can be good models upon which to base your own dietary strategy as long as they incorporate healthy, high-quality foods. One study comparing a low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and Mediterranean diet followed over 300 people for a 2-year period and found that diets composed of different foods can lead to different weight loss outcomes. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, this study concluded that: Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets might be more effective than low-fat diets. The positive effects of the low-carbohydrate diet and the Mediterranean diet upon lipids and glycemic control suggest that individualized dietary interventions \u2013 which take personal preferences and metabolic considerations into account \u2013 could be effective. (32) A large randomized trial on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease showed that among patients at high risk for CVD, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events over 4.8-years of follow-up. (33) This was the first randomized trial that showed reduced cardiac events over a long follow-up period, so it provided strong scientific evidence that the Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy dietary approach. Though this study focused on cardiovascular outcomes rather than weight loss, it still provides solid evidence that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d is not the case, and that instead, food quality is a key contributor to personal health. It also shows that low-fat diets are continuing to lose credibility, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 can improve heart health and weight loss. What Exactly is a \u201cMediterranean\u201d Diet? There isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes into account the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern. Conclusion: The best diet incorporates high-quality foods in appropriate portions; there isn\u2019t one \u201cperfect\u201d diet for everyone. Calories matter, but quality is equally important. When making dietary decisions, regardless of whether you choose a certain dietary style such as low-carbohydrate or Mediterranean, you can also use the Healthy Eating Plate as a guide for how to fill your plate. A healthy diet for weight loss also needs to be sustainable, and regardless of what you\u2019re eating, you need to make sure you\u2019re not eating too many calories overall. Calories do matter, but focus first on choosing high-quality, healthy foods. References 27. Is total fat consumption really decreasing, U.C.f.N.P.a. Promotion, Editor. 1998. 28.

So how to differentiate what \u201cworks\u201d from an overhyped fad? It\u2019s important to remember that even if a particular diet may be successful for one person, it may not be effective for another due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. And while research shows that calories matter, focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss. Diets are also more likely to be successful when they are easier to follow, so tailoring a strategy to suit your own lifestyle is key. Still, when faced with the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans, it helps to see what evidence is supporting them. In this series, we take a look at some popular diets and approaches to eating\u2014and review the research behind them. Anti-Inflammatory Diet An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that \u201cinflammation\u201d is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by our immune system. Learn more about anti-inflammatory diets: how they work, potential pitfalls, and what the research says. Clean Eating Once just a buzzword, \u201cclean eating\u201d is now a popular eating style. What it means will depend on who you ask. The terms clean eating and clean diets are not federally regulated in the U.S., so interpretation by consumers and the marketing of \u201cclean\u201d products by the food industry can vary widely. Learn more about the potential pros and cons of this approach to eating. DASH Diet The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure, however numerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of this eating pattern. Learn more about DASH: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says. Gluten-Free for Weight Loss A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. As the sole treatment for the 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, this diet is not new. What is new\u2014and driving these sales upward\u2014is the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss. Learn more about a gluten-free diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss. Intermittent Fasting for Weight Loss Intermittent fasting is a diet regimen that cycles between brief periods of fasting, with either no food or significant calorie reduction, and periods of unrestricted eating. The most common methods are fasting on alternate days, for whole days with a specific frequency per week, or during a set time frame. Learn more about intermittent fasting: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss. Intuitive Eating ntuitive eating (IE) is not so much a diet plan as an approach to eating based on one\u2019s internal needs, whether physical, emotional, or other influencers. When these needs are recognized, they may determine one\u2019s food choices. Learn more about intuitive eating: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the available research says. Ketogenic Diet for Weight Loss The ketogenic or \u201cketo\u201d diet is a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich eating plan that has been used for centuries to treat specific medical conditions. However in recent years, this diet has gained considerable attention as a potential weight-loss strategy. Learn more about the keto diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss. Mediterranean Diet The Mediterranean diet is a primarily plant-based eating plan that includes daily intake of whole grains, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, nuts, herbs, and spices. Other foods like animal proteins are eaten in smaller quantities, with the preferred animal protein being fish and seafood. It does not specify portion sizes or specific amounts, as it is up to the individual to decide exactly how much food to eat at each meal. Learn more about the Mediterranean diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says. MIND Diet Dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, driving many people to search for ways to prevent cognitive decline. The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet, targets the health of the aging brain. Learn more about the MIND diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says. Mindful Eating This approach to eating focuses on the eating experience, body-related sensations, and thoughts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment. Attention is paid to the foods being chosen, internal and external physical cues, and your responses to those cues. Learn more about the mindful eating: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the available research says. Paleo Diet for Weight Loss The Paleolithic or \u201cPaleo\u201d diet seeks to address 21st century ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Learn more about the Paleo diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss.

The strongest evidence to date shows that calories matter, but focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss. Focus on eating high-quality foods in appropriately sized portions. Consider Quality, Not Just Calories \u201cA calorie is a calorie\u201d is an oft-repeated dietary slogan, and not overeating is indeed an important health measure. Rather than focusing on calories alone, however, emerging research shows that quality is also key in determining what we should eat and what we should avoid in order to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Rather than choosing foods based only on caloric value, think instead about choosing high-quality, healthy foods, and minimizing low-quality foods. High-quality foods include unrefined, minimally processed foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and healthy sources of protein \u2013 the foods recommended in the Healthy Eating Plate. Lower-quality foods include highly processed snack foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined (white) grains, refined sugar, fried foods, foods high in saturated and trans fats, and high-glycemic foods such as potatoes. There isn\u2019t one \u201cperfect\u201d diet for everyone, owing to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. Quality Counts One study analyzed whether certain foods were more or less likely to promote weight gain. This type of research examining specific foods and drinks allows us to understand whether \u201ca calorie is a calorie,\u201d or if eating more higher-quality foods and fewer lower-quality foods can lead to weight loss and maintenance. Researchers in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health show us that quality is in fact very important in determining what we should eat to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and that the notion of \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d does not tell the whole story. In a study of over 120,000 healthy women and men spanning 20 years, researchers determined that weight change was most strongly associated with the intake of potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and both processed and unprocessed red meats. The researchers concluded that consumption of processed foods higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain. Foods shown to be associated with weight loss were vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt. Researchers did not discount the importance of calories, instead suggesting that choosing high-quality foods (and decreasing consumption of lower-quality foods) is an important factor in helping individuals consume fewer calories. (23) Managing Macronutrients: Does it Matter? With the proliferation of macronutrient-based diets over the past several decades, from low-fat to low-carbohydrate, discussion of the three main macronutrients \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, and fats \u2013 has become standard when talking about optimal diets. Researchers have begun comparing these \u201cmacronutrient management\u201d-style diets to one another in order to determine which is most effective, but thus far evidence is largely inconclusive. One study, published in JAMA in 2007, compared four weight-loss diets ranging from low to high carbohydrate intake. This 12-month trial followed over 300 overweight and obese premenopausal women, randomly assigning them to either an Atkins (very low carbohydrate), Zone (low carbohydrate), LEARN (high carbohydrate), or Ornish (very high in carbohydrate) diet. After one year, weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups. This study also examined secondary outcomes focused on metabolic effects (such as cholesterol, body fat percentage, glucose levels and blood pressure), and found that those for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups. There was no significant difference in weight loss among the other three diets (Zone, LEARN, and Ornish). This study does raise questions about about long-term effects and mechanisms, but the researchers concluded that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible recommendation for weight loss. (24) Another study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, challenged the above study\u2019s findings by testing four different types of diets and producing results that showed comparable average weight loss among the different diets. The study followed 800 people over 2 years, assigning subjects to one of four diets: Low-fat and average-protein, low-fat and high-protein, high-fat and average-protein, and high-fat and high protein. Researchers concluded that all of the diets resulted in meaningful weight loss, despite the differences in macronutrient composition. The study also found that the more group counseling sessions participants attended, the more weight they lost, and the less weight they regained. This supports the idea that not only is what you eat important, but behavioral, psychological, and social factors are important for weight loss as well. (25) An additional study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, looked at the role of protein and glycemic index upon weight loss maintenance. Researchers first implemented a low-calorie diet to produce weight loss, then examined whether protein and glycemic index impacted weight loss maintenance. The study population was made up of nearly 800 overweight adults from European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a low-calorie diet. Participants were then assigned one of five diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: A low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet. The low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain, and weight regain was less in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet, as well as less in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet. These results show that a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycemic index led to an improvement in maintenance of weight loss. (26) The results from these three studies suggest that there may be some benefits to a macronutrient-based dietary approach, but research also shows that while a particular diet may result in weight loss for one person, it may not be effective for another person due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. For those seeking the \u201cperfect\u201d one-size-fits-all diet, then, there isn\u2019t one! The great news is that everyone can follow The Healthy Eating Plate guidelines and choose healthy, flavorful foods to create a diet that works best for you. References 23.

Research strongly supports its benefits across a range of physical and mental health conditions for people of all ages. However, busy lifestyles and an environment that encourages being sedentary for many hours of the day (driving door-to-door, sitting at an office desk, relaxing for the evening in front of a television) have led to exercise ranking low as a priority for many people. Types of Exercise All types of exercises offer health benefits. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further. But it is important to remember that some exercise is better than none, and that most everyone can participate in some form of exercise safely. Aerobic/Cardiovascular physical activity. These are activities that are intense enough and performed long enough to maintain or improve one\u2019s heart and lung fitness. Examples: walking, jogging, dancing, bicycling, basketball, soccer, swimming Muscle-strengthening activity. This may be referred to as resistance training. These activities maintain or increase muscle strength, endurance, and power. Examples: weight machines, free weights, resistance elastic bands, Pilates, daily activities of living (lifting children, carrying groceries or laundry, climbing stairs) Flexibility training. This may be referred to as stretching. It lengthens or flexes a skeletal muscle to the point of tension, and holds for several seconds to increase elasticity and range of motion around a joint. Improving flexibility can enhance the overall physical performance of other types of exercise. Examples: dynamic stretches performed with movement (yoga, tai chi), static stretches without movement (holding a pose for several seconds or longer), passive stretching (using an external force like a strap or wall to hold an elongated pose), and active stretching (holding a pose without an external force) Balance training. These activities are intended to throw off one\u2019s balance to improve body control and stability. They can help to prevent falls and other injuries. Examples: standing on one foot, walking heel-to-toe in a perfectly straight line, standing on a balance or wobble board Measures of Exercise Intensity Although just moving more and sitting less offers health benefits, how much energy you use while exercising can increase those health benefits further. This is referred to as energy intensity. Borg Scale The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion measures your exercise intensity by rating how you feel. It is based on observations like higher heart rate, heavier and faster breathing, increased sweating, and muscles feeling tired. It does not use actual measurements of these occurrences but a personal self-check. The scale uses numbers from 6 to 20. The lowest rating is \u201cno feeling of exertion,\u201d at number 6, and the highest rating is \u201cvery, very hard,\u201d at number 20. Moderate activities register 11 to 14 (\u201cfairly light\u201d to \u201csomewhat hard\u201d) while vigorous activities usually rate 15 or higher (\u201chard\u201d to \u201cvery, very hard\u201d). Dr. Gunnar Borg, who created the scale, set it to run from 6 to 20 as a simple way to estimate heart rate\u2014multiplying the Borg score by 10 gives an approximate heart rate for a particular level of activity. [1] The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion Exercise workouts may vary in intensity throughout the session. You can use the Borg Scale to change the intensity, by speeding up or slowing down movements or applying more or less resistance (such as increasing the incline on a treadmill or turning the resistance control knob on a stationary bicycle). Target heart rate Calculating your heart rate and target heart rate can be used to measure exercise intensity. First determine your maximum heart rate: subtract your age from 220 (example: the maximum heart rate for a 40-year-old person would be 220 \u2013 40 = 180 beats per minute). The target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise is between 65-75% of your maximum heart rate (or 77-93% of maximum heart rate for vigorous exercise). So for the 40-year-old person with a maximum heart rate of 180, the target heart rate falls somewhere between 117-135 beats per minute for moderate exercise, or 139-167 for vigorous exercise. Then measure your actual heart rate in either of these two ways: Midway through the exercise, stop to check your pulse. Place the tips of your index and middle fingers at the wrist and press lightly on the artery in line with the thumb. Count the heartbeats for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. Wear a heart rate monitor. Some pedometers have a built-in heart rate monitor that displays your current heartbeats per minute. METs MET stands for the metabolic equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy used while sitting quietly. Physical activities may be rated using METs to indicate their intensity. For example, reading may use about 1.3 METs while running may use 8-9 METs. METs can also be translated into light, moderate, and vigorous intensities of exercise. Sedentary\u2014Uses 1.5 or fewer METs. Examples are sitting, reclining, or lying down. Light intensity\u2014Uses from 1.6-3.0 METs. Examples are walking at a leisurely pace or standing in line at the store. Moderate intensity\u2014Uses from 3.0-6.0 METs. Examples are walking briskly, vacuuming, or raking leaves. Vigorous intensity\u2014Uses from 6.0+ METs. Examples are walking very quickly, running, taking an aerobics class, or shoveling snow. More on METs Physical Activity Through the Life Course In the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services provides specific guidelines for physical activity for different life stages and conditions: [2] Children ages 3 through 5. Try to be physically active throughout the day. Adult caregivers should encourage children this age to engage in active playing for at least 3 hours daily. Children and adolescents ages 6 through 17. At least 1 hour daily of moderate-to-vigorous activity with both aerobic and strength movements. Adults. Move more frequently throughout the day and sit less. Engage in at least 150 to 300 minutes weekly (spaced throughout the week) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and at least 2 days weekly of muscle-strengthening exercises. Greater health benefits may be seen with more than 300 minutes weekly of exercise. Older adults. Follow similar activity guidelines as those for adults but also include a focus on balance training. Although discussing the start of a new exercise regimen with one\u2019s doctor is a good practice for all ages, it is especially important with this age group because of the higher likelihood of having health conditions or physical limitations that may require modified exercises. See additional physical activity considerations for older adults. Women who are pregnant or postpartum. Aim for 150 minutes weekly (spaced throughout the week) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. If vigorous exercise was performed regularly prior to pregnancy, one may continue this throughout pregnancy after discussing with their doctor. See additional physical activity considerations for pregnancy. Adults with physical disabilities and chronic conditions. Follow similar activity guidelines as those for adults if able to exercise, but discuss with one\u2019s doctor about the types and amounts of activity that would be appropriate for specific conditions. Any exercises within one\u2019s ability is encouraged, to avoid being completely sedentary. See additional physical activity considerations for chronic conditions. The frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise are helpful terms to consider when deciding on an exercise regimen. Frequency: How often will you do the activity\u2014once a day, three times a week, twice a month? Duration: How long is the exercise session\u201420 minutes, 1 hour, 30 minutes split into two sessions in one day? Intensity: How much energy is needed\u2014light versus vigorous activity, 3 METs versus 6 METs? Wearable trackers for physical activity If you are health-conscious, chances are you like seeing data that reveals information on how you are doing. Pedometers, heart rate monitors, and sleep trackers can all analyze what goes on inside our bodies. Most of these devices are combined with a smartphone or computer app that provide tracking tools to better manage personal health, and can be an effective source of motivational support. [3] The data may be shared with one\u2019s physician or other health care provider to monitor progress with physical activity goals. Trackers can motivate people to change behavior, whether this means getting up and moving more, going to bed earlier, or advancing an exercise routine to challenge the heart. [4] But how reliable are they? Generally these trackers are pretty accurate when measuring steps taken. But other measures, such as how many calories are burned, can overestimate or underestimate the actual amount. Studies looking at the accuracy of devices in tracking calories used while exercising tend to be small in size. In one study, 14 participants wearing different popular brand devices walked and ran. The estimated calorie usage displayed on the devices was compared with measurements from indirect calorimetry (a reliably accurate technique to measure calorie output). The results were mixed. Some of the devices were accurate for calorie expenditure with running but not walking and visa versa. Some of the devices overestimated the amount of calories used during exercise. [5] Other studies found similar discrepancies. [6] Tracking devices can be useful for personal motivation and accountability, but the data should be interpreted with caution as there are variable readings among devices. The accuracy of the data may also vary within the same device when performing different intensities of exercise. [6] They are best used with other methods to gauge fitness levels, such as monitoring the frequency, duration, and perceived exertion of your exercise routine. It\u2019s also important to have motivation to exercise because you enjoy how you feel during and after the exercise, not just to reach a certain number on a tracker. Exercise Safety Safety should be a major priority when exercising. Any physical activity carries the risk of injury, whether you are just starting an exercise regimen or are a seasoned fitness buff. But don\u2019t let this stop you from moving because the health benefits of being active far outweigh any risks. Using caution and patience can reduce the risk of injuries. Common workout injuries include: Strained or pulled muscles Ankle sprain Knee strain Inflamed tendons or ligaments Rotator cuff (shoulder) injury Overuse injuries caused by repetitive movements using mainly one part of the body In very rare cases, vigorous physical activity may lead to a heart attack or sudden death. Active people have a lower risk of serious or fatal heart problems than inactive people. Common missteps: Not talking with your doctor first. If you are new to exercise or have medical conditions, let your doctor know what type of exercise you\u2019ll be starting. They can review the format to ensure it is safe with a specific health condition. Doing too much too soon. This is very common as people may be highly motivated when starting a new exercise program. However, forcing your body to move with too much intensity can be jarring to the heart, muscles, and joints that may lack strength from inactivity. This often leads to injury. Even if starting slowly feels too easy, plan to progress exercise gradually. Start with light to moderate-intensity movements for a shorter amount of time, and continue this for a few weeks. As you develop strength and stamina, you can add minutes and higher-intensity movements every few weeks. Leaving out the warm-up and cool-down. A warm-up before exercising includes light movements that initiate the flow of blood and loosening of muscles and joints. An example would be 5-10 minutes of marching in place, doing arm circles, and neck rolls. After exercising, the cool-down is important to slow down the body and heart rate steadily, as a sudden stop in movements can interfere with blood flow to the brain and cause lightheadedness or dizziness. A cool-down could be simply slowing the pace of whatever exercise being performed for 10 minutes (if jogging, change to a walk; if on a stationary bicycle, release any tension on the resistance knob and peddle slower). The cool-down period may also include stretches that are most effective when the muscles are warmed from exercising; stretches help to lengthen muscles that will protect against injuries. A cool-down with stretching can also lessen muscle soreness the following day. How to get started safely If you have a chronic health condition or are pregnant, let your doctor know of your desire to start exercising. If you are sedentary, start with activities that are lower impact and require a light-to-moderate effort, such as walking, gardening, stationary bicycling, or swimming. Progress gradually\u2014it\u2019s especially important to \u201cstart low and go slow.\u201d Protect yourself: Choose the right equipment. If you\u2019re cycling, wear a bike helmet. If you\u2019re going out for a walk, pull on a well-fitting pair of sneakers instead of a pair of flip flops. Generally, exercise shoes should be replaced very 4-6 months as the cushioning wears out. Find a safe place to work out. Seek out streets that have sidewalks or bicycle lanes, or visit a local park. Play basketball on well-maintained courts. Pay attention to the weather. In the middle of a heat wave, exercise in the morning or evening when it\u2019s cooler out, exercise indoors, or hit the swimming pool instead of the tennis court. Be aware of signs of overheating like dizziness, nausea, headache, cramping, and a racing heart rate that doesn\u2019t slow down even when stopping the exercise. Stay hydrated with water. The amount will vary depending on the temperature (more is needed in very hot and humid conditions) and level of exercise. For moderate workouts of one hour or less, bring about 24 ounces of water to drink during and after exercising. Choose healthy \u201cfuel.\u201d A diet with adequate amounts of healthy protein and carbohydrates is sufficient to fuel the body for low to moderate amounts of physical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling. Be wary of supplement claims. Fitness gurus and advertisements touting workout supplements as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, and explosive muscle growth might have you believing you can\u2019t effectively exercise without them. Although some supplements have been researched for use in regular high-intensity, strenuous physical activity (such as marathon training or power lifting), it\u2019s important to note they are not regulated for safety. Be sure to consult with a doctor before incorporating them into your exercise routine and discuss if there are any potential contraindications if you have existing medical conditions. Learn more about the research on common workout supplements. Listen to your body. If you feel very fatigued, pain, or lightheaded while exercising, slow down the workout or end it early. What\u2019s the difference between muscle pain and muscle soreness? It is normal and healthy to feel moderately sore muscles the day after a vigorous workout. The soreness is usually noted in the general area of the body that was used while exercising. This is caused by the accumulation of lactic acid as well as small tears in muscle fibers that become inflamed; after 48 hours the lactic acid begins to dispel and muscle tissue is repaired so the soreness should lessen. Although you may not want to move at all when experiencing muscle soreness, this can actually delay healing. Doing light movements like walking or stretching can increase blood flow and circulation, speeding healing time. On the other hand, sharp pain in a specific area that starts during the workout or soon after could be a sign of a more serious injury. See a doctor if the pain does not lessen in a day or two or you notice swelling or bruising around the painful area. 10 Tips to Keep Moving Plan exercise into your day. Intention is an important first step. Set aside a specific time in your schedule to exercise and write it in your planner. Accountability helps. If your motivation is lagging, connect with a friend or family member with a similar goal to move more. A workout partner can help keep you on track and motivate you to get out the door. Try counting steps. Step-counters or pedometers are an easy, inexpensive way to remind yourself to move. Working up to 10,000 steps per day can be a good general goal. If that seems too intimidating, measure your steps on an average day and increase by 1000 steps every two weeks. Keep it brisk. When you walk, make it brisk, since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace. What is brisk enough? Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late. Turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone. Chances are that if you turn off these devices for an hour or two, you will automatically move more and curb your \u201csit time.\u201d Fill the time by doing household chores, running errands, playing with the kids, or taking a stroll around your neighborhood. Turn sit time into fit time. Try to combine movement with a sedentary activity that you already do. For example, perform squats, marching in place, jumping jacks, push-ups, or sit-ups while watching TV or throughout each commercial. Fidgeting, or its scientific term non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), also uses extra energy. Studies show that people who are lean incorporate more NEAT movements throughout the day compared with people who are overweight. [7] This might mean pacing around while talking on the phone, tapping your feet when sitting, drumming your fingers on a desk or your leg, or wiggling your toes. For inspiration on how to move \u201ccreactively\u201d wherever you are, check out Activating a Move-Friendly World. Move at the office. If you work long shifts or care for a busy family after hours, fitting in a workout can be daunting. So focus on moving at the office even if you have a sedentary desk job. Make climbing stairs and avoiding elevators the norm, park as far from the front office door as possible, set a reminder to get up and walk for 5 minutes each hour (that could add up to 40 minutes in a day!), or follow a short desk exercise video online. Split the workout. If you are new to exercise and find a 30-minute session challenging, split it into two 15-minute sessions. The fitness benefit may actually be greater if you can exercise with higher energy and intensity in two shorter bouts, than if you tried to exercise for 30 minutes but slowed down from fatigue towards the end. Sign up for a class or a specific event. Check out the fitness class schedule at your local gym, yoga studio, or community center. Some offer virtual classes with a live instructor but which you can do at home. Or sign up for a specific event like a road race or walk-for-charity a few months out; this can help drive you to train regularly the weeks leading up to the event. You may find that having a target date or the structure of a weekly class keeps you consistent. Reward yourself. Set short-term goals\u2014then acknowledge and reward yourself when achieving them. Positive affirmations are key to building confidence as you commit to ongoing fitness goals. Treat yourself to new exercise shoes, clothing, or workout gear; a new book; or a massage. The influence of music in exercise Research has shown various physical and mental benefits of music in enhancing exercise performance. Music can help people to experience greater enjoyment and a lower perception of fatigue and \u201cwork\u201d during repetitive endurance exercise, even while achieving a faster heart rate and deeper breathing. This can also help to increase blood flow and promote muscle recovery during high-intensity exercise. Studies have shown that music can increase a positive mood compared with controls who do not listen to music while exercising.

[1] People are more likely to be active if they live near parks and playgrounds, in neighborhoods that have sidewalks or bike paths, or close enough to work, school, or shopping that they can travel by bike or on foot. People are less likely to be active if they live in neighborhoods without recreation facilities or in sprawling suburbs designed for driving. Moving to another neighborhood is not a viable option for most people. Instead, communities need to create built environments that make it easier for people to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. [2, 3] Local and state leaders control budgets, zoning, and a variety of regulations that shape our physical surroundings, and there are many strategies communities can use to promote safe environments for activity: [2, 3] Improving access to parks, walking and biking paths, community gardens, and other outdoor recreation facilities Creating attractive sidewalks and so-called \u201ccycle tracks,\u201d barrier-protected and bicycle-exclusive facilities alongside sidewalks Curbing traffic so that people feel safer walking and cycling Building schools within easy walking distance of where people live Improving public transportation to encourage more people to use it Changing zoning rules to allow \u201cmixed-use development\u201d\u2014if communities allowed homes, stores, schools, offices, and other buildings to be built close to each other, people would be more likely to walk or bike from place to place, rather than hop in the car Making neighborhoods safer to encourage people to be active outdoors Allowing community residents to use schools for recreation, after school hours Individuals can help by becoming advocates for change, and also by pitching in. Volunteer to clean up a local park, join a neighborhood crime watch, start a petition to add crosswalks along a popular walking route, or to turn parking spaces into cycle tracks along busy streets.

There are three main types of stress that may occur in our everyday lives: acute (a brief event such as a heated argument or getting stuck in a traffic jam), acute episodic (frequent acute events such as work deadlines), and chronic stress (persistent events like unemployment from a job loss, physical or mental abuse, substance abuse, or family conflict). Many of us may experience a combination of these three types. Our bodies react to all types of stress via the same mechanism, which occurs regardless if the stress arises from a real or perceived event. Both acute and chronic stressors cause the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response. Hormones are released that instigate several actions within seconds: pumping blood and oxygen quickly to our cells, quickening the heart rate, and increasing mental alertness. In prehistoric times, this rapid response was needed to quickly escape a dangerous situation or fight off a predator. However all types of stress can trigger this response, as described in more detail below: A very small region at the base of the brain, called the hypothalamus, sets off the reaction and communicates with the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This system regulates involuntary responses like blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and digestion. The ANS signals nerves and the hormone corticotropin to alert the adrenal glands, located on the top of each kidney, to release a hormone called adrenaline into the blood. [1] Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) quickens the heart rate and increases blood pressure so more blood circulates to the muscles and heart to support a boost of energy. More oxygen in the blood is available to the heart, lungs, and brain to accommodate faster breathing and heightened alertness. Even one\u2019s vision and hearing may become sharpened. If stress continues, the adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, which stimulates the release of glucose into the blood and increases the brain\u2019s use of glucose for energy. It also turns off certain systems in the body to allow the body to focus on the stress response. These systems include digestion, reproduction, and growth. These hormones do not return to normal levels until the stress passes. If the stress does not pass, the nervous system continues to trigger physical reactions that can eventually lead to inflammation and damage to cells. With acute stress, the event is brief and hormone levels will gradually return to normal. Acute episodic and chronic stress repeatedly trigger the fight-or-flight response causing a persistent elevation of hormones, leading to a risk of health problems: [2] Digestive issues (heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation) Weight gain Elevated blood pressure Chest pain, heart disease Immune system problems Skin conditions Muscular pain (headaches, back pain, neck pain) Sleep disruption, insomnia Infertility Anxiety, depression How Chronic Stress Affects Eating Patterns Chronic stress can affect the body\u2019s use of calories and nutrients in various ways. It raises the body\u2019s metabolic needs and increases the use and excretion of many nutrients. If one does not eat a nutritious diet, a deficiency may occur. [2] Stress also creates a chain reaction of behaviors that can negatively affect eating habits, leading to other health problems down the road. Stress places a greater demand on the body for oxygen, energy, and nutrients. Yet people who experience chronic stress may crave comforting foods such as highly processed snacks or sweets, which are high in fat and calories but low in nutrients. [3] People feeling stress may lack the time or motivation to prepare nutritious, balanced meals, or may skip or forget to eat meals. Stress can disrupt sleep by causing lighter sleep or more frequent awakenings, which leads to fatigue during the day. [4] In order to cope with daytime fatigue, people may use stimulants to increase energy such as with caffeine or high-calorie snack foods. The reverse may also be true that poor-quality sleep is itself a stressor. Studies have found that sleep restriction causes a significant increase in cortisol levels. [4] During acute stress, the hormone adrenaline suppresses the appetite. [5] But with chronic stress, elevated levels of cortisol may cause cravings, particularly for foods high in sugar, fat, and calories, which may then lead to weight gain. [5,6] Cortisol favors the accumulation of fat in the belly area, also called central adiposity, which is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain breast cancers. [5,7-9] It also lowers levels of the hormone leptin (that promotes satiety) while increasing the hormone ghrelin (that increases appetite). [3] Tips to Help Control Stress Healthy diet. A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and the repair of damaged cells. It provides the extra energy needed to cope with stressful events. Early research suggests that certain foods like polyunsaturated fats including omega-3 fats and vegetables may help to regulate cortisol levels. [10] If you frequently rely on fast food because you are tired or too busy to prepare meals at home, consider meal planning, a practice that can help save time in the long run, ensure more balanced healthful meals, and prevent weight gain. Mindful eating. When we \u201cstress-eat,\u201d we eat quickly without noticing what or how much we\u2019re eating, which can lead to weight gain. Mindful eating practices counteract stress by encouraging deep breaths, making thoughtful food choices, focusing attention on the meal, and chewing food slowly and thoroughly. This increases enjoyment of the meal and improves digestion. Mindful eating can also help us realize when we are eating not because of physiological hunger but because of psychological turbulence, which may lead us to eat more as a coping mechanism. Regular exercise. Physical activity will help to lower blood pressure and stress hormone levels. Aerobic exercise like walking and dancing increases breathing and heart rate so that more oxygen reaches cells throughout the body. This reduces tension in muscles, including the heart. Meditation or deep breathing techniques. Fast, shallow breathing and erratic thoughts occur in response to stress. Therefore, take slow deep breaths to reduce muscular tension, lower the heart rate, and calm the mind. Whenever you feel stressed, breathe slowly, focusing on each in- and out-breath. Through this simple act, your parasympathetic nervous system kicks in and can help you calm down. If you\u2019d like some guidance, try this short mindful breathing exercise. Additionally, certain exercises like yoga and tai chi emphasize deep breathing and a focused mind. Research has also found that meditation training may lengthen or prevent the shortening of protein structures called telomeres. [11] Telomeres generally shrink in length with age and in those experiencing chronic stress; this can lead to the death of cells and inflammation, which is associated with an increased risk of age-related dementia and cardiovascular disease. Meditation practice has been associated in some studies with greater telomere activity and length in response to a reduction in anxiety, chronic stress, and cortisol levels. Mental health counseling or other social support. Feeling alone can add to stress. It can help to talk through feelings and concerns with a trusted individual. Often, just realizing that you are not alone and that your feelings are not unusual can help lower stress. Practicing work-life balance. Use vacation and personal time, or just set aside an hour a day. A periodic escape from the pressures of work can do wonders to reduce stress, increase productivity, and decrease the risk of physical and mental illnesses that are associated with workplace burnout. Schedule fun activities or hobbies at least once a week. Gardening, reading, enjoying music, getting a massage, hiking in nature, and cooking a favorite recipe are examples of welcome stress relievers. Good sleep hygiene. Stress can cause a heightened sense of alertness, which delays the onset of sleep as well as cause interrupted sleep throughout the night. This can prevent one from entering the deeper sleep stages in which the body repairs and grows tissue and supports a healthy immune system. The REM (rapid eye movement) sleep stage in particular helps with mood regulation and memory. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep a night by slowing down about 30 minutes before bedtime. Controlling stress through the other tips listed above can also improve sleep quality.

Although we may feel that sleep simply rests our tired bodies, our brain remains active throughout the night. Sleep plays a critical role in brain as well as physical functioning. What Happens When We Sleep? Our internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime. There are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles. Non-REM sleep Stage 1. You transition from being awake to a restful state. Stage 2. You are in a light sleep state. Your breathing, heart rate, and muscle movements slow down. Brain activity also slows, and your body temperature drops. Stage 3. You are in a deep sleep state. This stage often occurs early in the sleep cycle immediately following light sleep. Your heart rate and breathing are the slowest during this phase, and you are not easily awakened. Events of the day are processed and stored in your memory. A lack of deep sleep can leave one feeling tired in the morning even if achieving an adequate duration of sleep. REM sleep During REM, your pupils twitch and move quickly from side to side underneath closed eyelids. Brain activity rises as you breathe faster and your heart rate increases. It is the phase of sleep when dreams are most common, and certain nerves signal your limbs to become temporarily paralyzed so you do not act out the dream. REM tends to occur later at night and into early morning. Memory is processed and stored during REM sleep. Why do we dream? Dreams occur during the REM sleep stage and may include events or thoughts you experienced recently. Dreams may occur to help process emotions caused by those events. People report dreaming in vivid color as well as in black and white. Sometimes even a wild crazy dream can be forgotten by the time we awaken in the morning. Hormones that Regulate Sleep Cycles There are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. [1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness. GABA is a neurotransmitter that decreases nerve cell activity, playing a major role in allowing the body to sleep. Adenosine is another neurotransmitter that gradually accumulates in the brain during the day, and at high concentrations makes us sleepy at night. Caffeine in coffee and other beverages can keep us awake as it blocks brain receptors for adenosine. Melatonin is a hormone released by the brain when it is dark. It travels to cells to tell the body to sleep. Sunlight or exposure to light inhibits the production of melatonin and increases the release of cortisol, which awakens us. If we are exposed to too much artificial light (such as the blue light emitted from smartphones or televisions) late at night, less melatonin may be released making it harder to fall asleep. Serotonin, the body\u2019s \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemical, is a neurotransmitter associated with both sleep and being awake. The brain releases this chemical during daylight but also uses it to form melatonin at night. Hormones that counteract sleep include norepinephrine, adrenaline, histamine, and cortisol. These are secreted in response to stress and cause the body to be awake and alert. If one experiences prolonged or chronic stress, the body releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn releases cortisol. Levels of ACTH tend to be higher in people who have insomnia. Immediate Effects of Sleep Deprivation About one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2,3] Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Because of the public health burden of poor sleep health, achieving sufficient sleep in children and adults was included as a goal in the Healthy People 2020 goals. [4] Sleep helps to process your thoughts from the day as well as store memories, so a lack of good-quality sleep can lead to difficulty focusing and thinking clearly. You may feel tired, irritable, or anxious during the day. Performance at work or school may suffer. Your reaction time may be slowed, increasing the risk of driving accidents. In children, insufficient sleep can lead to attention and behavior problems or hyperactivity. In the elderly, lack of sleep may decrease focus and attention, leading to a greater risk of falls, bone fractures, and car accidents. There are several reasons people may get insufficient sleep: Poor sleep habits (watching television or using screens late at night, drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages at night, not following a regular sleep schedule). Your sleep environment is too noisy, too light or otherwise not conducive to sleep. You attempt to sleep outside of the body\u2019s natural circadian clock (working an overnight shift and trying to make up for sleep during the day). You have a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or periodic limb movements that reduces deep or REM sleep or causes frequent awakenings. You have a medical condition such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or chronic pain, which causes frequent awakenings. Sleep Deficiency and Disease Risk If you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death. Obesity Diabetes Cardiovascular disease Depression Dementia Mortality Medical Conditions that Interfere with Sleep Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\u2014Symptoms of OSA include snoring or gasping for air that causes interruptions in sleep and prevention of good-quality sleep. Sleep apnea also causes oxygen levels to drop during sleep, which can pose a stress on the heart, brain and other organs. People with OSA may not be aware that they are awakening frequently in the night, but do not get refreshed sleep, feeling excessively sleepy or tired during the day. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices may be prescribed, which provides pressurized air to the nose and throat, preventing the upper airway from collapsing. Another common treatment is dental devices that move the jaw forward and increasing the airway size. Obesity is a risk factor for OSA because carrying extra weight, particularly in the neck area, can contribute to obstructed breathing passages. About 70% of adults with OSA have obesity, and a significant improvement in OSA is seen with weight reduction. [7] OSA is a risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. [7] Restless leg syndrome\u2014This condition is associated with discomfort in the legs accompanied by an urge to move, which disrupts sleep. It is believed that abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine may be responsible, so medications are given to correct this. In some cases, low levels of iron can result in this disorder. Insomnia\u2014This condition is defined as the inability to sleep or stay asleep. An individual may have a hard time falling asleep, or may sleep but then awaken in the early morning and be unable to return to sleep. Short-term insomnia can be caused by stress or traumatic events (divorce, job loss, death of a loved one). Chronic or long-term insomnia may be caused by ongoing anxiety, working different work shifts that disrupt the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, poor sleep habits, medical conditions that can interrupt sleep (chronic pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease), or medications that have a stimulating effect. Insomnia often can be treated with behavioral therapies, although sometimes sleep medications are prescribed. Genetic\u2014Studies have found specific gene variants that are associated with insomnia. [25,26] The same genes for insomnia were also associated with higher levels of body fat, depression, and heart disease. Research has also found that sleep apnea clusters within families, and genes have been identified that appear to increase risk for sleep apnea as well as cardiovascular disease. [27] More research is needed in this area. What if I work the night shift? People who work overnight shifts, early morning shifts, or rotating shifts (both day shifts and night shifts) may develop something called shift work disorder (SWD). Studies show that those with SWD have poorer sleep quality than day workers. [28] They may take longer to fall asleep, experience insomnia, and feel excessive sleepiness while awake. This is caused by attempts to sleep in daylight, which opposes natural circadian rhythms. Poor sleep hygiene further aggravates the problem. SWD is associated with decreased alertness, higher risk of work-related accidents, and increased depression and anxiety. SWD is also associated with metabolic changes increasing the risk of heart disease, obesity, and digestive problems caused by irregular eating habits or poor diet. The following tips can help if you work nontraditional hours: [29] Request to work the same shift several nights in a row, to avoid flipping between day and night shift schedules on consecutive days. This helps to regulate the circadian system. Commit to a consistent sleep schedule, darkening the bedroom with blackout shades, and creating a quiet atmosphere as much as possible. You might reduce light exposure even earlier by wearing sunglasses as soon as you leave work. To reduce noise, wear earplugs and use a white noise machine to block sounds. After finishing a night shift, try to return home and go to bed as soon as possible. Running errands, watching television, talking with family, or exercising can re-energize your body so that falling asleep becomes more difficult. Although it is tempting to run errands and attend medical appointments during the day when places are less crowded, try to minimize doing them immediately after work so that you can return home and honor your sleep schedule. Try to keep a set meal schedule. Do meal planning to ensure that quick easy meals are ready when you arrive home, and bring prepped meals/snacks to work for overnight shifts to prevent reliance on fast food and takeout meals. Try to avoid eating a large meal right before bed, which can increase the risk of reflux and indigestion. Sleep Deficiency and Eating Behaviors Epidemiological studies show that insufficient sleep is independently associated with a higher risk of obesity. Clinical studies of of sleep-restricted adults show an increased hunger and calorie intake when participants are allowed free access to food. [7] A preference for late evening or nighttime food intake and increased snacking has been observed. [9] There also appears to be a food preference for higher carbohydrate and fat foods, which could partly explain the overall higher calorie intake. Changes in hormone levels that signal either hunger or satiety have also been observed in clinical sleep restriction studies. Leptin is a hormone associated with satisfaction. When food enters the stomach, leptin is released from fat cells and travels to the brain where it signals the body to stop eating by creating a sensation of fullness. People with obesity may actually have very high levels of leptin; the more body fat one has, the more leptin is produced in fat cells. However, a condition called leptin resistance may occur in which the brain does not receive the usual signal from leptin to stop eating. In response, more and more leptin is released. Lower leptin levels as well as high leptin levels suggesting leptin resistance have been observed in sleep-deprived adults. [7] Ghrelin, the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d typically has the opposing action of leptin. It is released in the gut and sends hunger signals to the brain when someone is not eating enough. About three hours after eating a meal, ghrelin levels drop. Clinical studies have found that sleep restriction leads to elevated ghrelin levels. [9] Despite this interesting theory of poor sleep leading to changes in appetite hormone levels, other studies have found no changes and therefore the association is still inconclusive. [9] Conflicting findings may be due to differences in the study participants (e.g., age, gender) and differences in how the researchers defined the duration and severity of sleep restriction. How Much Sleep Do We Need? Sleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps. Toddlers need about 10-14 hours a day. Preteens and teenagers need about 8-12 hours a night, and adults about 7-8 hours a day. [30] A consensus by the AASM and Sleep Research Society recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours a night to promote optimal health. [31] Despite these general recommendations on sleep duration, individual differences in sleep requirements exist. In most epidemiologic studies, increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, has been observed among those who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per day, and 9 hours or more per day. Thus, a range of sleep hours (more than 5 and less than 9) is considered appropriate for most healthy adults. Other factors such as quality of sleep are important, because just meeting the total recommended sleep hours may not be enough if one wakes up frequently in the night. A common belief is that lost sleep from a late night out or studying can be recovered by \u201csleeping in\u201d another day or taking naps. However, both of these methods disrupt the body\u2019s circadian rhythms and may deprive the body of deeper sleep stages. In fact, increased variability in how much sleep we get from night to night is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic and heart diseases. [32] It is important to respond, whenever possible, to the body\u2019s natural signals of sleepiness. What about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep? Herbal supplements Two popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness. It is well tolerated in adults with few reported adverse events in doses up to 10 mg. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the judicious use of melatonin for certain sleep and circadian disorders such as shift work disorder or jet lag. [33] Valerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep. However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia. The AASM does not recommend valerian for insomnia disorder. [33] It is important to note that supplements are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness. Therefore doses and preparations of these herbs can vary widely. A study of 31 melatonin products found that the melatonin levels in the pills ranged between 83%-478% of the dose reported on the label. [33] More than 70% of the products varied from the labeled dose by more than 10%. If supplements are used, look for a label verifying its quality from a third-party, such as from the U.S. Pharmacopeia. Sleep medicines Common medicines prescribed for sleep include sedatives such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan*). They help with falling asleep initially, but tend to reduce the amount of deeper sleep. They are not recommended for long-term use because they can worsen insomnia, increase depression, and impair memory, and are associated with increased risk of falls, cancer, and early death. [34] Long-term use of benzodiazepines can promote psychological dependence, and there is a risk of addiction and abuse. [35] Tolerance can also develop over time, requiring larger doses to maintain their effectiveness. Because of these side effects, benzodiazepines are not recommended to treat insomnia in older adults. [35] There are other classes of sleep medications including non-benzodiazepines (e.g., Lunesta, Ambien) and antidepressants (e.g., Zoloft) that also quicken the time to fall asleep but may interfere with deeper sleep stages. Anticholinergic medications (e.g., Benadryl) can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and decline. Generally, sleep medicines are most effective when used occasionally or for a short time of less than one month. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that cognitive behavioral therapy be used as the initial treatment for insomnia. [*The inclusion of brand names is included for reference and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse any specific brands.] Other therapies Randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia. [35,33] They have been found more effective than medications for the long-term management of insomnia. People may be asked to keep a sleep journal to record sleep habits and activities performed around bedtime, which can help determine the most appropriate CBT. Sleep Hygiene Tips Set a sleep schedule and stick to it. Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same times, even on weekends. This helps to regulate the body\u2019s sleep cycles and circadian rhythms. Try to exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training or HIIT) one hour before bedtime. Regular exercise of adequate intensity can promote muscle relaxation and deeper sleep later on. Try to avoid large meals, heavy snacking, or alcohol 2-3 hours before bed. If you are sensitive to caffeine, try to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages 4-6 hours before bedtime. Stop using electronic devices an hour before bed, especially those emitting blue light such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions. Schedule before-bed activities to signal that you are winding down, such as changing into pajamas and brushing teeth. Create a quiet, dark, relaxing environment in your bedroom. Dim the lights and turn off your cell phone\u2019s sound and vibration modes if possible. Ensure a comfortable temperature, as feeling too hot or cold can disrupt sleep. Create calming bedtime rituals such as practicing deep breathing exercises, doing light yoga stretches, or listening to soothing relaxing music. Many meditation podcasts, apps, and YouTube videos offer these tools for free. If you awaken and can\u2019t return to sleep, don\u2019t stay in bed. Get up and do quiet relaxing activities, such as reading, until you feel tired enough to fall back asleep. Does exercising at night disrupt sleep? A solid body of research confirms that both aerobic and resistance exercises improve sleep, with reported improvements comparable to the effects of pharmacological treatments for insomnia if exercises are performed regularly. [36] A review of 13 studies found that regular resistance exercises (using resistance bands, strength machines) performed 2-3 times a week for an average of one hour improved sleep quality. [37] It also found that resistance exercises decreased anxiety and depression, which could be a factor in improving sleep. However, it is not recommended to do vigorous exercises such as running or interval training within one hour of bedtime. A review of 23 studies found that healthy adults who performed high-intensity exercise too soon before bed had difficulty falling asleep and experienced poorer sleep quality. [38] Yet, this study and others did not find that performing more moderate exercises or exercising vigorously further away from bedtime caused sleep disturbances, and in fact helped people to experience increased amounts of deeper sleep.

We may hope for longevity so that we can experience many years of quality time with loved ones or have time to explore the world. But living to a ripe old age doesn\u2019t necessarily mean healthy or happy longevity if it is burdened by disability or disease. The population of people over age 65 has grown more quickly than other age groups due to longer life spans and declining birth rates, and yet people are living more years in poor health. [1] Therefore, we will explore not just one\u2019s lifespan but healthspan, which promotes more healthy years of life. What you do today can transform your healthspan or how you age in the future. Although starting early is ideal, it\u2019s never too late to reap benefits. Five Key Lifestyle Factors Researchers from Harvard University looked at factors that might increase the chances of a longer life. [2] Using data collected from men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were followed for up to 34 years, researchers identified five low-risk lifestyle factors: healthy diet, regular exercise (at least 30 minutes daily of moderate to vigorous activity), healthy weight (as defined by a body mass index of 18.5-24.9), no smoking, and moderate alcohol intake (up to 1 drink daily for women, and up to 2 daily for men). Compared with those who did not incorporate any of these lifestyle factors, those with all five factors lived up to 14 years longer. In a follow-up study, the researchers found that those factors might contribute to not just a longer but also a healthier life. [2] They saw that women at age 50 who practiced four or five of the healthy habits listed above lived about 34 more years free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, compared with 24 more disease-free years in women who practiced none of these healthy habits. Men practicing four or five healthy habits at age 50 lived about 31 years free of chronic disease, compared with 24 years among men who practiced none. Men who were current heavy smokers, and men and women with obesity, had the lowest disease-free life expectancy. Five factors for a longer and healthier lifespan Healthy diet \u2013 The prevalence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and dementia increases with age. Eating patterns such as those from the DASH, MIND, and Mediterranean diets can lower the risk of these and other chronic conditions that accompany older ages. A multivitamin-mineral supplement may also help to improve cognitive function and memory in some people, according to large randomized controlled trials. Regular exercise \u2013 Regular physical activity lowers the risk of several chronic conditions that increase with age including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and cognitive decline. Exercise also helps to lower anxiety and blood pressure, and improve sleep quality. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first recommends to move more and sit less, with some activity better than none. For additional health benefits, they advise a minimum of 150-300 minutes weekly of moderate to vigorous activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, as well as two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercises. Older adults who are at risk for falls may also wish to include balance training such as tai chi or yoga. See additional physical activity considerations for older adults. Healthy weight \u2013 Determining one\u2019s healthy weight range is unique for each person. Factors to consider include reviewing current health conditions, family history, weight history, and genetically inherited body type. Rather than focusing on scale weight alone, monitoring an increase in harmful visceral \u201cbelly fat\u201d and weight change since age 20 may be useful. Not smoking \u2013 Smoking is a strong risk factor for cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, and earlier death as it promotes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (a condition that can damage cells and tissues). [2] Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Quitting greatly reduces the risk of these smoking-related diseases. [4] Moderate alcohol \u2013 Research finds that moderate drinking, defined as 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and early death from cardiovascular disease. Low to moderate amounts of alcohol raises levels of \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prevent small blood clots that can block arteries. However, because alcohol intake\u2014especially heavier drinking\u2014is also associated with risks of addiction, liver disease, and several types of cancer, it is a complex issue that is best discussed with your physician to weigh your personal risk versus benefit. Additional Factors for Healthy Longevity Beyond the five core lifestyle habits mentioned above, a growing body of research is identifying additional factors that may be key to increasing our healthspans: Having life purpose/meaning. Research shows that having a sense of meaning or purpose in daily life is associated with better sleep, healthier weight, higher physical activity levels, and lower inflammation in some people. [5,6] It also promotes optimism. If people are healthier at older ages, they can potentially contribute more to their family, community, and society as a whole. [1] This translates to being stronger and more mobile to assist younger generations with childcare or other family activities, working beyond retirement age, volunteering for local causes, pursuing pleasurable hobbies, and engaging in community groups. In reciprocation of these activities, people reap a sense of meaning and purpose. Social connections. Studies of adults 50 years and older show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with a higher risk of disease, disability, and mortality. [7-10] The U.S. Health and Retirement study comprised of 11,302 older participants found that almost 20% met criteria for loneliness. [7] Those who experienced persistent loneliness had a 57% increased risk of early death compared with those who never experienced loneliness; those who were socially isolated had a 28% increased risk. Participants who experienced both loneliness and social isolation showed signs of advanced biological aging (e.g., chronic inflammation that can increase the risk of morbidities). Conversely, people experiencing cognitive decline may have less social contact due to greater difficulty initiating and maintaining social interactions. [11] Brain stimulation. Stressing the brain or doing activities that entail strenuous mental effort, such as learning a new skill, language, or exercise format during leisure time may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Research has shown a strong association of attaining higher education and engaging in work that is intellectually demanding with a lower risk of dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cognitive impairment. [10,12] Improving sleep quality. Research is still inconclusive, but some reports suggest that insomnia is associated with higher rates of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline. Chronic disrupted sleep may lead to systemic (throughout the body) inflammation, which is a precursor to the development of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain as found with AD. [13] The reverse can also occur with advanced stages of AD causing disturbed circadian rhythms that regulate sleep. However, a cohort study of 1,629 adults aged 48 to 91 years from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative did not find that sleep disturbance affected cognitive decline in later years. [14] Intermittent fasting. Animal research shows that caloric restriction over a lifetime, such as with intermittent fasting, increases lifespan. [15] The body responds to fasting with improved regulation of blood glucose, greater stress resistance, and decreased inflammation and production of damaging free radicals. During fasting, cells remove or repair damaged molecules. [15] These effects may prevent the development of chronic disorders including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological decline including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. [16] Other effects of intermittent fasting in animals include better balance and coordination, and improved cognition, specifically with memory. Human studies have found improved insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure, decreased LDL cholesterol, and weight loss. [15,17] However, human studies and randomized controlled trials on the effects of fasting on aging and longevity are still needed. How sensory changes with aging affect how we eat We know that taste is key when enjoying a meal, but what about the smell, texture, appearance, colorfulness, mouthfeel, and even the sound of food (how it crunches in the mouth or sizzles when cooking)? These are the human senses that contribute to the eating experience and influence our food choices. [18] These senses can decline over time for various reasons: normal aging, which causes a gradual decrease in taste and smell; prescription drugs that reduce taste sensitivity and promote dry mouth or lack of saliva; deficiencies in micronutrients such as zinc that reduce taste; and poor dentition with tooth loss or dentures leading to chewing problems. [19] Up to 60% of adults 70 years and older may lose their sense of taste. [20] With this loss may come heavier seasoning of food with sugar and salt. [21] They may prefer softer lower-fiber foods that don\u2019t require much chewing. Poor taste and smell in the elderly is associated with lower dietary quality and poorer appetite. [22] Food aromas are important as they trigger the release of saliva, stomach acid, and enzymes in preparation for digestion. [23] The scent of food can trigger the release of dopamine and serotonin, causing a feeling of wellbeing to encourage eating. An impaired sense of smell in older adults is also associated with less variety in food choices and poorer nutrition, but can also lead to increased food intake and weight gain in some individuals. [23] Seasoning food more liberally with sodium-free herbs, spices, and vinegars may help to compensate for sensory deficiencies. Using foods with a savory umami quality like mushrooms, tomatoes, some cheeses, and yeast can boost richness and flavor. Another sensory aspect of food called \u201ckokumi\u201d describes a full and rich mouthfeel\u2014such as that experienced from a minestrone soup, an aged cheese, or a seafood stew simmering for many hours. If poor appetite from sensory loss is a problem, providing variety through different textures, smells, and colors in the meal may stimulate an increased desire to eat. [21] Eating and food preparation are also important activities offering socialization and mental stimulation such as when learning new cooking skills. Preparing meals helps to reduce sedentariness as there are several action steps involved: selecting and purchasing, washing and chopping, and cooking the ingredients. Spotlight on longevity in Japan Japanese women and men currently live five to six years longer than Americans, so their practices are of great interest. In Japanese families, elders are highly revered and households are intergenerational. Japanese elders are generally healthier than Western elders, but is this the chicken or the egg? Does better health from good lifestyle habits allow them to stay physically active and involved in society so they remain a valuable asset and reap psychosocial benefits, or is it the culture that reveres elders so they have better mental health, less loneliness, and better healthcare so that they stay healthier longer? Japan has also largely avoided the epidemic of obesity that the U.S. is experiencing; for example, the prevalence of obesity among U.S. women is about 37% but among Japanese women is less than 5%. [24] This difference is certainly an important contributor to differences in life expectancy, but raises questions about how the Japanese have been able to control their weight. In recent years, diets in Japan have become more similar to those in the U.S. but they still eat smaller portions, more fermented foods, less sweets, and less red meat. Looking Ahead Identifying additional factors that improve and extend our healthspans is an active area of scientific inquiry. In the meantime, current research findings are encouraging, and underscore the importance of following healthy lifestyle habits throughout one\u2019s life course. That said, sticking to these behaviors is easier said than done, and public policies must support and promote these habits by improving the food and physical environments that surround us.

Yet many of these chronic diseases are preventable, as they\u2019re linked to poor diet and lifestyle choices including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity. The CDC reports some sobering statistics about Americans: Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability. 70% of annual deaths are due to chronic diseases. These preventable conditions not only compromise quality of life, they add to rising health care costs\u201475% of our health care dollars are devoted to treat these diseases. Among adults ages 20 to 74, diabetes remains the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations. The good news is that you have the power to help prevent chronic disease, as making positive diet and lifestyle changes can help reduce risk. Eating healthy foods, getting enough exercise, and refraining from tobacco and excessive alcohol use confer numerous health benefits\u2014including possibly preventing the onset of chronic diseases.

Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play in environments that are conducive to healthy eating and offer opportunities for physical activity. Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy. Strategies for a Healthy Weight Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below. Eat well Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and a healthy eating pattern is crucial to good health. Additionally, how we eat matters too. Eat and drink these: Vegetables, fresh or frozen (choose a rainbow!) Whole fruits, fresh or unsweetened frozen (but minimize fruit juices) Healthy protein sources, including plant protein (tofu, tempeh, legumes, nuts, seeds) and lean animal protein (seafood and skinless poultry) Whole grains like whole wheat, steel-cut oats, intact whole grains like brown rice, bulgur, barley, amaranth, quinoa Healthy fats, including liquid plant oils such as olive, avocado, and sunflower oil Water, tea, coffee (limit excess sweeteners and creams added to these beverages) Eat and drink less of these: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, fruit drinks, high-sugar sports drinks) and foods with added sugar Fruit juices Refined grains (white bread, white rice, white pasta) Red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and processed red meats (salami, ham, bacon, sausage) Low-nutrient ultra-processed foods and snacks, and other highly processed foods, such as fast food How we eat and how much: Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it\u2019s far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating. Eat breakfast. While it seems like skipping a meal is an easy way to cut calories and is often promoted with certain intermittent fasting regimens, skipping breakfast entirely can backfire when hunger comes raging back mid-day, often leading to overeating. Breakfast doesn\u2019t have to mean a big bowl of cereal, eggs, and toast. It may mean a slice of whole grain toast with nut butter, a hardboiled egg or leftover piece of chicken and an orange, or a low-sugar protein smoothie blended with plain Greek yogurt, calcium-fortified plant milk, and fresh fruit. Choose small portions and eat slowly. Slowing down while eating and using smaller bowls or plates can help avoid overeating by giving the brain time to tell the stomach when it\u2019s had enough food. Limiting distractions like turning off screens from phones and computers can also help us to increase our focus and enjoyment on food. Eat at home. Fast food, restaurant meals, and other foods prepared away from home tend to have larger portions and richer ingredients. When cooking meals at home, you have more control what you put into them. If you feel too busy to cook, try meal prep strategies. Eat mindfully. Taking time to think about why you\u2019re eating and if you\u2019re truly hungry can help you to make better food choices. When you do eat, focus all of your senses on the food with sight, smell, touch, and taste so that you can fully enjoy what you are eating. Learn more about mindful eating. What about GLP-1 RA weight loss medications? The billion-dollar popularity of these once-weekly injectable medications is fueled by their dramatic weight loss results, with more pharmaceutical industries rushing to produce them amidst high demand causing shortages. Prescribed initially for treatment of type 2 diabetes, weight loss was a commonly observed side effect, which prompted their use for weight management. After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack. GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4] Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5] Stay active Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit \u201csit time\u201d or being sedentary. See Staying Active for further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages. Limit screen time Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits. Get enough sleep Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise. See Sleep for more guidance. Self-care Today\u2019s world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities. Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies. See Stress and Health for more information and tips.

Heart disease afflicts or kills as many as one in two adults in the United States and other developed countries. [1] Types Two harmful internal processes underlie most forms of heart disease: Atherosclerosis: atherosclerosis is the accumulation of cholesterol-filled plaque in the inner walls of an artery. It is usually accompanied by low-grade inflammation. Atherosclerosis is a slow-growing, generally silent condition that plays a key role in many types of heart disease. It can begin during teenage years, or even earlier. Atherosclerosis first appears as whitish streaks on the inner lining of artery walls. As more and more cholesterol enters the artery wall, these fatty streaks turn into plaques\u2014pockets of cholesterol, white blood cells, and more. Plaque can bulge outward into the bloodstream, or inward away from the bloodstream. Large plaques can narrow the opening available for blood flow, causing chest pain, or angina, during physical exertion or stress. Large and small plaques can rupture, creating a blood clot that, if too large, can completely block blood flow in the vessels, causing a heart attack or stroke. Endothelial dysfunction: the endothelium is the layer of tissue that lines the inside of arteries. A healthy endothelium works to keep an artery free from plaque or blood clots. It also allows the artery to easily widen and narrow to regulate blood flow. Smoking, high blood pressure, and other \u201cinsults\u201d can cause the endothelium to malfunction. Endothelial dysfunction harms health directly and also contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction can be prevented. Halting them once they\u2019ve started, or reversing them, is possible too, but is much harder to achieve. Atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction can lead to a variety of conditions: Coronary artery disease: atherosclerosis in one or more arteries that nourish the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease underlies: Angina: chest pain or discomfort with exertion or stress. Angina occurs when the heart\u2019s demand for oxygen (because it is working harder) outstrips the coronary arteries\u2019 abilities to supply part of the heart with enough oxygenated blood. Heart attack: the complete blockage of blood flow through an artery, which prevents part of the heart muscle from receiving any oxygenated blood. Such blockages occur when a plaque ruptures and a clot forms to seal the break. If the clot is large enough, it can completely block the blood vessel. A clot can also break away and lodge in a smaller artery. Stroke: essentially a brain attack. Most strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery feeding part of the brain (these are called ischemic strokes). Without a constant supply of oxygen, brain cells rapidly die. About 20% of strokes occur when a blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain (these are called hemorrhagic strokes). Heart failure: the inability of the heart to pump blood through the body as efficiently as it should. This prevents other organs from getting as much oxygenated blood as they need to carry out their functions Heart arrhythmias: potentially harmful changes in the rhythm of the heartbeat. They include ventricular fibrillation, which nearly always causes death, and atrial fibrillation, which causes fatigue and increases the risk of stroke. Valve disorders: four valves inside the heart ensure a one-way flow of blood through the heart and around the body. Corrosion of a valve can cause it to leak, which makes the heart work harder. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath or lead to heart failure. Peripheral artery disease: atherosclerosis-induced reductions in circulation to the arms, legs, kidneys, digestive system, and other parts of the body. Cognitive decline: age-related memory loss and decline in thinking abilities. Although it is usually blamed on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a common cause is poor blood flow to the brain through atherosclerosis-narrowed arteries. The American Heart Association estimates that around 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of heart disease or the after-effects of stroke. [2] It\u2019s also the number one cause of death globally: more people die annually from cardiovascular diseases than from any other cause. [3] Risk Factors Several factors influence your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, or developing another form of heart disease. Some of these you can\u2019t change; some you can: Non-modifiable risk factors (risk factors you can\u2019t change) include: age, gender, genes, and ethnic origin. There\u2019s also strong evidence that your early development in the womb and during childhood helps set the stage for heart health or heart disease. Risk factors that can be modified include habits and choices such as: tobacco use, physical activity, and what you eat and drink. Other potentially modifiable risk factors include air pollution, noise, stress, and infection, though these are not as easy for an individual to control directly. And all of the above affect physiologic factors like blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar. Having a risk factor doesn\u2019t automatically mean you will develop heart disease. But the more of them you have, the higher your odds\u2014unless you take action. Calculating risk Several models have been developed to help individuals predict their risk of having a heart attack or developing heart disease. The American Heart Association has endorsed the use of these models in the primary prevention setting. [4] My Life Check is an online health assessment tool created by the American Heart Association that encourages forming habits that will promote heart health. Based on answers to the questionnaire, one will receive recommendations, ability to log goals, and track one\u2019s progress. It requires you to create a username and password, but is a free service. The Reynolds Risk Score is a validated tool developed from the Women\u2019s Health Study and Physicians Health Study that predicts the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or heart disease in the next 10 years, accounting for age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol, family history, and C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation. The ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus is a calculator developed by the American College of Cardiology for healthcare providers to estimate the 10-year risk of an initial heart attack or stroke in patients who are 40-79 years of age, accounting for age, sex, race, cholesterol, blood pressure, and disease history. It then outlines treatment guidelines with lifestyle changes and/or medication. These calculators are useful for estimating the risk of developing heart disease among individuals who already have strong risk factors and who are at high risk for having a heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event. However, these calculators may underestimate the true lifetime burden of heart disease, especially in middle-aged adults, as more than half of all such cardiovascular events occur in individuals who aren\u2019t classified as high risk. [5] In addition, while most American adults have low short-term risk of heart disease, two-thirds of them have a high lifetime risk. [6] Prevention Is Possible Although some types of heart disease have an unknown cause or are inherited at birth, the good news is that the most common conditions like heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure can be largely prevented by making healthy dietary and lifestyle choices. Compelling data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study show that women who followed a healthy lifestyle pattern were 80% less likely to develop coronary artery disease over a 14-year period compared to all other women in the study. [7] In a companion study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, men also reaped similar benefits from making healthy choices. [8] A healthy lifestyle pattern may prevent more than 50% of deaths due to ischemic strokes,[9] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [10] and 75% of all deaths due to cardiovascular disease.

[1] All three have similar elements, but different starting times and different effects. Secondary prevention. These efforts are started after someone has a heart attack or stroke, undergoes angioplasty or bypass surgery, or develops some other form of heart disease. It involves taking medications like aspirin and/or a cholesterol-lowering statin, quitting smoking and losing weight if needed, exercising more, and following a healthy diet. Although secondary prevention may sound like \u201cclosing the barn door after the horse has gone,\u201d it isn\u2019t. These steps can prevent a second heart attack or stroke, halt the progression of heart disease, and prevent early death. It may be obvious, but the number one killer of individuals who survive a first heart attack is a second heart attack. Primary prevention. Primary prevention aims to keep an individual at risk of heart disease from having a first heart attack or stroke, needing angioplasty or surgery, or developing some other form of heart disease. Primary prevention is usually aimed at people who already have developed cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. As with secondary prevention, primary prevention focuses on controlling these risk factors by making healthy lifestyle changes and, if needed, taking medications. That said, the appearance of worrisome cardiovascular risk factors means that inflammation, atherosclerosis, and/or endothelial dysfunction are already at work and, in most cases, aren\u2019t reversible. Primordial prevention. The word \u201cprimordial\u201d means existing from the beginning. Primordial prevention involves working to prevent inflammation, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction from taking hold, and thus prevent risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, excess weight, and ultimately cardiovascular events. Once rarely discussed, primordial prevention is now the cornerstone of the American Heart Association\u2019s definition of ideal heart health and efforts to help people achieve it. [1] As its name implies, the sooner you can start practicing primordial prevention\u2014ideally from childhood on\u2014the more likely you are to achieve it and protect yourself from heart disease. Steps for the Primordial Prevention of Heart Disease Five key lifestyle steps can dramatically reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately heart disease: 1. Not smoking One of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease. In fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2] This study also reported that much of the excess risk due to smoking may be drastically lowered after quitting. Additionally, the excess risk for all-cause mortality\u2014that is, death from any cause\u2014decreases to the level of a \u201cnever-smoker\u201d 20 years after quitting. The nicotine that tobacco products deliver is one of the most addictive substances around. That makes tobacco use one of the toughest unhealthy habits to break. But don\u2019t get discouraged; many smokers do quit! In fact, in the United States today there are more ex-smokers than smokers. [3] Learn more about the hazards of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and tips for quitting from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2. Maintaining a healthy weight Excess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well as a host of other health problems. [4-6] In a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7] In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer. Those who gained more than 22 pounds had an even greater risk of developing these diseases. [4,8-11] Weight and height go hand-in-hand. The taller you are, the more you weigh. That\u2019s why researchers have devised several measures that account for both weight and height. The one most commonly used is BMI. You can calculate your BMI by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m2). You can also use an online BMI calculator or BMI table. A healthy BMI is under 25 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 Waist size matters, too. In people who are not overweight, waist size may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI. [12] An expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health identified these useful benchmarks: Men should aim for a waist size below 40 inches (102 cm) and women should aim for a waist size below 35 inches (88 cm). [13] 3. Exercising Exercise and physical activity are excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions, [14-16] but many of us get less activity as we get older. Getting regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your health. It lowers the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, and it can also help control stress, improve sleep, boost mood, keep weight in check, and reduce the risk of falling and improve cognitive function in older adults. It doesn\u2019t take marathon training to see real health gains. A 30-minute brisk walk five days of the week will provide important benefits for most people. Getting any amount of exercise is better than none. Exercise and physical activity benefit the body, while a sedentary lifestyle does the opposite\u2014increasing the chances of becoming overweight and developing a number of chronic diseases. Research shows that people who spend more time each day watching television, sitting, or riding in cars have a greater chance of dying early than people who are more active. [17-19] A 2013 study showed that, among women ages 50-79 with no cardiovascular disease at the start of study, prolonged sitting time was associated with increased heart disease risk regardless of the amount of time spent in leisure-time physical activity. [16] 4. Following a healthy diet For years, research into connections between diet and heart disease focused on individual nutrients like cholesterol (and foods high in dietary cholesterol, like eggs), types of fats, and specific vitamins and minerals. This work has been revealing, but it has also generated some dead ends, along with myths and confusion about what constitutes a heart-healthy diet. That\u2019s because people eat food, not nutrients. The best diet for preventing heart disease is one that is full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, poultry, and vegetable oils; includes alcohol in moderation, if at all; and goes easy on red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates, foods and beverages with added sugar, sodium, and foods with trans fat. People with diets consistent with this dietary pattern had a 31% lower risk of heart disease, a 33% lower risk of diabetes, and a 20% lower risk of stroke. [20] A randomized controlled trial found that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, both rich sources of unsaturated fat, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with cardiovascular disease over a 4.8-year follow-up period. This study highlighted that low-fat diets are not beneficial to heart health, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 can improve heart health and weight loss. There isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes into account the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern, including: high intake of olive oil, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and cereals; moderate intake of fish and poultry; low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets; and wine in moderation, consumed with meals. [21] A 2020 study focused on dietary scores for 4 healthy eating patterns: Healthy Eating Index\u20132015 ; Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score; Healthful Plant-Based Diet Index; and Alternate Healthy Eating Index. Despite different scoring methods, each of these patterns emphasizes higher intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts, and lower intakes of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. The study found that those who adhered most to healthy eating patterns had a 14% to 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with those who adhered least. The findings also showed that these different healthy eating patterns were similarly effective at lowering risk across racial and ethnic groups and other subgroups studied, and that they were statistically significantly associated with lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke. [22] Sodium and potassium are two interrelated minerals that play major roles in regulating blood pressure and a healthy heart. Eating less salty foods and more potassium-rich foods may significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. [29] Potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy. But the reverse of eating a lot of sodium-rich foods especially from processed breads, packaged snacks, canned goods, and fast-food meals while skimping on potassium can increase cardiovascular disease risk. 5. Improving sleep health Research has shown that sleep is an essential component of cardiovascular health. Sleeping for too short or too long a stretch is associated with heart disease and can negatively affect other heart-related risk factors like dietary intake, exercise, weight, blood pressure, and inflammation. [30] There are various reasons causing poor sleep, including clinical sleep disorders, working overnight shifts, or poor sleep hygiene. Talk with your doctor if you have frequent restless nights or do not feel adequately rested during the day. Improving sleep habits can make a difference. Examples include setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it, having a calming bedtime ritual like doing stretches or meditating, getting regular exercise, stopping use of electronic devices an hour before bedtime, and avoiding heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol several hours before bed. Other factors to consider Along with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. Learn more at the American Heart Association\u2019s \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8.\u201d Supportive policy change Despite the power of individual behavior change, it must be noted that unfavorable eating patterns are driven by a variety of biological, social, economic, and psychological factors. This is acknowledged in a 2018 review paper, which recommends that \u201cgovernments should focus on cardiovascular disease as a global threat and enact policies that will reach all levels of society and create a food environment wherein healthy foods are accessible, affordable, and desirable.\u201d [23] The central illustration of the paper (below) highlights several policy strategies that may help boost healthy eating, such as improving nutrition labels, regulating food marketing, and promoting healthy school and work environments. Reprinted from Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Vol 72, Issue 8, E Yu, VS Malik, FB Hu, Cardiovascular Disease Prevention by Diet Modification: JACC Health Promotion Series, 914-926, 2018, with permission from Elsevier. Putting It All Together You can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits: Don\u2019t smoke (or quit if you do) Maintain a healthy weight Exercise; be active Follow a healthy diet Improve sleep health Strong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.

Body mass index (BMI) is one tool used to screen for excessive body fat. A BMI value of more than 25 is categorized as overweight, and a BMI value of more than 30 is categorized as obese. Why use BMI? BMI is one of the most widely used screening tools for estimating excess body fat. However, it can be a controversial measure as it only accounts for one\u2019s height and weight and not the amount of, location of, or types of body fat. It does not distinguish between fat mass and fat-free mass (lean body mass) that includes muscle and the body\u2019s tissues and organs, which contribute to total body weight. That said, BMI is simple to measure and noninvasive, and research has shown that BMI often correlates with \u201cgold standard\u201d direct measures of fat mass and fat-free mass such as dual X-ray absorptiometry. Learn more about calculating BMI and other methods of measuring body fat. Health Impacts There are negative health impacts associated with excess body fat. The WHO estimates that in 2019, 5 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes were caused by a high BMI, and rates of obesity continue to grow globally in children and adults. [1] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S., 1 in 5 children and 1 in 3 adults has obesity. [2] Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults and the associated risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. What is a healthy BMI in children? Ethnic and racial differences in BMI and disease Weight gain of greater than 10 pounds in adulthood also increases disease risk (i.e., heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones) even in those whose BMI remains in the normal range, according to research from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. [15-19] With the five leading causes of death \u2013 heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, and unintentional injuries \u2013 obesity is a major risk factor for the first four. [20] Obesity is also associated with other health conditions such as sleep apnea, fatty liver disease, gallstones, infertility, respiratory diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis. No less real are the social and emotional effects of obesity which may include discrimination, lower quality of life, and susceptibility to depression. Economic Impacts Obesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion annually. [2] This includes money spent directly on medical care and prescription drugs related to obesity. In the workplace, research has shown that the number of sick days, short-term disability, and workers\u2019 compensation days increase with increasing BMI. [21] Compared with an employee with a BMI of 25, an employee with a BMI of 35 has nearly double the risk of a disability or workers\u2019 compensation claim. Perhaps one of the most surprising consequences of the current obesity epidemic in the U.S. is its impact on recruitment for the armed services, with data showing that 3 in 5 young adults carry too much weight to qualify for military service. [2] Trends According to the WHO, worldwide obesity rates are rising with 1 in 8 people, or more than 1 billion people, around the world living with obesity. [14] A Lancet review showed that global adult obesity doubled from 1990 to 2022, and adolescent obesity quadrupled. [22] As low to middle-income countries adopt unhealthy eating patterns and behaviors of industrialized nations such as less physical activity, so do their obesity rates. Specific regions including Polynesia, Micronesia, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and north Africa showed the greatest increases in obesity, as well as higher-income countries such as Chile. [22] Increased eating out of home, access to ultra-processed low-nutrient-dense foods, and sedentariness (e.g., sitting at work, driving instead of walking or bicycling) have contributed. Higher cost and limited access to healthy foods and decreased opportunities for play and sports may cause inequalities in obesity and could limit the impact of policies that target unhealthy foods. [22] The NCD Risk Factor Collaboration visualizes the prevalence of obesity globally as well as changing obesity rates in various countries since 1990. Below are data summaries of obesity rates for both adults and children around the world: North America Latin America and the Caribbean Europe Central, East, West and South Africa North Africa and the Middle East Asia Oceania Risk Factors Various factors can influence body weight or greater weight gain in specific areas of the body. Some of these cannot be changed, but others may be modified: Non-modifiable risk factors (risk factors you can\u2019t change): age, gender, genes, ethnic origin, and sometimes medications that change how energy is processed in the body leading to weight gain. There\u2019s also strong evidence that having obesity in infancy or childhood increases the chances of remaining obese in adulthood. Risk factors that can be modified: food and beverages consumed, level of physical activity, daily screen time (increased screen time is associated with reduced physical activity time and also increases exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods/beverages), poor sleep hygiene, uncontrolled negative stress. While easier said than done, evidence has shown that addressing these factors as early as possible, even in childhood, may reduce the risk of developing obesity. Obesity is complex and not just about being born with a certain body size, taking in more calories than the body needs, or burning extra calories through exercise to lose weight. It is often the result of a combination of several non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. When looking at diet and food, which is often the focus with obesity, there are various factors to consider than just calories in/calories out: Living in a food environment that lacks access to healthy food choices or income-related barriers to regularly consuming a variety of healthy foods. Amount of low-nutrient ultra-processed foods and sugary beverages consumed, especially when displacing high-fiber whole foods, which can increase cravings. Eating behaviors such as skipping meals and eating heavy meals or snacks at night before bed. Overeating portions not from hunger but from stress or boredom. The environments that surround us also play an important role, as they can make a modifiable risk factor a non-modifiable one. Examples are when someone does not have the ability to secure healthy food choices due to living in a food desert or a safe place to perform regular physical activity. Are genes to blame for weight gain? Is Prevention Possible? Many factors contribute to rising rates of obesity in children and adults. Among them, the abundance of low-priced, high-calorie ultra processed foods and sugary drinks; incessant marketing driving people to eat more; and an environment that reduces the need for regular physical activity. Although preventing weight gain over the years of life may not be possible for everyone due to a variety of circumstances, there are strategies to reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. However, focusing only on the individual (e.g., nutrition and lifestyle education, weight loss medications) has little impact on global obesity prevalence. Prevention requires a broader scope that addresses food systems and an obesogenic environment, including policy changes such as regulating the marketing of ultra-processed low-nutrient-dense foods and taxing items such as sugar-sweetened beverages. Indeed, what sometimes gets lost in the discussion is that obesity is preventable. We can turn around the obesity epidemic by collaboratively creating an environment where the default option is the healthy choice.

The body has intricate mechanisms in place to make sure glucose levels in the blood don\u2019t go too low or soar too high. When you eat, most digestible carbohydrates are converted into glucose and quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. Any rise in blood sugar signals the pancreas to make and release the hormone insulin, which instructs cells to sponge up glucose. Without insulin, glucose floats around the bloodstream, unable to slip inside the cells that need it for energy. Diabetes mellitus is a condition of abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood because either the body is not making enough insulin or can\u2019t properly use the insulin it makes. Normally, blood glucose rises after eating a meal but then drops in 1-2 hours as the glucose is shuttled out of the blood and into cells. In people with diabetes, their blood glucose may remain elevated for several hours. Their blood glucose may also rise much higher after eating a meal than someone who does not have diabetes. What is hypoglycemia? There are different types of diabetes, including prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The most common types in the U.S. are prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, which are largely influenced by carrying excess body fat, a poor diet, and lack of exercise. Almost 30 million Americans have diabetes; of those, about 7 million don\u2019t know they have the disease. [1] About 84 million adults have a condition called prediabetes that is a precursor to full-blown diabetes. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed cases of diabetes in the U.S. was $327 billion including direct medical costs and reduced productivity. (1) If the spread of type 2 diabetes continues at its present rate, the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the United States will increase to about 48 million in 2050. [2] Worldwide, the number of adults with diabetes will rise to 439 million in the year 2030. [3] Secondary health problems stemming from diabetes are equally alarming. High blood glucose levels can damage organs and tissues. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and kidney failure among adults. It causes mild to severe nerve damage that, coupled with diabetes-related circulation problems, often leads to the loss of a leg or foot. Diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and strokes. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., directly causing almost 80,000 deaths each year and contributing to thousands more. [1,4,5] Types of Diabetes Type 1 diabetes mellitus Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) Gestational diabetes mellitus Prediabetes Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 Diabetes (and Prediabetes) Can Be Prevented Type 2 diabetes, once called adult-onset diabetes, is striking an ever-growing number of adults. Even more alarming, it is now showing up in teenagers and children. With the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups. In the U.S., the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study found that type 2 diabetes accounted for only 6% of new diabetes cases in non-Hispanic white children ages 10 to 19, but anywhere from 22-76% of new cases in other ethnic groups [8]. The highest rates were found in Asia-Pacific Islander and Native American youth. Although the genes you inherit may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, they take a back seat to behavioral and lifestyle factors. Data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study suggest that 90% of type 2 diabetes in women can be attributed to five such factors: excess weight, lack of exercise, a less-than-healthy diet, smoking, and abstaining from alcohol. [13] Among 85,000 married female nurses, 3,300 developed type 2 diabetes over a 16-year period. Women in the low-risk group were 90% less likely to have developed diabetes than the rest of the women. Low-risk meant a healthy weight (body mass index less than 25), a healthy diet, 30 minutes or more of exercise daily, no smoking, and having about three alcoholic drinks per week. Similar factors are at work in men. Data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study indicate that a \u201cWestern\u201d diet, combined with lack of physical activity and excess weight, dramatically increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in men. [14] Information from several clinical trials strongly supports the idea that type 2 diabetes is preventable. The Diabetes Prevention Program examined the effect of weight loss and increased exercise on the development of type 2 diabetes among men and women with high blood sugar readings that hadn\u2019t yet crossed the line to diabetes. In the group assigned to weight loss and exercise, there were 58% fewer cases of diabetes after almost three years than in the group assigned to usual care. [15] Even after the program to promote lifestyle changes ended, the benefits persisted: The risk of diabetes was reduced, albeit to a lesser degree, over 10 years. [16] Similar results were seen in a Finnish study of weight loss, exercise, and dietary change, and in a Chinese study of exercise and dietary change. [17\u201320] Is diabetes reversible? Is it possible to reverse or cure diabetes? The answer is maybe. When someone reports that they have \u201creversed\u201d their diabetes, this actually means that they were able to stop using diabetes medication after making healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, following a healthful diet, and exercising. If prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes is detected early in an individual who immediately initiates healthy lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse or at least stop the progression of the disease. However, if these types of diabetes are not diagnosed early or are not well-controlled for a long period, the cells of the pancreas can become permanently damaged so that they no longer produce insulin. If this happens, chances are higher that diet and exercise alone may no longer be effective in controlling the diabetes and lifelong medication may be needed. The same is true with type 1 diabetes and LADA, in which the pancreas already does not make enough insulin. With these conditions, the diabetes can be managed but not reversed. The good news is that type 2 diabetes (as well as prediabetes) are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by healthy lifestyle practices, including controlling your weight, following a healthy diet, staying active, and not smoking.

Overview If type 2 diabetes were an infectious disease, passed from one person to another, public health officials would say we\u2019re in the midst of an epidemic. This difficult disease is striking an ever-growing number of adults, and with the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups (learn more about diabetes, including the other types and risk factors). The good news is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by making lifestyle changes. These same changes can also lower the chances of developing heart disease and some cancers. The key to prevention can be boiled down to five words: Stay lean and stay active. What if I already have diabetes? Guidelines for preventing or lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes are also appropriate if you currently have a diabetes diagnosis. Achieving a healthy weight, eating a balanced carbohydrate-controlled diet, and getting regular exercise all help to improve blood glucose control. If you are taking insulin medication, you may need more or less carbohydrate at a meal or snack to ensure a healthy blood glucose range. There may also be special dietary needs for exercise, such as bringing a snack so that your blood glucose does not drop too low. For specific guidance on scenarios such as these, refer to your diabetes care team who are the best resources for managing your type of diabetes. Simple Steps to Lowering Your Risk Control your weight Excess weight is the single most important cause of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven-fold. Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone with a healthy weight. [1] Losing weight can help if your weight is above the healthy-weight range. Losing 7-10% of your current weight can cut your chances of developing type 2 diabetes in half. Get moving\u2014and turn off the television Inactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. [2] Working your muscles more often and making them work harder improves their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. This puts less stress on your insulin-making cells. So trade some of your sit-time for fit-time. Long bouts of hot, sweaty exercise aren\u2019t necessary to reap this benefit. Findings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study suggest that walking briskly for a half hour every day reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30%. [3,4] More recently, The Black Women\u2019s Health Study reported similar diabetes-prevention benefits for brisk walking of more than 5 hours per week. [5] This amount of exercise has a variety of other benefits as well. And even greater cardiovascular and other advantages can be attained by more, and more intense, exercise. Television-watching appears to be an especially-detrimental form of inactivity: Every two hours you spend watching TV instead of pursuing something more active increases the chances of developing diabetes by 20%; it also increases the risk of heart disease (15%) and early death (13%). [6] The more television people watch, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese, and this seems to explain part of the TV viewing-diabetes link. The unhealthy diet patterns associated with TV watching may also explain some of this relationship. Tune Up Your Diet Four dietary changes can have a big impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes. 1. Choose whole grains and whole grain products over refined grains and other highly processed carbohydrates. 2. Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water, coffee, or tea instead. 3. Choose healthy fats. 4. Limit red meat and avoid processed meat; choose nuts, beans, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead. Don\u2019t smoke Add type 2 diabetes to the long list of health problems linked with smoking. Smokers are roughly 50% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers, and heavy smokers have an even higher risk. [33] Light to moderate alcohol consumption Evidence has consistently linked moderate alcohol consumption with reduced risk of heart disease. The same may be true for type 2 diabetes. Moderate amounts of alcohol\u2014up to a drink a day for women, up to two drinks a day for men\u2014increases the efficiency of insulin at getting glucose inside cells. And some studies indicate that moderate alcohol consumption decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes. [1, 34-39], but excess alcohol intake actually increases the risk. If you already drink alcohol, the key is to keep your consumption in the moderate range, as higher amounts of alcohol could increase diabetes risk. [40] If you don\u2019t drink alcohol, there\u2019s no need to start\u2014you can get the same benefits by losing weight, exercising more, and changing your eating patterns. Beyond Individual Behavior Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by taking several simple steps: keeping weight under control, exercising more, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. Yet it is clear that the burden of behavior change cannot fall entirely on individuals. Families, schools, worksites, healthcare providers, communities, media, the food industry, and government must work together to make healthy choices easy choices.

However, even for cancers with effective treatment options, prevention has the greatest potential to reduce the burden of cancer in the general population. [1] Because each person is exposed to unique environmental and lifestyle factors, cancer risk can vary. Although some factors cannot be controlled (such as inherited genetic mutations), there is a range of modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors that can help reduce the risk of developing cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a 30-40% cancer burden can be attributed to lifestyle risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. [2] In a 2018 report by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR), not-for-profit organizations that lead a network of cancer prevention charities with a global reach, 10 cancer prevention recommendations on diet and nutrition were developed. These recommendations were based on the continuous update project of evidence in cancer research, which summarizes current evidence with relevant papers from randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. [3] Taken together, they promote a lifestyle consisting of a healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and weight management. This may not only help reduce the risk of cancer but may also contribute to the prevention of obesity and other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here is a closer look at some of their recommendations: Maintain a Healthy Weight In a meta-analysis conducted by the WCRF/AICR, there is convincing evidence that carrying extra fat mass, marked by a higher body mass index (BMI), greater waist circumference, and greater waist-to-hip ratio, significantly increases the risk of several cancers: [4] BMI measures one\u2019s weight in relation to height. A BMI between 18.5-25 is classified as normal, 25.1-29.9 overweight, and 30 or higher obese. Each increase of 5 points in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk of endometrial cancer, 48% higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, 30% higher risk of kidney cancer, 30% higher risk of liver cancer, 12% higher risk for postmenopausal breast cancer, 10% higher risk of pancreatic cancer, and 5% higher risk of colorectal cancer. Each 4-inch increase in waist circumference was shown to increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 34%, pancreatic cancer by 11%, postmenopausal breast cancer by 11%, kidney cancer by 11%, endometrial cancer by 5%, and colorectal cancer by 2%. A waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) measures one\u2019s waist size divided by hip size. People who carry more weight in the belly (apple shape) are at higher risk for cancer and other chronic diseases than those who carry more weight in the hips (pear shape). The WHO recommends a healthy WHR to be 0.9 or less in men and 0.85 or less in women. Each 0.1 unit increase in waist-hip ratio significantly increased the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 38%, kidney cancer by 26%, endometrial cancer by 21%, pancreatic cancer by 19%, postmenopausal breast cancer by 10%, and colorectal cancer by 2%. Significant increasing weight in adult life is a convincing cause of postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Each 11-pound increase in weight gain during adulthood was significantly associated with a 16% higher risk of endometrial cancer, and 6% higher risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Incidence of obesity-related cancers is also rising in young adults. Researchers from the American Cancer Society collected data from 25 state cancer registries for people ages 25-84 years diagnosed with any cancer from 1995 to 2014. [5] Over this time period, incidence rates of several obesity-related cancers\u2014including colorectal, kidney, and pancreatic\u2014increased significantly in the youngest age group, ages 25-49 years (with the sharpest increases in progressively younger ages). Although the incidence of these cancers also rose in older age groups, the rate of increase was much smaller. Be Physically Active Physical activity is defined as any movement that uses skeletal muscles and requires more energy than does resting. Physical activity can include working, exercising, performing household chores, and leisure-time activities such as walking, jogging, running, yoga, hiking, bicycling, and swimming. There is evidence from a 2009 meta-analysis of 52 epidemiologic studies showing that the most physically active individuals had a 24% lower risk of colon cancer than those who were the least physically active. [6] A 2013 meta-analysis of 31 prospective studies showed that the average breast cancer risk reduction associated with physical activity was 12%, and the protective effect was stronger for postmenopausal women. [7] After menopause, women who increase their physical activity may also have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who do not. [8] Sedentary behaviors, such as spending an extended amount of time sitting, reclining, or lying down, may also increase cancer risk. [9] The review of research on sedentary behavior and risk of endometrial, colon, and lung cancers found that the highest versus lowest levels of sedentary time increased risks of these cancers by a statistically significant range of 20-35%. [10] Eat a Healthful Diet An overall healthy dietary pattern has the potential to lower cancer risk by 10-20%. [11] The association between diet and cancer incidence varies by cancer sites and also by sex, [12] but the recommended components of a healthy diet are often similar. The WCRF/AICR listed the following dietary recommendations to protect against cancer: Limit alcohol consumption. [13] There is strong evidence that consumption of alcoholic drinks is a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx and larynx, esophagus (squamous cell carcinoma), liver, colorectum, and breast (particularly postmenopause). Every 10 grams of alcohol (as ethanol) consumed per day elevated the risks of these cancers by 4-25%. The evidence shows that alcoholic drinks of all types have a similar impact on cancer risk. This recommendation therefore covers all types of alcoholic drinks, whether beer, wine, spirits (liquors), or any other alcoholic drinks, as well as other alcohol sources. Eat a diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and beans. [14] Make whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and pulses (legumes) such as beans and lentils a major part of your daily diet. There is strong evidence that eating whole grains protects against colorectal cancer, and that eating foods containing dietary fiber protects against colorectal cancer, weight gain, overweight, and obesity, which, as described above, increases the risk of many cancers. Limit \u201cfast\u201d foods. [15] Fast foods are readily available convenience foods that tend to be energy-dense and are often consumed in large portions. Most of the evidence on fast foods is from studies looking at burgers, fried chicken, French fries, and high-calorie drinks (containing sugar, such as soda; or unhealthy fats, such as shakes). There is strong evidence that diets containing higher amounts of fast foods and other processed foods high in unhealthy fats, starches, or sugars, as well as consuming a \u201cWestern type\u201d diet (characterized by a high amount of added sugars, meat, and fat), are causes of weight gain, overweight, and obesity, which are a risk factor for many cancers. Limit red and processed meat. [16,17] Red meat includes all types of muscle meat from a mammal, including beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat. Processed meat has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation. Although these products are often made from red meat (i.e., ham, salami, bacon, and some sausages such as frankfurters and chorizo), other meats can also be processed (i.e., turkey bacon, chicken sausage, and deli-sliced chicken). While both red and processed meat were suggested to increase the risk of a number of other cancers, the evidence was most convincing for colorectal cancer. The risk of colorectal cancer increased by 16% with every 50g/day of processed meat intake, and by 12% with every 100g/day of red meat intake. Because meat can be a valuable source of nutrients, in particular protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin B12, the recommendation is to limit rather than completely avoid minimally processed red meat. However, poultry and seafood are generally healthier sources of protein as well as many of these other nutrients. Very little, if any, processed meat should be consumed. Limit sugar-sweetened drinks. [18] There is convincing evidence that sugar-sweetened drinks is a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in both children and adults, especially when consumed frequently or in large portions. As noted above, obesity increases the risk of many cancers. Avoid Tobacco and Excess Sun Exposure The recommendations also emphasize that not smoking and avoiding other exposure to tobacco and excess sun are also important in reducing cancer risk. Cancer survivorship With improved early detection and availability of more advanced treatment options, people diagnosed with cancer are living much longer. Research on the effects of diet, nutrition, and physical activity on the risk of cancer in cancer survivors is growing, but much more limited than that on risk. Therefore, the lifestyle recommendations mentioned above emphasize that all cancer survivors should receive nutritional care and physical activity guidance from trained professionals. Although evidence is not strong enough to reach firm conclusions, there are indications of links between lifestyle factors and cancer survivorship with improved quality of life and longer survival, especially for more common cancers. For example, maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, eating foods containing fiber, and having a lower intake of saturated fat appear to lead to better survival after a breast cancer diagnosis.[14] Unless otherwise advised, and if they can, all cancer patients and survivors are advised to follow the WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations as long as possible after the acute stage of treatment. These recommendations are also helpful for managing or preventing other chronic diseases after a cancer diagnosis. A study of survivors of the 20 most common cancers revealed that, even after controlling for the overlapped risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular disease such as excessive weight and smoking, survivors of most site-specific cancers had an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases compared with that of the general population. [15] Evidence has shown that certain cancer treatments, for example anthracycline and trastuzumab, can lead to a higher risk of disease and death from cardiovascular complications.

Precision nutrition may sound like a new fad diet, but it is actually a credible emerging area of research supported by the National Institutes of Health under the umbrella of precision medicine. [1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person\u2019s unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or \u201ccure\u201d their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful. Precision nutrition also considers the microbiome, trillions of bacteria in our bodies that play a key role in various daily internal operations. What types and how much bacteria we have are unique to each individual. Our diets can determine which types of bacteria live in our digestive tracts, and according to precision nutrition the reverse is also true: the types of bacteria we house might determine how we break down certain foods and what types of foods are most beneficial for our bodies. How Does It Work? Precision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person\u2019s microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one\u2019s DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease. Applying Precision Nutrition to Disease Management There are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: a gluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU). However precision nutrition is in its early stages and too soon to introduce as a treatment for chronic diseases in the general population. Research is being conducted on the application of precision nutrition for obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). For example, the traditional management of T2DM targets healthy lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, achieving a healthy weight), often with use of medications. Precision nutrition can further tailor diabetes management by looking closely at the following areas: [4,5] How one\u2019s DNA may be related to the intake and metabolism of certain nutrients, which can predict how a person responds to a specific diet. The measurement of metabolites (small molecules created during the breakdown and digestion of food) that reveal a person\u2019s long-term dietary patterns, whether it be eating fruits and vegetables regularly or having a high intake of saturated fat from a daily intake of meats and butter. Precision nutrition would see if there is an association between a person\u2019s metabolic \u201csignature\u201d created by these dietary patterns and their risk of developing T2DM. The metabolic testing used with precision nutrition might help to determine how a person\u2019s body would respond to a specific diet. Discovering types of gut bacteria that help to improve blood glucose control, and implementing dietary patterns that change one\u2019s microbiome to support the growth and maintenance of these specific gut bacteria. Applying Precision Nutrition to Specific Foods Precision nutrition examines how a person\u2019s DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup? Coffee beans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content. Research has discovered genes specifically related to coffee intake. [6] These genes may determine how fast or slowly the caffeine in coffee is metabolized. They are also associated with anti-inflammatory effects and a lower risk of certain chronic diseases. Precision nutrition uses genetic data such as this to determine if an individual would benefit from drinking more or less coffee. Other factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one\u2019s risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations. Challenges and Considerations The field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges\u2014a lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual\u2019s DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided. Primary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.). Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests. Ethical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It\u2019s also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities. We must not lose sight of improving the broader food environment through effective policies, regulations, and other population-based approaches that can help make healthy food choices the default.

The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life. Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1] What Is a Healthy Mouth? The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth. Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases. Oral Health and Nutrition: What You Eat and Drink Affects Your Teeth Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. A balanced diet with adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus contribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such as cheese, milk, plain yogurt, calcium-fortified tofu, leafy greens, and almonds may help tooth health. [2] While protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus. When it comes to a healthy smile, fruits and vegetables are also good choices since they are high in water and fiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins like vitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, and vitamin A, another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2] Water is the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth\u2014particularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth. Fluoride is needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities. Is carbonated water a healthy choice for my teeth? According to available research, carbonated or \u201csparkling\u201d water, although slightly more acidic than regular water, is generally fine for your teeth. [2] While it is great to replace soda with carbonated water, it should not be used as a replacement for water with fluoride. However, not all carbonated waters are created equal. Citrus-flavored waters may have higher acid levels, increasing the risk of damage to tooth enamel. A good way to help protect your teeth is to drink these in one sitting or with meals. If you prefer drinking it without food, another option is to use a straw to help the water bypass your teeth. Remember, sparkling waters that have added sugar are sugar-sweetened beverages, which increase your risk of developing tooth decay and other chronic diseases. How snacking can affect your dental health What you eat and how often you eat can affect your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth and, unless removed daily, this plaque builds up. Plaque bacteria use sugar from things you eat and drink to make acid that attacks tooth enamel. This \u201cacid attack\u201d can last up to 20 minutes even after you\u2019ve finished eating or drinking. This is why snacking all day or sipping a sugary drink for a long period of time can lead to tooth decay. Excess intake of added sugars leads not only to tooth decay but is also associated with other health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. [4] Although you may not be adding that much sugar to your food, you can still be eating more sugar than you realize. This is because added sugars are often hidden. Learning about where sugar may be hiding and how to identify these added sugars can help you win this game of hide and seek. Malnutrition and oral health Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person\u2019s intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition. Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body\u2019s immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6] Oral Health and General Health While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7] Endocarditis and heart disease Pregnancy and birth complications Conditions that impact oral health Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including: Anxiety and stress. Stress is a normal human reaction that everyone experiences at one point or another. However, stress that is left unchecked can contribute to many health problems including oral health issues. While behavioral changes play a leading role in these poor oral health findings, there are certain physiological effects on the body as well. Stress creates a hormone in the body called cortisol. Spikes in this hormone can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to developing periodontal disease. Evidence has shown that stress reduces the flow of saliva which in turn can contribute to dental plaque formation. [12] Certain medications like antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can also cause dry mouth, increasing risk of tooth decay. Additionally, stress may contribute to teeth grinding (or bruxism), clenching, cold sores, and canker sores. Osteoporosis and Paget\u2019s Disease. Medical conditions such as osteoporosis are a fitting example of why it is so important to let your dentist know about all the medications you are taking. Certain medications like antiresorptive agents, a group of drugs that slows bone loss, can influence dental treatment decisions. That is because these medications have been associated with a rare but serious condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can damage the jawbone. Bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Actonel, and Boniva) and Denosumab (or Prolia) are examples of antiresorptive agents. Although it can occur spontaneously, ONJ more commonly occurs following surgical dental procedures like extracting a tooth or implant placement. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are taking antiresorptive agents so they can take that into account when developing your treatment plan. A healthy, pain-free mouth can lead to a better state of mind! Positive oral health can enhance mental and overall health, while neglect of oral health can negatively impact an individual\u2019s self-image and self-esteem. Poor oral health may also affect speech, which can cause or contribute to social anxiety. In this way, regular dental exams and professional cleaning not only help support positive oral health but are also vital to overall well-being and good mental health as well. Eating Concerns: What to Eat If You Have\u2026 Braces and orthodontic treatments Dentures Dry mouth Oral Health Tips Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15] Drink fluoridated water and brush with fluoride toothpaste. Practice good oral hygiene. Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day and floss daily between the teeth to remove dental plaque. Visit your dentist at least once a year (the average person should go twice a year), even if you have no natural teeth or have dentures. Do not use any tobacco products. If you smoke, seek resources to help you quit. Limit alcoholic drinks. Some alcoholic beverages can be very acidic, resulting in erosion of tooth enamel, and those with a high alcohol content can lead to dry mouth. Also be mindful of drink mixers, many of which are high in sugar and can increase the risk of tooth decay. If you have diabetes, work to support control of the disease. This will decrease the risk for other complications, including gum disease. Treating gum disease may help lower your blood sugar level. If your medication causes dry mouth, discuss other medication options with your doctor that may not cause this condition. If dry mouth cannot be avoided, drink plenty of water, chew sugarless gum, and avoid tobacco products and alcohol. Your oral health care provider may be able to recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications to improve your dry mouth as well. See your doctor or a dentist if you experience sudden changes in taste and smell. When acting as a caregiver, help those who are not able to brush and floss their teeth independently. Chew sugar-free xylitol gum between meals and/or when you are unable to brush after a meal. Bottom Line \u2013 There Is No Health Without Oral Health As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn\u2019t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

Normal healthy cells in the body follow certain rules, growing and dividing in an orderly fashion. Eventually they die and are replaced with new cells. But sometimes old or damaged cells do not die and form an abnormal mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors may be benign, meaning that they do not invade nearby healthy tissue. But sometimes they are malignant, in which genes in the cells deviate, causing them to grow and divide erratically and spread into nearby tissues. As cancer cells continue to grow, they may break off from the original growth and travel through the blood or lymph fluid to other parts of the body. Genetic changes can be inherited, or the result of DNA damage caused by external exposures like excessive ultraviolet light or carcinogens like tobacco smoke. The global burden of cancer is rising alongside the world\u2019s aging population: 1 in 5 men and 1 in 6 women worldwide develop some type of cancer during their lifetime, and 1 in 8 men and 1 in 11 women die from the disease. [1] Cancer also takes a huge economic toll. A report from the World Economic Forum and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health projected that the global cost of cancer, including medical costs, non-medical costs, and income losses, will total an estimated U.S. $458 billion in 2030. [2] A cancer diagnosis can also place a heavy toll on the patient and their family. Fortunately, with screening and early detection, as well as ongoing development of cancer treatments, people diagnosed with cancer are living longer than before. Even better is that many cases of cancer are preventable through a range of lifestyle changes, which may also prevent other common chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Types and Risk Factors Cancer is not just one disease. There are more than 100 types, which can start anywhere in the body. They are named by the organ or tissue in which they start growing. They can form in organs, bones, muscles, tendons, fat, blood vessels, and lymph fluid. Examples of more common types include: Carcinoma\u2014This is the most common type, which forms a solid mass of tissue (tumor). Breast, lung, and colorectal cancer are types of carcinomas. Leukemia\u2014This cancer starts in the blood, occurring when large numbers of abnormal white blood cells build up in the blood and bone, crowding out healthy blood cells. A lack of healthy blood cells can lower one\u2019s immune function, increasing the risk of frequent infections, fatigue, and recurrent bruising or bleeding. Lymphoma\u2014This cancer arises in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes normally fight infection, but here they grow out of control. This can cause swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The figures below (click to enlarge) show the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths worldwide in 2020, classified by the cancer site. [3] Lung cancer contributes to the greatest number of new cancer cases in women and men combined. However in women, breast cancer contributes to more new cases, and slightly edges out lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths. In men, lung cancer contributes the greatest number of new cases (followed by prostate cancer) and is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Other common cancers include those of the colon and rectum, stomach, liver, pancreas, esophagus, and cervix, which, together with lung, breast, and prostate cancer account for over half of all cancer cases and deaths worldwide. The other 46% of cases and 39.5% of deaths are from a variety of other types of cancer, such as skin cancer. Learn more about cancer prevalence in this interactive tool from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Beyond the classification of cancer by site, tumors originating from the same tissue can have different features\u2014a distinction which can help decide the most effective treatment. For example: Tumors in breast tissue have several different subtypes defined by hormone receptors, such as estrogen receptors (ER). ER-positive breast tumor cells grow in response to estrogen, and thus are more likely to be treated successfully using anti-estrogen hormone therapy than ER-negative tumor cells. Primary lung cancer is divided into two main groups: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Both types behave and respond to treatment in a similar way. But small cell lung cancer is rarer and requires more immediate treatment because it tends to grow faster and spread early. The more common non-small cell lung cancer tends to develop slowly and causes fewer symptoms before it reaches later stages. However, cancer cells also have in common a range of abnormal features. [4] They ignore signals to stop dividing, quickly replicate, escape detection by the body\u2019s immune cells, and invade normal tissues. Cancer cells cause nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients, which is needed to grow. This material has been reproduced from the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research. Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer: a Global Perspective. Continuous Update Project Expert Report 2018. Available at dietandcancerreport.org. All cells are exposed to genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they have mechanisms to repair damage to genes and protect themselves against these hallmarks of cancer. [5] However, due to factors like aging, the environment (e.g., UV radiation), and lifestyle (e.g., poor diet, smoking), the protective mechanisms sometimes fail, leading to an increased risk of cancer development. Prevention Because each person is exposed to unique environmental and lifestyle factors, the risk of developing cancer can vary. Although some of the risk factors cannot be controlled (such as inherited genetic mutations), there is a range of environmental and lifestyle risk factors that can be modified. Taking preventive measures can reduce the overall risk of cancer by 30-50%, which varies depending on the cancer\u2019s site of origin. [6] Screening Cancer screening tests look for evidence of cancer cells or abnormal cells that may become cancer in people who do not show any symptoms. This helps to catch and remove a pre-cancer lesion and avert the cancer, or treat a potential cancer early, before it grows or spreads and causes symptoms, and which may be easier to treat. Examples of screening tests that lower the risk of dying early from cancer include: Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or stool tests for colorectal cancer Mammography for breast cancer Human papillomavirus (HPV) or pap tests for cervical cancer PSA tests for prostate cancer Skin exams for skin cancer (particularly in those at higher risk for skin cancer, such as having a prior skin cancer) Low-dose helical computed tomography for lung cancer (especially in people who smoke and are older than 55 years) However, there are sometimes downsides to screening. Individuals should discuss the pros and cons of screening tests with their doctor. Screening tests can have false-positive results (a finding that suggests cancer even though it is not), which may mean undergoing additional tests and procedures and causing increased anxiety in the patient. Screening tests can have false-negative results (a finding that does not find cancer even though it is present) that can delay an accurate diagnosis and earlier treatment. A result from a screening test may lead to \u201covertreatment\u201d of the cancer. In other words, even though a cancer may be accurately found, the type may be very slow-growing so that immediate aggressive cancer treatments are not needed though they may be prescribed. Vaccines Vaccinations can prevent a few types of cancer caused by prolonged infection from specific pathogens. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for females ages 9 to 26 years old and males 9 to 21 years old. It protects against the HPV types that most often cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. [7] The hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes hepatitis B, a serious chronic illness that can lead to liver cancer. [8] Vaccines targeting other cancer-causing viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus) are under development, but it is emphasized that vaccination should not be a substitute for routine screening according to recommended guidelines. [9,10] Lifestyle recommendations According to the World Health Organization, a 30-40% cancer burden can be attributed to lifestyle risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. [6] That\u2019s why a lifestyle consisting of a healthy dietary pattern, weight management, and physical activity may help reduce the risk of cancer.

Vitamin C and foods like citrus fruits, chicken soup, and tea with honey are popular examples. Yet the design of our immune system is complex and influenced by an ideal balance of many factors, not just diet, and especially not by any one specific food or nutrient. However, a balanced diet consisting of a range of vitamins and minerals, combined with healthy lifestyle factors like adequate sleep and exercise and low stress, most effectively primes the body to fight infection and disease. What Is Our Immune System? On a daily basis, we are constantly exposed to potentially harmful microbes of all sorts. Our immune system, a network of intricate stages and pathways in the body, protects us against these harmful microbes as well as certain diseases. It recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites and takes immediate action. Humans possess two types of immunity: innate and adaptive. Innate immunity is a first-line defense from pathogens that try to enter our bodies, achieved through protective barriers. These barriers include: Skin that keeps out the majority of pathogens Mucus that traps pathogens Stomach acid that destroys pathogens Enzymes in our sweat and tears that help create anti-bacterial compounds Immune system cells that attack all foreign cells entering the body Adaptive or acquired immunity is a system that learns to recognize a pathogen. It is regulated by cells and organs in our body like the spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. When a foreign substance enters the body, these cells and organs create antibodies and lead to multiplication of immune cells (including different types of white blood cells) that are specific to that harmful substance and attack and destroy it. Our immune system then adapts by remembering the foreign substance so that if it enters again, these antibodies and cells are even more efficient and quick to destroy it. Other conditions that trigger an immune response Antigens are substances that the body labels as foreign and harmful, which triggers immune cell activity. Allergens are one type of antigen and include grass pollen, dust, food components, or pet hair. Antigens can cause a hyper-reactive response in which too many white cells are released. People\u2019s sensitivity to antigens varies widely. For example, an allergy to mold triggers symptoms of wheezing and coughing in a sensitive individual but does not trigger a reaction in other people. Inflammation is an important, normal step in the body\u2019s innate immune response. When pathogens attack healthy cells and tissue, a type of immune cell called mast cells counterattack and release proteins called histamines, which cause inflammation. Inflammation may generate pain, swelling, and a release of fluids to help flush out the pathogens. The histamines also send signals to discharge even more white blood cells to fight pathogens. However, prolonged inflammation can lead to tissue damage and may overwhelm the immune system. Autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or type 1 diabetes are partly hereditary and cause hypersensitivity in which immune cells attack and destroy healthy cells. Immunodeficiency disorders can depress or completely disable the immune system, and may be genetic or acquired. Acquired forms are more common and include AIDS and cancers like leukemia and multiple myeloma. In these cases, the body\u2019s defenses are so reduced that a person becomes highly susceptible to illness from invading pathogens or antigens. What factors can depress our immune system? Older age: As we age, our internal organs may become less efficient; immune-related organs like the thymus or bone marrow produce less immune cells needed to fight off infections. Aging is sometimes associated with micronutrient deficiencies, which may worsen a declining immune function. Environmental toxins (smoke and other particles contributing to air pollution, excessive alcohol): These substances can impair or suppress the normal activity of immune cells. Excess weight: Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Fat tissue produces adipocytokines that can promote inflammatory processes. [1] Research is early, but obesity has also been identified as an independent risk factor for the influenza virus, possibly due to the impaired function of T-cells, a type of white blood cell. [2] Poor diet: Malnutrition or a diet lacking in one or more nutrients can impair the production and activity of immune cells and antibodies. Chronic diseases: Autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders attack and potentially disable immune cells. Chronic mental stress: Stress releases hormones like cortisol that suppresses inflammation (inflammation is initially needed to activate immune cells) and the action of white blood cells. Lack of sleep and rest: Sleep is a time of restoration for the body, during which a type of cytokine is released that fights infection; too little sleep lowers the amount of these cytokines and other immune cells. Does an Immune-Boosting Diet Exist? Eating enough nutrients as part of a varied diet is required for the health and function of all cells, including immune cells. Certain dietary patterns may better prepare the body for microbial attacks and excess inflammation, but it is unlikely that individual foods offer special protection. Each stage of the body\u2019s immune response relies on the presence of many micronutrients. Examples of nutrients that have been identified as critical for the growth and function of immune cells include vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, iron, and protein (including the amino acid glutamine). [3,4] They are found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Diets that are limited in variety and lower in nutrients, such as consisting primarily of ultra-processed foods and lacking in minimally processed foods, can negatively affect a healthy immune system. It is also believed that a Western diet high in refined sugar and red meat and low in fruits and vegetables can promote disturbances in healthy intestinal microorganisms, resulting in chronic inflammation of the gut, and associated suppressed immunity. [5] The microbiome is an internal metropolis of trillions of microorganisms or microbes that live in our bodies, mostly in the intestines. It is an area of intense and active research, as scientists are finding that the microbiome plays a key role in immune function. The gut is a major site of immune activity and the production of antimicrobial proteins. [6,7] The diet plays a large role in determining what kinds of microbes live in our intestines. A high-fiber plant-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes appear to support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microbes. Certain helpful microbes break down fibers into short chain fatty acids, which have been shown to stimulate immune cell activity. These fibers are sometimes called prebiotics because they feed microbes. Therefore, a diet containing probiotic and prebiotic foods may be beneficial. Probiotic foods contain live helpful bacteria, and prebiotic foods contain fiber and oligosaccharides that feed and maintain healthy colonies of those bacteria. Probiotic foods include kefir, yogurt with live active cultures, fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, tempeh, kombucha tea, kimchi, and miso. Prebiotic foods include garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, bananas, and seaweed. However, a more general rule is to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains for dietary prebiotics. Chicken soup as medicine? A warm bowl of chicken soup is a popular go-to when we\u2019re feeling under the weather. Is there scientific evidence that it aids in healing? The short answer is no; there aren\u2019t any clinical trials that show that chicken soup speeds healing any more than other foods. But when breaking down its ingredients, it does appear a worthwhile remedy to try. First of all, chicken soup is light and easy on the stomach when our appetite isn\u2019t great. Second, it provides fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration, which can easily occur with a fever. Lastly, a traditional chicken soup recipe supplies various nutrients involved in the immune system: protein and zinc from the chicken, vitamin A from carrots, vitamin C from celery and onions, and antioxidants in the onions and herbs. This is one tasty and soothing food to include when not feeling well and doesn\u2019t need a doctor\u2019s prescription. Do Vitamin or Herbal Supplements Help? A deficiency of single nutrients can alter the body\u2019s immune response. Animal studies have found that deficiencies in zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E can alter immune responses. [8] These nutrients help the immune system in several ways: working as an antioxidant to protect healthy cells, supporting growth and activity of immune cells, and producing antibodies. Epidemiological studies find that those who are poorly nourished are at greater risk of bacterial, viral, and other infections. Spotlight on vitamin D Vitamin D\u2019s role in regulating the immune system has led scientists to explore two parallel research paths: Does vitamin D deficiency contribute to the development of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and other so-called \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases, where the body\u2019s immune system attacks its own organs and tissues? And could vitamin D supplements help boost our body\u2019s defenses to fight infectious disease, such as tuberculosis and seasonal flu? LEARN MORE Eating a good quality diet, as depicted by the Healthy Eating Plate, can prevent deficiencies in these nutrients. However, there are certain populations and situations in which one cannot always eat a variety of nutritious foods, or who have increased nutrient needs. In these cases a vitamin and mineral supplement may help to fill nutritional gaps. Studies have shown that vitamin supplementation can improve immune responses in these groups. [8-10] Low-income households, pregnant and lactating women, infants and toddlers, and the critically ill are examples of groups at risk. The elderly are a particularly high-risk group. The immune response generally declines with increasing age as the number and quality of immune cells decreases. This causes a higher risk of poorer outcomes if the elderly develop chronic or acute diseases. In addition, about one-third of elderly in industrialized countries have nutrient deficiencies. [8] Some reasons include a poorer appetite due to chronic diseases, depression, or loneliness; multiple medications that can interfere with nutrient absorption and appetite; malabsorption due to intestinal issues; and increased nutrient needs due to hypermetabolic states with acute or chronic conditions. Diet variety may also be limited due to budget constraints or lower interest in cooking for one person; poor dentition; mental impairment; or lack of transportation and community resources to obtain healthy food. A general multivitamin/mineral supplement providing the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) may be used in these cases, unless otherwise directed by one\u2019s physician. Megadose supplements (many times the RDA) do not appear justified, and can sometimes be harmful or even suppress the immune system (e.g., as with zinc). Remember that vitamin supplements should not be considered a substitute for a good diet because no supplements contain all the benefits of healthful foods. Herbals Several herbal supplements have been suggested to boost immune function. What does the research say? Echinacea: Cell studies have shown that echinacea can destroy influenza viruses, but limited research in humans has been inconclusive in determining echinacea\u2019s active components. Taking echinacea after catching a cold has not been shown to shorten its duration, but taking it while healthy may offer a small chance of protection from catching a cold. [11,12] Garlic: The active ingredient in garlic, allicin sativum, is proposed to have antiviral and antimicrobial effects on the common cold, but high-quality clinical trials comparing garlic supplements to placebo are lacking. A Cochrane review identified only one trial of reasonable quality following 146 participants. Those taking the garlic supplement for 3 months had fewer occurrences of the common cold than those taking a placebo, but after contracting the cold virus, both groups had a similar duration of illness. [13] Note that these findings are from a single trial, which needs to be replicated. Tea catechins: Cell studies have shown that tea catechins such as those found in green tea can prevent flu and some cold viruses from replicating and can increase immune activity. Human trials are still limited. Two randomized controlled trials found that green tea capsules produced less cold/flu symptoms or incidence of flu than a placebo; however both studies were funded or had author affiliations with tea industries. [14] 8 Steps to Help Support a Healthy Immune System Eat a balanced diet with whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of water. A Mediterranean Diet is one option that includes these types of foods. If a balanced diet is not readily accessible, taking a multivitamin containing the RDA for several nutrients may be used. Don\u2019t smoke (or stop smoking if you do). Drink alcohol in moderation. Perform moderate regular exercise. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly. Try to keep a sleep schedule, waking up and going to bed around the same time each day. Our body clock, or circadian rhythm, regulates feelings of sleepiness and wakefulness, so having a consistent sleep schedule maintains a balanced circadian rhythm so that we can enter deeper, more restful sleep. Aim to manage stress. This is easier said than done, but try to find some healthy strategies that work well for you and your lifestyle\u2014whether that be exercise, meditation, a particular hobby, or talking to a trusted friend. Another tip is to practice regular, conscious breathing throughout the day and when feelings of stress arise. It doesn\u2019t have to be long\u2014even a few breaths can help. If you\u2019d like some guidance, try this short mindful breathing exercise. Wash hands throughout the day: when coming in from outdoors, before and after preparing and eating food, after using the toilet, after coughing or blowing your nose.

One\u2019s unique food environment is shaped by the physical, political, economic, and sociocultural factors that influence which foods are available, affordable, chosen, and prepared for consumption. [1-4] Unfortunately in many food environments, unhealthy foods and beverages are often more readily available\u2014and accessible\u2014than healthful items. Their choice is also powered by appealing marketing approaches and ubiquitous placement in vending machines and checkout counters. A healthy food environment is one in which healthy choices are readily available and promoted, easily accessible, and affordable. To make this shift, change and support must come from all parts of society: governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities, and individuals and families. [5] It is crucial to effect policy changes and create an environment where the default option is the healthy choice. Beyond the Individual The food environment often lurks silently in the background going largely unnoticed, but it plays a major role in the food choices people make, even for the most independent-minded consumer. Individuals may choose a food based on factors including taste preferences, beliefs about foods, nutritional knowledge, eating behaviors, and income. Food choices are also influenced by cultural and ethnic norms and social pressures, and many other influences that extend beyond the individual. [6] Whether it\u2019s small victories on the local level or large shifts on the national level, any positive changes to the food environment can begin to shift momentum away from a world that so readily promotes unhealthy eating. Sociocultural Influences Families Families influence children\u2019s dietary choices, and children develop food preferences at home that can last well into adulthood. [7] The food that families keep at home and how family members share meals can influence what and how much they eat. For example, there is a strong association between children, adolescents, and adults eating more fruits vegetables if they are available at home. [8] Eating family meals together has also been linked with increased intake of fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods. [9] Eating meals together may or may not affect weight as some studies show a positive link while others do not. [10\u201313] Families also influence what children drink, with children drinking more sugar-sweetened beverages when their parents frequently consumed these beverages, compared with children whose parents did not drink sugar-sweetened beverages. [14] Families with lower incomes face additional barriers to healthy eating. One roadblock is that healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, tend to be more expensive than less healthful foods such as refined grains and sweets. [15] Another is time: It takes longer to prepare meals at home than to buy convenience foods or fast food. People in lower-income households, often single parents working full time and taking care of children, may have less time for meal preparation. [1, 15, 16] Social networks and norms Social norms are rules that define beliefs and behaviors of a group. People may change their food preferences and eating behaviors based on health-based social norms. [17] Some research has found that when participants are exposed to healthy social norms, they report lower preferences for unhealthy foods compared with participants who are exposed to unhealthy norms. Increased exposure to social media that endorses images of low-nutrient processed foods may also lead to greater consumption these foods. [18] Sociocultural interventions Keep fresh fruit washed and ready-to-eat at home as snacks for the whole family. Limit or avoid keeping sugary beverages at home. If you enjoy these drinks, consider them as an occasional treat, such as when eating out in a restaurant. Try to eat at least one meal together daily as a family. Consider getting children involved to help with preparation (chopping vegetables, setting the table) or cleanup. Implement a meal prep day once weekly, batch-cooking proteins, grains, and vegetables so they can be reheated quickly during the week. Encourage children and teens to participate in meal prep by washing fruits and vegetables, chopping for older kids, and more advanced cooking or baking food ingredients for teenagers. Community Environments Throughout the course of life, the environments in which we spend our time can also influence the food we eat. This includes the communities where we live, but also places like schools and workplaces. Visit the below pages for specific recommendations to improve these spaces: Early childcare and education (ages 2-5 years old) Schools and other spaces for youth, such as afterschool programs (ages 5-17 years old) Workplaces (adults) Neighborhood food environment Lack of access to supermarkets Roughly 2 million U.S. households live more than a mile from a supermarket and don\u2019t have cars or access to cars. [19] Researchers use the term \u201cfood desert\u201d to describe neighborhoods with limited access to full-service grocery stores or supermarkets. [20] Living in food deserts is associated with lower quality diets [21-24] and increased risk of obesity. [25\u201327] There\u2019s evidence that low-income neighborhoods, as well as Black or Hispanic neighborhoods, are less likely to have access to large supermarkets offering high-quality and low-cost food, compared with middle-income neighborhoods and white neighborhoods. [28,29] Greater access to convenience stores Having greater access to small food stores may increase the risk of obesity. [25] Convenience stores often offer less variety, higher prices, and lower quality produce than supermarkets. [30] When small stores do stock healthier foods, however, people living nearby eat better. [31] If small stores changed the foods they stock, they could have a positive influence on community members\u2019 diets and obesity risks. Convenience stores selling unhealthy snack foods are more likely to locate in low-income neighborhoods and particularly near schools. [30] They\u2019re also found near schools with more Hispanic and Black students, even after accounting for students\u2019 poverty level. [31] Fast food Although eating fast food has been shown to increase caloric intake and the risk of weight gain, it is not as clear that living or working closer to fast-food restaurants has the same effect. [32-34] While some studies have found that living near fast-food restaurants is linked to weight gain, lower intake of vegetables, and less physical activity, other studies have not. [33,35-39] Fast-food restaurants are more likely to locate near schools, and proximity of fast-food restaurants to schools has been linked to weight gain, lower fruit and vegetable intake, and higher soda intake in school children. [40,41] Improving local healthy food access Increase availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in neighborhood convenience and corner stores Ensure that public transportation routes and schedules maximize access to supermarkets Offer vouchers to farmers markets Impart zoning regulations to help bring supermarkets to low-income neighborhoods Change zoning laws and give incentives to lure supermarkets and farmers markets to \u201cfood deserts\u201d (areas that lack access to nutritious foods) and underserved communities Create healthy food zones near schools and recreational areas to ban unhealthy fast-food restaurants Limit the number of fast-food restaurants in one area through zoning restrictions Encourage restaurants to reformulate menu items to provide healthier options Provide permits/incentives to healthy mobile vending carts and food trucks Promote community gardens through zoning policy and grants or other financial support Industry Influences Food marketing Restaurant, food, and beverage advertising targeted to adolescents almost exclusively promotes energy-dense nutrient-poor products, especially fast food, sugary drinks, candy, and snacks. [42] Exposure to this marketing increases preferences and consumption of these products. Digital marketing through websites, video games, and social media as well as advertising and product placement in supermarkets and schools also contribute to an environment with little uncommercialized space. [43] In 2005, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly called the Institute of Medicine) concluded that food marketing contributes to unhealthy diets and risk of poor health among American children and youth. [44] Despite this widespread recognition of the negative impact of marketing unhealthy foods, the practice continues unabated. One study found that when children were presented with foods with cartoon characters on the packaging, 73% were more likely to choose the item packaged with these characters compared with the same food without characters. [45] Food marketers are increasingly using sophisticated digital marketing techniques to target youth across a host of platforms, including smartphones, video games, social media, and immersive \u201cvirtual worlds,\u201d prompting public health advocates to call for stronger government regulation and industry self-regulation. [46-48] Furthermore, children are less likely to recognize digital advertising techniques as compared with television advertisements. [43,47] One study demonstrates that when children viewed both \u201cadvergames\u201d and television commercials, advergames produced more positive attitudes towards brands. [49] In 2012, the WHO released The WHO NCD Action Plan 2013\u20102020, which recommended restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products to children. [50] By 2018, only 63 out of the 193 Member States who originally endorsed these restrictions had enacted federal policy to limit the marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children. [50] Instead, some countries relied on industry self-regulatory programs, while many other countries made no changes at all. [50] In March 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest issued a report card grading the strength of the voluntary food marketing policies of 128 food and entertainment companies. [51] Two-thirds of these companies had no policy whatsoever on marketing to children. Of the existing policies, a majority applied only weak nutrition standards to their marketing efforts. Meanwhile, in the U.S., efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop voluntary, uniform nutrition standards for foods and drinks marketed to children have met strong resistance from industry and have been stymied by Congress. [52] In 2014, the FTC stopped tracking food marketing to children. [53] Healthy food campaigns Create education campaigns using various media sources (e.g., television, print, radio) about a specific food or eating pattern Support policies that increase taxes on unhealthy foods and subsidizing the costs of healthy options Employ communication policies that restrict advertising to youth about unhealthy foods, or curb stealth marketing to youth through junk food product placements on prime-time television and social media Industry food marketing Require food marketed to children to meet nutritional standards Limit the amount of time per hour of children\u2019s programming that can include food marketing Restrict food product placement in television shows/movies, and restrict other forms of marketing to children, such as marketing agreements between entertainment brands and food brands If voluntary efforts to improve the nutritional quality of foods marketed to children on television are not successful, enact federal legislation and monitor compliance with and enforcement of child food marketing regulations at the national level Public health marketing Develop public service media and social marketing campaigns to promote healthy eating and drinking Develop counter-marketing campaigns, such as campaigns that highlight the negative health impact of sugar-sweetened beverages and other unhealthful foods Restaurants Encourage the food and restaurant industry to shift marketing efforts toward more healthful foods and beverages for children Require restaurants to post calorie information on menus and menu boards Give restaurants incentives to offer healthier items, such as by creating promotional campaigns that highlight or recognize healthy restaurants or by offering other marketing support Set nutrition requirements for meals that include toys, giveaways, or other incentives aimed at children Food labeling Standardize front-of-package health labeling Require more prominent calorie-per-serving labeling on food packaging Require additional information on food labeling, such as recommended daily limit on added sugar consumption or caffeine consumption Agriculture Support agricultural policies that focus on increased planting and buying of fresh fruits and vegetables. Use zoning/land use policies to create new space for farmers markets Provide government subsidies or create public/private partnerships to develop new farmers markets Provide financial support for marketing of and transportation to farmers markets Governmental and Global Influences Government food policy and pricing In the past 30 years, the price of fruit and vegetables rose much faster than prices of all other consumer goods in the U.S. At the same time, the price of sugar, sweets, and carbonated drinks declined, and people began consuming more sugar and other sweeteners, reaching 151 pounds of caloric sweeteners every year per person by 1999. [54,55] In recent years, per capita sweetener consumption has declined to 142 pounds per year, still significantly higher than the 123 pounds consumed in 1966. A 2014 study offered further evidence that inexpensive food is a key factor in rising obesity rates. [56] Changes in food prices have been linked to changes in how much we eat and our risk of obesity. One study that followed more than 5,000 young adults for 20 years found that lower prices on soda and pizza were associated with higher caloric intake and increased weight. [57] Another found that higher fruit and vegetable prices were associated with greater weight gain over time in young children. [39] There has been much debate about why the price of sweeteners has dropped. Some researchers have argued that subsidies to corn growers have led to an oversupply of cheap high-fructose corn syrup, which drives higher sweetener consumption. Economic evaluations of this argument have found that direct subsidies currently play a limited role in lowering sweetener prices, although their historical impact on development of the sweetener market may be more important. [55,58] Taxing sugar-sweetened beverages Although economists debate how much government subsidies to corn growers influence the price of sweeteners, the government can set policies that influence the price and availability of foods that, in turn, influence obesity risk. [59] Taxes are related to a greater decrease in consumption and overweight for children who are already overweight or whose families have a low income. Several cities in the U.S. as well as countries such as Mexico and Chile have implemented various taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. In Philadelphia, the government enacted a $0.15 per ounce tax on all sugary drinks sold within the city. [60] A recent evaluation of this law found that it led to a 51% decrease in sugary drink sales within Philadelphia. [61] However, this decrease was partially offset by a more moderate increase in sugary drink sales (24%) outside of the Philadelphia border. [61] Case Study: Chile's sugar-sweetened beverage regulations In 2016, Chile implemented a set of laws regulating food labeling and advertising, taxing sugar-sweetened beverages, and restricting sugary food and beverage sales in schools. Due to these new regulations, purchases of sugary drinks decreased by 27% throughout Chilean households. [62] One recent study noted that Chile\u2019s laws were significantly more impactful than standalone policies taxing sugar-sweetened beverages that have been implemented throughout Latin America. Rather, addressing sugar-sweetened beverage purchases required approaching the problem from all angles, from putting warning labels on junk food packaging, to restricting child-directed food advertisements. [62] One potential caveat in Chile\u2019s food-related laws is that they had more significant effects in high-education households versus low-education households. Therefore, it is possible that these laws increase health gaps between high-education and low-education households. [62] Healthy food policies Establish strong nutrition standards and healthy food policies for foods served at public facilities and government buildings, as well as foods purchased with government funds Make healthy foods more \u201cavailable and affordable in public facilities and government buildings, and restrict the availability of less-healthy foods Ensure that smaller portion-size food options are available in public facilities and government buildings Limit or discourage access to sugar-sweetened beverages, especially in schools and childcare centers, worksites, government buildings, and public facilities Ensure access to free water in all government buildings Limit mobile vending of unhealthy foods through legislation or health department regulations Food pricing and taxes Tax foods of minimal nutritional value (\u201cjunk food\u201d) to decrease consumption such as sugar-sweetened beverages and other high-calorie, low-nutrient foods Earmark tax revenues from sugar-sweetened beverage taxes or other taxes for obesity prevention efforts Lower the relative cost of healthy foods through subsidies or other measures Food assistance programs Increase enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), using existing government programs (such as Medicaid and the Children Health Insurance Program) Change SNAP and WIC guidelines to give people incentives to make healthier food choices, such as providing discounts or rebates for buying fruits and vegetables Study the impact of changing SNAP guidelines to prohibit benefits from being used to buy sugar-sweetened beverages, or making other changes to improve the quality of foods purchased with SNAP Remove restrictions on the use of SNAP Education funds for materials or social marketing campaigns that discourage the consumption of unhealthy foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages Increase WIC vouchers for fruit and vegetables Encourage farmers markets and small store owners to accept electronic benefits from food assistance programs Focus on children\u2019s nutrition by testing healthy food guidelines for children who receive SNAP benefits Create stronger healthy food stocking standards for SNAP retailers similar to those required of stores that participate in WIC Require the FDA to collect data on SNAP purchases that can be used to analyze the program\u2019s effect on nutrition and health Improve nutrition guidelines for Child and Adult Care Food Program and Summer Food Service Program Increase supply of healthy foods (including produce) in food banks and other emergency food programs Healthier hospitals and health care Hospitals are important settings for public health efforts because they reach a large population each year, including employees, patients, and visitors.

Disparities in healthy eating and physical activity habits that influence health also emerge early in life. [1,2] In the U.S., early childcare and education (ECE) programs provide an important setting for intervention by reaching nearly three-quarters of 3-5 year old children. [3] Federal, state, and local programs, regulations, and policy have the potential to improve the quality of meals and snacks, provide opportunities for physical activity, and limit screen time of early child care programs, and contribute to the formation of healthy habits among young children in their care. [4] Key resource The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Spectrum of Opportunities Framework guides states and communities in their ECE work. It can help identify how healthy growth and obesity prevention policies and activities can be embedded into ECE systems. Evidence-Based Best Practices for Early Child Care and Education Evidence suggests that policies and regulations based on best practices related to nutrition, physical activity, and screen time have the greatest potential to improve young children\u2019s health. There are several resources available with evidence-based best practices. Below are a few key topics and strategies in each area related to nutrition, physical activity, and screen time. Nutrition Programs participate or follow the Child and Adult Care Food Program food and beverage guidelines (see below) Sugar-sweetened beverages are not served No more than 4-6oz of 100% juice is served per day for children aged one to six years Safe drinking water is offered throughout the day or in frequent intervals Fruits and/or vegetables are served at each eating occasion At least half of the grains/breads served in meals and snacks are whole grains Grain-based desserts or sugary/sweet foods are served once per week Processed and red meats are limited Program includes a policy with nutritional guidance/standards for food and beverages brought to the program from home Written menus are shared with families and maintained by programs Family-style meal service during meals and snack Physical activity Toddlers are provided 60-90 minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity daily Preschoolers are provided 90-120 minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity daily Outdoor play is provided for at least 60 minutes per day Safe weather conditions for outdoor play are specified Staff provide structured and unstructured physical activity opportunities Staff participate in physical activity with children Staff are trained in promoting physical activity Screen time No screen time for children younger than 2 years of age Less than 30 minutes per week of screen time for children 2-5 years of age Any screen time provided must be educational (includes physical education) or children are specifically not allowed to watch marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages Related resources Staff Training Providing ECE providers with the training, technical assistance, and resources to implement obesity prevention is a critical strategy to ensure that recommendations positively impact child nutrition, physical activity, and screen time behaviors while in their care. Below are additional resources for providers related to healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time practices among preschool aged children. Related resources Interventions in Early Care and Education Modifications to childcare programs\u2019 policies around food, physical activity, and screen time appear to be a way to meaningfully impact children\u2019s healthy habit development and obesity risk. In particular, the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) program, which has been widely disseminated throughout the U.S. and is now available online through the Go NAP SACC program, has been shown to be an effective strategy for engaging and empowering child care providers to make healthy changes to their program policies. Based on existing evidence, promising ECE interventions include those focused on improving the nutritional quality of meals and snacks served in childcare, increasing physical activity opportunities, limiting screen time, and/or providing classroom-based nutrition education. Interventions focusing on children at greatest risk of developing obesity showed highest efficacy, and longer-term follow-up effectiveness studies suggest that booster interventions may be required to ensure that healthy weight is maintained over time. [6,7] Intervention highlight A 2021 cost-effectiveness study found that requiring licensed child care settings to limit non-educational television would be a practical and low-cost intervention and could prevent over 35,000 cases of childhood obesity over a 10 year period.[8] Related resources Head Start Head Start is a federal program that promotes the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families; it also may be a powerful program for supporting children\u2019s healthy habit development, reducing their risk of unhealthy weight gain, and addressing health disparities. In addition to early learning and a focus on family overall wellbeing, Head Start Program Performance Standards include requirements related to nutrition and physical activity. [9,10] Updated in 2016, the goal of the standards is to ensure that programs actively engage in obesity prevention processes during the program day, as well as working with families by providing guidance, resources, education, and measurement for the performance standards. The nutrition and physical activity standards include the following: ensuring meals and snack meet daily nutrition requirements; safe drinking water is freely available to children throughout the day; physical activity is integrated into curricular activities and daily routines; and ensuring that physical activity is not used as a reward or punishment. [10] One national survey indicated that most Head Start programs reported doing more to support healthy eating and physical activity than required by federal guidelines. [11] In a review of the early child care literature, there a protective effect of Head Start programs for obesity risk among children; this was not seen among other types of child care settings (e.g, centers, relative, or non-relative care). Head Start is highly regulated and has higher nutritional and physical activity standards than what is required by licensed child care programs, and therefore may offer a healthier nutrition, physical activity, and screen time environment. [12] For more detailed information, see the resources below. Related resources Child and Adult Care Food Program The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is another federal program that can influence the diet quality of very young children. CACFP is a federally-funded program administered by states that provides financial support for food service in ECE settings, including child care centers and family day care homes. CACFP is particularly targeted towards young children from households and neighborhoods with lower incomes. Early childcare and education programs apply for CACFP reimbursement for the meals and snacks they serve to eligible families. [13] CACFP subsidizes meals and snacks for over 4 million children each day. [14] Updated in 2017 as part of the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act, CACFP regulates the types and quantity of food and beverages served for meals and snacks during child care.[14] Participation in CACFP promotes child care environments that support healthy nutrition, including improved quality of foods and beverages served and/or consumed, including more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and less juice and refined grains compared to non-participating programs. [15-20] That said, research suggests that CACFP is not meeting its full potential as a policy to improve children\u2019s diet quality and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk. Studies have found that CACFP is not reaching everyone who could benefit from it: many childcare programs that could participate in CACFP do not do so, and some are not even aware that the program exists. [21] Other research suggests that providers need more financial support from CACFP as well as training and implementation support to provide foods that are optimal for young children\u2019s diet quality. [22] More research is needed to better understand how to best support early child care providers in implementing the CACFP nutrition standards through effective trainings and technical assistance. [15,23] Related resources State Child Care Licensing Standards State licensing regulations have the potential to promote healthy standards across all licensed child care programs, including healthy eating, the offering daily physical activity, and the limiting of screen time opportunities for children in their care. [24-28] However, most states lack strong regulations relating to the promotion of healthy eating, physical activity and screen time. [29,30] States have increasingly been including stronger standards in their regulatory language, and there has been an increasing number of states banning sugary beverages served in child care. [29,30,26] However, most states still lack important best practice strategies in their licensing regulation. Furthermore, child care providers require more training and technical assistance on implementing licensing standards. Below are resources and tools from organizations that have put forward recommended best practice policy standards through state licensing standards in early child care. Related resources Quality Rating and Improvement Standards The Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) were developed as an approach to improve the quality of ECE programming and supplement regulatory approaches to quality. [24,31,32] In addition to the meeting standards set forth by state licensing agencies, QRIS are voluntary systems with the aim of reaching ECE providers, especially those serving low-income children receiving child care subsidies. Training, technical assistance, professional development, and/or financial incentives are often used to encourage providers to meet QRIS standards. [24,31,32] The adoption of voluntary standards around nutrition, physical activity, screen time and/or assessments of health and wellness policies and practices are included in voluntary QRIS program standards have the potential to impact the health of children when attending early child care. [24,32] Related resources Child Care and Development Block Grant The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act provides funding to states for child care subsidies for low-income families who are working or participating in education or training activities. [24,33,34] The CCDBG Act also allows for flexibility to pair state and federal funds to improve the overall quality of child care within existing state and local systems. The law includes provisions specific to nutrition and physical activity, including ensuring that eligible providers are enrolled in CACFP; supporting efforts to develop high-quality nutrition and physical activity standards within licensing requirements or encouraging standards through QRIS; and requiring participating states to disseminate information to families about other food assistance programs (for example, WIC and SNAP).

Schools can implement policies and practices that encourage healthy eating and physical activity during the school day, and can also help children and adolescents establish lifelong healthy patterns. Healthy Eating During the School Day Policies and programs guiding what foods and beverages are available in schools provide an important opportunity to improve child health. This is especially important for children from households with lower incomes and children who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups (who, on average, have less access to healthy food, poorer dietary quality, and higher risk for obesity compared to other children). [1] School meals and competitive foods and beverages In the U.S., federal assisted meal programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture provide nutritionally adequate breakfasts, lunches, and afterschool snacks to children during the school year. The School Breakfast Program (SBP) serves meals to 14.6 million children, and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provides lunches and after-school snacks to more than 30 million children; 22 million receive those meals for free or at a reduced price. [2] Lower-income children participate in these programs at higher rates than other children, and can receive free or reduced-priced meals. [3] The Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 authorized funding and set policies to improve the nutritional quality of food and beverages served to children through the SBP and NSLP. [4] HHFKA regulations required meal patterns for breakfast and lunch to increase fruits and vegetables and limit starchy vegetables, create age-specific recommended serving sizes, serve only low-fat or fat-free milk, and serve more whole grains, among other standards. [5] The HHFKA also, for the first time, established nutrition standards for competitive food and beverages sold outside of school meal programs as a la carte, from vending machines, or school stores. These \u201cSmart Snacks\u201d guidelines eliminated almost all sugary beverages, and placed limits on calories, sodium, and saturated fat and sugars on snacks. [6] Implementation of HHFKA has been a major advance for child nutrition, [7-9] and several studies have found its implementation was associated with significant decreased risk of obesity among school-aged children and may have been particularly impactful for students in poverty, who tend to benefit the most from NSLP/SBP. [10-12] In the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom, nutrition standards for competitive food and beverages and school meals in the and have demonstrated positive health impacts, including reducing consumption of sugary beverages and unhealthy snacks, and increasing fruit intake. [13] Increasing participation in school meals To ensure that children who would benefit most from SBP and NSLP have access to these programs, it is important to consider how to increase student participation in school meals. One promising approach is the adoption of universal free school meals (UFSM) policies. After a UFSM policy was temporarily introduced nationwide in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, several states passed legislation to continue funding the program within their own states, and many others are considering adopting a UFSM model. UFSM models are associated with increased participation in school meals and reduced obesity risk. [14] In states without UFSM, there are more localized options for increasing access to school meals. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) is a non-pricing meal service option for schools and school districts in low-income areas that allow them to serve breakfasts and lunches at no cost to all enrolled students without collecting household application. Schools that adopt CEP are reimbursed based on the participation in other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Students in CEP districts would be provided free, healthy meals consistent with the HHFKA guidelines, and significantly reduce the administrative burden for school districts. [15] Direct provision of fresh fruits and vegetables In the U.S., the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) is another federally assisted program that provides free fresh fruits and vegetables to elementary school children during the school year. FFVP introduces children to new and different varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables, with the goal of increasing overall acceptance and consumption. FFVP prioritizes schools with the highest percentage of children eligible for free and reduced priced meals. [16] Other countries have also implemented direct provisions of fruits and vegetables in schools, including Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. A meta-analysis of programs in these countries and the U.S. demonstrated that direct provision policies significantly increased fruit and vegetable intake. [13] Recommendations for school meals and competitive foods in schools Provide competitive foods and beverages and school meals that meet nutrition standards Increase participation in school meals through programs such as Community Eligibility Provision and Universal School Breakfast States should implement nutrition standards that strengthen the federal standards Direct provision of healthful food and beverages such as fruits and vegetables Increase financial support for school meal programs from federal, state, and local governments Best practice guidance for school meals and competitive foods in schools Give students adequate time to eat Encourage staff to model healthy eating Incorporate nutrition education into school meal programs Ensure that food served at classroom parties and school functions, including fundraisers, meets competitive food standards Limit marketing of unhealthy foods School garden programs including nutrition and gardening education and hands-on gardening experiences Invest in cafeteria facilities to store, prepare, and display healthy foods Train food service staff in health food preparation techniques Related resources Drinking Water Access During the School Day Providing clean, safe drinking water in schools helps increase students\u2019 overall water intake, maintain hydration, and reduce calorie intake if substituted for sugary drinks. [17-19] The HHFKA requires schools participating in the School Breakfast or and National School Lunch Program to make water available to students during meal times for free. [20] One study found that installation of water jet dispensers on school cafeteria lunch lines was a cost-effective strategy for preventing cases of childhood obesity. [21] Related resources Physical Activity During the School Day Children require at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. Schools can help children get the recommended amount of daily physical activity by offering more frequent, higher quality and more active physical education and recess, and by promoting physical activity throughout the day. [22-26] Active physical education Health organizations recommend that schools provide 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education for school children and 225 minutes per week for middle and high school students throughout the school year. [27,28] In 2014, only 15% of elementary, 9% of middle, and 6% of U.S. high schools require students to take physical education classes on at least 3 days per week. [29] Furthermore, children often spend less than half of their time in physical education classes being physically active. [24,30] Active physical education focuses on making the time that children spend in class more active. Improving the quality of physical education classes will help children get more physical activity and encourage them to develop healthy habits. Best practice guidance for physical activity during the school day Provide daily physical education to children in grades K-12 Provide a minimum minutes per week of participation in physical education Adopt physical education standards and curriculum Ensure that children spend most of their physical education time being physically active Hire licensed physical education teachers and offer them ongoing training Make sure that physical education requirements are not waived for other physical or academic activities Prohibit schools and districts from using physical activity as a form of punishment Related resources Physical activity during recess Daily recess during the school day is a relatively easy and low-cost way to help children be physically active. In addition to offering recess, it is important that the time that children spend in recess periods is physically active time. Unfortunately, since the mid-2000s, up to 40% of U.S. school districts have reduced or eliminated recess time. [21,31] Ways to increase physical activity during recess time include providing structured physical activity, the installation of playground markings, and/or the provision of portable play equipment. [32] Best practice guidance for recess during the school day Provide all k-12 students with recess daily Provide schools and students with adequate spaces, facilities, equipment, and supplies for recess Ensure that spaces and facilities for recess meet or exceed recommended safety standards Do not exclude students from recess for disciplinary reasons or academic performance in the classroom Schedule morning recess before lunch Provide staff members who lead or supervise recess with ongoing professional development Related resources Active classrooms Incorporating classroom physical activity can take place at any time and occurs at one or several brief periods during the school day. Physical activity in the classroom can be integrated into academic instruction or providing breaks from instruction designed for physical activity. In 2016, only 11% of U.S. school districts required elementary schools to provide regular classroom physical activity breaks; this was even lower for middle schools (8%) and high schools (2%). [33] Best practice guidance for classroom physical activity in schools Integrate physical activity into planned academic instruction to reinforce academic concepts [34,35] Provide physical activity breaks outside of planned academic instruction Use classroom physical activity as a way to reinforce skills learned in physical education Ensure that barriers to classroom physical activity, such as lack of equipment or available space, are minimized. Do not withhold classroom physical activity from students as a disciplinary approach Provide teachers with ongoing professional development on classroom physical activity Related resources A comprehensive school physical activity program A Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program is the development, implementation, and evaluation of strategies to increase physical activity during the school day. With active physical education, active recess, and movement breaks in the classroom. [22] A coordinated effort in schools to help all students meet recommended levels of physical activity would help children grain skills and confidence to make regular physical activity a lifelong habit. The 5 Components of a Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program [22] Physical Education Physical Activity During School: Recess and Movement Breaks in the Classroom Family and Community Engagement Staff Involvement Physical Activity Before and After School Related resources Multi-component School Based Programs and Policies to Improve Diet and Physical Activity Schools play an important role in improving the dietary and physical activity behaviors of students by implementing policies and practices that support healthy eating and physical activity. Multi-component school-based interventions targeting both diet and physical activity may help prevent excess weight gain among children. [36-40] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the School Health Guidelines that are the foundation for developing, implementing, and evaluating healthy eating and physical activity policies and programs for students during the school day. Resources for the School Health Guidelines are provided by the Centers for Disease Control: School Health Guidelines to Promote Healthy Eating and Physical Activity, and School Health Guidelines. The 9 School Health Guidelines [40] Healthy Eating and Physical Activity School Environments Quality School Meal Program Comprehensive Physical Activity Health Education Health, Mental Health, and Social Services Partner with Families and Community members School Employee Wellness Program Certified and Qualified Staff Intervention highlight A systematic review across high-income countries of strategies to prevent childhood overweight and obesity found that school-based intervention with combined diet and physical activity components and a home element had the greatest intervention effects for at least one adiposity-related outcome. The findings support recommendations that schools should be a focal point for obesity prevention efforts. [36] School Wellness Policies Starting in 2006, U.S. schools participating in NSLP and/or SBP were required to adopt and implement a wellness policy that included standards for nutrition education, school meals and competitive foods, and physical activity. Districts with strong, comprehensive policies were more successful at implementing such policies at the school level. [41] Furthermore, state wellness policy requirement laws have been associated with successful school district wellness policy implementation, highlighting the role of state laws and district policies in working together to ensure healthy eating and physical activity strategies are implemented in schools. [42] Strong school wellness policies result in improved competitive food and beverage environments and physical activity practices, and may significantly reduce the risk of adolescent obesity.

They include before- and after- school programs; specialty programs (sports teams, STEM); and other programs providing various activities (Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, etc.) With 7.8 million U.S. children attending afterschool programs in 2020, these are key settings for improving children\u2019s food and beverage intake, providing physical activity opportunities, and limiting TV exposure. [1] Healthy Eating Outside of School Improving the quality of children\u2019s snacks offered during out-of-school time could positively impact children\u2019s health by increasing the intake of healthier food and beverages, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and water. Snacks account for 27% of total calorie intake among youth, and most frequently consist of grain-based desserts, salty snacks, sweets, and sugary beverages, which are associated with increased obesity risk. [2,3] Snacks and beverages that children bring to afterschool programs are usually less healthy than snacks served from federal reimbursable meal programs such as the National School Lunch Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Summer Food Service Program. [4,5] Policies limiting non-program snacks and/or sugary beverages being brought in for snacks could improve the nutritional quality snacks during out-of-school time. Best practice guidance for healthy eating during out-of-school time Provide healthy food and beverage choices consistent with the federal reimbursable meal programs [6,7] Do not allow children to bring in their own snacks to afterschool programs Serve a fruit or vegetable at every snack Serve water at every snack and meal, and make sure it is available at all times When serving grains for snack (like bread, crackers and cereal), serve whole grains Serve water instead of sugary drinks at every snack or meal Limit juice servings to 4 ounces of 100% juice Key resource The Out-of-School Nutrition and Physical Activity Initiative (OSNAP) is an evidence-based initiative that helps out-of-school time programs improve policies and practices to help kids move more and eat healthier snacks. The goal of OSNAP is to support policy and practice strategies that promote nutrition and physical activity in out-of-school-time settings. OSNAP focuses on six nutrition and physical activity goals. It provides training, tools, and resources to help programs make sustainable changes to promote increased physical activity and consumption of healthy snacks. Physical Activity Encouraging students to be physically active during out-of-school time can help promote health and well-being. Before- and after-school programs as well as physical activity clubs and intramural/extramural sports are important components of a comprehensive approach to increase physical activity. In addition to physical activity programming during out-of-school programs, walking and biking programs encouraging active transport to and from school is another method of increasing physical activity among children.

[1,2] Due to the number of people reached and the amount time spent in these settings, creating healthy worksite programs, policies, and environments have the potential to positively impact workers\u2019 health. [3,4] Diet-related chronic diseases are among the health conditions that contribute to direct medical costs and lost productivity to U.S. employers, including heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. [3] Worksite wellness programs primarily focus on improving health, increasing productivity, and reducing insurance costs. [4] What about remote and hybrid workers? The number of people physically located in their workplace has decreased substantially since the COVID-19 pandemic because more people are working from home. One survey from spring 2022 found that 58% of Americans reported having the opportunity to work from home at least one day a week; 35% reported having the option to work from home five days a week. [5] Nevertheless, effective workplace programs and policies utilizing a multidisciplinary approach can help reduce health risks and improve the quality of life for their employees. [3] Worksite Wellness Programs Worksite wellness programs have used a variety of mechanisms to promote health. Programs can be offered to the entire workplace, or specifically targeted to high-risk individuals. Best practices for worksite wellness Employers offer multifaceted nutrition and physical activity programs and initiatives. [2,4,6] Programs would include components such as: Employee steering committees Nutrition classes and seminars Promotional and educational materials Health risk assessments Goal setting and lifestyle skills Group exercise sessions Signage to promote stair use Increased availability of healthy foods and nutrition labeling in worksite cafeterias Employers offer nutrition counseling to help individuals learn skills and gain support needed to improve eating and food preparation habits.

One of every five deaths globally is due to suboptimal diets, accounting for more than any other risk factor, including tobacco. Emerging evidence suggests that food and nutrition interventions in coordination with health care settings may be associated with improved health outcomes and decreased health care costs. Food Is Medicine \u201cFood is Medicine\u201d interventions are being explored to prevent, manage, and treat illness through improved diet and lifestyle, such as medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries (for example, food \u2018farmacies\u2019 or healthy food prescriptions), and produce prescriptions. [1] These interventions are usually implemented by clinicians; funded by health care, government or philanthropy; and are provided to patients at no or very low cost. [1] Medically tailored meals Medically tailored meals are fully prepared home-delivered meals designed by a dietitian based on individual needs determined through nutrition counseling. The target population of these meals are patients with complex medical conditions who are physically unable to shop or prepare meals. Patients participating in medically tailored meals have demonstrated a range of positive outcomes, including decreased in-patient hospital admissions, decreased overall health care costs, and increased diet quality among food-insecure individuals. [1-4] Medically tailored groceries Medically tailored groceries reach a broader range of patients than medically tailored meals, because the patient cooks and prepares food at home. For medically tailored groceries, a nutrition professional selects grocery items as part of a treatment plan for food insecure patients with diet related chronic and acute conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The patient collects non-prepared grocery items from a clinic or other community location, and cooks or prepares the food at home. Measured impact of this intervention is not as robust as medically tailored meals, but nevertheless the co-location of food pantries and hospitals/health centers are becoming more common, as well as the ability to participate in this program through food banks. [1] Produce prescription programs Produce prescription programs have the broadest impact among \u201cfood is medicine\u201d interventions. These prescriptions are vouchers or debit cards for free or discounted produce for food insecure patients who are at risk for diet related disease (e.g, obesity, prediabetes). There have been positive outcomes related to participation in this program, including improved biomarkers among people with diabetes, decreased fast food consumption, decreased body mass index, and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. Cost-effectiveness studies have shown that a 30% subsidy incentive on fruit and vegetables would prevent nearly 2 million cardiovascular disease events and save $40 billion in health care costs. [1,5-7] Related resources Healthy Hospital Environments Hospitals are important settings for public health efforts because they reach a large population each year, including employees, patients, and visitors. Hospitals have a significant opportunity to support healthy weight by providing healthier food and drink choices in cafeterias and vending machines and provide opportunities for physical activity. Best practices for supporting healthy eating and physical activity in hospitals Utilize pricing and point-of-purchase strategies to promote healthier choices in cafeterias and vending machines [8-15] Development of healthy food and beverage procurement policies for cafeterias, vending machines, concessions stands, and/or for food provided at meetings, conferences and other organizational events [8-10,16] Improve nutritional quality of hospital food and support a more environmentally sustainable food system by purchasing local foods, sustainable foods, serving less meat, and participating in community benefit programs [17,18] Create incentive-based physical activity programs for employees [8,9] Initiate employee wellness programs that includes promoting use of stairs and walking trails, and targeting healthy eating [8,9] Health Care Health care and health service providers are uniquely positioned to help identify patients at-risk for obesity and related chronic diseases, and implement effective clinical interventions to help patients achieve a healthy weight. Health insurers and health care systems can utilize incentives and provide support for clinicians and patients to adopt evidence-based standards of practice for prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of overweight and obesity for children, adolescents, and adults. [9,17] Furthermore, working with the health care system is important to reduce disparities among the populations they serve. [17] Below are some best practices for health care, hospitals, and service providers. Health care providers Health care providers use clinical guidelines to identify patients at-risk for obesity, and recommend effective healthy eating and physical activity strategies to help patients lose weight and/or maintain weight loss [9,17,19] Health care providers utilize clinical preventive-service recommendations to refer patients with obesity to comprehensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions [17,20\u201322] Require that health care clinician education includes comprehensive nutrition training as well as prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of obesity [1,9,17,23,24] Health care providers screen patients for food insecurity and connect at-risk patients with nutrition assistance programs such as SNAP, WIC, and school meals [17,25] Incorporating nutrition education in medical training Nutrition plays a critical role in the prevention and treatment of obesity and other chronic disease, yet nutrition receives little attention in medical school and other health care provider education. [1,24,26,27] Furthermore, requiring nutrition education as a component of health care provider training is important to ensure equitable patient access to nutrition expertise. [1] Nevertheless, in the U.S., medical schools dedicate fewer than 1% of lecture hours to nutrition education. [27] Globally, an assessment of medical schools in the U.S., Europe, Middle East, Africa and Australasia found that nutrition education is insufficiently incorporated into medical education regardless of country, setting, or year of medical education. Lack of nutrition education affects medical student\u2019s knowledge, skills and confidence to include high-quality, effective, nutrition care into their practice. [26] Ways to ensure that nutrition education in incorporated into clinician curriculums include: legislative mandates; make government funding for schools contingent upon requiring nutrition education; integrating nutrition topics into accreditation standards; and including nutrition questions on the medical board and other qualifying exams. [1,24] Hospitals Hospitals provide benefits to their local communities to assess, implement and evaluation strategies to address local community needs [17,28] Hospitals use electronic health records to adopt standards of practice that include BMI screening, assessment, and treatment of obesity [9] Case Study: The Study of Technology to Accelerate Research (STAR) Primary care settings provide structure and opportunities to reduce the prevalence of obesity among children. Regular primary care visits can help track and identify trends in increasing body mass index (BMI) levels and offer opportunities for prevention, screening, and treatment. [29] The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by clinicians during primary care visits may facilitate childhood obesity management by prompting diagnosis and providing decision support tools and electronic resources and tools for evaluation, management, and follow-up care. One such intervention is The Study of Technology to Accelerate Research (STAR) program, which utilizes a point-of-care clinical decision support alert to pediatric clinicians when a child between the ages of 6-12 years measures a BMI \u226595th percentile during a well care visit. The alert included links to growth charts, childhood obesity screening and management guidelines, and standard clinician note templates specifically for obesity. Furthermore, clinicians were trained in motivational interviewing to negotiate follow-up weight management plans, and provided educational materials to families. Some families were assigned a health coach for individualized support. [29] A trial of this intervention demonstrated that children ages 6-12 years old with obesity had smaller increases in BMI after one year compared with usual care. Overall, this type of approach in the clinical primary care setting demonstrated improved quality of care, and effective support of patients and families in improving obesity-related behaviors. [29,30] Furthermore, childhood obesity interventions with electronic decision support for clinicians and self-guided behavior-change support for parents may be a more cost-effective approach than other clinical interventions targeting children with obesity.

Try perusing your local grocery store\u2019s bulk bins to discover new, delicious whole grains that are often simple to prepare. Protein \u2013 Rely on healthy protein such as fresh fish, chicken or turkey, tofu, eggs, and a variety of beans and nuts. Healthy fats and oils \u2013 Use liquid vegetable oils whenever possible for saut\u00e9ing vegetables, stir-frying fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings. Good choices include canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, peanut, and olive oil. Other essentials \u2013 Even a small amount of a high-quality ingredient can have a big impact on flavor.

It\u2019s a simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The first recording of tea described it as a medicinal beverage in China in the 3rd century AD. Merchants helped its popularity to spread quickly across continents. In the early 19th century, Great Britain popularized the concept of afternoon tea, a break from one\u2019s routine in which tea is served alongside sandwiches and baked goods such as scones. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. [1] Herbal teas are not made from the Camellia plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas. Source Of Caffeine (traditional teas, not herbal) Polyphenols Flavonols \u2013 myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol Theaflavins \u2013 formed when black tea leaves are oxidized Catechins \u2013 found in green tea; epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) is the main form Most traditional teas do not contain a significant amount of nutrients, but are rich in polyphenols. These are plant chemicals that give teas their distinct flavor and aroma and may have health-promoting properties. Tea and Health Animal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. [2] However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (more than 131-140\u00b0 F [55-60\u00b0 C]). [2,3] Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea. So pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup! Spotlight on tea and antioxidants Polyphenols, or flavonoids, are likely a key component to what makes tea a healthful drink. These chemical compounds act as antioxidants, which control the damaging effects of free radicals in the body. Free radicals can alter DNA by stealing its electrons, and this mutated DNA can increase LDL cholesterol or alter cell membrane traffic\u2014both harmful to our health. Though green tea is often believed to be richer in polyphenols than black or oolong (red) teas, studies show that\u2014with the exception of decaffeinated tea\u2014all plain teas have about the same levels of these chemicals, albeit in different proportions. Green tea is richest in epigallocatechin-3 gallate whereas black tea is richest in theaflavins; research has shown that both can exert health benefits. Herbal teas contain polyphenols as well but will vary highly depending on its plant origin. Indeed, one reason for conflicting results in observational studies may be the wide variations in tea types with varying flavonoid content. [4] Where the tea leaves are grown, the specific blend of tea leaves, type of processing, and addition of ingredients such as milk, honey, and lemon can alter specific flavonoid content. How accurately people report their tea intake (e.g., type, amount, brew strength) and their overall diet (e.g., do they eat other foods rich in flavonoids?) are other factors that need to be clarified as they can affect study results. For example: Some research suggests that the protein and possibly the fat in milk may reduce the antioxidant capacity of tea. [5] Flavonoids are known to \u201cdeactivate\u201d when binding to proteins so this theory makes scientific sense. [6] One study that analyzed the effects of adding skimmed, semi-skimmed, and whole milk to tea concluded that skimmed milk significantly reduced the antioxidant capacity of tea. Higher-fat milks also reduced the antioxidant capacity of tea, but to a lesser degree. [7] All said, in practice it\u2019s important to keep in mind that tea\u2014even tea with a splash of milk\u2014can be a healthful drink. Learn more about some of the research on tea on health: Cardiovascular disease Cancer Is decaffeinated tea healthy? Decaffeinated tea is an option if you enjoy the flavor and experience of tea but are sensitive to caffeine. People have varying sensitivity to caffeine but it is classified as a stimulant that has the potential to affect the nervous system and heart rate, and cause jitteriness. In general, traditional teas already have about half the caffeine of coffee and even less if the brewing time is shorter. To decaffeinate tea, there are different methods. One process uses an organic chemical solvent (either ethyl acetate or methylene chloride) that also removes most of tea\u2019s polyphenols. The residual amount of the chemical after processing is minimal to none, and no research has shown negative health effects. Another method called \u201ceffervescence\u201d uses water and carbon dioxide, which retains the majority of polyphenols. Both methods apply the chemical or gas onto moistened tea leaves, which bonds to the caffeine; when the leaves are dried, the caffeine evaporates along with the solvent/gas. If you wish to know which processing method is used, check the package label or contact the manufacturer. Herbal teas are naturally caffeine-free and do not undergo a decaffeination process. Most research looks at the health effects of traditional teas, not decaffeinated. Decaffeinated tea may lose polyphenols that are associated with health benefits, depending on the processing method. Polyphenol content varies widely among teas even before the decaffeinated process, so it is hard to know the exact amount that remains. Regardless of decaffeination type, tea is still considered a healthful beverage choice. Purchase If you visit a tea shop, you may be surprised and overwhelmed by just how many different teas exist! Traditional teas originating from the Camellia sinensis plant include black, white, green, yellow, and oolong, all of which contain caffeine. Black tea is made by crushing and drying fresh tea leaves and allowing them to ferment, which oxidizes the leaves and changes their color and flavor. Oolong tea is partly fermented, and green tea undergoes no fermentation. Matcha is a special form of green tea in which the dried leaves are ground into a fine powder. Decaffeinated teas have been processed to remove most of the naturally occurring caffeine from the leaves. They may still contain trace amounts of caffeine. This is done by using carbon dioxide, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, or water processing. Herbal teas that are naturally caffeine-free include chamomile, peppermint, vanilla, turmeric, ginger, and fruit essence teas. They may have notes of floral, fruit, mint, spice, grassiness, sweetness, or bitterness. The varieties are vast, and the choice is completely up to your personal preferences. Teas are packaged in tea bags, tea sachets, or as loose-leaf. Loose-leaf teas sold in tin canisters or sacks allow you to control how much tea to use, using more to create a stronger flavor or less for more mellowness. Tea bags and sachets hold a standard amount of leaves for optimum flavor and are portable. Store There are five elements to avoid to keep tea as fresh as possible: light, heat, moisture, odor, and air. Tea bags should be stored in their original container or placed in a sealed plastic bin. Loose-leaf teas should be stored in an airtight container. Place all teas in a dark cupboard at a consistent room temperature. Tea tends to absorb odors from food and even other strongly scented teas, so keep them separate. Freezing and refrigerating is not recommended as the moisture introduced can degrade the tea. If unopened, tea will last about one year beyond the \u201cbest by\u201d date. After opening, packaged and loose-leaf teas last about one year. However, some black and oolong teas can last up to two years, and more delicate teas may last only 6 months. The flavor is your best guide to determining how long to keep a tea in your cupboard. Make Avoid purchasing expensive bottled teas or teas from shops that contain added sweeteners. To enjoy the maximum benefits of drinking tea, consider brewing your own at home. You can serve it hot, or make a pitcher of home-brewed iced tea during warmer months. Black and oolong teas are generally steeped in hot or boiling water (about 210\u00ba F) and brewed for about 4-5 minutes. Green tea is steeped at a slightly lower temperature 180\u00ba F from 4-15 minutes. The longer tea steeps, the stronger the flavor with bitter notes. Additives of sugar, cream, or milk can reduce the polyphenol content of tea. For the greatest health benefits, try serving tea plain or without too many additives. A dash of vanilla or cinnamon can mimic sweetness. Some fruit-flavored herbal teas taste naturally sweet to the palate without added sweeteners. Sparkling Iced Tea with Lemon, Cucumber, and Mint Try making this refreshing iced tea at home; the perfect sugar-free alternative to store-bought sweetened tea drinks or sodas. Did You Know? What western coffeehouses commonly refer to as \u201cchai\u201d is more accurately called \u201cmasala chai\u201d or \u201cspiced tea\u201d (\u201cchai\u201d is simply the Hindi word for \u201ctea\u201d). The recipe for this beverage has varied widely across time and place, but today is often made from black tea mixed with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and peppercorns, and served with milk and sweetener. Japan has a rich tea culture, best known for the ceremonial preparation and drinking of green tea. A traditional Japanese tea ceremony, also called \u201cthe way of tea\u201d (\u8336\u9053 [sad\u014d or chad\u014d] or \u8336\u306e\u6e6f [chanoyu]) can take up to multiple hours! Some advertisements claim that tea can speed weight loss, but research on the effects of green tea and fat reduction have shown little promise of weight loss benefits. [25,26] Moreover, it\u2019s best to skip any so-called \u201cweight loss\u201d teas that may contain potentially harmful substances such as laxatives. Yerba mate, or mate, is a popular herbal tea in South America made from the dried leaves of the Ilex paraguariensis tree. It shares traits with coffee in that they both contain the antioxidant polyphenol chlorogenic acid and similar amounts of caffeine. There has been concern that certain processing methods of mate, such as drying the leaves with smoke, may introduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (the carcinogenic substances also found in grilled or smoked meats). [27] Some research links drinking large amounts of mate over time with increased risk of certain cancers, including head and neck, stomach, bladder, and lung, but it is not clear if the risk is due to drinking it very hot or the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, mate fans may choose to drink it at moderate temperatures or to purchase brands that process it by air-drying rather than smoking.

Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature. Dairy milk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. Although dairy milk may come from any mammal, cows, goats, buffalo, and sheep are common producers. This section will focus on dairy milk from cows, and briefly discuss non-dairy plant milk alternatives. Whole cow\u2019s milk contains about 87% water. The remaining 13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Processing techniques remove fat to produce lower fat varieties: \u201creduced fat\u201d contains 2% milkfat, \u201clowfat\u201d contains 1% milkfat, and \u201cnonfat\u201d or \u201cskim\u201d has virtually no milkfat. Cows are often pregnant while they are milked, so dairy milk contains hormones like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), estrogens, and progestins. Some cows are given additional hormones to increase milk production. Source Of Calcium Protein Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) Vitamin B12 Potassium Phosphorus Vitamin A and Vitamin D (added during processing) Milk and Health The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends including three 8-ounce servings of milk daily (or equal portions of other dairy foods like cheese or yogurt), which is justified to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Marketing efforts such as the iconic \u201cGot Milk?\u201d campaign with celebrities donning milk mustaches spread this message as well. However, research has not shown a consistent benefit on bone health with high intakes of milk, and furthermore has suggested potential harm with certain conditions like prostate cancer. [1] Research on milk often produces contrary findings. Some reasons may be the wide range of different nutritional qualities in milk and how milk intake is measured, as seen in the following factors: The amount of milk that is considered a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intake can vary among populations studied. For example, people from Japan tend to drink about less than half of the milk consumed in Western countries [2] Are different classifications of milk included, or just one type? Whole, reduced-fat, fat-free, or organic? The composition of milk (fat, protein from varying amino acids) may differ depending on the breed and feed of the cows. Are other factors in the diet considered, such as if the participants are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, or large amounts of processed meat or refined carbohydrates, which can confound the true health effects of milk? Different forms of dairy foods, such as cheese, or yogurt, may have health effects different than milk. Cardiovascular disease Bone health Weight Diabetes Cancer Bottom line: The health benefits of dairy foods appear to be stronger for fermented types like yogurt, which play a role in the gut microbiome. Milk possesses several individual nutrients that can affect blood pressure and bone health, but some of their health-promoting effects may be weakened by whole milk\u2019s high saturated fat content. Although popular media articles have speculated that whole milk is not less healthful than skim milk, research has not supported this statement in regards to diabetes and heart disease, and a high intake of any type of milk can lead to weight gain due to the extra calories. What is A2 milk? Is raw milk safe to drink? For Your Health and the Planet\u2019s Health The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane\u2014a powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk. Purchase Milk is often sold in cartons or opaque containers because too much exposure to light can cause a loss of vitamin A and B2. Choose a carton with the latest sell-by or use-by date (indicating it is the freshest). Most milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurized and homogenized, processing techniques that use heat to kill most of the bacteria present and break down fat molecules so that texture of milk remains smooth and creamy. What about plant-based milk? Plant-based milks contain no lactose so may be better tolerated than dairy milk in some people. Also, plant-based milk has no cholesterol, and most have little saturated fat. However the nutritional content varies widely, so be sure to read the food label to ensure you are getting the desired nutrients. This chart compares dairy milks to a sample of plant-based milks. As you will see, nutrients vary across types of plant-based milks, as well as among different brands selling similar options. Specific brands may contain more or less of the nutrients depending on if products are fortified, or if added flavors or sweeteners are included. Generally, plant-milks labeled \u201coriginal\u201d will include added sugars, so look for unsweetened options and be sure to check the Nutrition Facts label and ingredients list so you know what you\u2019re buying.

Storage Milk requires refrigeration at a temperature below 40 F. If it has been stored at room temperature for two hours or longer, it is recommended to discard it. Although pasteurization kills much of the bacteria in milk, any remaining bacteria can grow quickly in milk at room temperature or warmer. Once milk is opened, it will last about 3-5 days after the sell-by date on the label. Spoiled milk has a strong, sour odor and lumpy texture caused by excess bacteria producing lactic acid, which curdles the protein in milk and produces off odors. Store milk towards the rear of the refrigerator rather than the front or side shelf door, where the temperature varies the most. Don\u2019t forget to close the carton or recap the bottle to prevent the milk from absorbing the odors and flavors of other foods in the refrigerator. Lactose-free milk undergoes pasteurization and the addition of an enzyme lactase, which breaks down the milk sugar lactose, so it generally lasts longer than regular milk. If refrigerated properly, lactose-free milk can last about 7 days after the sell-by date once it is opened. Serve Milk is not just for drinking by the glass or splashing onto cold cereal. Adding milk to foods can boost one\u2019s intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other nutrients. Blend 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of fresh or frozen berries, and 1 small banana for an easy breakfast drink or snack. Overnight oats. In a mason jar (you can also reuse a clean jelly or salsa jar), add 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of rolled oats, 1 tablespoon chia seeds, 3 tablespoons of chopped nuts, \u00bd sliced banana, and \u00bc cup fresh or frozen berries. Secure the lid and shake the jar well until all the ingredients are mixed. Refrigerate overnight. Hot oatmeal. Cook old-fashioned rolled oats in milk (the ratio is generally \u00bd cup oats to 1 cup milk). Did You Know? Several other animals produce milk including sheep, goat, and yaks. These types of milk are more popular in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries than in the U.S. Sheep\u2019s milk can be made into various cheeses like feta and ricotta, and goat\u2019s milk produces a popular cheese called goat cheese or chevre. How do they compare nutritionally? Sheep, goat, and yak milks contain about the same if not more calcium than cow\u2019s milk. The amount of protein and carbohydrate are about the same. They all contain some lactose but less than found in cow\u2019s milk, so they may be easier to digest for people with lactose sensitivity.

While ice cream and cream cheese are examples of indulgent dairy foods that are viewed as every-so-often treats, a lack of clarity exists over other dairy foods that offer protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other healthful nutrients. Is cheese a healthy food? Is non/low-fat milk and yogurt better for the heart than full-fat versions? Traditionally, whole milk dairy products have been viewed as the less healthful choice because of their predominant type of fat\u2014saturated fat. Saturated fats were targeted in the 1970s and 1980s as potentially causing harm to health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980 recommended choosing non/low-fat dairy foods in place of full-fat versions (except for young children). In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools in the U.S. to replace whole milk with non/low-fat unflavored milk or non-fat flavored milk. Sales of low-fat and fat-free milks, yogurts, and cheeses skyrocketed despite complaints about their lack of flavor and satisfaction. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend three 1-cup (8 ounce) servings of non/low-fat milk or similar amounts of low-fat cheese, yogurt, or other dairy foods for adults and children over 9 years old to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of bone fractures. [1] To the surprise of many, research in the 2000s defied these longstanding guidelines to suggest that full-fat dairy foods might be just as healthful as their lower-fat counterparts, provoking scientists to look more closely at all dairy products. Upon closer examination, they realized that dairy foods are not one and the same. The fermentation process required to make cheese and yogurt may impart unique health benefits as well as improved digestibility from a lower lactose content. That said, how people eat dairy is important to consider. Take cheese for example: is it consumed melted on fast-food burgers, pasta, and pizza that are already high in refined carbohydrate, sodium, and saturated fat? Or is it served in thin wedges, eaten with fresh fruit as a snack or dessert? Another key point is frequency and amount. If people drink several glasses of low-fat milk or snack on reduced-fat cheese throughout the day, they might end up eating as much saturated fat (or more) than if they had consumed one glass of whole milk or serving of full-fat cheese. These questions are important to consider when reviewing scientific research on dairy foods. Source Of Protein Calcium Phosphorus Potassium Vitamin A Vitamin D B Vitamins Saturated fat What is lactose, and what causes lactose intolerance? Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar found in milk and all dairy products. The body breaks down the sugar molecule and digests it with the help of an enzyme called lactase. Some people have low levels of lactase due to genetics, digestive problems, or gastrointestinal surgeries that interfere with its production. Without lactase, the undigested lactose passes into the small intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing symptoms of gas, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation. Dairy foods like milk, ice cream, cream, and soft cheeses like cottage and ricotta are high in lactose. Yogurt and aged cheeses are low in lactose because their production involves fermentation by natural bacteria that break down and consume the lactose. This is why some people with lactose intolerance may be able to safely consume some types of cheese and yogurt without side effects. Lactaid pills are a commercial product that contains the lactase enzyme that breaks down lactose, and can be taken before meals containing dairy to help reduce uncomfortable side effects. Lactaid milk is cow\u2019s milk that contains the lactase enzyme so the product is very low in lactose. Dairy and Health The nutrients and types of fat in dairy are involved with bone health, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are important for bone building, and the high potassium content of dairy foods can help lower blood pressure. Studies on dairy have limitations that may be a cause of seemingly conflicting findings. In observational studies, people who consume a high amount of milk may be different from those who do not in ways that are not fully captured by statistical adjustments. Randomized clinical trials tend to be short in duration with a small number of participants, making it difficult to see possible effects of dairy intake on chronic diseases like heart disease and bone fractures that take years to develop. Thus, longer-term epidemiological studies may provide additional insights. Bone health Cardiovascular disease Diabetes Weight Cancer For Your Health and the Planet\u2019s Health The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane\u2014a powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day). 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk, yogurt, or equivalent amounts of cheese (because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese). If everyone were to consume 2 servings of dairy per day, climate change would be difficult to control. [26] Bottom Line Both full-fat and non/low-fat dairy foods can be good sources of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin D. Dairy foods that undergo fermentation, such as yogurt and some cheeses, are lower in lactose and contain healthful gut bacteria that may benefit digestive health. However, the nutrients in milk can be found in other foods and therefore it is not an essential food even for the normal growth and development in children and for the prevention of health conditions like bone fractures. Although full-fat dairy foods are high in saturated fat, whether full-fat dairy is more harmful (or more beneficial) to health than non/low-fat dairy will depend on the sources calories that replace the dairy fat. If this is sugar there may be little difference, but if this is unsaturated fat (such as in nuts or plant oils), the lower fat version would be better. The total amount of dairy consumption is also important; at only one serving per day, the amount of fat would not be important, whereas it would with 3 or more servings per day. Thus, while more research emerges, the type of dairy one incorporates into their dietary pattern can be a matter of personal preference. Some people enjoy using non-fat milk in their cereal or eating a low-fat Greek yogurt. Others may find that choosing a richer full-fat yogurt as an afternoon snack works well to prevent extra snacking before dinner. The overall dietary pattern is key, and creating a balanced plate allows for 0 to 2 servings daily of dairy (of any type) can be healthy.

Fears of contaminants make many unnecessarily shy away from fish. Fish is a very important part of a healthy diet. Fish and other seafood are the major sources of healthful long-chain omega-3 fats and are also rich in other nutrients such as vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat. There is strong evidence that eating fish or taking fish oil is good for the heart and blood vessels. An analysis of 20 studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants indicates that eating approximately one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish a week\u2014salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, or sardines\u2014reduces the risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. (1) Eating fish fights heart disease in several ways. The omega-3 fats in fish protect the heart against the development of erratic and potentially deadly cardiac rhythm disturbances. They also lower blood pressure and heart rate, improve blood vessel function, and, at higher doses, lower triglycerides and may ease inflammation. The strong and consistent evidence for benefits is such that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the American Heart Association, and others suggest that everyone eat fish twice a week. (2, 3) Unfortunately, fewer than one in five Americans heeds that advice. About one-third of Americans eat seafood once a week, while nearly half eat fish only occasionally or not at all. (4) Although some people may simply not like fish, the generally low consumption is likely also caused by other factors, including perceptions about cost, access to stores that sell fish, and uncertainty about how to prepare or cook fish. Still others may avoid seafood because they worry that they\u2014or their children\u2014will be harmed by mercury, pesticide residues, or other possible toxins that are in some types of fish. Should you forgo fish because of the contaminants they might carry? It\u2019s a controversial topic that is often fueled more by emotion than by fact. Here\u2019s what\u2019s known about the benefits and risks of eating fish and other seafood: Known or likely benefits: In a comprehensive analysis of human studies, Harvard School of Public Health professors Dariush Mozaffarian and Eric Rimm calculated that eating about 2 grams per week of omega-3 fatty acids in fish, equal to about one or two servings of fatty fish a week, reduces the chances of dying from heart disease by more than one-third. (1) Both observational studies and controlled trials have also demonstrated that the omega-3 fats in fish are important for optimal development of a baby\u2019s brain and nervous system, and that the children of women who consume lower amounts of fish or omega-3\u2019s during pregnancy and breast-feeding have evidence of delayed brain development. Possible benefits: Eating fish once or twice a week may also reduce the risk of stroke, depression, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other chronic conditions. (11) Possible risks: Numerous pollutants make their way into the foods we eat, from fruits and vegetables to eggs and meat. Fish are no exception. The contaminants of most concern today are mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and pesticide residues. Very high levels of mercury can damage nerves in adults and disrupt development of the brain and nervous system in a fetus or young child. The effect of the far lower levels of mercury currently found in fish are controversial. They have been linked to subtle changes in nervous system development and a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The case for PCBs and dioxins isn\u2019t so clear. A comprehensive report on the benefits and risks of eating fish compiled by the Institute of Medicine calls the risk of cancer from PCBs \u201coverrated.\u201d (5) Striking a Balance Avoiding fish is certainly one way to avoid mercury or PCBs. But is that the wisest choice, given the benefits of eating fish? Drs. Mozaffarian and Rimm put this in perspective in their analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. (1) First, reviewing data from the Environmental Protection Agency and elsewhere, they calculated that if 100,000 people ate farmed salmon twice a week for 70 years, the extra PCB intake could potentially cause 24 extra deaths from cancer\u2014but would prevent at least 7,000 deaths from heart disease. Second, levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish are very low, similar to levels in meats, dairy products, and eggs. Third, more than 90 percent of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come from such non-seafood sources, including meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. So, given these limited health effects, low levels in fish, and major sources from other foods, the levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish should not influence your decision about which fish to eat (just as it does not influence your decision about whether or not to eat vegetables, meats, dairy products, or eggs, the major sources of PCBs and dioxins). One exception: if you eat local freshwater fish caught by friends or family, it makes sense to consult local advisories about the amounts of such fish you should eat. Learn more about new study that finds no link between mercury exposure and heart disease, from Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. At the levels commonly consumed from fish, there is also limited and conflicting evidence for effects of mercury in adults; thus, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Institutes of Medicine report, and the analysis by Mozaffarian and Rimm all conclude that this evidence is insufficient to recommend limitations on fish intake in adults, given the established benefits of fish consumption for cardiovascular disease. In fact, the easiest way to avoid concern about contaminants is simply to eat a variety of fish and other seafood. Except perhaps for a few fish species, the scale tips in favor of fish consumption for women who are pregnant. High intake of mercury appears to hamper a baby\u2019s brain development. (6) But low intake of omega-3 fats from fish is at least as dangerous. In a study of almost 12,000 pregnant women, children born to those who ate less than two servings of fish a week didn\u2019t do as well on tests of intelligence, behavior, and development as children born to mothers who ate fish at least twice a week. (7) A study conducted by Harvard researchers showed that visual recognition scores in six-month-olds were highest in those whose mothers ate at least two servings of fish a week during pregnancy but who also had low mercury levels. (8) Several other observational studies of fish intake during pregnancy, and randomized controlled trials of fish oil during pregnancy or breast feeding, have found similar benefits of mothers\u2019 fish or fish oil intake for their babies\u2019 brain development. So, women should recognize that avoiding seafood altogether is likely to harm their babies\u2019 brain development. The healthiest approach for women who are or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children is to eat two servings per week of fish or other seafood, including up to one serving per week of white (albacore) canned tuna, and avoid the four fish species higher in mercury (shark, swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel). It is important that women recognize that the list of fish and seafood that they should eat is far larger than the few specific species to be avoided. Here\u2019s what the Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration recommend for women who are or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children: Don\u2019t eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish (sometimes called golden bass or golden snapper) because they contain high levels of mercury. Eat up to 12 ounces (two average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. Shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish are low-mercury fish. Albacore (\u201cwhite\u201d) tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna. So limit your intake of albacore tuna to once a week. You can find a table of various fish, their omega-3 fatty acid content, and their average load of mercury and other contaminants online in the article by Mozaffarian and Rimm. (1) Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don\u2019t consume any other fish during that week. So, these recommendations emphasize that women who are or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children should eat fish, avoiding only four specific (and generally rarely consumed) fish species. Importantly, the latter limitation does not apply to the rest of the population, for whom the evidence supports simply choosing a variety of fish and seafood. What If You Hate Fish? Not all omega-3 fats come from fish. In fact, Americans also consume plant omega-3s in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in flax seeds, walnuts, and a few vegetable oils. In the human body, ALA is not converted to the marine omega-3s. EPA and DHA, to any large extent. So, the evidence does not support eating ALA as a replacement for seafood consumption. On the other hand, some data from observational studies like the Nurses\u2019 Health Study suggest that getting extra ALA may reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease. (9) Another analysis, from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, showed that higher intake of ALA may be particularly important for protection against heart disease in people who didn\u2019t eat much fish. (10) Since these findings haven\u2019t yet been replicated in randomized trials, the exact benefit of ALA is still a bit up in the air, but eating more foods rich in this good fat may also be good for health.

[1] Legumes are a nutritious staple of diets around the world. They are an inexpensive source of protein, vitamins, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Although used interchangeably, the terms \u201clegumes,\u201d \u201cpulses,\u201d and \u201cbeans\u201d have distinct meanings. A legume refers to any plant from the Fabaceae family that would include its leaves, stems, and pods. A pulse is the edible seed from a legume plant. Pulses include beans, lentils, and peas. For example, a pea pod is a legume, but the pea inside the pod is the pulse. The entire legume plant is often used in agricultural applications (as cover crops or in livestock feed or fertilizers), while the seeds or pulses are what typically end up on our dinner plates. Beans in their various forms (kidney, black, pinto, navy, chickpeas, etc.) are just one type of pulse. Legumes are emphasized by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines (about 3 cups a week) and the DASH Eating Plan of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (4-5 half-cup servings a week). [2] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations declared the International Year of Pulses in 2016, focusing on the contribution of pulses in food production and nutritional diversity to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition. [3] Source Of Protein Folate Fiber (both insoluble and soluble) Iron Phosphorus Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids including linoleic and oleic acids Legumes and Health Legumes contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases: Cardiovascular disease Cancer Digestive health Diabetes Obesity What about products made from legumes? Because of their texture, flavor, and nutritional profile, legumes are found in numerous products throughout the supermarket. While these can include classic options such as tofu, peanut butter, and hummus, legumes and their components are also a key ingredient in a wide range of plant-based meat alternatives. Because this product mix relies on varying degrees of processing, consumers should be on the lookout for added sodium, sugar, saturated fat from tropical oils, or other additives. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a processed food in the diet. For Your Health and The Planet\u2019s Health Food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination. However, along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also have differing impacts on the environment. Generally, the production of plant-based foods tends to have lower greenhouse gas emissions, and use less land and water than producing animal-based foods. In transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems\u2014especially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050\u2014legumes are slated to play a key role. The 2019 EAT-Lancet report that outlines a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d recommends 50 grams of legumes (about \u00bc cup) in the daily diet. [14] Legumes have a range of characteristics that make them a relatively sustainable crop. For example, legumes release up to seven times less greenhouse gas emissions per area compared to other crops, and can sequester carbon in soils. They can also make their own nitrogen from the atmosphere, thus reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers. This leaves nitrogen-rich residues in the soil after harvesting; a benefit for the next crop planted in its place. [1] According to the FAO, drought-resistant species of legumes can be of particular benefit to dry environments where food security is often a challenge. They can also help minimize food waste, since pulses can be dried and stored for relatively long periods of time without losing their nutritional value. [15] Bottom Line Despite their wide variety, legumes share many common benefits. They are relatively sustainable and inexpensive, a low glycemic index food, rich in protein and fiber, and satiating. Because of their \u201cmeaty\u201d texture, legumes can even stand in for animal-based protein foods in a variety of preparations. Additionally, their generally neutral flavor makes them versatile to blend well with other ingredients and pair easily with a variety of seasonings. Learn more about some specific legumes, including a variety of ways to incorporate them into your meals: Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans) Whichever name you call them, explore these versatile legumes; a staple of diets worldwide.

You may have also heard that producing dairy and red meat (particularly beef, lamb, and goat) stand out for their disproportionate impact on our planet\u2019s health as well. It\u2019s clear that reducing red meat in our diets can improve our own health and the health of the planet. However, if you\u2019ve grown up (or have grown accustomed to) having beef, pork, and other red meats on your plate at most meals\u2014such a change may seem daunting. But you don\u2019t have to completely cut it out to make a difference; even a partial shift away from a meat-centered diet can be a step in the right direction. If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, here are four key approaches to cutting back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. Simply find your \u201cstarting point\u201d and move forward with the strategies that work for you. Eat a little less red meat, any way you can Assess how often you eat red meat, and see if one of these strategies can help you find a way to cut back a bit. Swap out red meat for healthier meats If you\u2019re thinking of a meal that features red meat, see if you can replace it with a better option, like poultry or seafood. Consume less meat, enjoy more variety This approach boosts healthy plant-based foods like beans, nuts, whole grains, and other veggies, while still providing ways to incorporate some of your favorite animal-based foods. Prioritize hearty and savory plant-based preparations Simple strategies for creating filling, delicious, and even budget-friendly plant-based dishes.

And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee. Source Of Caffeine Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) Magnesium Plant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including cafestol and kahweol One 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Coffee and Health Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50\u2013300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit? Cancer Type 2 Diabetes Heart health Depression Neurodegenerative diseases Gallstones Mortality The bottom line: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee. What about iced coffee? Types Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees. Type of bean. There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight. Type of roast. Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark. Type of grind. A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses. Decaffeinated coffee. This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing. Watch out for hidden calories in coffee drinks Store Place beans or ground coffee in an airtight opaque container at room temperature away from sunlight. Inside a cool dark cabinet would be ideal. Exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light can strip coffee of its flavor. Coffee packaging does not preserve the coffee well for extended periods, so transfer larger amounts of coffee to airtight containers. Coffee can be frozen if stored in a very airtight container. Exposure to even small amounts of air in the freezer can lead to freezer burn. Make Follow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water. For optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time. Use ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks. Did You Know? It is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration! Coffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a pleasant coffee flavor. While water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the coffee. Related Caffeine Caffeine is naturally found in the fruit, leaves, and beans of coffee, cacao, and guarana plants. It is also added to beverages and supplements. Learn about sources of caffeine, and a review of the research on this stimulant and health.

This phantom fat\u2014the worst type of fat for the heart, blood vessels, and rest of the body\u2014was found in thousands of foods; but only those familiar with the \u201ccode words\u201d partially hydrogenated oil and vegetable shortening knew when it was present. Fortunately, after a large body of research in the 1990s sounded the alarm on its deleterious health effects, a series of policy initiatives led to the near elimination of artificial trans fat in the U.S. food supply by 2018. However, the road to eliminating trans fat was not so straightforward, and outside the U.S. there\u2019s still more work to be done. In many developing nations, trans fat intake remains high. Where Do Trans Fats Come From? In the late 19th century, chemists discovered that they could add hydrogen atoms to unsaturated fats by bubbling hydrogen gas through vegetable oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst. [1] This was far more than a chemical curiosity. Partially hydrogenated oils don\u2019t turn rancid as easily as non-hydrogenated fats. They can withstand repeated heating without breaking down, and the process can turn a liquid oil into a solid, which allowed for easier transportation and wider uses. This solid fat was also much less expensive than many solid animal fats. These characteristics were attractive to food makers, and partially hydrogenated oils became a mainstay in margarines, vegetable shortenings, doughnuts, commercial baked goods like packaged pastries and cookies, other snack foods, and in fast-food restaurant deep fryers. At the time, switching from butter or lard (both of which contain high amounts of saturated fat) to a product made from healthy vegetable oil seemed to make sense\u2014and intake of trans fat increased dramatically. Before the advent of partial hydrogenation, the only trans fat that humans consumed came from eating cows (or dairy products), lamb, and deer. In ruminant animals like these, bacteria living in the stomach naturally make small amounts of trans fat. But due to the growth of partial hydrogenation, by the early 1990s, trans fat intake in the United States averaged 2% to 3% of total calories\u2014with many Americans consuming up to three times this amount. Listen Harvard Chan\u2019s This Week in Health Podcast takes a closer look at the history of trans fat, and the decades-long effort to remove it from the U.S. food supply. You\u2019ll hear from two experts who were on the front lines of the battle against trans fats: Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard Chan School, and Michael Jacobson, senior scientist and former executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). Research Sounds the Alarm Today, thanks to a series of research studies, we know that trans fats should be avoided. Eating trans fats increases levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol), especially the small, dense LDL particles that may be more damaging to arteries. It lowers levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol) particles, which scour blood vessels for bad cholesterol and truck it to the liver for disposal. It also promotes inflammation, [2] an overactivity of the immune system that has been implicated in heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Additionally, consuming trans fat reduces the normal healthy responsiveness of endothelial cells, the cells that line all of our blood vessels. In animal studies, eating trans fat also promotes obesity and resistance to insulin\u2014the precursor to diabetes. So when did the research on this harmful fat begin? In 1981, a group of Welsh researchers speculated that trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils might be linked with heart disease. [3] In 1990, a controlled feeding study by two Dutch researchers showed that trans fat consumption increased LDL cholesterol and reduced HDL cholesterol. [4] A 1993 Harvard study strongly supported the hypothesis that intake of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils contributed to the risk of having a heart attack. [5] In this study, researchers found that replacing just 2% of energy from trans fat with healthy unsaturated fat would decrease the risk of coronary heart disease by about one-third. An influential symposium on trans fat later in the 1990s drew public attention to the issue. Science and Advocacy Lead to Change in the U.S. In 2003, following a long campaign led by Dr. Fred Kummerow, along with the Center for Science in the Public Interest and researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled that trans fats must be declared on the Nutrition Facts label by 2006. [6] Despite intense lobbying efforts against the label addition by some parts of the food industry, this ruling sparked a major makeover of the American food supply. The FDA once estimated that approximately 95% of prepared cookies, 100% of crackers, and 80% of frozen breakfast products contained trans fat. When food companies realized that consumers\u2014armed with this new information\u2014would avoid products containing trans fat, many found ways to make their products without partially hydrogenated oils. For example, major manufacturers started using trans-free oils for making tortilla chips and other crunchy snacks; frozen food makers introduced frozen fried chicken products without trans fat; and many major restaurant chains reformulated their products to reduce trans fats. Impacts of the 2006 ruling By 2010, a survey of 83 major-brand grocery store products and restaurant dishes offered encouraging news: when most of these food makers reformulated their products, they cut back on trans fat without increasing saturated fat. [7] A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Americans\u2019 blood-levels of trans fats dropped 58 percent from 2000 to 2009\u2014evidence that the labeling law has had its desired effect. [8] The addition of trans fat on the Nutrition Facts label was certainly a victory for public health\u2014but there was more work to be done. Despite the ruling, manufacturers could still claim \u201c0 grams of trans fat\u201d on the label if the product contained less than 0.5 grams of trans fats per serving. While seemingly minimal, even small amounts of trans fat could add up over the course of a day. In these cases, the only way consumers could avoid trans fats from packaged products was by identifying partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list. Furthermore, since the ruling did not cover foods without labels\u2014such as those sold in bakeries, cafeterias, schools, and restaurants\u2014consumers couldn\u2019t easily choose to avoid potentially trans fat-laden foods in these settings. Still, word on the harm of trans fat was out, and states, counties, and cities spurred additional change with educational efforts and local bans on trans fats. In 2006, New York City became the largest city in the nation to require its restaurants, cafeterias, and schools to go trans fat-free, and other cities and towns such as Boston followed its lead. California was the first state to pass legislation phasing out trans fats from restaurants and baked goods by 2010 and 2011, respectively. NYC leads by example On December 5, 2006, the New York City Board of Health unanimously approved a ban that gave restaurants until July 2008 to phase out the use of artificial trans fats. The city even created a \u201cTrans Fat Help Center\u201d to help food service professionals comply with the ban. \u201cThis will save many hundreds, and probably thousands, of premature deaths each year in New York and will also likely reduce the development of type 2 diabetes and dementia,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, then chair of Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition, in response to the ban. Leading up to the decision, Willett and Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian detailed the many negative health effects associated with trans fat intake in testimony to the New York City Board of Health. In 2015\u2014over 10 years since the initial ruling and decades after research showed the harms of trans fat intake\u2014the FDA ruled that partially hydrogenated oils are no longer \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d for use in human food. Although earlier educational efforts and local bans had vastly reduced partially hydrogenated oils, this decision was the final nail in the coffin for industrial trans fat in America\u2019s food supply. Given three years to comply, food manufacturers are banned from using partially hydrogenated oils as of June 18, 2018. (Industry will be allowed some minor manufacturing and petitioned uses, though even these are set to be phased out by 2021. However, the FDA denied a last-minute petition by the Grocery Manufacturers Association for certain continued uses.) The story of trans fat in the U.S., while lengthy, serves as an excellent example where scientific evidence was translated into policy actions to improve public health. As early as 2006, researchers estimated that eliminating trans fats from America\u2019s food supply could prevent up to 1 in 5 heart attacks and related deaths; which would mean a quarter of a million fewer heart attacks and related deaths each year in the U.S. alone! [9] Encouragingly, research has already found that earlier bans on the use of trans fats in New York State public eateries are associated with a drop in heart attacks and strokes. [10] Work to be Done Worldwide Outside of the U.S., a number of countries, such as Denmark, Switzerland, Canada, and Britain, have already restricted or banned trans fats. However, trans fat remains prevalent in many developing nations where inexpensive partially hydrogenated oils have become staples not only for the food industry, but also for home use. This shift away from traditional cooking oils toward partially hydrogenated oils is contributing to the growing global epidemic of cardiovascular disease. For example, trans fats in India are often found in \u201cvanaspati,\u201d a partially hydrogenated oil often used as a low-cost alternative in food preparation. [11] Encouragingly, in 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) also put trans fat in the spotlight on a global stage. Estimating that industrial trans fat intake leads to more than 500 thousand deaths from cardiovascular disease annually, the WHO is calling on governments to eliminate, or \u201cREPLACE,\u201d trans fats by 2023 through six strategic actions: REview dietary sources of industrially-produced trans fats and the landscape for required policy change. Promote the replacement of industrially-produced trans fats with healthier fats and oils. Legislate or enact regulatory actions to eliminate industrially-produced trans fats. Assess and monitor trans fats content in the food supply and changes in trans fat consumption in the population. Create awareness of the negative health impact of trans fats among policy makers, producers, suppliers, and the public. Enforce compliance of policies and regulations. Because the WHO has no enforcement capacity, it is up to national and local governments to carry out these actions in to eliminate industrial trans fats. Two years into the campaign, the WHO reported that 58 countries so far have introduced laws that will protect 3.2 billion people from the harmful substance by the end of 2021. However, more than 100 countries still need to take actions to remove trans fat from their food supplies. Progress in Asia Currently, only two countries throughout Asia have implemented best-practice trans fat policies: Thailand: In January 2018, Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health released a notification banning partially hydrogenated oils and food products containing them by January 2019. India: In early 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India passed a policy reducing the current permissible limit of trans fats in oils/fats in food products from 5% to 2% by 2022. Tips for Lowering Trans Fat Intake If you live or spend time in a country where there is weak regulation or no ban on industrial trans fat, here are a few tips that may help you lower your intake: Choose liquid vegetable oils. Avoid eating commercially prepared baked foods (cookies, pies, donuts, etc.), snack foods, and processed foods, including fast foods. To be on the safe side, assume that all such products contain trans fats unless they are labeled otherwise. When foods containing partially hydrogenated oils can\u2019t be avoided, choose products that list the partially hydrogenated oils near the end of the ingredient list. To avoid trans fats in restaurants, one strategy is to avoid deep-fried foods (since restaurants may use partially hydrogenated oils in their fryers) and desserts. You may be able to help change these cooking practices by asking your server, the chef, or manager if the establishment uses only trans fat-free oils and foods.

It was discovered in ancient civilizations during the rise of agriculture and domestication of sheep and goats for their milk. By accident, when the milk was left sitting out in the sun for hours, it turned sour and the protein components curdled into solids. When the liquid portion, or whey, was drained and removed leaving only the solid curds, farmers realized these curds had a pleasing taste. Since then, countries around the world have experimented with cheese-making, varying the types of milk, how long the cheese is allowed to age and ripen, and using different additives like salt or acid to produce unique textures and flavors. India is known for its mild-tasting soft paneer, Greece discovered salty crumbly feta made from sheep or goat\u2019s milk, and Sardinia developed the hard, pungent grating cheese called Pecorino Romano. Cheese is a nutrient-dense dairy food, providing protein, fats, and minerals. Some hard block cheeses that contain little moisture like Parmigiano-Reggiano and aged cheddar are easily stored and travel well because they do not require refrigeration. Cheese may be better tolerated than milk in some people because it is lower in lactose, a type of sugar that is not easily digested if people lack the enzyme to break it down. Source Of Calcium Protein Phosphorus Vitamin B12 Vitamin A The nutrients in cheese vary. One ounce of hard cheese, or a wedge about the size of your thumb, contains about 120 calories, 8 grams (g) of protein, 6 g saturated fat, and 180 milligrams (mg) of calcium. A half-cup of soft cheese like 4% full-fat cottage cheese has about 120 calories, 14 g protein, 3 g saturated fat, and 80 mg of calcium. Most cheeses are high in sodium with 300-450 mg per serving because salt is a key ingredient to hold moisture and prevent overgrowth of bacteria. However, some cheeses like goat, whole-milk mozzarella, and Swiss are low in sodium with only 50-100 mg per serving. Cheese and Health Full-fat dairy foods contain a high amount of saturated fat and some cholesterol. Milk fat is about 70% saturated fat, 25% monounsaturated, and 5% polyunsaturated. Because a high intake of saturated fat can increase LDL cholesterol levels, and because cheese is often high in sodium, it is generally recommended to eat cheese in limited amounts as its components may exert a negative health effect. However, there is ongoing debate about the impact of cheese on health. Though the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend choosing low-fat dairy (milk, yogurt, and cheese) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), some reports suggest that full-fat dairy may lower risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes. [1] It is suggested in these studies that perhaps specific nutrients in cheese may be protective for the heart, like calcium and conjugated linoleic acid, and that the types of saturated fatty acids in cheese have a different effect on the heart than other types such as that in red meat. During the processing of some cheeses, bacteria are added during the fermentation stage, which may alter its effects on blood cholesterol. However, this is a fairly new theory with early evidence arising mainly from certain cheeses manufactured with probiotics. An important point to consider is that many published studies showing a health benefit of cheese are funded by industries such as dairy associations or large commercial corporations that sell dairy foods. The studies discussed below did not have industry conflicts of interest, to the best of our knowledge. It appears that cheese might have some benefit with strokes and weight changes, specifically when replacing red meat in the diet. That said, the dietary patterns associated with cheese intake can make a difference. In the U.S. for example, cheese is often added to a pizza or burger containing refined grains, meats high in saturated fats, and sodium. Such a dietary pattern is likely to have an adverse health effect regardless of the amount of cheese consumed. Cardiovascular disease Mortality Prostate cancer Weight Bottom line: Although cheese is high in saturated fat and sodium, it is also rich in calcium and protein, and some fermented types contain probiotics. One can enjoy a modest amount of cheese as part of a healthful diet, but how it is eaten is key. Eating cheese with foods like refined grains (white pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and processed meats may negate its health benefits. On the other hand, cheese may provide health benefits if consumed as a replacement for red and processed meats or eaten as a snack instead of potato chips (although nuts would still be a healthier snack option!). For Your Health and the Planet\u2019s Health The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane\u2014a powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day, with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day. 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk, or equivalent amounts of cheese (because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese). Production There are three main components for making cheese: the milk, a coagulant, and bacterial cultures. Cheese is made mostly of milk, whether from cows, sheep, goats, buffalo or a blend of these milks. A coagulant is a substance added to milk to help solids form out of the liquid portion. This is typically an acid like vinegar, or rennet, a natural enzyme found in the stomach lining of cows. Starter bacteria are added to help with coagulation, impart flavor and texture, and prevent the growth of harmful organisms. They feed on lactose sugar in the milk. You can see the work of bacteria in the eye holes in Swiss cheese or in the pungency of sharp cheddar. Sometimes molds are added that produce an unusual appearance like the greyish-blue veins in blue cheese and the hard rinds of Brie and Camembert. Pasteurized or raw milk may be used. Both types of milk are heated to a temperature to allow the starter bacteria to grow and ferment the milk. If raw milk is used, the cheese must further be aged for at least two months to reduce the exposure to harmful pathogens present in the milk. A coagulant is then added with heat, after which the whey is drained out. At this point, salt or herbs may be added and the cheese may be pressed into blocks. Depending on the type of cheese, it will be stored from months to years until the desired ripening and aging is achieved. Why do some cheeses stink? Bacteria are needed to age certain cheeses, which contribute to a cheese\u2019s smell, flavor, and texture. The strongest smells are often concentrated in the cheese\u2019s rind or outer covering, which develops naturally as the cheese ages. Before the rind forms, a soft-ripened cheese is first washed in a brine solution that contains bacteria, the same species that is responsible for human foot and body odor! Cheese experts assure cheese lovers that the flavor of stinky cheeses is usually milder than its smell, and the combination of the strong odor with the flavor and texture of the cheese is actually necessary to create a unique and pleasing total sensory experience. Purchase Most cheese is sold refrigerated in the dairy case. Some grocery stores display gourmet cheeses in a separate case. There are also boutique cheese shops that may carry more unique varieties of imported or artisan cheeses. A cheesemaker makes cheeses; a fromager or cheesemonger sells cheeses. Purchasing cheese from a specialty cheese shop is often pricier than cheese found in the dairy case, so it is worth your time to find a seller that can educate you on different types of cheeses available. This will ensure that you receive your money\u2019s worth of the variety that best fits your taste preferences. Consider: Type of milk. In general, cow\u2019s milk cheese tends to be rich and buttery, goat\u2019s milk cheeses carry a sharp tang, and sheep\u2019s milk cheeses have a mild nutty flavor. Texture. Hard, granular, crumbly (pecorino, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Grana Padano, manchego, aged Gouda, Asiago, aged cheddar); semi-hard (mild cheddar, Colby, Gouda); semi-soft (haloumi, chevre or goat, baby Swiss); or soft (Brie, Camembert, cottage, feta, farmer, Gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, ricotta). Location. Cheese flavor is affected by climate, temperature, diet of the animal, and when the animals were milked, so even the same type of cheese tastes different when produced in different areas of the world. Storage Softer cheeses like cream, cottage, goat, and shredded types have a high moisture content and should be refrigerated to prevent bacterial growth. The lower moisture in harder cheeses prevents bacteria from developing so they do not need to be refrigerated, but cooler temperatures can preserve their flavor and texture longer. In general, opened soft cheeses last in the refrigerator at 40-45 F for about 2 weeks. After that, there is risk of mold growth. Check the label\u2019s use-by date for storage information about specific cheeses. Unopened refrigerated hard cheeses last about 2-4 months; if opened they last about 1 month. Sealed and opened hard cheeses last even longer in the freezer, about 7 months, if they are tightly sealed from oxygen. Although cheese may be sold in plastic wrapping or cellophane, tightly wrapped plastic can cause too much moisture to collect and increases the risk of rotting. Rewrapping the cheese loosely in wax paper or aluminum foil can prevent the cheese from drying out but allow it to \u201cbreathe.\u201d If the cheese is refrigerated and has a strong odor, it may be placed in a sealed plastic container. It can also be placed in the produce drawer in the refrigerator to further regulate temperature, minimize exposure to oxygen, and prevent odor transfer to other foods. Serve Typically the flavor of cheese is best at room temperature, whether a soft or hard cheese. The rind of hard cheeses naturally forms during the ripening process. In most cases it is edible but may be removed if it is too tough or waxy. Softer rinds such as that with Brie are often enjoyed along with the creamy interior. Although cheese is commonly served with crackers as a snack, try taking a few bites first of just the cheese to appreciate its unique flavor. Crackers can dilute the full flavor of the cheese. If consuming cheese with wine, know that certain pairings can enhance cheese flavor. Fresh softer cheeses like Brie, ricotta, goat, and halloumi pair well with white wines and red wines low in tannins like Chablis, Moscato, and Pinot Grigio. Harder cheeses like aged cheddar, pecorino, and manchego go well with high-tannin wines like Burgundy, Bordeaux, and Zinfandel. You might try pairing very salty cheese like blue with the contrasting sweet flavor of a Port or sherry. Similarly, salty cheeses are also complimented by sweet dried and fresh fruits: apples, cherries, dates, figs, and apricots. If you are concerned about the cholesterol, sodium, and high saturated fat content of full-fat cheeses, consider using them as a condiment. Top off a soup, salad, vegetables, or grain dish with a freshly shredded tangy cheese. Crumble a small handful of feta or goat cheese onto raw or cooked vegetables. Add a dusting of shredded mozzarella to a homemade pizza. If you aren\u2019t a fan of cheese, or looking to reduce your consumption, nuts and seeds can be a satiating swap in a variety of ways: almond or sunflower seed butter spread on a sandwich; pecans sprinkled on a salad; or freshly toasted walnuts finely grated over the top of a dish. Increasingly, cashews, macadamia, and other nuts are also being used in a variety of dairy-free cheeses, where nut milks are cultured with bacteria and aged to impart that classic tangy flavor. Did You Know? Some types of cheese are low in lactose and may be tolerated in people who have lactose intolerance. Firmer cheeses such as cheddar, mozzarella, and Swiss cheese tend to be lower in lactose, but creamy cheeses like cottage, ricotta, and cream cheese are higher in lactose. Europe produces and eats the most cheese worldwide. The biggest consumers, the French, eat about 57 pounds of cheese annually per person! Americans eat less at about 34 pounds a year, however the most notable difference between the two countries may be the typical role of cheese on the plate. In France, cheese is often served as a post-meal palate cleanser before dessert, or as the dessert itself. It is purposefully and artfully cut into various shapes and arranged with other types of cheeses to contrast flavors and textures of soft, medium, and hard. It is often eaten slowly and savored, and sips of wine may be taken between each bite. In the U.S., cheese is more often added to numerous mixed dishes\u2014melted into pasta, topping a burger, coating a pizza, or stacked on crackers. Of course, these approaches to cheese consumption are not mutually exclusive. Brie can be found in Boston, just as easy as cheesy pizza in Paris.

In reality, nuts are excellent sources of healthy fat, protein, and other healthful nutrients. One surprising finding from nutrition research is that people who regularly eat nuts are less likely to have heart attacks or die from heart disease than those who rarely eat them. Several of the largest cohort studies, including the Adventist Study, the Iowa Women\u2019s Health Study, the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, and the Physicians\u2019 Health Study have shown a consistent 30 percent to 50 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or cardiovascular disease associated with eating nuts several times a week. In fact, the FDA now allows some nuts and foods made with them to carry this claim: \u201cEating a diet that includes one ounce of nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.\u201d There are several ways that nuts could have such an effect. The unsaturated fats they contain help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol. One group of unsaturated fat found in walnuts, the omega-3 fatty acids, appears to prevent the development of erratic heart rhythms. Omega-3 fatty acids (which are also found in fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish) may also prevent blood clots, much as aspirin does. In one large study examining nuts and health, researchers analyzed data from over 210,000 health professionals followed up to 32 years. They found that, compared with those who never or almost never ate nuts, people who ate one ounce of nuts five or more times per week had a 14% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease during the study period. [1] Both peanuts (technically a legume, but nutritionally similar to nuts) and walnuts were linked with lower disease risk. Listen to a podcast on the study: See Transcript Another study found that nut consumption may help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease among people with type 2 diabetes (a condition associated with an increased risk for high cholesterol, heart disease, and stroke). Researchers found that those who ate five 28-gram servings of nuts per week had a 17% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease, a 34% lower risk of cardiovascular disease death, and a 31% reduced risk of all-cause premature death (compared to people who reported eating less than a single serving per month). [2] Since the study\u2019s 16,217 participants were asked about nut consumption both before and after they were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, researchers also found that those who increased their intake after diagnosis had an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, a 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease, a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease death, and a 27% percent lower risk of all-cause premature death (compared with those who did not change their nut consumption after diagnosis). Nuts are rich in arginine, an amino acid needed to make a molecule called nitric oxide that relaxes constricted blood vessels and eases blood flow. They also contain vitamin E, folate, potassium, fiber, and other healthful nutrients. Because different nuts supply a different mix of nutrients, it\u2019s a good idea to incorporate a variety of nuts into a healthy eating plan. Of course, eating nuts won\u2019t do much good if you gobble them in addition to usual snacks and meals. At an average of 185 calories per ounce, a handful of walnuts a day could add 10 pounds or more in a year if you don\u2019t cut back on something else. This weight gain would tip the scales toward heart disease, not away from it. Instead, eat nuts instead of chips or other, less healthy snacks. Or try using them instead of meat in main dishes, or as a healthful crunch in salads.

[1] In some households, rice is included with more than one meal a day. This starchy high-calorie grain is generally low cost, making it accessible to all and a vital base of many diets. Each country showcases a rice specialty to reflect local spices and taste preferences: risotto in Italy, paella in Spain, jambalaya in the southern U.S., coconut rice in Colombia, steamed rice in China, rice and beans in Mexico, and sweet rice in Portugal, to name a few. The scientific name for rice is Oryza. Oryza sativa is the most common species and is subdivided into the long-grain indica, and short-grain japonica. Tools for farming rice have been found in China dating back 8000 years. Merchant traders helped the gradual spread of rice across the continents. Source Of* (*primarily whole grain varieties) Fiber Vitamins B1 (thiamin) and B6 Magnesium Phosphorus Selenium Manganese Types There are thousands of types of Oryza sativa, which can differ in size, thickness, stickiness, color, aroma, and flavor. Rice is often broadly categorized based on its shape or method of processing: Long, short, or medium grain This refers to the length and width of the rice grain after cooking: Long grains have a slender kernel over four times as long as they are wide. When cooked, long grain rice stays separate and fluffy (e.g., Jasmine and Basmati rice). Medium grains have a shorter, wider kernel, yielding a tender and semi-sticky consistency when cooked (e.g., Arborio rice). Short grains have a kernel only twice as long as they are wide, and yield the stickiest texture when cooked (e.g., \u201csushi\u201d rice). Whole or refined grain Is the rice in its whole, intact form (like \u201cbrown\u201d rice), or has it been milled and polished (like \u201cwhite\u201d rice)? Whole: Just like all whole grains, rice naturally contains three edible components\u2014the bran, germ, and endosperm (the inedible hull is removed). \u201cBrown\u201d rice is the typical whole grain rice, though this describes not a particular variety but the natural color of the grain. However, whole grain rice is not limited to one color\u2014it also comes in shades of black, purple, and red. Because the fibrous bran layer and nutrient-rich germ remain intact, these varieties typically take longer to cook, and have a nuttier and chewier texture than refined white rice. Refined: Rice that is polished to remove the bran layers and embryo so that only the starchy white endosperm remains\u2014hence the name \u201cwhite\u201d rice (again, this refers to the color and not one particular variety). The milling and polishing process removes the majority of naturally occurring B vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber, so B vitamins and iron are added back. Food labels will display the term \u201cenriched\u201d to indicate this. However, only a fraction of the original amount of these nutrients is added back. Of course, when it comes to cooking, specific varieties of rice are often chosen for their unique characteristics. Here are a few popular types: Arborio: A medium-grain rice popular for making risotto and puddings. It undergoes less milling than long-grain rice so it retains more starch, which is released during cooking to produce a naturally creamy consistency without becoming mushy. Unlike other rice cooking methods, water must be added to Arborio rice gradually in segments, with constant stirring, to produce the creamy texture of risotto. Arborio rice is available in both brown and white versions. Basmati, Jasmine: These are varieties of long-grain rice with fragrant aromas that are available in both brown and white versions. Black (Forbidden), Purple, or Red: These types of short or medium-grain colorful rice contain a natural plant phytochemical called anthocyanins, a flavonoid with antioxidant properties that is also found in blueberries and blackberries. Their nutritious bran and germ layers are intact similar to brown rice. Glutinous: Named for its glue-like consistency (not for gluten, which it does not contain), this short-grain rice is especially sticky when cooked. This is because it contains primarily one component of starch, called amylopectin, while other types of rice contain both amylopectin and amylose. Glutinous rice is particularly popular throughout Asia, and is available in a range of colors including white, brown, and black/purple. Rice and Health Diabetes Cardiovascular health Should I be concerned about arsenic in rice? Prepare Before cooking, rinse rice in cool water until it runs clear to remove excess starch. If rice is obtained from bulk bins, rinsing also helps to remove dust or any unwanted material. It may then be soaked to reduce cooking time and stickiness. Keep in mind that excess washing and rinsing may remove some water-soluble B vitamins, especially for polished enriched white rice, in which the vitamins have been sprayed onto the surface of the grain. Rice is typically boiled in water or steamed, as it absorbs water and softens during the cooking process. Long-grain varieties tend to produce fluffy separated grains after cooking, while short or medium grains become sticky. Make Follow package directions as different varieties of rice require differing amounts of water and cook times. In general, use a 2:1 ratio for cooking rice, or 2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add rice and stir into water. Place a lid on the pot and reduce heat to low-medium. Simmer for about 20 minutes for white rice, and 40-45 minutes for brown rice and other minimally processed varieties. Remove from heat and allow to steam in the covered pot for 5-10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork to separate the grains. For extra flavor, use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water while cooking, or add spices into the cooking water. If using fresh chopped herbs, such as chopped parsley, dill, or chives, gently stir them into cooked rice after it is removed from the heat but still steaming in the pot. Easy ways to use cooked rice or leftover rice: Saut\u00e9 chopped vegetables and cooked meat or tofu in a pan, then add cooked rice and stir mixture well. Add bulk to soup by throwing in a cup of cooked rice. Add a handful of cooked rice to a salad. For an easy vegan rice bowl, mix together one cup of cooked rice, \u00bd cup cooked beans, \u00bd cup salsa, and a handful of greens.

There are over 40,000 varieties of rice worldwide! Wild rice is not in the same rice family as Oryza sativa. It is actually a seed from a grassy aquatic plant. It is high in fiber and minerals and contains slightly more protein than brown rice. It possesses such an intense nutty flavor that is often mixed with milder tasting grains.

The plant has been cultivated for about 5000 years and is indigenous to the Andean region of South America, specifically Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. After the seeds are harvested they undergo processing to remove the natural saponins, a bitter-tasting chemical compound coating the exterior that acts as a natural pesticide. Quinoa is usually harvested by hand due to the differing levels of maturity of the seeds even within one plant. Therefore seed losses may occur if mechanically harvested. However, in the U.S., seed varieties that have a more consistent maturity are selected to allow for mechanical processing. Source Of Manganese Phosphorus Magnesium Folate Thiamin (Vitamin B1) Quinoa and Health Though technically a seed, Quinoa is classified as a whole grain and is a good source of plant protein and fiber. One cup cooked provides about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. Unlike some plant proteins, quinoa is a complete protein, meaning that it contains all nine essential amino acids that our bodies cannot make on their own. Quinoa is also naturally gluten-free and can be eaten safely if one has gluten intolerance such as celiac disease. Make Packaged quinoa is usually pre-rinsed but some brands may advise rinsing before cooking to remove any remaining saponins. Use a fine mesh strainer to catch the small seeds and run the quinoa under cool water for a few passes. Quinoa is prepared similarly to rice using two parts liquid to one part dry quinoa. One cup of dry quinoa will yield 3 cups cooked, and can be prepared in water, stock, or other liquids. You may also add herbs or spices during cooking such as bay leaves, marjoram, thyme, black pepper, or garlic or onion powder. Add the seeds, liquid, and desired herbs to a pot and bring to a boil on high heat. When a rolling boil is reached, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until tender. You may notice a little white \u201ctail\u201d unfold when it is fully cooked; this is the nutritious germ. Fluff with a fork. If the quinoa is too wet or you prefer a drier quinoa, drain the cooked quinoa in a strainer and return to the pot. Cover and let sit for 15 minutes to dry out further. For easier cooking, quinoa can be prepared in a rice cooker with the same ratio of 1 cup quinoa to 2 cups water. Serve Prepare as a breakfast cereal by cooking the quinoa in milk or water. Stir in diced fresh fruit, cinnamon, and a tablespoon of nuts. Substitute quinoa in place of rice in stir-fries and sushi. Add a half to one cup of cooked quinoa to salads or soups for more heartiness. Replace pasta with quinoa in pasta salad recipes. Pop quinoa similarly to popcorn. Place a 6-inch deep pot over medium-high heat. When the pan is very hot, add enough quinoa to cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer. Turn the heat to medium, then cover and shake the pot to ensure a more even temperature and less burnt seeds. Open the lid slightly a few times to allow steam to escape. Continue shaking the pan until popping slows or you smell burning. Pour the grains onto a baking sheet to cool. Season as desired.

The grain refers specifically to the edible seeds of oat grass, which is what ends up in our breakfast bowls. Whether loved or hated for their mushy yet hearty texture when cooked, oats are most prized for their nutritional value and health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration allows the use of a health claim on food labels associating a reduced risk of coronary heart disease with the consumption of beta-glucan soluble fiber from whole grain oats. [1] Oatmeal is also a desired asset to those trying to lose weight and control hunger levels due to its high water and soluble fiber content. Source Of Fiber (insoluble and soluble) Phosphorus Thiamine Magnesium Zinc Types of oats Oats are available in a variety of forms, based on how they are processed. The following list shows the types of oats in order of least to most processing. Although the nutritional content between steel-cut and instant oats is relatively similar, their effects on blood sugar are not. The least processed oats, like groats or steel-cut, generally take longer to digest so they have a lower glycemic index than rolled or instant oats. Oat Groats: The whole oat kernels that have been cleaned, with only the loose, inedible hulls removed. Groats contain the intact germ, endosperm, and bran. Oat bran, which contains the most fiber in a groat, is also removed and eaten as a cereal or added to recipes to boost fiber content. Steel-Cut or Irish: Oat groats that have been cut into two or three smaller pieces either using a steel blade. The larger the size of the pieces, the longer they will take to cook. Scottish Oats: Oat groats that have been stone-ground into a meal, creating a porridge-like texture when cooked. Rolled or Old-Fashioned: Oat groats that have been steamed, rolled and flattened into flakes, and then dried to remove moisture so they are shelf-stable. Quick or Instant: Oat groats that are steamed for a longer period and rolled into thinner pieces so that they can absorb water easily and cook very quickly. Be aware that many brands of instant oats come sweetened or flavored, so be sure to check the ingredients for no added sugar. Oats and Health Oats contain several components that have been proposed to exert health benefits. The primary type of soluble fiber in oats is beta-glucan, which has been researched to help slow digestion, increase satiety, and suppress appetite. Beta-glucan can bind with cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestine and transport them through the digestive tract and eventually out of the body. Whole oats also contain plant chemicals called phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens that act as antioxidants to reduce the damaging effects of chronic inflammation that is associated with various diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [2] Because available research specific to oats is limited, most of the studies below assessed whole grain intake, which included several types of whole grains in addition to oats. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to oats alone. Heart Disease: Oats are associated with heart health benefits, but research shows differing degrees of benefit. Part of the variation may be caused by meta-analyses or reviews that compared different types of studies, or compared different oat forms (oat groats vs. instant). Some studies analyzed not just oats intake but a more general whole-grain intake. Other studies did not specify the exact type of oats used. A systematic review of nine randomized controlled trials did not find adequate evidence to show that whole grain diets including oats reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease or lower blood cholesterol or blood pressure. However, the study authors acknowledged the small sample sizes and relatively short durations of the interventions (four months or less). These studies included a range of whole grain foods in addition to oats such as brown rice, whole wheat, barley, and rye. [3] In contrast, a meta-analysis of 18 studies that included mainly cohort studies found that the highest whole-grain intakes (including various types of whole grains in addition to oats) compared with the lowest intakes were significantly associated with a 21% reduced risk of heart disease. [4] A prospective cohort of 54,871 Danish adults ages 50\u201364 found that men and women with the highest quartile of total whole grain intake had a 25% and 27% lower risk of heart attack than individuals with intakes in the lowest quartile. Rye and oats, but not wheat, were associated with lower heart disease risk, especially in men. [5] A meta-analysis found that eating 3 grams of beta-glucan soluble fiber daily from whole oats modestly decreased blood cholesterol levels by about 12 points. [6] Diabetes: Beta-glucan fiber may help to prevent sharp rises in blood sugar and insulin levels after eating a meal, and may benefit gut health as the fiber is broken down and fermented by intestinal bacteria. [7-9] Though a carbohydrate-rich food, minimally processed whole grain oats can be incorporated into a diabetic diet. The glycemic load of less processed oats like steel-cut is low to medium, while highly processed instant oats have a high glycemic load. A meta-analysis of 14 controlled trials and two observational studies following people with type 2 diabetes found that, compared with the control groups, oats intake (specified as \u201coats or oatmeal or oats-containing products\u201d) significantly reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (a test that measures average blood glucose over the previous 2-3 months) particularly in those with a high baseline A1c. It also significantly reduced blood sugar and insulin rises after eating a meal. [7] A randomized controlled trial looked at the effects of a 30-day dietary intervention given to 298 adults with type 2 diabetes, with follow-up at one year. Two of the four intervention groups received either 50 grams or 100 grams daily of \u201cwhole grain oats\u201d along with a healthful diet. The oats were equivalent in nutritional value to minimally processed oat groats. The other two groups had either no dietary change or followed a generally healthful low-fat high-fiber diet. Both oat intervention groups saw a significant reduction of blood glucose after meals compared with control groups, with the higher oat intake showing a greater reduction. The study also showed modest weight loss at one year in the 100-gram oat group. [8] Weight Control: Beta-glucan fiber attracts water and increases the viscosity (or thickness) of digested food, which increases the volume of food in the gut. This slows down digestion and the rate that nutrients are absorbed, which in turn increases satiety. Short-chain fatty acids produced from bacteria that ferment beta-glucan fibers may also increase satiety through a chain reaction of events that regulate appetite hormones. [10] Although several randomized controlled trials have shown that intake of beta-glucan oat fiber can increase satiety, other studies have not consistently shown that intake of oats produces the desired outcome of significant weight loss. [7,8,10] Digestive Health: Fiber contributes to bowel regularity and the prevention of constipation. It has the ability to increase the weight and water content of stool, making them easier to pass. [11] Cereal fibers, as found in wheat bran and oat bran, are considered more effective than fiber from fruits and vegetables. The breakdown and fermentation of beta-glucan oat fiber has also been reported to increase the diversity of gut microbiota [8]. This may in turn improve certain digestive issues such as diarrhea, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, more research is needed to evaluate the role of various microbiota on digestive conditions. Make Oatmeal: A breakfast favorite, cooked oats pair well with fruits, nuts, and seeds. Follow package directions for exact cooking times. Generally, less-processed oats such as steel-cut take 25-30 minutes to cook, whereas instant oats take 1-2 minutes. Overnight Oats: A quick, easy no-cook solution for a nutrient-dense breakfast or snack. In a medium glass jar, add \u00bd cup old-fashioned or rolled oats (not instant), \u00bd-1 cup liquid such as dairy milk, soy milk, or nut milk, and \u00bd cup of any chopped fruit (banana, melon, apple, grapes). Additional optional ingredients include a few tablespoons of Greek yogurt, 1-2 tablespoons of chia/flaxseeds, nuts, or any spices. Tightly screw on the lid and shake the jar vigorously until all ingredients are incorporated well. Refrigerate overnight or for at least four hours. The oats will soften and the mixture will thicken into a pudding-like texture. Oat Flour: These are oats that have been ground to a flour-like consistency. Although it may be tempting to substitute oat flour for regular flour in baked recipes, keep in mind that oat flour lacks gluten, a crucial component that adds structure, moisture, and volume to a baked product; without it, cookies would crumble and breads would become dense and lack volume. However, oat flour can add chewiness to cookies and a boost of nutrients to breads. Substitute 25-30% of flour in a recipe with oat flour for best results. Oat Risotto: Oats are also delicious in savory dishes. An example is replacing rice in risotto with whole oat groats or steel-cut oats. Typically, the oats are first toasted for a few minutes in hot oil with aromatics like shallots or diced onion. Then stock and/or water are added, 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition, until the oats are cooked (about 25 minutes). Other Ideas: Add \u00bd cup dry old-fashioned oats to batter, such as for breads and cookies. Add 2-3 tablespoons of oat bran to any hot or cold cereal.

Pure oats are gluten-free but most commercial brands are processed in facilities that also produce gluten-containing wheat, rye, and barley. Cross-contamination can also occur if oats are grown too close to wheat crops. If there is cross-contamination of gluten in an oat product, it is difficult to know exactly how much. The Food and Drug Administration allows the voluntary use of the regulated term \u201cgluten-free\u201d to refer to products that contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Because the term is voluntary, some brands of oats may actually be gluten-free although not labeled as such. However, those who have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity may wish to choose oats specifically labeled \u201cgluten-free.\u201d Oats are sometimes used to soothe inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, and are a popular ingredient in facial masks.

Should I ditch a low-fat diet? Are \u201cfat-free\u201d foods healthy? Will eating fat make me get fat? Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet? Are all kinds of fat equally healthy? How can I cut back on trans fat? Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy? Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods? Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat? What\u2019s better than a low-fat diet? Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats? How can I convince my family to eat healthy fats? 1.Should I ditch a low-fat diet? Walter Willett: If you\u2019ve been able to keep your weight, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose under good control while eating a low-fat diet, this type of diet may be working for you. But for many people, low-fat diets don\u2019t work. In fact, dozens of studies have found that low-fat diets are no better for health than moderate-or high-fat diets\u2014and for many people, they may be worse. Low-fat diets are usually high in carbohydrates, often from rapidly-digested foods such as white flour, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks. Eating lots of these \u201cfast carbs\u201d can cause quick, sharp spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, and over time can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. High-carbohydrate, low-fat diets also have a negative effect on the fats and cholesterol in our blood: They raise \u201cbad\u201d blood fats (triglycerides) and they lower the \u201cgood\u201d blood cholesterol (HDL), both of which can increase the risk of heart disease. These diets also tend to increase blood pressure. For many people, low-fat diets are not satisfying. People finish a meal and within a few hours, they are hungry again, seeking more low-fat fixes for their hunger. This vicious cycle leads to weight gain and, in turn, to the conditions associated with excess weight (such as blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes). 2. Are \u201cfat free\u201d foods healthy? Amy Myrdal Miller: Some foods in their natural state contain little or no fat\u2014for example, most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dried beans. And of course these are healthy choices. But processed foods billed as \u201clow fat\u201d and \u201cfat free\u201d are often higher in salt, sugar, or starch than their full-fat counterparts, to make up for the flavor and texture that\u2019s lost when food manufacturers slash fat. So they are not necessarily \u201chealthy\u201d choices. For example, low-fat and non-fat salad dressings are nearly always higher in sugar and salt. 3. Will eating fat make me get fat? Willett: No, it\u2019s a myth that eating specifically high-fat foods makes you fat. Eating or drinking more calories than you need from any source, whether it\u2019s fat, carbohydrate, protein, or alcohol can lead to weight gain. Over the past 30 years in the U.S., the percentage of calories from fat has actually gone down, but obesity rates have skyrocketed. Sugary soft drinks don\u2019t contain any fat\u2014yet the billions of gallons of sugary beverages that Americans drink each year have been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. 4. Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet? Willett: It\u2019s possible to lose weight on any diet. But carefully-conducted clinical trials find that following a low-fat diet doesn\u2019t make it any easier to lose weight or keep it off. In fact, study volunteers who follow moderate- or high-fat diets lose just as much weight, and in some studies a bit more, as those who follow low-fat diets. Calories are what count for weight loss, so it\u2019s important to find a lower-calorie eating plan that you can follow\u2014and a lower-calorie plan that\u2019s good for lifelong health. Low-fat diets raise triglycerides and lower good cholesterol, so for many folks, they\u2019re simply not the best choice for health. For some people, high intake of carbohydrates, particularly if they come from refined rather than whole grains, can make weight control more difficult. 5. Are all kinds of fat equally healthy? Willett: Some types of fats are healthier than others. Unsaturated fat is the healthiest type of fat. Plant oils, such as olive, canola, corn, peanut and other nut oils; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pistachios; avocados; and fish, especially oily fish such as salmon and canned tuna, are excellent sources of unsaturated fat. Eating unsaturated fat in place of refined grains and sugar can improve blood cholesterol profiles and lower triglycerides, and in turn, lower the risk of heart disease. It is essential to include a special kind of unsaturated fat, called omega-3 fats, in the diet; good sources include fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and canola oil. Keep in mind that omega-3 fats from marine sources, such as fish and shellfish, have much more powerful health benefits than omega-3 fats from plant sources, like walnuts and flax seeds. But omega-3 fats from plant sources still are a good choice, especially for people who don\u2019t eat fish. Saturated fat is less healthy, since it raises \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol in the blood. We can\u2019t completely eliminate saturated fat from our diets, though, because foods that are rich in healthy fats also contain a little bit of saturated fat. The best strategy is to limit foods that are very high in saturated fat, such as butter, cheese, and red meat, and replace them with foods that are high in healthy fats, such as plant oils, nuts, and fish. An alternative approach is to just use a very small amount of full-fat cheese, butter, cream, or red meat in dishes that emphasize plant foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Whatever you do, don\u2019t replace foods that are high in saturated fat with \u201cfast carbs\u201d\u2014foods like white bread, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks\u2014since eating too many of these fast carbs is just as bad for your heart as eating too much saturated fat. Trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil (oil that has been chemically processed to make it more shelf-stable) is especially bad for health. Eating just a small amount of trans fat on a regular basis raises the risk of heart disease. So it\u2019s best to avoid trans fat altogether. Most of the trans fat in people\u2019s diets comes from commercially prepared baked goods, margarines, snack foods, and processed foods. Many food makers are cutting trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthier fats. Still, you\u2019ll need to scan Nutrition Facts labels to make sure that the food you eat is free of trans fats. Keep in mind that most foods contain a mix of fats. The key to a healthy diet is to choose foods that are higher in unsaturated fat than saturated fat\u2014and that do not contain any trans fat. When you cut foods like red meat and butter out of your diet, replace them with healthy plant oils, nuts, fish, vegetables, or whole grains\u2014don\u2019t replace them with white bread, white rice, potatoes, or other refined carbohydrates. 6. How can I cut back on trans fats? Willett: Many food manufacturers are already removing trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthy fats. Similarly, many restaurants are removing trans fat from their menu items, so this is a big help. But you still need to pay attention to nutrition labels, to make sure that the food you buy does not contain any trans fats. Labeling laws allow food makers to say that a product has \u201c0 grams trans fat\u201d even if it contains up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving from partially hydrogenated oils. This may not sound like a lot of trans fat. But if you eat several servings a day of these foods, your trans fat intake can really add up. So to make sure that a food you are buying is truly trans fat free, check the Nutrition Facts Panel to make sure it has 0 grams of trans fat\u2014and check the ingredients list to make sure it does not contain any partially hydrogenated oil. 7. Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy? Willett: Coconut oil and palm oil are higher in saturated fat than other plant oils. They are less harmful than partially hydrogenated oil, which is high in trans fats. But they are less beneficial for the heart than plant oils that are rich in unsaturated fats \u2014 olive, canola, sunflower, and other oils. Coconut oil increases good cholesterol, which may make it a good choice when cooking a dish that needs a little hard fat. Read more about coconut oil and health. 8. Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods? Willett: It\u2019s okay to eat fried foods, as long they are prepared with frying oil that doesn\u2019t have any trans fats. It\u2019s also important to look at the types of foods being fried. In America, we eat lots of fried potatoes, which contain rapidly-digested starch, and it\u2019s good to find an alternative. Fried foods are high in calories, and it is important to think about calories, because most of us need to keep our calories in check to avoid gaining weight. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut out fried foods\u2014just choose smaller portions. Myrdal Miller: Sweet potatoes are a great alternative for frying. Or you could just try making a smaller portion of fried potatoes, or pairing fried potatoes with other vegetables. If you\u2019re in a restaurant and watching your calories, try sharing a fried dish with a friend. Or you could try ordering a half-sized portion of fried food along with a small salad. 9. Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat? Willett: No. When you cook or read nutrition labels, don\u2019t fixate on fat percentages. As long as you use healthy fats, and your keep your portion sizes modest, it doesn\u2019t matter if your dish or meal has 30 percent, 40 percent, or more of its calories from fat. The same is true for your overall diet: Don\u2019t worry about the percentage of calories from fat. Focus on choosing foods with healthy fats. 10. What\u2019s better than a low-fat diet? Willett: Try following a healthy fat, healthy carb diet, using two nutrition tools from Harvard School of Public Health as your guide: The Healthy Eating Plate and the Healthy Eating Pyramid. The Healthy Eating Plate offers a simple blueprint for a healthy meal: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits, save a quarter of the plate for whole grains, and the rest for a healthy source of protein; the glass bottle to the left of the plate is your reminder to use healthy plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery shopping list: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and plant oils are in the base, and healthy proteins\u2014nuts, beans, fish, and chicken\u2014are in the next tier, meaning that these foods should make it into your grocery cart every week. Refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks, as well as red meat and butter, are in the \u201cuse-sparingly\u201d tip\u2014so skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. You can download copies of the Healthy Eating Plate and Healthy Eating Pyramid from The Nutrition Source website. 11. Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats? Myrdal Miller: Here\u2019s a few ideas for how to use healthy fats in your kitchen: Cook with healthy oils. Olive, canola, soy, peanut, sunflower, corn, and other oils from plants are the best choices, since they are high in healthy unsaturated fat. If you have a dish that requires the flavor of butter, use a very small amount of butter mixed with a neutral-flavored oil, such as canola oil. And keep in mind that it\u2019s okay to cook with extra-virgin olive oil. The healthy fats in extra-virgin olive oil are stable at temperatures used in home cooking, with the exception of deep-fat frying or stir frying. Then we\u2019d advise using an oil that\u2019s more stable, like peanut oil. Bake with healthy oils. You can replace the butter in many baked goods with vegetable oils. Just cut back on the amount of oi by 25 percent; butter contains some water, so that\u2019s why you can use less oil. Pastry chefs at The Culinary Institute of America have done experiments making pound cake with canola oil instead of butter, and consumers prefer the taste and texture of the pound cake made with canola oil! Check out The Great Muffin Makeover for five new muffin recipes that use healthy oils and whole grains. Serve healthy fats at the table. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil or nut oils on vegetables, instead of butter. Use peanut butter, trans fat-free margarine, or refrigerated extra virgin olive oil as a spread for whole grain toast, instead of spreading on cream cheese. With Mexican cuisine, serve guacamole as a topping instead of sour cream. Pare calories by pairing healthy fats with low-calorie foods. Use oils and nuts to add flavor to lower-calorie, high-fiber foods, such as vegetables, beans, and whole grains. That way, it will be easier for you to stay within your daily calorie budget. Cut \u201cfast carbs\u201d and replace them with \u201cslow carbs\u201d and healthy fats. \u201cSlow carbs\u201d include beans, non-starchy vegetables, and minimally-processed whole grains, such as whole wheat berries, barley, quinoa, or brown rice. There are many delicious ways to switch from fast carbs to slow carbs. For example, instead of making white pasta or potatoes as a side dish, try making smaller portions of whole grain pasta, quinoa, or dried beans, and prepare them with flavorful plant oils, nuts, and seeds. Try this recipe for whole wheat penne with pistachio pesto, or a quick hummus with pureed chickpeas and sesame paste (tahini). Instead of serving potato chips with soup or a sandwich, how about serving a side salad or crunchy raw vegetables with an olive oil-based dressing, like this oregano garlic vinaigrette? Use full-fat cheese in small amounts. Low-fat cheeses are not really that much lower in saturated fat than their full-fat counterparts\u2014and they are often higher in sodium. A healthier strategy is to just use a small amount of full-fat, full flavored cheese in a dish. And if you choose aged cheeses, you can use even less cheese\u2014thanks to the aging process the fermentation products intensify, so a little offers lots of flavor. If you\u2019re serving chicken, there\u2019s no need to strip the skin. Chicken skin has had a bad rap for being high in fat. But most of the fat in chicken skin is healthy, unsaturated fat\u2014and cooking with the skin keeps the chicken flavorful and moist, so you don\u2019t need to add as much salt or use a breaded coating. Trade fish, nuts or tofu for beef and pork. At your next cookout, try serving salmon or turkey burgers instead of hamburger, shrimp kabobs instead of steak tips, tuna steak instead of rib eye. Be sure to brush fish and shellfish with a healthy vegetable oil to keep them from getting too dry. Instead of using pork for protein in your stir fry, try peanuts and tofu, like in this recipe for spicy lemongrass tofu. 12. How can I convince my family to eat healthy fats? Recipes for Health: Nut-Based Sauces Try these Mediterranean-inspired sauce recipes with vegetables, chicken, or fish: Spanish Romesco Sauce (Red Pepper and Almond Sauce) Turkish Muhammara (Red Pepper and Walnut Sauce) Greek Skordalia (Almond, Bread and Garlic Sauce) Turkish Tarator (Walnut and Garlic Sauce) Italian Pesto alla Trapanese (Almond, Parsley, Basil, and Tomato Sauce) Myrdal Miller: Introduce your family to the range of healthy foods and flavors from around the world that rely on healthy fat to deliver their great flavor. Think about the nut-based sauces of the Mediterranean that make other healthful foods, such as vegetables and fish, more appealing and flavorful. Share this article with your family members, so that they understand that the type of fat matters more than the amount of fat, and that low-fat cooking isn\u2019t necessarily better for health. Tell them that you will cook with healthy fats, such as olive and canola oil, and you will serve foods that naturally contain healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and fish. Promise to limit foods that are high in saturated fat\u2014butter, cheese, red meat. And tell them that you\u2019ll scan nutrition labels so that you can avoid foods with partially hydrogenated oil and keep your pantry and table trans-fat free.

The formula is simple: fill half your plate (or lunch box) with colorful fruits or vegetables (aim for two to three different types), one-quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with healthy proteins. Healthy fats and a small amount of dairy (if desired) round out a tasty meal that will fuel an active, healthy lifestyle. When packing your child\u2019s lunches, let the Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate guide and inspire you: -Remember two points\u2014choices and presentation -Save time with meal prep -Build super snacks to fill the gaps between meals -Send a refillable water bottle Choices Choose any 1 fresh fruit. For example: grapes, apple slices or rings, any melon chunks (cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon), any berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), or banana slices. Choose any 2 vegetables. For example: carrot coins or sticks, cucumber, broccoli, bell pepper strips, asparagus spears, summer squash ribbons, or grape tomatoes. Choose any 1 healthy protein. For example: Beans, edamame, nuts, seeds, peanut butter, hummus, veggie burger, roasted turkey or chicken slices, or a hardboiled egg. Choose any 1 whole grain. For example: whole grain pasta, bread, and crackers, brown rice, quinoa, steel-cut oats, and other minimally-processed whole grains. Incorporating dairy (if desired). For example: unflavored milk, plain Greek yogurt, small amounts of cheese like cottage cheese, and string cheese. For dairy-free options, try soy milk and soy yogurt, which contain similar amounts of calcium, protein, and vitamin D as dairy milk. Presentation Kabobs: Cut fruits, vegetables, and proteins into cubes or small balls and insert onto a skewer with rounded or blunt edges. Bento boxes: Lunchboxes that contain several small divided containers are great for portion control, keeping foods separate (if kids prefer foods not touching), and encouraging a variety of foods. Themes: Mexican = beans and brown rice, whole grain tortilla chips, homemade guacamole or salsa made with diced tomatoes, avocado, and cilantro. Chinese = chicken strips and broccoli florets served with brown rice and low-sodium soy dipping sauce. Pizza = whole grain pita or crackers, grape tomatoes, and bell peppers, mozzarella string cheese, chicken slices. Green = edamame, cucumber coins, butter lettuce rolled in a spinach wrap spread with mashed ripe avocado. Sprinkle sunflower seeds or nuts for extra crunch and nutrients. Eat a Rainbow = red grape tomatoes, orange hummus, yellow cheese, green cucumbers and bell peppers, blueberries, purple grapes. Shapes: Cut sandwiches into triangles or smaller squares, or use cookie cutters. Mini cookie cutters can transform apples, watermelon, or cantaloupe into juicy heart or star shapes. A vegetable peeler makes elegant ribbons of any firm long vegetable. Carefully use a knife to cut sticks of carrot or bell pepper. Save Time with Meal Prep Amidst hectic weekday schedules, meal prep is a great tool to help keep us on a healthy eating track. Although any type of meal prep requires planning, there is no one correct method. Below are just a few ideas relevant to kid\u2019s lunches, but you can learn more about using this helpful strategy for other meals, too! Choose a day that you are less busy to wash and chop fruits and vegetables, and prepare batches of healthy proteins like chicken, eggs, and beans. If you don\u2019t have time for this, don\u2019t feel guilty about purchasing pre-chopped and washed produce, pre-cooked chicken, or canned beans in the supermarket (but be on the lookout for added sodium in prepared foods, and rinse and drain canned beans). Have kids participate in food prep! Younger children can help to wash fruits and vegetables. Older children can learn how to use a knife on softer foods. Have children pack their lunch boxes the night before. Display choices of protein, vegetable, fruit, etc. and let them create their own meals based on the Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate. For younger children, include finger foods that do not need utensils. Search \u201ckids lunch ideas\u201d online for endless inspiration on how to fill your child\u2019s lunch box with healthy food. If you\u2019re not packing lunch, food provided by the school is also a great option, as a result of stronger standards. For more information on school meals and snacks, see Why school meals matter. Super Snacks Snacks are meant to fill the gap between meals, not become a whole meal in itself. Keep snacks small. An easy rule of thumb for a satisfying snack is to pair a protein-rich food with a carb-rich food. Including a healthy fat will quiet hunger pangs even more. Depending on the child\u2019s age and activity level, they may need one or two snacks a day. Examples: \u00bc cup nuts, 1 cup shredded mini whole wheat squares (with no added sugar) Apple slices, \u00bd cup chickpeas roasted in olive oil and spices [get the recipe] \u00bc cup sunflower seeds or nuts, \u00bc cup dried apricots, cherries, or raisins (with no added sugar) String cheese, 1 cup of grapes \u00bd cup blueberries or strawberries, 5 ounces of plain Greek yogurt Peanut, almond, or sunflower seed butter spread on a small 100% whole-wheat pita Carrot sticks or sliced veggies, hummus For more tasty snack and meal recipes, visit the Food, Fun & Family Recipe Packet created by the Harvard Prevention Research Center on Nutrition and Physical Activity. Go for Water Don\u2019t forget to pack a water bottle for refilling throughout the school day. Water is not only the best choice, but a necessary one. It restores fluids lost through everyday tasks of breathing, sweating, and even digesting meals. It keeps the body\u2019s temperature normal on hot days and carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells. It is also free of calories, sugar, and caffeine, and other additives found in sugary drinks. Beyond plain water, flavored and unsweetened seltzer or fruit-infused waters are also great healthy beverage choices. Fluid needs vary based on a child\u2019s age, size, gender, and activity level. The National Academy of Sciences recommends a range of seven to 14 cups of water per day, with the lower end for toddlers and the higher end for teenage boys. Part of this amount can come from water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. Only when your child participates in vigorous sports lasting long periods of time (over one hour) should sports drinks be considered to supplement water. In this case you may consider making your own sports drink by mixing one quart (32 ounces) of water, 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of salt, and two ounces of 100% orange juice or plain coconut water. Sugary drinks are a major contributor to the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. In 2016 the American Heart Association recommended that children and teens consume less than 25 grams, or six teaspoons of added sugar per day, and sugary drinks should be limited to no more than eight ounces per week. Healthy Kids and Healthy Families When creating healthy and balanced meals for kids, don\u2019t forget to do the same for the rest of the family. With a primary focus on diet quality, The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate reflects the same important messages as the Healthy Eating Plate. Download both and post them on the refrigerator for a daily reminder to make the best eating choices!

You must weigh the risks and benefits. \u2013Introduction \u2013What\u2019s Moderate Alcohol Intake? What\u2019s a Drink? \u2013The Downside of Alcohol \u2013Possible Health Benefits of Alcohol \u2013Genes Play a Role \u2013Shifting Benefits and Risks \u2013The Bottom Line: Balancing Risks and Benefits Introduction Throughout the 10,000 or so years that humans have been drinking fermented beverages, they\u2019ve also been arguing about their merits and demerits. The debate still simmers today, with a lively back-and-forth over whether alcohol is good for you or bad for you. It\u2019s safe to say that alcohol is both a tonic and a poison. The difference lies mostly in the dose. Moderate drinking seems to be good for the heart and circulatory system, and probably protects against type 2 diabetes and gallstones. Heavy drinking is a major cause of preventable death in most countries. In the U.S., alcohol is implicated in about half of fatal traffic accidents. [1] Heavy drinking can damage the liver and heart, harm an unborn child, increase the chances of developing breast and some other cancers, contribute to depression and violence, and interfere with relationships. Alcohol\u2019s two-faced nature shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. The active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, a simple molecule called ethanol, affects the body in many different ways. It directly influences the stomach, brain, heart, gallbladder, and liver. It affects levels of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and insulin in the blood, as well as inflammation and coagulation. It also alters mood, concentration, and coordination. What\u2019s Moderate Alcohol Intake? What\u2019s a Drink? Loose use of the terms \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201ca drink\u201d has fueled some of the ongoing debate about alcohol\u2019s impact on health. In some studies, the term \u201cmoderate drinking\u201d refers to less than 1 drink per day, while in others it means 3-4 drinks per day. Exactly what constitutes \u201ca drink\u201d is also fairly fluid. In fact, even among alcohol researchers, there\u2019s no universally accepted standard drink definition. [2] In the U.S., 1 drink is usually considered to be 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1\u00bd ounces of spirits (hard liquor such as gin or whiskey). [3] Each delivers about 12 to 14 grams of alcohol on average, but there is a wider range now that microbrews and wine are being produced with higher alcohol content. Is Red Wine Better? Some experts have suggested that red wine makes the difference, but other research suggests that beverage choice appears to have little effect on cardiovascular benefit. LEARN MORE ABOUT WHETHER THE TYPE OF ALCOHOL CONSUMED HAS ANY EFFECT ON HEALTH. The definition of moderate drinking is something of a balancing act. Moderate drinking sits at the point at which the health benefits of alcohol clearly outweigh the risks. The latest consensus places this point at no more than 1-2 drinks a day for men, and no more than 1 drink a day for women. This is the definition used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, [3] and is widely used in the United States. The Dark Side of Alcohol Not everyone who likes to drink alcohol stops at just one. While many people drink in moderation, some don\u2019t. Heavy drinking can take a toll on the body. It can cause inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis) and lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), a potentially fatal disease. It can increase blood pressure and damage heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). Heavy alcohol use has also been linked with several cancers: The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research indicate that there is convincing evidence linking alcohol to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast, liver, colon, and rectum. [4] The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that both the ethanol in alcohol and acetaldehyde, a chemical formed from the breakdown of ethanol, are carcinogenic to humans in high amounts. [5] The risk is multiplied for drinkers who also smoke tobacco or have a poor diet. Problem drinking also touches drinkers\u2019 families, friends, and communities. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and others: In 2014, about 61 million Americans were classified as binge alcohol users (5 or more drinks on the same occasion at least once a month) and 16 million as heavy alcohol users (5 or more drinks on the same occasion on 5 or more days in one month). [6] Alcohol plays a role in one in three cases of violent crime. [7] In 2015, more than 10,000 people died in automobile accidents in which alcohol was involved. [8] Alcohol abuse costs about $249 billion a year. [9] Even moderate drinking carries some risks. Alcohol can disrupt sleep and one\u2019s better judgment. Alcohol interacts in potentially dangerous ways with a variety of medications, including acetaminophen, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, painkillers, and sedatives. It is also addictive, especially for people with a family history of alcoholism. Alcohol Increases Risk of Developing Breast Cancer There is convincing evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer, and the more alcohol consumed, the greater the risk. [10-14] A large prospective study following 88,084 women and 47,881 men for 30 years found that even 1 drink a day increased the risk of alcohol-related cancers (colorectum, female breast, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, liver, esophagus) in women, but mainly breast cancer, among both smokers and nonsmokers. 1 to 2 drinks a day in men who did not smoke was not associated with an increased risk of alcohol-related cancers. [15] In a combined analysis of six large prospective studies involving more than 320,000 women, researchers found that having 2-5 drinks a day compared with no drinks increased the chances of developing breast cancer as high as 41%. It did not matter whether the form of alcohol was wine, beer, or hard liquor. [10] This doesn\u2019t mean that 40% or so of women who have 2-5 drinks a day will get breast cancer. Instead, it is the difference between about 13 of every 100 women developing breast cancer during their lifetime\u2014the current average risk in the U.S.\u2014and 17 to 18 of every 100 women developing the disease. This modest increase would translate to significantly more women with breast cancer each year. A lack of folate in the diet or folic acid, its supplement form, further increases the risk of breast cancer in women. [14] Folate is needed to produce new cells and to prevent changes in DNA. Folate deficiency, as can occur with heavy alcohol use, can cause changes in genes that may lead to cancer. Alcohol also increases estrogen levels, which fuel the growth of certain breast cancer cells. An adequate intake of folate, at least 400 micrograms a day, when taking at least 1 drink of alcohol daily appears to lessen this increased risk. [16, 17] Researchers found a strong association among three factors\u2014genetics, folate intake, and alcohol\u2014in a cohort from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II of 2866 young women with an average age of 36 who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Those with a family history of breast cancer who drank 10 grams or more of alcoholic beverages daily (equivalent to 1 or more drinks) and ate less than 400 micrograms of folate daily almost doubled their risk (1.8 times) of developing the cancer. Women who drank this amount of alcohol but did not have a family history of breast cancer and ate at least 400 micrograms of folate daily did not have an increased breast cancer risk. [14] Folate and Alcohol Alcohol and Weight Gain One serving of alcohol on average contains 100-150 calories, so even a moderate amount of 3 drinks a day can contribute 300+ calories. Mixed drinks that add juice, tonic, or syrups will further drive up calories, increasing the risk of weight gain over time. However, a prospective study following almost 15,000 men at four-year periods found only an increased risk of minor weight gain with higher intakes of alcohol. [19] Compared to those who did not change their alcohol intake, those who increased their intake by 2 or more drinks a day gained a little more than a half-pound. It was noted that calorie intake (not from alcohol) tended to increase along with alcohol intake. Possible Health Benefits of Alcohol What are some of the possible health benefits associated with moderate alcohol consumption? Cardiovascular Disease More than 100 prospective studies show an inverse association between light to moderate drinking and risk of heart attack, ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, peripheral vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, and death from all cardiovascular causes. [20] The effect is fairly consistent, corresponding to a 25-40% reduction in risk. However, increasing alcohol intake to more than 4 drinks a day can increase the risk of hypertension, abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, heart attack, and death. [5, 21-23] Alcohol and Heart Disease: Prospective Studies The connection between moderate drinking and lower risk of cardiovascular disease has been observed in men and women. It applies to people who do not have heart disease, and also to those at high risk for having a heart attack or stroke or dying of cardiovascular disease, including those with type 2 diabetes, [32, 33] high blood pressure, [34, 35] and existing cardiovascular disease. [34, 35] The benefits also extend to older individuals. [36] The idea that moderate drinking protects against cardiovascular disease makes sense biologically and scientifically. Moderate amounts of alcohol raise levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol), [37] and higher HDL levels are associated with greater protection against heart disease. Moderate alcohol consumption has also been linked with beneficial changes ranging from better sensitivity to insulin to improvements in factors that influence blood clotting, such as tissue type plasminogen activator, fibrinogen, clotting factor VII, and von Willebrand factor. [37] Such changes would tend to prevent the formation of small blood clots that can block arteries in the heart, neck, and brain, the ultimate cause of many heart attacks and the most common kind of stroke. Drinking Patterns Matter What you drink (beer or wine) doesn\u2019t seem to be nearly as important as how you drink. Having 7 drinks on a Saturday night and then not drinking the rest of the week isn\u2019t at all the equivalent of having 1 drink a day. The weekly total may be the same, but the health implications aren\u2019t. Among participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, consumption of alcohol on at least three or four days a week was inversely associated with the risk for myocardial infarction. The amount consumed, under 10 grams a day or more than 30 grams, didn\u2019t seem to matter as much as the regularity of consumption. [25] A similar pattern was seen in Danish men. [38] A review of alcohol consumption in women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II found that smaller amounts of alcohol (about 1 drink per day) spread out over four or more days per week had the lowest death rates from any cause, compared with women who drank the same amount of alcohol but in one or two days. [39] The most definitive way to investigate the effect of alcohol on cardiovascular disease would be with a large trial in which some volunteers were randomly assigned to have 1 or more alcoholic drinks a day and others had drinks that looked, tasted, and smelled like alcohol but were actually alcohol free. Many of these trials have been conducted for weeks, and in a few cases months and even up to 2 years, to look at changes in the blood, but a long-term trial to test experimentally the effects of alcohol on cardiovascular disease has not been done. A recent successful effort in the U.S. to launch an international study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Although the proposal was peer-reviewed and initial participants had been randomized to drink in moderation or to abstain, post hoc the NIH decided to stop the trial due to internal policy concerns. Unfortunately, a future long trial of alcohol and clinical outcomes may never be attempted again, but nevertheless, the connection between moderate drinking and cardiovascular disease almost certainly represents a cause-and-effect relationship based on all of the available evidence to date. Beyond the Heart The benefits of moderate drinking aren\u2019t limited to the heart. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and other studies, gallstones [40, 41] and type 2 diabetes [32, 42, 43] were less likely to occur in moderate drinkers than in non-drinkers. The emphasis here, as elsewhere, is on moderate drinking. In a meta-analysis of 15 original prospective cohort studies that followed 369,862 participants for an average of 12 years, a 30% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes was found with moderate drinking (0.5-4 drinks a day), but no protective effect was found in those drinking either less or more than that amount. [32] The social and psychological benefits of alcohol can\u2019t be ignored. A drink before a meal can improve digestion or offer a soothing respite at the end of a stressful day; the occasional drink with friends can be a social tonic. These physical and social effects may also contribute to health and well-being. Genes Play a Role Twin, family, and adoption studies have firmly established that genetics plays an important role in determining an individual\u2019s preferences for alcohol and his or her likelihood for developing alcoholism. Alcoholism doesn\u2019t follow the simple rules of inheritance set out by Gregor Mendel. Instead, it is influenced by several genes that interact with each other and with environmental factors. [1] There is also some evidence that genes influence how alcohol affects the cardiovascular system. An enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase helps metabolize alcohol. One variant of this enzyme, called alcohol dehydrogenase type 1C (ADH1C), comes in two \u201cflavors.\u201d One quickly breaks down alcohol, the other does it more slowly. Moderate drinkers who have two copies of the gene for the slow-acting enzyme are at much lower risk for cardiovascular disease than moderate drinkers who have two genes for the fast-acting enzyme. [44] Those with one gene for the slow-acting enzyme and one for the faster enzyme fall in between. It\u2019s possible that the fast-acting enzyme breaks down alcohol before it can have a beneficial effect on HDL and clotting factors. Interestingly, these differences in the ADH1C gene do not influence the risk of heart disease among people who don\u2019t drink alcohol. This adds strong indirect evidence that alcohol itself reduces heart disease risk. Shifting Benefits and Risks The benefits and risks of moderate drinking change over a lifetime. In general, risks exceed benefits until middle age, when cardiovascular disease begins to account for an increasingly large share of the burden of disease and death. For a pregnant woman and her unborn child, a recovering alcoholic, a person with liver disease, and people taking one or more medications that interact with alcohol, moderate drinking offers little benefit and substantial risks. For a 30-year-old man, the increased risk of alcohol-related accidents outweighs the possible heart-related benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. For a 60-year-old man, a drink a day may offer protection against heart disease that is likely to outweigh potential harm (assuming he isn\u2019t prone to alcoholism). For a 60-year-old woman, the benefit/risk calculations are trickier. Ten times more women die each year from heart disease (460,000) than from breast cancer (41,000). However, studies show that women are far more afraid of developing breast cancer than heart disease, something that must be factored into the equation. The Bottom Line: Balancing Risks and Benefits Given the complexity of alcohol\u2019s effects on the body and the complexity of the people who drink it, blanket recommendations about alcohol are out of the question. Because each of us has unique personal and family histories, alcohol offers each person a different spectrum of benefits and risks. Whether or not to drink alcohol, especially for \u201cmedicinal purposes,\u201d requires careful balancing of these benefits and risks. Your healthcare provider should be able to help you do this. Your overall health and risks for alcohol-associated conditions should factor into the equation. If you are thin, physically active, don\u2019t smoke, eat a healthy diet, and have no family history of heart disease, drinking alcohol won\u2019t add much to decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease. If you don\u2019t drink, there\u2019s no need to start. You can get similar benefits with exercise (beginning to exercise if you don\u2019t already or boosting the intensity and duration of your activity) or healthier eating. If you are a man with no history of alcoholism who is at moderate to high risk for heart disease, a daily alcoholic drink could reduce that risk. Moderate drinking might be especially beneficial if you have low HDL that just won\u2019t budge upward with diet and exercise. If you are a woman with no history of alcoholism who is at moderate to high risk for heart disease, the possible benefits of a daily drink must be balanced against the small increase in risk of breast cancer. If you already drink alcohol or plan to begin, keep it moderate\u2014no more than 2 drinks a day for men or 1 drink a day for women. And make sure you get adequate amounts of folate, at least 400 micrograms a day. Related What about news headlines saying no amount of alcohol is safe?

Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, points consumers to the healthiest choices in the major food groups. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) MyPlate, though it has been revised to reflect some key findings, still doesn\u2019t offer the most complete picture when it comes to basic nutrition advice. The Healthy Eating Plate is based exclusively on the best available science and was not subjected to political or commercial pressures from food industry lobbyists. Here\u2019s a table showing how the Healthy Eating Plate compares to the USDA\u2019s MyPlate, section by section. Whole Grains Grains The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to choose whole grains and limit refined grains, since whole grains are much better for health. In the body, refined grains like white bread and white rice act just like sugar. Over time, eating too much of these refined-grain foods can make it harder to control weight and can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Read more about the health benefits of whole grains. Although initially MyPlate did not tell consumers that whole grains are better for health, it has since been revised to suggest that consumers make at least half of their grains whole grains \u2013 an important update! Healthy Protein Protein The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to choose fish, poultry, beans or nuts, protein sources that contain other healthful nutrients. It encourages them to limit red meat and avoid processed meat, since eating even small quantities of these foods on a regular basis raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and weight gain. Read more about the benefits of choosing healthy protein. MyPlate\u2019s protein section could be filled by a variety of sources, including a hamburger or hot dog. Though the plate has been revised to suggest that adult consumers eat at least 8 ounces of cooked seafood per week, it still offers no indication that red and processed meat are especially harmful to health. Vegetables Vegetables The Healthy Eating Plate encourages an abundant variety of vegetables, since Americans are particularly deficient in their vegetable consumption\u2014except for potatoes and French fries. Potatoes are chock full of rapidly digested starch, and they have the same effect on blood sugar as refined grains and sweets, so limited consumption is recommended. Read more about the benefits of vegetables. MyPlate does not distinguish between potatoes and other vegetables. Fruits Fruits The Healthy Eating Plate recommends eating a colorful variety of fruits. Read more about the benefits of fruits. MyPlate also recommends eating fruits. Healthy Oils (Not included in MyPlate) The Healthy Eating Plate depicts a bottle of healthy oil, and it encourages consumers to use olive, canola, and other plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table. These healthy fats reduce harmful cholesterol and are good for the heart, and Americans don\u2019t consume enough of them each day. It also recommends limiting butter and avoiding trans fat. Read more about the benefits of healthy fats and oils. MyPlate is silent on fat, which could steer consumers toward the type of low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet that makes it harder to control weight and worsens blood cholesterol profiles. Water Dairy The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to drink water, since it\u2019s naturally calorie free, or to try coffee and tea (with little or no sugar), which are also great calorie-free alternatives. It advises consumers to avoid sugary drinks, since these are major contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. It recommends limiting milk and dairy to one to two servings per day, since high intakes are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and possibly ovarian cancer; it recommends limiting juice, even 100% fruit juice, to just a small glass a day, because juice contains as much sugar and as many calories as sugary soda. Read more about water and other healthy drinks, and learn about calcium, milk and health. MyPlate recommends dairy at every meal, even though there is little if any evidence that high dairy intakes protect against osteoporosis, and there is considerable evidence that too-high intakes can be harmful. As for sugary drinks, MyPlate says 100% fruit juice counts as part of the Fruit Group. Stay Active (Not included in MyPlate) The figure scampering across the bottom of the Healthy Eating Plate\u2019s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Read more about the benefits of staying active. There is no activity message on MyPlate.

In fact, the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate (as well as the Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate) complement each other. Consumers can think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as a grocery list: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy oils, and healthy proteins like nuts, beans, fish, and chicken should make it into the shopping cart every week, along with a little yogurt or other dairy foods if desired. The Healthy Eating Pyramid also addresses other aspects of a healthy lifestyle\u2014exercise, weight control, vitamin D, and multivitamin supplements, and moderation in alcohol for people who drink\u2014so it\u2019s a useful tool for health professionals and health educators. The Healthy Eating Plate and the companion Healthy Eating Pyramid summarize the best dietary information available today. They aren\u2019t set in stone, though, because nutrition researchers will undoubtedly turn up new information in the years ahead. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate will change to reflect important new evidence.

[1] However, potatoes don\u2019t count as a vegetable on Harvard\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate because they are high in the type of carbohydrate that the body digests rapidly, causing blood sugar and insulin to surge and then dip (in scientific terms, they have a high glycemic load). For example, a cup of potatoes has a similar effect on blood sugar as a can of cola or a handful of jelly beans. [2, 3] The roller-coaster-like effect of a high dietary glycemic load can result in people feeling hungry again soon after eating, which may then lead to overeating. [4*] Over the long term, diets high in potatoes and similarly rapidly-digested, high carbohydrate foods can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. [5-9] Potatoes seem to be a particular culprit for weight gain and diabetes: A 2011 study by Mozaffarian et al. that tracked the diet and lifestyle habits of 120,000 men and women for up to 20 years looked at how small food-choice changes contributed to weight gain over time. People who increased their consumption of French fries and baked or mashed potatoes gained more weight over time\u2014an extra 3.4 and 1.3 pounds every four years, respectively. [7] People who decreased their intake of these foods gained less weight, as did people who increased their intake of other vegetables. A similar long-term study found that high potato and French fry intakes were linked to a greater risk of diabetes in women, and that replacing potatoes with whole grains could lower diabetes risk. [9] Potatoes do contain important nutrients\u2014vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin B6, to name a few. But the potato is not the only source of these nutrients, nor is it the best: Broccoli, for example, has nearly nine times as much vitamin C as a potato. White beans have about double the potassium. What to eat instead of potatoes? Whole grains are an excellent choice, especially minimally processed grains such as brown rice and quinoa. Beans can also stand in as a \u201cstarchy\u201d side dish; they are high in fiber and protein, and cause less of a spike in blood sugar than processed grains. If you\u2019re looking for that mashed-potato texture, try this recipe that uses cauliflower instead. If you want to swap sweet potatoes for white potatoes, you\u2019ll still need to go easy on the portions: Though sweet potatoes are a rich source of beta carotene, they have a high glycemic index and glycemic load\u2014almost as high as that of a white potato. Most people don\u2019t eat sweet potatoes in the same over-sized quantities as they do white potatoes, which is perhaps why research studies haven\u2019t found sweet potatoes to be a major culprit for obesity and diabetes.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that \u201cinflammation\u201d is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by our immune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides. Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body\u2019s immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn\u2019s disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and certain cancers (e.g., breast, colon). Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. The Mediterranean diet and DASH diet are popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods. An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts of red meat, refined sugary foods and beverages, and excess alcohol. How It Works An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically to boost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthy gut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation. Examples of anti-inflammatory foods: Fruits Vegetables High-fiber whole grains Legumes Monounsaturated fats (avocados, olive oil, nuts, nut butters, seeds) Polyunsaturated omega-3 fats (walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and aquatic foods including salmon, herring, sardines, mackerel) Tea Coffee Dark chocolate with at least 70% or higher cocoa solids Herbs, spices (turmeric, ginger) Moderate amounts of alcohol (wine, beer) Examples of inflammatory foods to limit: Sweetened beverages like soda, juice drinks, iced tea An excess of refined carbohydrate foods like white bread, pasta, rice Fried foods Processed high-fat meats like bacon, sausage, hot dogs Saturated fats like full-fat dairy from cream and butter, partially hydrogenated oils, fatty cuts of meat and poultry Excess alcohol Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such as exercising regularly, controlling stress, and getting enough sleep. The Research So Far Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading to blood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemic heart disease (a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat and cholesterol may raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state. A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity. An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity of beneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [6,7] A randomized trial of participants at risk for cardiovascular disease found that a Mediterranean diet with an emphasis on fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seafood, and olive oil significantly decreased several markers of inflammation compared with a low-fat diet. [8,9] There are currently no standardized dietary guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of joints and breakdown of bone and cartilage. A vegan diet, Mediterranean diet, and elimination diet (avoiding certain food allergens) have been shown in some studies to suppress pro-inflammatory cells and improve symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. [10] Patients tend to report worse symptoms when eating certain foods like red meat, alcohol, and soda, whereas fish and berries are reported to improve symptoms. [11] The Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid Arthritis randomized controlled crossover trial examined patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were assigned to either a diet with anti-inflammatory foods or a control diet for 10 weeks. [11] After a 4-month washout period, the participants switched diets. The study found that the disease activity score significantly decreased during the anti-inflammatory diet intervention period. Vegetarian diets are based on large amounts of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. A meta-analysis of 17 observational cross-sectional studies found that following a vegetarian diet (including vegan diets with no animal foods and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets with eggs and dairy) for at least 2 years was associated with lower C-reactive protein levels, a pro-inflammatory marker, than in omnivores who had no dietary restrictions. [12] The MIND diet, a hybrid of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, is an anti-inflammatory eating plan that includes whole grains, vegetables especially green leafy types, berries, olive oil, beans, nuts, fish and poultry, and limits fried/fast food, butter, cheese, sweets, and red meat. The MIND diet was found to significantly reduce the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a chronic pro-inflammatory condition, in a cohort of 923 older adults. Those who followed the diet the most closely showed a 53% reduced rate of the disease, but even those who followed the diet moderately had a 35% reduced rate. [13] Two different studies following three large cohorts (Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) rated the participants\u2019 diets using a dietary inflammatory pattern score. [14,15] These scores were defined based on levels of several inflammatory markers in the body including C-reactive protein. Inflammatory foods included red, processed, and organ meats; refined carbohydrates; and sweetened beverages. Anti-inflammatory foods included green leafy and dark yellow vegetables, whole grains, fruit, tea, and coffee. The studies found that when comparing participants with the highest to lowest inflammatory diet scores, the highest scores were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and twice the risk of type 2 diabetes. Large cohort studies following men and women in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses Health Studies found an increased risk of Crohn\u2019s disease and colorectal cancer in persons who ate diets highest in inflammatory foods. [16,17] A validated score called the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) was created that measured markers of inflammation in the blood such as C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor in relation to eating certain foods. [18] A high EDIP score indicated a proinflammatory diet, which was associated with higher intakes of total calories, red meat, refined grains, and soda. Lower scores indicated an anti-inflammatory diet, which was associated with intakes of leafy green vegetables, dark yellow vegetables, coffee, and tea. Inflammation and the leaky gut The research is still young, but rapidly growing evidence suggests a connection between our microbiome and various diseases and disorders. Abnormal levels of bacteria found in areas of the body where they should not be, termed dysbiosis, and increased intestinal permeability (sometimes referred to as \u201cleaky gut\u201d) that allows bacteria to travel or \u201cleak\u201d from the gut into the bloodstream have been observed in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, [19] Hashimoto thyroiditis, [20] celiac disease, [21,22] Crohn\u2019s disease, [22] multiple sclerosis, [23] obesity, [24,25] and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, [26] as well as major depression. [27] The small and large intestines of the digestive tract are lined with a layer of epithelial cells that create a barrier of tight junctions, which prevents bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation occurs when not only bacteria but viruses, toxins, and allergens in the gut escape into the bloodstream and the rest of the body. [22] If translocation occurs, inflammation or disease may develop. This intestinal barrier also regulates various immune functions by sending signals to immune cells. Beneficial bacteria naturally live in the gut, and any abnormal changes in the amount or type of these microbes (for example due to chronic stress or the use of medications like antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can change the intestinal barrier, lowering its immune defense system and increasing the risk of disease. However, it is not yet clear of the initial trigger for dysbiosis: leaky gut causing the disease/inflammation, or vice versa. The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28] Fiber in the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich in prebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments. Potential Pitfalls The anti-inflammatory diet is flexible in that it does not include rigid meal plans. However, this requires people to plan their own meals and find recipes incorporating foods on the plan. People who are not used to meal planning or cooking may need more specific guidance. Calorie levels and portion sizes are not highlighted on this plan, so it is possible to gain weight if excessive portions are consumed. Bottom Line An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body\u2019s immune response, such as practicing stress reduction, exercising regularly, and getting adequate sleep.

What it means will depend on who you ask. The terms clean eating and clean diets are not federally regulated in the U.S., so interpretation by consumers and the marketing of \u201cclean\u201d products by the food industry can vary widely. Generally, clean eating is assumed to refer to foods that are as close to their natural state as possible, maybe organic, and most likely with minimal use of any chemical additives and preservatives. A clean diet may include whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting highly processed snacks and other packaged foods with added sugar and salt. It may also be associated with terms like plant-based, grass-fed, sugar-free, or gluten-free. In summary, clean eating seemingly promotes health and wellness. The concept is popular among younger consumers active with social media, which is the prime platform for celebrities, bloggers, and other high-profile personalities who chronicle their clean eating meals and recipes. A survey of more than 1,200 participants ages 14-24 years found that 55% were familiar with the term clean eating from social media, other online sources, or their peers. [1] A survey by the International Food Information Council (IFIC) helps to further define consumer beliefs about clean eating. It found that \u201cclean eaters\u201d eat foods that are not highly processed, such as fresh or organic fruits and vegetables, and food products with a short, simple ingredients list. [2] Additional findings: Almost half of those surveyed considered themselves to be clean eaters, with \u201ceating foods that aren\u2019t highly processed,\u201d \u201ceating fresh produce,\u201d \u201ceating organic foods,\u201d and \u201ceating foods with a simple ingredients list\u201d as the most cited definitions. 64% surveyed said they try to choose foods made with clean ingredients, defined as \u201cnot artificial or synthetic,\u201d \u201corganic,\u201d \u201cfresh,\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d A Darker Side to Clean Eating Clean eating can take on a different meaning when it introduces unrealistic expectations. In a survey of teenagers and young adults, though 71% defined clean eating as a healthy positive approach, a small percentage felt it was unhealthy due to its restrictive nature. [1] Because of its strong association with health, clean eating was viewed favorably according to another survey of college students even though it produced emotional distress (experiencing negative emotions if not able to follow the diet) and functional impairment (having a rigid eating schedule, ignoring natural hunger cues to eat more or less than is scheduled, interference with school work). [3] Some clean diets advise eliminating groups of foods like dairy, wheat, or refined sugars. The term \u201cclean\u201d also suggests that not following this pattern is \u201cdirty,\u201d which encourages food restrictions and a preoccupation with healthy eating. [1] Although clean eating is not always focused on weight loss, it can mask symptoms of an eating disorder. When food restrictions are taken to an extreme to be \u201chealthy,\u201d clean eating can have negative health consequences that mirror those of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, such as osteoporosis, amenorrhea, difficulty concentrating, and depression. [3] Orthorexia or Just Trying to Be Healthy? Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is a term coined in 1997 by physician Steven Bratman, though it is not yet a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Currently there is no universally shared definition of ON and the diagnostic criteria is debatable. It is a condition that exhibits extreme preoccupation with healthy eating, with a goal of trying to achieve dietary \u201cpurity\u201d but which leads to distress, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsiveness. Whereas a condition like anorexia nervosa is centered on weight loss, ON is centered on a healthy diet. Some researchers believe that ON is an extreme variant of clean eating. It is the pursuit of control with clean eating and restraint from eating (whether it be amounts or certain types of foods) that can crossover from healthy eating behaviors into ON. Suggested criteria in defining ON include: [4] Obsessional or pathological preoccupation with healthy nutrition Emotional consequences (e.g., distress, anxiety) of non-adherence to self-imposed nutritional rules Psychosocial impairments in relevant areas of life as well as malnutrition and weight loss The most common warning signs of ON include experiencing anxiety around food, and impaired functioning that disrupts daily life. This may mean avoiding social events involving food because one cannot eat what is offered. ON often restricts certain foods and nutrients, which may lead to an imbalanced diet. Because it wears a mask of health and wellness, it is not easily recognized as problematic and does not carry the stigma of other eating disorders like bulimia or anorexia nervosa. It is important to emphasize that it is not harmful to enjoy and seek out healthful foods and recipes. Our society praises and promotes healthy behaviors because of high rates of obesity and other chronic diseases. Changing dietary habits to reduce the risk of these diseases can feel empowering, because other factors like family history and genetic predisposition cannot be changed. A healthy lifestyle can protect from developing chronic conditions that might otherwise mean hospital visits and bills, which causes anxiety and stress. Therefore, it may be difficult to distinguish ON from normal health-promoting behaviors. People at higher risk for ON tend to have a history of an eating disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, have perfectionistic tendencies, or are working in a health/wellness-related field. The following are examples of statements that may help differentiate healthy eating from ON. Healthy Eating Orthorexia Nervosa* I plan out meals once a week so I can create a food shopping list and do meal prep for the upcoming week to save time later. I spend more than 3 hours a day thinking about what I will eat and planning meals. I am learning what foods are beneficial to my health and adding them to my diet, but I don\u2019t follow special rules and allow \u201cjunk\u201d foods occasionally because I enjoy them. I find that in order to eat healthfully, I am eliminating more foods and creating more food rules. I value nutrition but if the food does not taste good, I likely will not eat it, as I know there are many different delicious, healthful foods from which to choose. The nutritional value of my food is more important to me than how good it tastes. Eating healthful foods often makes me feel better with greater energy and better digestion. I feel better about myself and have more self-confidence when I eat very healthy foods. I know that restaurant meals can be indulgent, but I order what I enjoy and eat it mindfully. I have a hard time eating out because I often can\u2019t find anything on the menu that fits my diet. I understand that I cannot always follow my usual healthy meal plan (such as when traveling with limited food choices), but I do the best I can to nourish myself with what is available. I feel guilty, unclean, or anxious when I cannot follow my healthy meal plan. I feel good about eating healthfully but it is not my main source of peace. I feel at peace with myself and in total control when I eat healthfully. The quality of my diet has improved, and it has enhanced my relationships, work, and school, as I have more energy and focus to work and am happier around my family and friends. The quality of my diet has improved, but it has interfered with other areas of my life, such as my relationships, work, and school as it consumes much of my time and focus and I am spending less time with family and friends. *Adapted from a self-test for ON created by Steven Bratman [5] The Instagram effect There are more than 1 billion users globally on the social media platform Instagram, which was introduced in 2010. Each Instagram post is an image, photo, or short video, offering a quick easy way to share a user\u2019s ideas, inspiration, and creativity. People ages 18-34 years represent the largest age group using Instagram. Research has shown potential negative effects of frequent users of this platform, including anxiety, depression, and negative body image due to social comparison when viewing the often picture-perfect images. One study surveyed a group of young men and women with a mean age of 25 years, using a validated questionnaire to screen for orthorexia nervosa. The results showed that the higher the use of Instagram reported, the greater the tendency toward orthorexia nervosa, with a prevalence of 49%. [6] No other social media platform (Twitter, Facebook) showed this effect. This may be because Instagram is the channel of choice for the healthy eating community, where users post photos and videos about their meals, recipes for various diets, and exercise workouts. The authors observed a potential risk from the Instagram feature in which users select accounts they wish to follow; if they choose mostly health and food-related accounts, they are constantly exposed to these ideas, potentially leading to the belief that extremes of healthy behaviors are normal and feeling increased pressure to emulate them. Sometimes celebrities and other \u201cinfluencers\u201d are perceived as authorities on health due to their physical appearance, which typically conforms with dominant societal beauty ideals, further encouraging users to follow their lead in health behaviors. Studies have shown that popular social media influencers such as these have a strong impact on their followers\u2019 decisions and increasingly change their behaviors related to food choices and diet. [7] Future Directions There are proposals for the Food and Drug Administration to provide clear industry guidance and enforce labeling laws to police deceptive \u201cclean\u201d labeling claims on food products. [8] This may in turn help to reduce the use of unsupported health claims and protect vulnerable individuals such as those with disordered eating patterns. Bottom Line Clean eating can be a concept that promotes health and wellness by encouraging the selection of minimally processed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy proteins, and healthy fats. However, it is an unregulated term, so the interpretation of what defines clean eating can vary widely, both among individuals and within the food industry that markets \u201cclean\u201d food products. Clean eating taken to an extreme has been associated with an increased risk of disordered eating patterns, such as orthorexia nervosa. If you feel increased anxiety around food and eating, avoid situations involving food, or have a preoccupation with food that interferes with daily activities, seek help from your doctor, a counselor, or a registered dietitian.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? A gluten-free diet is not new. It is the sole treatment for 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, a serious condition where the body attacks a protein called gluten, naturally found in many whole grains, causing a spectrum of symptoms that range from bloating to intestinal damage. Up to 6% of people have a related stomach-upsetting but less threatening condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity. With such a small number truly needing this diet, why have sales of gluten-free products topped $12 billion according to market research? What is new\u2014and driving these sales upward\u2014is the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss, partly fueled by celebrity endorsements and personal testimonies of not only pounds quickly shed, but increased energy, improved digestion, and even clearer skin. Consumer surveys reveal that people perceive gluten-free products to be healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts, and almost a third of Americans are now avoiding or reducing their intake of gluten. [1] How It Works A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. Gluten is largely ubiquitous in foods, found as a main ingredient (in wheat, rye, barley, triticale, cross-contaminated oats), in sauces (soy sauce, malt vinegar, flour), and as additives or fillers (maltodextrin, wheat starch). See What Is a Gluten-Free Diet? When first going gluten-free, perhaps the most noticeable change is having to relinquish favorite staples of bread, pasta, cereals, and processed snack foods. Because some of these products, which are typically highly processed, may be low in nutrients and high in calories, one may feel better and even lose some weight soon after removing them from the diet. Although there are now plenty of gluten-free counterparts to take their place, a gluten-free diet usually causes one to revisit naturally gluten-free whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains like brown rice, quinoa, and millet. Including these minimally processed, high-fiber foods may also help to promote weight loss and a feeling of well-being. The Research So Far Though research has explored the effects of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal disorders, autism, and fibromyalgia, there is none that examines the diet\u2019s effects on weight loss alone or for general health benefits. Because of the lack of experimental studies on weight loss, some researchers have instead examined the long-term effects of people with celiac disease on gluten-free diets, or who are generally healthy and consume a diet low in wheat and other gluten-containing grains. They have found that gluten-free diets: 1) may promote certain nutrient deficiencies, 2) may increase the risk of some chronic diseases, and 3) may actually cause weight gain. Intakes of people with celiac disease on a strict gluten-free diet were found to have inadequate intakes of fiber, iron, and calcium. [2] Other research has found gluten-free cereal products to be low not only in those nutrients but also B vitamins including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate. A study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease found that those who restricted gluten intake were likely to limit their intake of whole grains and experienced an increased risk of heart disease compared with those who had higher gluten intake. [3] Many studies have found that people with higher intakes of whole grains including whole wheat (2-3 servings daily) compared with groups eating low amounts (less than 2 servings daily) had significantly lower risk of heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and deaths from all causes. [4-7] Gluten may act as a prebiotic, feeding the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in our bodies. [8-10] It contains a prebiotic carbohydrate called arabinoxylan oligosaccharide that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon, bacteria normally found in a healthy human gut. A change in the amount or activity of these bacteria has been associated with gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. Research is conflicting, but some studies have shown weight gain or increased BMI in people with celiac disease after starting a gluten-free diet. [10-13] This may be partly due to improved absorption of nutrients, a reduction in stomach discomfort, and increased appetite after starting the diet. However, another suspected reason is an increased intake of gluten-free processed food options containing high amounts of calories, fat and sugar. Potential Pitfalls Gluten-free foods wear a health halo, a belief that a food product is healthful even when it may not offer special health benefits for most people. Research has shown that if one aspect of a food is advertised as healthy or people believe it to be healthy (in this case, the term \u201cgluten-free\u201d), there is a tendency to eat more of it. [14] This may promote weight gain. Also, an overreliance on processed gluten-free products may lead to a decreased intake of certain nutrients like fiber and B vitamins that are protective against chronic diseases. Bottom Line Although a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease and may help to alleviate symptoms in various conditions related to gluten sensitivity, there is currently no evidence showing that a gluten-free diet is effective for weight loss or for general health benefits. For individuals who don\u2019t have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no need to restrict gluten consumption. A healthy dietary pattern typically includes higher amounts of whole grains and lower amounts of refined grains and added sugar. Related Gluten: A Benefit of Harm to the Body?

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure. Blood pressure is the amount of pressure that blood places against the walls of arteries. It will normally vary throughout the day but if it remains too high, this is called high blood pressure or hypertension. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. [1] DASH was first introduced at a meeting of the American Heart Association in 1996 and later published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997. [2] The DASH trial randomly assigned 456 people to different diets to test the effects of dietary patterns on lowering blood pressure. The authors surmised that eating a diet with many different foods with blood pressure-lowering nutrients would show a greater effect on blood pressure than eating single nutrients, such as found in supplements or in a limited diet. Three diets were tested: 1) a control diet, or a standard American diet, 2) a fruits and vegetables diet, similar to the control diet but providing more fruits and vegetables and less snacks and sweets, and 3) a combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and low-fat dairy foods with reduced amounts of saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. The last two diets were richer in nutrients associated with lower blood pressure, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and protein. All three diets provided about 3000 mg sodium, which is more than the recommended amount from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans but less than the average sodium intake for Americans. [3] Despite no weight changes, the combination diet reduced blood pressure more than the other two diets. Those with hypertension showed greater decreases in blood pressure than those without hypertension. The reduction of blood pressure in the DASH combination diet was comparable to that of people on medication for stage 1 hypertension. The results of this landmark study contributed much of the scientific basis for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 and later editions. Podcast: Reduce Blood Pressure with the DASH Diet Hear from Drs. Frank Sacks and Larry Appel about the origins of the DASH Diet in this True Health Initiative Podcast. How It Works DASH is based on the following foods: fruits, vegetables, low fat milk, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, and nuts. It recommends reducing sodium, foods and beverages with added sugars, and red meat. The diet is heart-friendly as it limits saturated and trans fat, while increasing the intake of potassium, magnesium, calcium, protein, and fiber, nutrients believed to help control blood pressure. [1] The diet suggests a specific number of servings of the recommended foods listed above. The sample plans provided by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) are based on 1600, 2000, or 2600 calories daily. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to about 6-8 servings of grains or grain products (whole grains recommended), 4-5 servings vegetables, 4-5 fruits, 2-3 low fat dairy foods, 2 or fewer 3-ounce servings of meat, poultry, or fish, 2-3 servings of fats and oils, and 4-5 servings of nuts, seeds, or dry beans per week. It advises limiting sweets and added sugars to 5 servings or less per week. The plan defines the serving sizes of each these food groups. Eating less carbohydrate but more protein or unsaturated fats may also benefit the heart. The OmniHeart (Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease) clinical trial found that swapping out about 10% of calories from carbohydrates with protein (especially plant proteins like legumes, nuts, seeds) or monounsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, nuts, seeds) lowered blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides among adults with early or stage 1 hypertension. [4] Swapping carbohydrates specifically with unsaturated fats also helped to increase \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol. The benefit did not come from simply eating more fats and protein, but swapping an equal amount of calories so that the total calorie level stayed about the same. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to eating daily about 4-5 servings of whole grains, 5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 fruits, 2 low fat dairy foods, one 3-ounce serving of fish, poultry, or meat, and 2-3 servings of unsaturated fats, and eating weekly 7-8 servings of beans, nuts, or seeds. To follow the plan, one must decide their calorie level and then divide the suggested servings of each food group throughout the day. This requires meal planning ahead of time. The NHLBI guide provides many tips on how to incorporate DASH foods and to lower sodium intake; a one-day sample menu following a 2300 mg sodium restriction and a 1500 mg sodium restriction; and one week\u2019s worth of recipes. The NHLBI also publishes an online database of \u201cheart healthy\u201d recipes. Sample meal plan The Research So Far Numerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of the DASH diet. A consistent body of research has found that DASH lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure but also normal blood pressure even without lowering sodium intake. [5] It can produce greater reductions in blood pressure if sodium is restricted to less than 2300 mg a day, and even more so with a 1500 mg sodium restriction. [6, 7] When compared with a standard American diet (e.g., high intake of red and processed meats, beverages sweetened with sugar, sweets, refined grains) DASH has also been found to lower serum uric acid levels in people with hyperuricemia, which places them at risk for a painful inflammatory condition called gout. [8] Because people with gout often also have high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases, DASH is optimal in improving all of these conditions. The DASH diet was found to lower cardiovascular risk in a controlled 8-week trial looking at participants randomized to consume either a DASH diet (low in total/saturated fat with whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, fruits and vegetables), a fruit and vegetable-rich diet (more fruits/vegetables than control diet but same amount of fat), or control diet (standard American diet high in fat and cholesterol). [9] The researchers estimated a 10-year reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease based on the participants\u2019 blood pressure and cholesterol levels before and after the diet intervention. Participants who ate the DASH or fruit/vegetable diets showed a 10% reduced risk compared with those eating the control diet, but women and Black adults showed the greatest benefits with a 13% and 14% risk reduction, respectively. Adherence to the DASH-style pattern may also help prevent the development of diabetes, as analyzed in a recent meta-analysis, and kidney disease as found in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort that followed more than 3700 people who developed kidney disease. [10, 11] Dietary components of DASH that were protective in the ARIC cohort included a high intake of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. A high intake of red meat and processed meats increased kidney disease risk. Potential Pitfalls DASH requires each person to plan their own daily menus based on the allowed servings. People who are not used to meal planning or cooking may need more specific guidance. The types of foods listed are not comprehensive. For example, avocados are not included so it is not clear if they would be categorized as a fruit or a fat serving. Certain foods are placed into questionable categories: pretzels are placed in the grain group even though they have fairly low nutrient content and no fiber; frozen yogurt is placed in the dairy group even though most brands contain little calcium and vitamin D and are high in added sugar. The general term \u201ccereals\u201d are placed in the grain group but different types of cereals can be highly variable in nutrient and sugar content. Those with lactose intolerance or food allergies (e.g., nuts) may need to modify the diet to include lactose-free alternatives to dairy and seeds instead of nuts. Some people may experience gas and bloating when starting the diet due to the high fiber content of plant foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This can be minimized by adding one or two new high fiber foods a week instead of all at once. Bottom Line Research supports the use of the DASH diet as a healthy eating pattern that may help to lower blood pressure, and prevent or reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, and gout.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? Intermittent fasting is a diet regimen that cycles between brief periods of fasting, with either no food or significant calorie reduction, and periods of unrestricted eating. It is promoted to change body composition through loss of fat mass and weight, and to improve markers of health that are associated with disease such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Its roots derive from traditional fasting, a universal ritual used for health or spiritual benefit as described in early texts by Socrates, Plato, and religious groups. [1] Fasting typically entails a steady abstinence of food and beverages, ranging from 12 hours to one month. It may require complete abstinence, or allow a reduced amount of food and beverages. Prolonged very low calorie diets can cause physiological changes that may cause the body to adapt to the calorie restriction and therefore prevent further weight loss. [2] Intermittent fasting attempts to address this problem by cycling between a low calorie level for a brief time followed by normal eating, which may prevent these adaptations. However, research does not consistently show that intermittent fasting is superior to continuous low calorie diets for weight loss efficiency. How It Works The most common methods are fasting on alternate days, for whole days with a specific frequency per week, or during a set time frame. [3] Alternate-day fasting\u2014Alternating between days of no food restriction with days that consist of one meal that provides about 25% of daily calorie needs. Example: Mon-Wed-Fri consists of fasting, while alternate days have no food restrictions. Whole-day fasting\u20141-2 days per week of complete fasting or up to 25% of daily calorie needs, with no food restriction on the other days. Example: The 5:2 diet approach advocates no food restriction five days of the week, cycled with a 400-500 calorie diet the other two days of the week. Time-restricted feeding\u2014Following a meal plan each day with a designated time frame for fasting. Example: Meals are eaten from 8am-3pm, with fasting during the remaining hours of the day. The Research So Far Physiologically, calorie restriction has been shown in animals to increase lifespan and improve tolerance to various metabolic stresses in the body. [4] Although the evidence for caloric restriction in animal studies is strong, there is less convincing evidence in human studies. Proponents of the diet believe that the stress of intermittent fasting causes an immune response that repairs cells and produces positive metabolic changes (reduction in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, fat mass, blood glucose). [3,5] An understandable concern of this diet is that followers will overeat on non-fasting days to compensate for calories lost during fasting. However, studies have not shown this to be true when compared with other weight loss methods. [5] A systematic review of 40 studies found that intermittent fasting was effective for weight loss, with a typical loss of 7-11 pounds over 10 weeks. [2] There was much variability in the studies, ranging in size from 4 to 334 subjects, and followed from 2 to 104 weeks. It is important to note that different study designs and methods of intermittent fasting were used, and participant characteristics differed (lean vs. obese). Half of the studies were controlled trials comparing the fasting group to a comparison group and/or a control group (either continuous calorie restriction or usual lifestyle), with the other half examining an intermittent fasting group alone. A brief summary of their findings: Dropout rates ranged from 0-65%. When comparing dropout rates between the fasting groups and continuous calorie restriction groups, no significant differences were found. Overall, the review did not find that intermittent fasting had a low dropout rate, and therefore was not necessarily easier to follow than other weight loss approaches. When examining the 12 clinical trials that compared the fasting group with the continuous calorie restriction group, there was no significant difference in weight loss amounts or body composition changes. Ten trials that investigated changes in appetite did not show an overall increase in appetite in the intermittent fasting groups despite significant weight loss and decreases in leptin hormone levels (a hormone that suppresses appetite). A randomized controlled trial that followed 100 obese individuals for one year did not find intermittent fasting to be more effective than daily calorie restriction. [6] For the 6-month weight loss phase, subjects were either placed on an alternating day fast (alternating days of one meal of 25% of baseline calories versus 125% of baseline calories divided over three meals) or daily calorie restriction (75% of baseline calories divided over three meals) following the American Heart Association guidelines. After 6 months, calorie levels were increased by 25% in both groups with a goal of weight maintenance. Participant characteristics of the groups were similar; mostly women and generally healthy. The trial examined weight changes, compliance rates, and cardiovascular risk factors. Their findings when comparing the two groups: No significant differences in weight loss, weight regain, or body composition (e.g., fat mass, lean mass). No significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. At 12 months, although there were no differences in total cholesterol and triglycerides, the alternate-day fasting group showed significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels. The authors did not comment on a possible cause. The dropout rate was higher in the alternate-day fasting group (38%) than in the daily calorie restriction group (29%). Interestingly, those in the fasting group actually ate less food than prescribed on non-fasting days though they ate more food than prescribed on fasting days. A one-year randomized trial also did not find intermittent fasting (16:8 method) more beneficial than calorie reduction without a restricted eating time. [7] Patients with obesity were placed on the same moderate calorie restriction but randomized to one of two groups: time-restricted eating (allowed to eat from 8am-4pm), or allowed to eat any time. Weight, waist circumference, body mass index, body fat, and blood work were measured. At one year, the time-restricted group lost an average of 18 pounds and the time-unrestricted group lost 14 pounds; blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels also decreased. However, the changes in weight and other parameters were not significantly different among the groups. Potential Pitfalls This type of dietary pattern would be difficult for someone who eats every few hours (e.g., snacks between meals, grazes). It would also not be appropriate for those with conditions that require food at regular intervals due to metabolic changes caused by their medications, such as with diabetes. Prolonged periods of food deprivation or semi-starvation places one at risk for overeating when food is reintroduced, and may foster unhealthy behaviors such as an increased fixation on food. [8,9] Individuals with the following conditions should abstain from intermittent fasting: Diabetes Eating disorders that involve unhealthy self-restriction (anorexia or bulimia nervosa) Use of medications that require food intake Active growth stage, such as in adolescents Pregnancy, breastfeeding Unanswered Questions How often and for how long should one fast to see a therapeutic benefit? Is this diet safe and beneficial for everyone (e.g., generally healthy population, higher risk individuals with chronic diseases, elderly)? What are the long-term effects of intermittent fasting? Is there a risk of negatively influencing the dietary behaviors of other family members, especially in children who see their parents abstaining from food and skipping meals? Bottom Line Although certain benefits of caloric restriction have been demonstrated in animal studies, similar benefits of intermittent fasting in humans have not been observed. It is unclear that intermittent fasting is superior to other weight loss methods in regards to amount of weight loss, biological changes, compliance rates, and decreased appetite. Certain people who typically eat one or two meals a day or do not eat for long stretches of time may show better compliance with this type of regimen. Additionally, people who tend to eat or snack excessively at night may benefit from a cut-off eating time, especially if the late eating leads to unpleasant side effects such as reflux or disrupted sleep. More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year are needed to show a direct effect and the possible benefits of intermittent fasting. Strong recommendations on intermittent fasting for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

Intuitive eating (IE) is not so much a diet plan as an approach to eating based on one\u2019s internal needs, whether physical, emotional, or other influencers. When these needs are recognized, they may determine one\u2019s food choices. Because the method is based on an individual\u2019s needs at one moment in time, it does not focus on specific foods, a calorie level to reach, or even eating at certain times. It has been used as an approach to lose weight as well as a treatment strategy for those with disordered eating patterns. The term \u201cintuitive eating\u201d was introduced in 1995 as the title of a book authored by registered dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch. However, the concept of eating from an emotional response was described by researchers prior to that date. [1] How It Works IE is the antithesis of restrained eating that demands rigid control. Many commercial diets follow a restrained eating model, with meal plans that include specific foods and/or measured portions. In contrast, IE focuses on body cues such as hunger and fullness, which may be physical hunger and fullness from an empty or filled stomach, or cues caused by emotional or external triggers. IE is flexible, with no restrictions on types of foods to eat, amounts, or specific mealtimes. IE is sometimes described as this basic concept: learning to eat when hungry and stopping when full. Yet, in our society physical hunger is not the only reason we eat. Our appetites and cravings are continuously stimulated by visual cues (cooking shows, food advertisements), emotional cues (feeling sad, lonely, stressed, bored), olfactory cues (smelling freshly baked bread), or social cues (Sunday family dinners, sharing a restaurant meal with friends). IE seeks to identify the specific cause of the \u201chunger,\u201d and to respond with awareness and intention. Eating in response to triggers other than from physiological cues may cause a feeling of lack of self-control, guilt, or self-condemnation. Practicing IE concepts may help to prevent these negative feelings. Intuitive eating encourages self-care and a positive body image. Weight loss is not a focus of IE. However, eating excess calories can occur from emotional cues, so if one learns to respond appropriately to emotional eating cues, weight loss may follow naturally. Signs of physical hunger: Fatigue, lightheadedness Irritability Headache Stomach is grumbling Hunger gradually intensifies No specific cravings; any type of food will satisfy Signs of emotional hunger: Stomach is quiet Desire for food occurs suddenly (e.g., because of an emotion such as anger or stress, or from external cues such as viewing a television commercial or other food advertising) Cravings are for a specific food or flavor, whether salty, sweet, crunchy, creamy, etc. Guilt is associated with eating Examples of intuitive eating strategies: Acknowledge hunger. Recognize physical hunger cues and respond to them. These cues will not always occur at consistent times, as true hunger can be influenced by changes in physical activity, lack of sleep, etc. Therefore, eating meals and snacks at the same time every day may not be appropriate according to IE principles, if you are not hungry. Recognize and respond to fullness. As you identify true hunger, you will also learn to identify a comfortable degree of fullness after eating, and respond by stopping eating. This may require periodic check-ins while eating, noting if you are enjoying the food and reaching a point of having enough. Don\u2019t fear negative feelings. Accept that negative emotions like stress, anger, and boredom will come and go. Learn to cope with these feelings without using food: talk to a friend, go for a walk, take a shower, pray, or meditate. Honor and respect your body regardless of size and ability. A negative self-image can lead to self-destructive behaviors, whereas nurturing a positive self-image may lead to healthful behaviors. How is intuitive eating different from mindful eating? Often used interchangeably, many intuitive eating and mindful eating concepts overlap but there are some key differences. Mindful eating stems from the broader practice of mindfulness, a centuries-old philosophy used in many religions. Mindful eating focuses on the present eating experience with heightened awareness beyond the self, and without judgment. [2] The following are some areas of focus: Considering the wider spectrum of the meal which informs what and how much one eats: where the food came from, what elements were needed from nature that enabled the food to grow and thrive, the individuals involved in getting the food from the farm to grocery stores or restaurants, how the food was prepared, who prepared it. Noticing how the food looks, tastes, smells, and feels in our bodies as we eat. How the body feels after eating the meal. Expressing gratitude for the meal before and/or after eating May use deep breathing or meditation before the meal to transition your busy mind to focus on the meal in front of you. How our food choices affect our local and global environment. Including these considerations when eating can help to increase appreciation, enjoyment, and understanding of the food. Intuitive eating often integrates concepts of mindful eating but also considers eating specifically in response to hunger and satiety cues, nurturing a positive body image, addressing non-physiological reasons for hunger, and physical activity. It usually does not involve meditation nor gratitude. LEARN MORE ABOUT MINDFUL EATING The Research So Far There is a growing body of research on IE. Small, short-term controlled trials or cross-sectional studies using IE concepts have consistently shown benefits for psychological wellbeing (e.g., reduced depression and anxiety; increased body satisfaction, self-acceptance, and quality of life). [3,4] IE interventions have also shown a decrease in certain behaviors such as binge eating and restrained eating/dieting. A limited number of studies have shown improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol. [5] Randomized trials show conflicting results of IE interventions and weight loss or decreased body mass index; some show no weight changes while others show modest weight reductions. Diet quality Body mass index Eating behaviors Potential Pitfalls May not cause weight loss. The IE model is not intended to cause weight loss, but to promote a positive self-image and healthy lifestyle changes. People who are seeking a plan that causes weight loss may not prefer this approach, because there are no specific amounts or types of foods recommended and body weight is not measured. However, a decrease in behaviors like restrained eating and emotional eating may naturally lead to weight loss for some. If a person has been advised to lose weight by their physician to improve medical conditions (e.g., prediabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver), an IE approach may be used in conjunction with a weight-reducing eating plan. Guidance on this type of plan from a registered dietitian or licensed health coach can help to encourage a healthy body image and realistic lifestyle goals. Fear of weight gain. A concern with individuals is letting go of diet rules and \u201cforbidden\u201d foods. They may fear a lack of control around these foods that are now permitted without restrictions. In certain cases, less boundaries may lead some people to overeat or choose low-nutrient-dense foods (e.g., processed high-sugar beverages or foods). Consulting with a registered dietitian who is experienced with IE concepts can help one to identify the body\u2019s signals on what and how much to eat, ideally choosing foods and amounts that support their wellbeing and health. May not improve health outcomes related to weight gain or chronic disease. IE concepts encourage self-care and a positive response to food, which may or may not cause a change towards healthful eating patterns (consuming more fruits and vegetables, less sweetened beverages and foods, less fried foods, not skipping meals, etc.). An individual has the freedom to choose fast food and soda if desired, so IE will not necessarily lead to a disease-preventive eating pattern or to a reversal of weight gain. Does not address the concept of food addiction from \u201chyper-palatable\u201d foods, which can lead to food cravings. Cravings for food may stem from a neurobiological source that is neither caused by physical or emotional hunger. The notion of a food addiction is controversial, but research shows that the brain can activate reward regions of the brain in response to flavors like fat, salt, and sugar when they are eaten in excess and on a regular basis. [10-14] Researchers have compared this effect to that of addictive drugs like cocaine and alcohol. These foods tend to be highly processed, calorie-dense, and low in nutrients. People may develop strong cravings for these foods because of the reward-related neural changes that occur after consumption (a calming or pleasurable feeling with the release of dopamine). In this case, relying on intuition about what to eat may backfire if one has developed an \u201caddiction\u201d to these types of foods. Unanswered Questions Can IE concepts prevent the onset or progression of chronic diseases including obesity by promoting healthier lifestyle behaviors? Are there certain types of people in which the IE approach would work best (e.g., chronic dieters, those experiencing disordered eating)? Bottom Line Intuitive eating is an alternative approach that was developed in response to the negative mental and physical health effects caused by traditional diets for weight loss, which involve the deliberate long-term restriction of food. IE allows internal cues to guide one\u2019s eating choices and patterns rather than a meal plan or designated rules. Research has shown that IE can lead to greater psychological wellbeing, increased pleasure when eating, and body satisfaction. However research also shows that permission to eat all foods with no \u201cfood rules\u201d can sometimes lead to unhealthful food choices with more high-calorie palatable foods. Therefore a certain level of restraint and nutrition knowledge may be beneficial when starting an IE plan (if the desired result is to improve overall health and wellness). Still, in the long run, continued dietary restraint increases the risk of ignoring natural physiological signals to eat. Therefore a combination of IE practices with basic nutrition knowledge may lead to more positive outcomes than either approach alone. It may also be beneficial to use IE strategies to heighten one\u2019s awareness of internal cues of not just feeling \u201cfull\u201d versus \u201chungry\u201d but to also note how the body feels after eating healthful foods of fruits and vegetables versus highly processed high-calorie snack foods, which may lead to eating patterns that promote wellbeing.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? The ketogenic or \u201cketo\u201d diet is a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich eating plan that has been used for centuries to treat specific medical conditions. In the 19th century, the ketogenic diet was commonly used to help control diabetes. In 1920 it was introduced as an effective treatment for epilepsy in children in whom medication was ineffective. The ketogenic diet has also been tested and used in closely monitored settings for cancer, diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, this diet is gaining considerable attention as a potential weight-loss strategy due to the low-carb diet craze, which started in the 1970s with the Atkins diet (a very low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, which was a commercial success and popularized low-carb diets to a new level). Today, other low-carb diets including the Paleo, South Beach, and Dukan diets are all high in protein but moderate in fat. In contrast, the ketogenic diet is distinctive for its exceptionally high-fat content, typically 70% to 80%, though with only a moderate intake of protein. How It Works The premise of the ketogenic diet for weight loss is that if you deprive the body of glucose\u2014the main source of energy for all cells in the body, which is obtained by eating carbohydrate foods\u2014an alternative fuel called ketones is produced from stored fat (thus, the term \u201cketo\u201d-genic). The brain demands the most glucose in a steady supply, about 120 grams daily, because it cannot store glucose. During fasting, or when very little carbohydrate is eaten, the body first pulls stored glucose from the liver and temporarily breaks down muscle to release glucose. If this continues for 3-4 days and stored glucose is fully depleted, blood levels of a hormone called insulin decrease, and the body begins to use fat as its primary fuel. The liver produces ketone bodies from fat, which can be used in the absence of glucose. [1] When ketone bodies accumulate in the blood, this is called ketosis. Healthy individuals naturally experience mild ketosis during periods of fasting (e.g., sleeping overnight) and very strenuous exercise. Proponents of the ketogenic diet state that if the diet is carefully followed, blood levels of ketones should not reach a harmful level (known as \u201cketoacidosis\u201d) as the brain will use ketones for fuel, and healthy individuals will typically produce enough insulin to prevent excessive ketones from forming. [2] How soon ketosis happens and the number of ketone bodies that accumulate in the blood is variable from person to person and depends on factors such as body fat percentage and resting metabolic rate. [3] What is ketoacidosis? Excessive ketone bodies can produce a dangerously toxic level of acid in the blood, called ketoacidosis. During ketoacidosis, the kidneys begin to excrete ketone bodies along with body water in the urine, causing some fluid-related weight loss. Ketoacidosis most often occurs in individuals with type 1 diabetes because they do not produce insulin, a hormone that prevents the overproduction of ketones. However in a few rare cases, ketoacidosis has been reported to occur in nondiabetic individuals following a prolonged very low carbohydrate diet. [4,5] The Diet There is not one \u201cstandard\u201d ketogenic diet with a specific ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat). The ketogenic diet typically reduces total carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day\u2014less than the amount found in a medium plain bagel\u2014and can be as low as 20 grams a day. Generally, popular ketogenic resources suggest an average of 70-80% fat from total daily calories, 5-10% carbohydrate, and 10-20% protein. For a 2000-calorie diet, this translates to about 165 grams fat, 40 grams carbohydrate, and 75 grams protein. The protein amount on the ketogenic diet is kept moderate in comparison with other low-carb high-protein diets, because eating too much protein can prevent ketosis. The amino acids in protein can be converted to glucose, so a ketogenic diet specifies enough protein to preserve lean body mass including muscle, but that will still cause ketosis. Many versions of ketogenic diets exist, but all ban carb-rich foods. Some of these foods may be obvious: starches from both refined and whole grains like breads, cereals, pasta, rice, and cookies; potatoes, corn, and other starchy vegetables; and fruit juices. Some that may not be so obvious are beans, legumes, and most fruits. Most ketogenic plans allow foods high in saturated fat, such as fatty cuts of meat, processed meats, lard, and butter, as well as sources of unsaturated fats, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, plant oils, and oily fish. Depending on your source of information, ketogenic food lists may vary and even conflict. The following is a summary of foods generally permitted on the diet: Programs suggest following a ketogenic diet until the desired amount of weight is lost. When this is achieved, to prevent weight regain one may follow the diet for a few days a week or a few weeks each month, interchanged with other days allowing a higher carbohydrate intake. The Research So Far The ketogenic diet has been shown to produce beneficial metabolic changes in the short-term. Along with weight loss, health parameters associated with carrying excess weight have improved, such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. [2,7] There is also growing interest in the use of low-carbohydrate diets, including the ketogenic diet, for type 2 diabetes. Several theories exist as to why the ketogenic diet promotes weight loss, though they have not been consistently shown in research: [2,8,9] A satiating effect with decreased food cravings due to the high-fat content of the diet. A decrease in appetite-stimulating hormones, such as insulin and ghrelin, when eating restricted amounts of carbohydrate. A direct hunger-reducing role of ketone bodies\u2014the body\u2019s main fuel source on the diet. Increased calorie expenditure due to the metabolic effects of converting fat and protein to glucose. Promotion of fat loss versus lean body mass, partly due to decreased insulin levels. The following is a summary of research findings: Potential Pitfalls Following a very high-fat diet may be challenging to maintain. Possible symptoms of extreme carbohydrate restriction that may last days to weeks include hunger, fatigue, low mood, irritability, constipation, headaches, and brain \u201cfog.\u201d Though these uncomfortable feelings may subside, staying satisfied with the limited variety of foods available and being restricted from otherwise enjoyable foods like a crunchy apple or creamy sweet potato may present new challenges. Some negative side effects of a long-term ketogenic diet have been suggested, including increased risk of kidney stones and osteoporosis, and increased blood levels of uric acid (a risk factor for gout). Possible nutrient deficiencies may arise if a variety of recommended foods on the ketogenic diet are not included. It is important to not solely focus on eating high-fat foods, but to include a daily variety of the allowed meats, fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds to ensure adequate intakes of fiber, B vitamins, and minerals (iron, magnesium, zinc)\u2014nutrients typically found in foods like whole grains that are restricted from the diet. Because whole food groups are excluded, assistance from a registered dietitian may be beneficial in creating a ketogenic diet that minimizes nutrient deficiencies. Unanswered Questions What are the long-term (one year or longer) effects of, and are there any safety issues related to, the ketogenic diet? Do the diet\u2019s health benefits extend to higher risk individuals with multiple health conditions and the elderly? For which disease conditions do the benefits of the diet outweigh the risks? As fat is the primary energy source, is there a long-term impact on health from consuming different types of fats (saturated vs. unsaturated) included in a ketogenic diet? Is the high fat, moderate protein intake on a ketogenic diet safe for disease conditions that interfere with normal protein and fat metabolism, such as kidney and liver diseases? Is a ketogenic diet too restrictive for periods of rapid growth or requiring increased nutrients, such as during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, or during childhood/adolescent years? Bottom Line Available research on the ketogenic diet for weight loss is still limited. Most of the studies so far have had a small number of participants, were short-term (12 weeks or less), and did not include control groups. A ketogenic diet has been shown to provide short-term benefits in some people including weight loss and improvements in total cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. However, these effects after one year when compared with the effects of conventional weight loss diets are not significantly different. [10] Eliminating several food groups and the potential for unpleasant symptoms may make compliance difficult. An emphasis on foods high in saturated fat also counters recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association and may have adverse effects on blood LDL cholesterol. However, it is possible to modify the diet to emphasize foods low in saturated fat such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish. A ketogenic diet may be an option for some people who have had difficulty losing weight with other methods. The exact ratio of fat, carbohydrate, and protein that is needed to achieve health benefits will vary among individuals due to their genetic makeup and body composition. Therefore, if one chooses to start a ketogenic diet, it is recommended to consult with one\u2019s physician and a dietitian to closely monitor any biochemical changes after starting the regimen, and to create a meal plan that is tailored to one\u2019s existing health conditions and to prevent nutritional deficiencies or other health complications. A dietitian may also provide guidance on reintroducing carbohydrates once weight loss is achieved. A modified carbohydrate diet following the Healthy Eating Plate model may produce adequate health benefits and weight reduction in the general population.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet, targets the health of the aging brain. Dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, driving many people to search for ways to prevent cognitive decline. In 2015, Dr. Martha Clare Morris and colleagues at Rush University Medical Center and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health published two papers introducing the MIND diet. [1,2] Both the Mediterranean and DASH diets had already been associated with preservation of cognitive function, presumably through their protective effects against cardiovascular disease, which in turn preserved brain health. The research team followed a group of older adults for up to 10 years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), a study of residents free of dementia at the time of enrollment. They were recruited from more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units in the Chicago area. More than 1,000 participants filled out annual dietary questionnaires for nine years and had two cognitive assessments. A MIND diet score was developed to identify foods and nutrients, along with daily serving sizes, related to protection against dementia and cognitive decline. The results of the study produced fifteen dietary components that were classified as either \u201cbrain healthy\u201d or as unhealthy. Participants with the highest MIND diet scores had a significantly slower rate of cognitive decline compared with those with the lowest scores. [1] The effects of the MIND diet on cognition showed greater effects than either the Mediterranean or the DASH diet alone. How It Works The purpose of the research was to see if the MIND diet, partially based on the Mediterranean and DASH diets, could directly prevent the onset or slow the progression of dementia. All three diets highlight plant-based foods and limit the intake of animal and high saturated fat foods. The MIND diet recommends specific \u201cbrain healthy\u201d foods to include, and five unhealthy food items to limit. [1] The healthy items the MIND diet guidelines* suggest include: 3+ servings a day of whole grains 1+ servings a day of vegetables (other than green leafy) 6+ servings a week of green leafy vegetables 5+ servings a week of nuts 4+ meals a week of beans 2+ servings a week of berries 2+ meals a week of poultry 1+ meals a week of fish Mainly olive oil if added fat is used The unhealthy items, which are higher in saturated and trans fat, include: Less than 5 servings a week of pastries and sweets Less than 4 servings a week of red meat (including beef, pork, lamb, and products made from these meats) Less than one serving a week of cheese and fried foods Less than 1 tablespoon a day of butter/stick margarine *Note: modest variations in amounts of these foods have been used in subsequent studies. [9,10] Sample meal plan Is alcohol part of the MIND diet? Wine was included as one of the 15 original dietary components in the MIND diet score, in which a moderate amount was found to be associated with cognitive health. [1] However, in subsequent MIND trials it was omitted for \u201csafety\u201d reasons. The effect of alcohol on an individual is complex, so that blanket recommendations about alcohol are not possible. Based on one\u2019s unique personal and family history, alcohol offers each person a different spectrum of benefits and risks. Whether or not to include alcohol is a personal decision that should be discussed with your healthcare provider. For more information, read Alcohol: Balancing Risks and Benefits. The Research So Far The MIND diet contains foods rich in certain vitamins, carotenoids, and flavonoids that are believed to protect the brain by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Although the aim of the MIND diet is on brain health, it may also benefit heart health, diabetes, and certain cancers because it includes components of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which have been shown to lower the risk of these diseases. Cohort studies Researchers found a 53% lower rate of Alzheimer\u2019s disease for those with the highest MIND diet scores (indicating a higher intake of foods on the MIND diet). Even those participants who had moderate MIND diet scores showed a 35% lower rate compared with those with the lowest MIND scores. [2] The results didn\u2019t change after adjusting for factors associated with dementia including healthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular-related conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes), depression, and obesity, supporting the conclusion that the MIND diet was associated with the preservation of cognitive function. Several other large cohort studies have shown that participants with higher MIND diet scores, compared with those with the lowest scores, had better cognitive functioning, larger total brain volume, higher memory scores, lower risk of dementia, and slower cognitive decline, even when including participants with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and history of stroke. [3-8] Clinical trials A 2023 randomized controlled trial followed 604 adults aged 65 and older who at baseline were overweight (BMI greater than 25), ate a suboptimal diet, and did not have cognitive impairment but had a first-degree relative with dementia. [9] The intervention group was taught to follow a MIND diet, and the control group continued to consume their usual diet. Both groups were guided throughout the study by registered dietitians to follow their assigned diet and reduce their intake by 250 calories a day. The authors found that participants in both the MIND and control groups showed improved cognitive performance. Both groups also lost about 11 pounds, but the MIND diet group showed greater improvements in diet quality score. The authors examined changes in the brain using magnetic resonance imaging, but findings did not differ between groups. [10] Nutrition experts commenting on this study noted that both groups lost a similar amount of weight, as intended, but the control group likely improved their diet quality as well (they had been coached to eat their usual foods but were taught goal setting, calorie tracking, and mindful eating techniques), which could have prevented significant changes from being seen between groups. Furthermore, the duration of the study\u20133 years\u2013may have been too short to show significant improvement in cognitive function. The results of this study showed that the MIND diet does not slow cognitive aging over a 3-year treatment period. Whether the MIND diet or other diets can slow cognitive aging over longer time periods remains a topic of intense interest. Other factors Research has found that greater poverty and less education are strongly associated with lower MIND diet scores and lower cognitive function. [11] Potential Pitfalls The MIND diet is flexible in that it does not include rigid meal plans. However, this also means that people will need to create their own meal plans and recipes based on the foods recommended on the MIND diet. This may be challenging for those who do not cook. Those who eat out frequently may need to spend time reviewing restaurant menus. Although the diet plan specifies daily and weekly amounts of foods to include and not include, it does not restrict the diet to eating only these foods. It also does not provide meal plans or emphasize portion sizes or exercise. Bottom Line The MIND diet can be a healthful eating plan that incorporates dietary patterns from the Mediterranean and DASH, both of which have suggested benefits in preventing and improving cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and supporting healthy aging. When used in conjunction with a balanced plate guide, the diet may also promote healthy weight loss if desired. Whether or not following the MIND diet can slow cognitive aging over longer time periods remains an area of interest, and more research needs to be done to extend the MIND studies in other populations.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? Chances are you have heard of the Mediterranean diet. If you have a chronic condition like heart disease or high blood pressure, your doctor may even have prescribed it to you. It is often promoted to decrease the risk of heart disease, depression, and dementia. The traditional diets of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea differ slightly so there are different versions of the Mediterranean diet. However, in 1993 the Harvard School of Public Health, Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, and the European Office of the World Health Organization introduced the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid as a guide to help familiarize people with the most common foods of the region. More of an eating pattern than a strictly regimented diet plan, the pyramid emphasized certain foods based on the dietary traditions of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy during the mid-20th century. [1,2] At that time, these countries displayed low rates of chronic disease and higher than average adult life expectancy despite having limited access to healthcare. It was believed that the diet\u2014mainly fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, whole grains, \ufb01sh, olive oil, small amounts of dairy, and red wine\u2014contributed to their health benefits. The pyramid also highlighted daily exercise and the beneficial social aspects of eating meals together. How It Works The Mediterranean diet is a primarily plant-based eating plan that includes daily intake of whole grains, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, nuts, herbs, and spices. Other foods like animal proteins are eaten in smaller quantities, with the preferred animal protein being fish and seafood. Although the pyramid shape suggests the proportion of foods to eat (e.g., eat more fruits and vegetables and less dairy foods), it does not specify portion sizes or specific amounts. It is up to the individual to decide exactly how much food to eat at each meal, as this will vary by physical activity and body size. There are additional points that make this eating plan unique: An emphasis on healthy fats. Olive oil is recommended as the primary added fat, replacing other oils and fats (butter, margarine). Other foods naturally containing healthful fats are highlighted, such as avocados, nuts, and oily fish like salmon and sardines; among these, walnuts and fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Choosing fish as the preferred animal protein at least twice weekly and other animal proteins of poultry, eggs, and dairy (cheese or yogurt) in smaller portions either daily or a few times a week. Red meat is limited to a few times per month. Choosing water as the main daily beverage, but allowing a moderate intake of wine with meals, about one to two glasses a day for men and one glass a day for women. Stressing daily physical activity through enjoyable activities. Sample meal plan The Research So Far Research has consistently shown that the Mediterranean diet is effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. [3, 4] A study of nearly 26,000 women found that those who followed this type of diet had 25% less risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the course of 12 years. [5] The study examined a range of underlying mechanisms that might account for this reduction, and found that changes in inflammation, blood sugar, and body mass index were the biggest drivers. Similar benefits were found in a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies following more than 22,000 women for a median of 12.5 years. [6] Those who had the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet showed a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and 23% lower risk of premature death compared with those who had the lowest adherence. One interesting finding of this eating plan is that it dispels the myth that people with or at risk for heart disease must eat a low fat diet. Although it does matter which types of fats are chosen, the percentage of calories from fat is less of an issue. The PREDIMED study, a primary prevention trial including thousands of people with diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease found that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts and without any fat and calorie restrictions reduced the rates of death from stroke by roughly 30%. [7] Most dietary fats were healthy fats, such as those from fatty fish, olive oil, and nuts, but total fat intake was generous at 39-42% of total daily calories, much higher than the 20-35% fat guideline as stated by the Institute of Medicine. [8] Risk of type 2 diabetes was also reduced in the PREDIMED trial. [9] There has also been increased interest in the diet\u2019s effects on aging and cognitive function. [10-12] Cell damage through stress and inflammation that can lead to age-related diseases has been linked to a specific part of DNA called telomeres. These structures naturally shorten with age, and their length size can predict life expectancy and the risk of developing age-related diseases. Telomeres with long lengths are considered protective against chronic diseases and earlier death, whereas short lengths increase risk. Antioxidants can help combat cell stress and preserve telomere length, such as by eating foods that contain antioxidants nutrients like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains. These foods are found in healthy eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet. [13] This was demonstrated in a large cohort of 4676 healthy middle-aged women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study where participants who more closely followed the Mediterranean diet were found to have longer telomere length. [13] Another Nurses\u2019 Health Study following 10,670 women ages 57-61 observed the effect of dietary patterns on aging. [14] Healthy aging was defined as living to 70 years or more, and having no chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cancer) or major declines in mental health, cognition, and physical function. The study found that the women who followed a Mediterranean-type eating pattern were 46% more likely to age healthfully. Increased intake of plant foods, whole grains, and fish; moderate alcohol intake; and low intake of red and processed meats were believed to contribute to this finding. Potential Pitfalls There is a risk of excess calorie intake because specific amounts of foods and portion sizes are not emphasized, which could lead to weight gain. It might be helpful to use the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, which provides guidance on specific types of foods to choose, along with a balanced plate guide such as the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate, which gives a better indication of proportions of food to eat per meal. However, it is important to note that\u2014probably in part due to the higher intake of olive oil and less processed foods\u2014the Mediterranean dietary pattern provides satiety and enables long term adherence. In one of the most successful weight loss trials to date, those assigned to the Mediterranean diet maintained weight loss over a period of six years. [15] Research supports the health benefits of a Mediterranean-style eating pattern that includes several different foods. It is the combination of these foods that appear protective against disease, as the benefit is not as strong when looking at single foods or nutrients included in the Mediterranean diet. [13] Therefore it is important to not simply add olive oil or nuts to one\u2019s current diet but to adopt the plan in its entirety. Bottom Line Research supports the use of the Mediterranean diet as a healthy eating pattern for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, increasing lifespan, and healthy aging. When used in conjunction with caloric restriction, the diet may also support healthy weight loss.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets\u2014and review the research behind them. What Is It? The Paleolithic or \u201cPaleo\u201d diet seeks to address 21st century ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Our predecessors used simple stone tools that were not advanced enough to grow and cultivate plants, so they hunted, fished, and gathered wild plants for food. If they lived long enough, they were believed to experience less modern-day diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease because of a consistent diet of lean meats and plant foods along with a high level of physical activity from intensive hunting. However, the life expectancy of our predecessors was only a fraction of that of people today. The popularity of the Paleo diet, which hit a peak in 2014, appealed to consumers\u2019 increasing desire to eat more healthfully and to know where their food was coming from. [1] How It Works The Paleo diet, also referred to as the caveman or Stone-Age diet, includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Proponents of the diet emphasize choosing low-glycemic fruits and vegetables. There is debate about several aspects of the Paleo diet: what foods actually existed at the time, the variation in diets depending on region (e.g., tropical vs. Arctic), how modern-day fruits and vegetables bear little resemblance to prehistoric wild versions, and disagreement among Paleo diet enthusiasts on what is included/excluded from the diet. Because of these differences, there is not one \u201ctrue\u201d Paleo diet. For example, although white potatoes were recorded as being available during the Paleolithic era, they are usually avoided on the Paleo diet because of their high glycemic index. Processed foods are also technically off limits due to an emphasis on fresh foods, but some Paleo diets allow frozen fruits and vegetables because the freezing process preserves most nutrients. Overall, the diet is high in protein, moderate in fat (mainly from unsaturated fats), low-moderate in carbohydrate (specifically restricting high glycemic index carbohydrates), high in fiber, and low in sodium and refined sugars. [2] The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA) come from marine fish, avocado, olive oil, and nuts and seeds. Grass-fed beef is often highlighted on the diet, which is promoted to contain more omega-3 fats than conventional beef (due to being fed grass instead of grain). It does contain small amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, only a small proportion of ALA can be converted in the body to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). The amount of omega-3 is also highly variable depending on the exact feeding regimen and differences in fat metabolism among cattle breeds. [3] In general, the amount of omega-3 in grass-fed beef is much lower than that in oily marine fish. [3] Cooked salmon contains 1000-2000 mg of EPA/DHA per 3-ounce portion, whereas 3 ounces of grass-fed beef contains about 20-200 mg of ALA. The following is a summary of foods generally permitted on the diet: Allowed: Fresh lean meats, fish, shellfish, eggs, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, coconut oil, and small amounts of honey. Certain root vegetables like sweet potatoes and cassava may be allowed in moderation because of their high nutrient content. Not Allowed: Whole grains, cereals, refined grains and sugars, dairy products, white potatoes, legumes (peanuts, beans, lentils), alcohol, coffee, salt, refined vegetable oils such as canola, and most processed foods in general. Calorie counting and portion sizes are not emphasized. Some plans allow a few \u201ccheat\u201d non-Paleo meals a week, especially when first starting the diet, to improve overall compliance. The Research So Far Some randomized controlled trials have shown the Paleo diet to produce greater short-term benefits than diets based on national nutrition guidelines, including greater weight loss, reduced waist circumference, decreased blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cholesterol. However these studies were of short duration (6 months or less) with a small number of participants (less than 40). [4-6] One larger randomized controlled trial followed 70 post-menopausal Swedish women with obesity for two years, who were placed on either a Paleo diet or a Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) diet. [7] The Paleo diet provided 30% of total calories from protein, 40% fat (from mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and 30% carbohydrates. It included lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, avocado, and olive oil. The NNR diet provided less protein and fat but more carbohydrate with 15% protein, 25-30% fat, and 55-60% carbohydrates, including foods similar to the Paleo diet but also low-fat dairy products and high-fiber grains. Both groups significantly decreased fat mass and weight circumference at 6 and 24 months, with the Paleo diet producing greater fat loss at 6 months but not at 24 months. Triglyceride levels decreased more significantly with the Paleo diet at 6 and 24 months than the NNR diet. Potential Pitfalls Meal planning. Because the diet relies heavily on fresh foods, expect a time commitment to plan, purchase, prepare, and cook meals. This may be challenging for busy lifestyles or for those less experienced with cooking. Higher cost. Fresh meats, fish, and produce tend to be pricier than processed versions such as frozen or canned. Excluding foods. The exclusion of entire categories of commonly eaten foods like whole grains and dairy requires frequent label reading in the supermarket and in restaurants. It may also increase the risk of deficiencies such as calcium, vitamin D, and B vitamins, if these nutrients are not consistently eaten from the allowed foods or a vitamin supplement. For example, there are some nondairy calcium-rich foods that are absorbed well by the body such as collard and turnip greens or canned bone-in sardines and salmon, but you would have to eat five or more servings of these greens and fish bones daily to meet recommended calcium needs. (Note that some greens like spinach that are touted to be calcium-rich also contain oxalates and phytates that bind to calcium so very little is actually absorbed.) One small, short-term intervention study of healthy participants showed a 53% decrease from baseline in calcium intake after following a Paleo diet for three weeks. [8] Furthermore, the exclusion of whole grains can result in reduced consumption of beneficial nutrients such as fiber and thus may increase one\u2019s risk for diabetes and heart disease. Health concerns of a high meat intake. Several studies have shown that a high intake of red meat is linked to a higher risk of death, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Unanswered Questions Is there potential for nutrient deficiencies, such as calcium and vitamin D, when following this diet for longer than one year that may make it inappropriate for certain at-risk groups (e.g., those with existing or at high risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis)? Are there long-term negative side effects of omitting entire food groups, especially if the diet is not carefully constructed to include the nutrients from the omitted foods? Is this diet safe and beneficial for everyone (e.g., generally healthy population, higher risk individuals with chronic diseases, elderly)? Bottom Line The Paleo diet includes nutrient-dense whole fresh foods and encourages participants to steer away from highly processed foods containing added salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. However, the omission of whole grains, dairy, and legumes could lead to suboptimal intake of important nutrients. The restrictive nature of the diet may also make it difficult for people to adhere to such a diet in the long run. More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year that compare the Paleo diet with other weight-reducing diets are needed to show a direct health benefit of the Paleo diet. Strong recommendations for the Paleo diet for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

Mindful eating stems from the broader philosophy of mindfulness, a widespread, centuries-old practice used in many religions. Mindfulness is an intentional focus on one\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the present moment. Mindfulness targets becoming more aware of, rather than reacting to, one\u2019s situation and choices. Eating mindfully means that you are using all of your physical and emotional senses to experience and enjoy the food choices you make. This helps to increase gratitude for food, which can improve the overall eating experience. Mindful eating encourages one to make choices that will be satisfying and nourishing to the body. However, it discourages \u201cjudging\u201d one\u2019s eating behaviors as there are different types of eating experiences. As we become more aware of our eating habits, we may take steps towards behavior changes that will benefit ourselves and our environment. How It Works Mindful eating focuses on your eating experiences, body-related sensations, and thoughts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment. Attention is paid to the foods being chosen, internal and external physical cues, and your responses to those cues. [1] The goal is to promote a more enjoyable meal experience and understanding of the eating environment. Fung and colleagues described a mindful eating model that is guided by four aspects: what to eat, why we eat what we eat, how much to eat, and how to eat. [1] Mindful eating: considers the wider spectrum of the meal: where the food came from, how it was prepared, and who prepared it notices internal and external cues that affect how much we eat notices how the food looks, tastes, smells, and feels in our bodies as we eat acknowledges how the body feels after eating the meal expresses gratitude for the meal may use deep breathing or meditation before or after the meal reflects on how our food choices affect our local and global environment Seven practices of mindful eating From SAVOR: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life [2] Honor the food. Acknowledge where the food was grown and who prepared the meal. Eat without distractions to help deepen the eating experience. Engage all senses. Notice the sounds, colors, smells, tastes, and textures of the food and how you feel when eating. Pause periodically to engage these senses. Serve in modest portions. This can help avoid overeating and food waste. Use a dinner plate no larger than 9 inches across and fill it only once. Savor small bites, and chew thoroughly. These practices can help slow down the meal and fully experience the food\u2019s flavors. Eat slowly to avoid overeating. If you eat slowly, you are more likely to recognize when you are feeling satisfied, or when you are about 80% full, and can stop eating. Don\u2019t skip meals. Going too long without eating increases the risk of strong hunger, which may lead to the quickest and easiest food choice, not always a healthful one. Setting meals at around the same time each day, as well as planning for enough time to enjoy a meal or snack reduces these risks. Eat a plant-based diet, for your health and for the planet. Consider the long-term effects of eating certain foods. Processed meat and saturated fat are associated with an increased risk of colon cancer and heart disease. Production of animal-based foods like meat and dairy takes a heavier toll on our environment than plant-based foods. Watch: Practicing mindful eating Mindful eating starts with being conscious of every bite you take. Learn more about this practice and other mindful living approaches from the Thich Nhat Hanh Center for Mindfulness in Public Health. The Research So Far The opposite of mindful eating, sometimes referred to as mindless or distracted eating, is associated with anxiety, overeating, and weight gain. [3] Examples of mindless eating are eating while driving, while working, or viewing a television or other screen (phone, tablet). [4] Although socializing with friends and family during a meal can enhance an eating experience, talking on the phone or taking a work call while eating can detract from it. In these scenarios, one is not fully focused on and enjoying the meal experience. Interest in mindful eating has grown as a strategy to eat with less distractions and to improve eating behaviors. Intervention studies have shown that mindfulness approaches can be an effective tool in the treatment of unfavorable behaviors such as emotional eating and binge eating that can lead to weight gain and obesity, although weight loss as an outcome measure is not always seen. [5-7] This may be due to differences in study design in which information on diet quality or weight loss may or may not be provided. Mindfulness addresses the shame and guilt associated with these behaviors by promoting a non-judgmental attitude. Mindfulness training develops the skills needed to be aware of and accept thoughts and emotions without judgment; it also distinguishes between emotional versus physical hunger cues. These skills can improve one\u2019s ability to cope with the psychological distress that sometimes leads to binge eating. [6] Mindful eating is sometimes associated with a higher diet quality, such as choosing fruit instead of sweets as a snack, or opting for smaller serving sizes of calorie-dense foods. [1] A literature review of 68 intervention and observational studies on mindfulness and mindful eating found that these strategies improved eating behaviors such as slowing down the pace of a meal and recognizing feelings of fullness and greater control over eating. [8] Slower eating was associated with eating less food, as participants felt fuller sooner. Mindfulness and mindful eating interventions appeared most successful in reducing binge eating and emotional eating. However, the review did not show that these interventions consistently reduced body weight. Limitation of the studies included small sample sizes, limited durations of about 6 months or less, lack of focus on diet quality, and lack of follow-up so that longer-term success was not determined. A randomized controlled trial following 194 adults with obesity (78% were women) for 5.5 months looked at the effects of a mindfulness intervention on mindful eating, sweets consumption, and fasting glucose levels. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a diet and exercise program with mindfulness concepts (stress reduction, chair yoga, meditation, affirmations) or the same program but without mindfulness concepts. After 12 months, the mindfulness group showed a decreased intake of sweets and maintenance of fasting blood glucose, as opposed to the control group showing increased fasting blood glucose. [9] The research authors also evaluated weight loss with these participants, but did not find a significant difference in weight changes between the mindfulness group and control group. [10] A small controlled trial of 50 adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized to either a 3-month mindful eating intervention that was focused on reducing overeating and improving eating regulation or to a diabetes self-management education (DSME) intervention that was focused on improving food choices. Both groups showed significant improvements in measures of depression, nutrition self-efficacy, and controlling overeating behaviors. Both groups lost weight during the intervention but there was no difference in amount of weight loss between groups. [11] It is important to note that currently there is no standard for what defines mindful eating behavior, and there is no one widely recognized standardized protocol for mindful eating. Research uses a variety of mindfulness scales and questionnaires. Study designs often vary as well, with some protocols including a weight reduction component or basic education on diet quality, while others do not. Additional research is needed to determine what behaviors constitute a mindful eating practice so that a more standardized approach can be used in future studies. [1] Standardized tools can help to determine the longer-term impact of mindful eating on health behaviors and disease risk and prevention, and determine which groups of people may most benefit from mindfulness strategies. [1] Are mindful eating strategies applicable in youth? Potential Pitfalls Mindful eating is not intended to replace traditional treatments for severe clinical conditions such as eating disorders. Neurochemical imbalances are a risk factor for developing eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, and although mindfulness may be an effective component of a treatment plan, it should not be used as a sole treatment. May not be effective as a weight loss strategy on its own, but rather a complement to a weight loss program. Mindful eating embraces making food choices that promote well-being and increasing enjoyment of the eating experience. Traditional weight loss regimens focus on following a structured meal plan that may not necessarily be satisfying or enjoyable. Combining mindfulness with a meal plan under the guidance of a registered dietitian may reduce the risk of emotional overeating or binge eating. [14] Research has not consistently shown that mindfulness strategies lead to weight loss, but this may be due to the study design not including education on healthy eating choices as part of the mindfulness intervention. Bottom Line Mindful eating is an approach to eating that can complement any eating pattern. Research has shown that mindful eating can lead to greater psychological wellbeing, increased pleasure when eating, and body satisfaction. Combining behavioral strategies such as mindfulness training with nutrition knowledge can lead to healthful food choices that reduce the risk of chronic diseases, promote more enjoyable meal experiences, and support a healthy body image. More research is needed to examine whether mindful eating is an effective strategy for weight management. Mindful eating in context of COVID-19 As COVID-19 lockdowns began, reports of food stockpiling by consumers (with trends toward shelf-stable, energy-dense comfort foods) fueled concern that adults may increase their overall food intake during extended isolation, thus leading to weight gain. [15] Along with the potential for increased emotional eating due to the numerous stressors brought on by the pandemic, researchers noted that home confinement provides an altered exposure to food cues, which may enhance impulsive eating behaviors. [16] The simultaneous loss of social eating opportunities was also flagged for its potential to reduce mindful eating practices, which could negatively influence food choice and promote overeating. [16] All said, the full impacts at a population-level remain to be seen amidst varying degrees of lockdown mandates and compliance with social-distancing measures worldwide. In the meantime, individuals may consider incorporating any number of mindful eating strategies in their daily lives alongside other important measures to help stay healthy during COVID-19. For example: If you\u2019re working from home and find that \u201coffice\u201d time blends into all hours of the day, schedule times in your calendar to only eat: a lunch break away from your computer, a reserved time for dinner with your family, etc. If you find yourself standing in your pantry or staring in your refrigerator, pause and ask yourself: \u201cam I truly hungry, or am I just bored or stressed?\u201d If hungry, eat. If boredom or stress is the source, reroute your attention to an activity you enjoy, call a friend, or simply spend some time breathing. If you have a craving for comfort foods, pause and take a few in-breaths and out-breaths to be fully present with your craving. Take a portion of the food from the container (a handful of chips, a scoop of ice cream) and put it on a plate. Eat mindfully, savoring each bite. A note about eating disorders: The COVID-19 pandemic may raise unique challenges for individuals with experience of eating disorders. [17] In the U.S., the National Eating Disorders Association has reported a significant increase in calls and messages for help as compared to a year ago. As noted, mindful eating is not intended to replace traditional treatments for severe clinical conditions such as eating disorders. If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, you can call the National Eating Disorders Association Helpline at 1-800-931-2237, or text \u201cNEDA\u201d to 741-741. A note about food insecurity: Many individuals may be facing food shortages because of unemployment or other issues related to the pandemic. If you (or someone you know) are struggling to access enough food to keep yourself or your family healthy, there are several options to help. Learn more about navigating supplemental food resources.

Although kale has early roots in Greek and Roman culture, it remained a relatively minor commercial crop in the U.S. until recent years. This leafy green reached celebrity status around 2012, appearing on menus of Michelin star restaurants and becoming the choice ingredient of millennial food bloggers. Kale displaced other greens in salads, soups, and pesto, and even showed up in the snack aisles as chips. Bon App\u00e9tit magazine named 2012 the year of kale, and on October 2, 2013, \u201cNational Kale Day\u201d was launched in the U.S. While curly and lacinato (also known as dinosaur or Tuscan) are generally the most common types of kale, this vegetable comes in a wide variety\u2014each with its own unique colors, flavors, and textures: redbor is characterized by its deep purple, curly leaves; the blue-green and purple-red leaves of red Russian are known for being semi-sweet; the large green leaves of Siberian are particularly cold weather-hardy; and Chinese kale (Gai Lan), or \u201cChinese broccoli,\u201d can be used in place of conventional broccoli in many dishes. Like broccoli, kale is part of the Brassica oleracea family, which also includes cabbage, cauliflower, bok choy, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts. Another more commonly recognized name for this vegetable family is Cruciferae or cruciferous, which refers to the shape of its sprouts that resemble a cross. Source Of Vitamin K Vitamin C Vitamin A Carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin Vitamin B6 Folate Fiber Manganese Kale and Health Cruciferous vegetables contain a plant chemical called glucosinolates, sulfur-containing compounds that are broken down into isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol after chewing, chopping, or cooking. In nature, glucosinolates act as a first-line defense for plants, protecting them from environmental and biological stresses (insects, fungi, drought conditions). These same substances are being researched for their proposed ability in humans to affect chronic conditions including certain types of cancer and heart disease. Laboratory studies have shown that isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol inhibit inflammatory processes, prevent the growth and spread of tumor cells, and protect healthy cells. [1] Observational studies that follow groups of people over time have sometimes suggested a protective effect of cruciferous vegetables on various cancers and cardiovascular health, but findings have not been consistent. [2-5] There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy. The use of different study designs and methods, as well as the way in which the vegetables were cooked can change the bioavailability of isothiocyanates and their effects on the disease process. Genes may also play a role, as some people metabolize isothiocyanates more efficiently than others. [2] It is also possible that the amounts of cruciferous vegetables consumed by study populations have no important impact on disease risks. More research with larger and longer-term studies is needed. Regardless, kale remains a highly nutritious food to include as part of a healthful dietary pattern. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults eat a variety of vegetables as part of a healthy meal plan, and specifically at least 1\u00bd cups of dark-green vegetables (including cruciferous) per week. [6] People who are placed on blood thinners or anticoagulant medication to prevent blood clots are sometimes concerned about eating kale and other green leafy vegetables that are rich in vitamin K. Vitamin K has a unique action that assists in clotting blood, and can interfere with the effects of some blood thinners. However, people taking these medicines can safely eat these vegetables with a general precaution: eating a relatively consistent amount from day to day can allow one\u2019s physician to adjust the dose of medication to balance the dietary intake of vitamin K, and should not interfere with the anticoagulant medication\u2019s effectiveness. For those who are on blood thinners or anticoagulant medications, it would be wise to check with their physician and possibly a clinical dietitian. Another concern has been the goitrogen content of kale and other cruciferous vegetables. Goitrogens are naturally occurring substances, sometimes referred to as \u201canti-nutrients,\u201d that can block iodine from entering the thyroid gland. Iodine is a trace mineral needed by the body to make thyroid hormones that promote normal metabolism. A deficiency of iodine can lead to a condition called goiter, or enlargement of the thyroid. Healthy persons who eat enough iodine and metabolize iodine normally will not be affected by dietary goitrogens. However, if one has an underactive thyroid called hypothyroidism and cannot produce enough thyroid hormone, eating excess goitrogens, especially in raw form, may further suppress thyroid activity and increase the risk of goiter. Those who have hypothyroidism specifically due to an iodine deficiency are at greatest risk. A simple solution is to cook cruciferous vegetables, which deactivates the enzyme responsible for causing the goitrogenic effect. [7] Including a wide variety of vegetables each week other than cruciferous will also protect against eating an excess amount of goitrogens. Prepare Available throughout much of the year, Kale is even tolerant to frost and cold weather. Low temperatures can actually cause kale and other cruciferous vegetables to convert starch molecules into sugar, resulting in a sweeter, less bitter flavor. Despite their tough and fibrous texture, kale stems are edible if cooked. Cut stems into small pieces and add to a stir-fry. Add diced stems to soups. Use to make a vegetable stock. Make Kale has hearty leaves that withstand all types of cooking: boiling, braising, steaming, microwaving, and stir-frying. Kale can also be served raw but the texture may be difficult to chew. Saut\u00e9ed Kale: This is one of the simplest, quickest methods to enjoy kale. Add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to a saucepan on medium-high heat. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until softened. Add \u00bd cup water or broth and 1 \u2013 1\u00bd pounds kale (washed, stems and leaves coarsely chopped). Cover the pan and allow to cook for 5 minutes until kale is softened and at desired texture. Season with herbs and spices as desired. Kale Chips: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Wash and dry 1 bunch of kale thoroughly; use paper towels to blot if needed. Using your hands, pull leaves from their stems and rip into small pieces; or you may use kitchen shears to cut leaves from stem and into small pieces. Place into a large bowl and drizzle with oil. Massage oil evenly into kale pieces. Spread in single layer on baking sheet. Sprinkle herbs or spices as desired (try curry, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, or chili powder). Bake until the leaves shrink and the edges turn slightly brown, about 15 minutes. Kale Pesto: This recipe uses walnuts instead of the classic but more expensive and obscure ingredient of pine nuts. Place into a food processor: 2 cups kale leaves (stems removed), \u00bc cup extra virgin olive oil, and 2 cloves garlic or \u00bc teaspoon garlic powder; pulse until smooth. Add \u00bc cup toasted walnuts, and pulse until blended. Add \u00bd cup Parmesan cheese and pulse again until blended. Serve pesto mixed into pasta or whole grains, as a sauce for chicken or fish, as a pizza sauce, or spread on crackers. Kale Salad: If using in a salad, there are two methods to soften the leaves so they are easier to chew: 1) Place leaves in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil; massage the leaves for 1-2 minutes, or 2) Blanch leaves by placing in a pot of boiling water for 1 minute. Drain the leaves and place into a bowl filled with ice water to quickly stop the cooking. Place leaves in a colander and gently press out excess water. Use paper towels to blot dry as needed. Blanching can also help to remove some of the bitter flavor from kale.

The word yogurt is believed to be derived from the Turkish word \u201cyo\u011furmak,\u201d which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. [1] Historical accounts describe nomadic herdsmen carrying milk in pouches made of animal skins. Naturally occurring enzymes in the pouches that were carried close to the body produced enough body heat to ferment the milk, producing an edible food that lasted longer than milk; thus the introduction of yogurt! Yogurt is made when heated milk is combined with bacteria, specifically Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, and left to sit for several hours at a warm temperature (110-115\u00b0F). Additional types of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be added. The bacteria convert the sugar in milk, called lactose, to lactic acid, which thickens the milk and develops its distinctive tart flavor. References to yogurt and health date back to 6000 BCE, as seen in Indian Ayurvedic medicinal texts. In the 1900s, the Bulgarian microbiologist Stamen Grigorov discovered Lactobacillus bulgaricus bacillus, a strain of the bacillus bacteria not naturally found in the human gut that caused the fermentation of yogurt. He also researched the specific health effects of lactic acid. Today, yogurt can be found in a variety of forms\u2014including plain, but often with added fruit or sweeteners. Thickeners and stabilizers such as gelatin and pectins may also be added for a thicker texture and richer taste. Individuals with lactose intolerance who cannot tolerate dairy products may be able to eat some yogurt because of its lower concentration of lactose. Fermentation by the bacteria breaks down lactose to lactic acid. Another option may be plant-based yogurts, which do not contain lactose. Source Of Protein Calcium Phosphorus B vitamins \u2013 riboflavin and B12 (animal-based yogurt only) Yogurt and Health Yogurt offers several important nutrients including protein and calcium. However, much of the research on yogurt\u2019s health benefits centers on its live bacterial content, which is also present in other fermented foods like kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut. [2] It has been proposed that a lower number of some bacterial strains in the body may influence risk of certain disease conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. [3, 4] A plant-based diet is associated with supporting a diverse and probably healthier gut microbiota more than a diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in meat, [5] and yogurt consumption may also help to increase microbiota diversity in the gut. [6] Learn more about the body\u2019s microbiome. Epidemiological research on specific health effects of yogurt is still limited but a few studies suggest a benefit. In a study following three large cohorts for up to 20 years that included 120,877 men and women free of obesity and chronic diseases at baseline, yogurt consumption appeared to protect from weight gain. [7] The authors suggested that changes in colonic bacteria from eating the yogurt may have influenced weight changes. Daily yogurt intake may also protect against heart disease and type 2 diabetes. [8,9] Two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies found an 18% and 14% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes with daily yogurt intake. [10,11] Why yogurt affects diabetes is unclear, but it is believed that helpful bacteria in the yogurt may reduce inflammation or improve the action of the body\u2019s natural insulin. For Your Health and the Planet\u2019s Health The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane\u2014a powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of yogurt. Purchase Along with fat content, flavor, and type of milk from which the yogurt is derived (cow, goat, etc.), here are some other terms you may find in the yogurt aisle: Greek yogurt, also called \u201cstrained yogurt\u201d or \u201cyogurt cheese.\u201d Yogurt that is strained to remove the whey portion, resulting in a thicker consistency than unstrained yogurt while preserving yogurt\u2019s distinctive, sour taste. Plant-based or non-dairy yogurts. Stemming from the rise in popularity of plant-based non-dairy milks, yogurts made from soy, coconut, nuts, rice, and other plant foods have become more common on supermarket shelves. Note that not all plant-based yogurts undergo fermentation so they may not contain live bacteria. Plant-based yogurts may be lower in protein, calcium, and other nutrients unless they are fortified, so check the Nutrition Facts label if these nutrients are important in your diet. Probiotic. Refers to foods, beverages, and supplements containing specific strains of live bacteria or microbiota. Food manufacturers may add additional probiotic strains for perceived health benefits. However, the exact amount of probiotics and strain of bacteria that yield a beneficial health effect will vary among individuals and is not well-researched. CFUs or colony forming units. The number of living bacteria per gram. This is an indication of how many live bacteria are present in the yogurt at the time of manufacture. Yogurt typically contains at least 1,000,000, or 106 CFUs, which is the minimum needed to display a \u201cLive and Active Cultures\u201d seal on the packaging. This minimum number is the standard provided because it is expected that some bacteria will be destroyed when passing through the digestive tract and exposed to stomach acid. Though food manufacturers often promote the health benefits of multiple strains of bacteria and a high amount of CFUs, with some products offering billions of CFUs, research does not support these claims. Make If you want to try making strained yogurt at home, it\u2019s not as difficult as you might think: Heat 1/2 gallon of milk (may be skim, 2%, or whole). Pour the milk into a 3-quart saucepan and set over medium heat. Warm the milk until almost boiling when small bubbles appear; stir the milk periodically to prevent scorching. Cool the milk to a warm temperature of about 110\u00b0-115\u00b0 F and transfer to a glass or ceramic bowl. A higher temperature can destroy the bacteria, while a cooler temperature can prevent fermentation. Whisk into the milk \u00bd cup plain yogurt with live cultures or a yogurt starter package. Cover the bowl with a lid or clean plate. Wrap the bowl in a towel. Heat oven to warm setting for 1-2 minutes and turn on oven light. Turn off the oven (leave light on) and place yogurt into oven. Let sit for at least 4 hours but may be left overnight. The oven temperature should be about 110\u00b0F. The yogurt is then ready to use. If you prefer this thinner consistency, refrigerate for a few hours before eating. If you wish a thicker Greek-style yogurt, strain the yogurt. Place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl and line with a coffee filter or cheesecloth. Pour the yogurt into the sieve and refrigerate for up to several hours, which will strain out the liquid whey and excess water. The yogurt may be stored in the refrigerator for about 7 days. Try plain Greek yogurt with berries for a satisfying snack. Serve Choose plain and unsweetened yogurt, either strained or unstrained. Add herbs and spices for savory preparations, or fresh fruit and spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger for a sweeter dish. Top with almonds, pecans, or other nuts for a crunchy addition. For a delicious tzatziki sauce, blend together 1 whole diced peeled cucumber, 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 garlic clove, 1 tablespoon dill, and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Stir mixture into 3 cups of plain Greek yogurt. Serve as a sauce or a dip. Substitute plain yogurt in recipes calling for sour cream or mayonnaise. Examples: For tuna salad, use half plain yogurt and half mayo. For extra zip, try adding any of the following to taste: Dijon mustard, chili powder, garlic powder, diced dill pickles, or red onion. For a creamy honey mustard salad dressing or marinade, whisk together 1/2 cup 2% plain Greek yogurt, 2 tablespoons yellow mustard, 3 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and pinch of salt and pepper. Did You Know? Greek yogurt did not originate in Greece! Although strained yogurt or straggisto is a staple dish in Greece, the term \u201cGreek yogurt\u201d was first made popular by a commercial yogurt company located in Greece, and later used by other U.S. and European yogurt companies. Britain is the only country that regulates the term, where yogurt must be produced in Greece to carry the title. Some calcium is removed from Greek yogurt during the straining process. Commercial Greek yogurts may add back calcium, but some do not so if you are including Greek yogurt in your diet as a calcium source, be sure to check the Nutrition Facts label. Some yogurts can contain up to 20-25 grams of sugar per 5 oz. container. Though some of this may come from naturally occurring lactose, most will be from added sweeteners. If you see sugar or other forms of sugar among the top four ingredients in the Ingredients list, consider choosing a lower sugar yogurt or use plain yogurt with your own addition of fresh fruit or a drizzle of honey. See Added Sugar in the Diet.

Historically, almond trees grew there wild and were later cultivated as early as 3000 BC. Almonds are even referenced in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, as a prized food given as gifts. The edible part of the almond is actually a seed from a drupe, a fruit in which the outer shell and hull layers are typically not eaten. After extracting the almond seed, the shells and hulls are often used for livestock feed and bedding. Source Of Vitamin E Monounsaturated fats Fiber Biotin Minerals: Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium Trace minerals: Copper Phytonutrients, specifically flavonoids, plant sterols, phenolic acids One serving of almonds equals one ounce, about 23 almonds or \u00bc cup. It is a calorie-dense food but also nutrient-dense with the majority of its fat being monounsaturated. One ounce provides about 165 calories, 6 grams protein, 14 grams fat (80% monounsaturated, 15% polyunsaturated, and 5% saturated), 6 grams carbohydrate, and 3 grams fiber. Almonds and Health Almonds have been suggested to reduce heart disease risk by lowering total and LDL cholesterol, and exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Plant sterols as found in almonds may interfere with the absorption of cholesterol and bile acid, and the high amount of unsaturated fat in almonds favors an improved lipid profile, especially when this food replaces other foods high in saturated fat and refined carbohydrate. Almonds also contain phytonutrients that support the growth of beneficial gut microbes. Controlled trials have shown that general nut intake can decrease inflammation, promote healthy blood vessels, and reduce insulin resistance. [1] Interestingly, despite nuts being calorie-dense, research does not support a link with nut intake and weight gain. In fact, they have been associated with less weight gain and a lower risk of obesity, possibly because the fat and fiber content help to improve feelings of satisfaction and fullness. [1] There is limited evidence examining the intake of almonds in large populations. Smaller controlled trials have looked specifically at almonds, but larger observational studies tend to examine nuts in general, because consumption of individual nuts is relatively low in the population. Observational studies looking at intakes of nuts have found a significantly lower risk of heart disease in those eating nuts at least four times a week. [2] Small randomized controlled trials have found consistent benefits of diets supplemented with nuts\u2014including almonds\u2014on reducing total and LDL cholesterol in blood. A large epidemiological study of health professionals that looked at general nut intake found that tree nuts including almonds eaten two or more times weekly was associated with a 13% lower risk of total cardiovascular disease and 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease. [1] Another large prospective study of Swedish adults found that those who ate nuts 1-2 times a week had a 12% reduced risk of a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, and 18% reduced risk if eaten 3 or more times a week, when compared with adults who ate no nuts. [4] There was also a 20% reduced risk of heart failure in those eating nuts 1-2 times a week compared with no-nut eaters. Meta-analyses have found that a higher nut intake is associated with reduced risk of total cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and deaths from all causes. These studies had conflicting results in showing a protective effect of nut intake from diabetes, respiratory disease, stroke, and infections. [5-8] Because earlier scientific evidence suggested a heart disease benefit of eating nuts, in 2003 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved manufacturers to state on food labels that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease. [9] Purchase Almonds are available raw, blanched, dry-roasted, and oil-roasted. They may be purchased whole, sliced, chopped, or slivered. Though they are most often found plain or salted, they are available in honey-roasted, BBQ, chili, chocolate-covered, and other flavors, many of which can drive up the calories, sodium, and sugar. Raw almonds are nutritionally comparable to dry-roasted. It is best to store almonds in a cool, dark, dry location. If kept at temperatures less than 40\u00b0F, almonds can be stored for about two years. Almond Milk. This dairy-free plant milk is free of cholesterol and lactose, which may appeal to those following a low-cholesterol diet or who are lactose-intolerant. It is made by finely grinding almonds with water, which is then strained to remove the almond pulp. The remaining liquid may then be fortified with nutrients like calcium, and vitamins A and D. While the best choice is unsweetened almond milk, many have added sweeteners, so be sure to check the nutrition panel. Almond Butter. Almond butter has a similar consistency to peanut butter, but can serve as an alternative for those with a peanut allergy. Jarred almond butter is typically more expensive than peanut butter, ranging in price from $5-15. For a less expensive option, try a DIY almond butter. Grind 1 pound of dry-roasted almonds in a food processor or high-powered blender, starting at low speed and gradually increasing the speed. Pause to scrape the sides of the processor and break up any large pieces. It may take several minutes before the consistency will change to a paste. The longer you blend, the smoother the paste will become as the oils are released. You can also add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, or curry for unique flavors. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 weeks. Almond Flour or Almond Meal. Made of finely ground almonds, this flour alternative is gluten-free and low in carbohydrate. The almonds are blanched with the skins removed to create a finer texture. It is more nutrient-dense than wheat flour but also higher in calories and fat. Almond flour contains more moisture than all-purpose flour, so usually a greater quantity is needed when using it as a replacement for other flours in recipes. Generally, \u00be cup of all-purpose flour is equivalent to about 1 \u00bd cups of almond flour. Keep in mind that the extra moisture in almond flour may make baked goods more susceptible to spoilage and mold, so store in an airtight container. Almond flour should be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 6-9 months; freezing may extend the shelf-life further. Eat Chopped or slivered unsalted almonds can be found in the baking aisle and are an easy topping for hot and cold cereals, salads, and baked goods. Spread almond butter on sliced apples or whole grain toast. For a richer-tasting oatmeal, add a tablespoon of almond butter as soon as the oats are cooked and stir well. Try crunchy and nutritious almonds in place of less healthy snacks like chips and pretzels. Try almond flour instead of all-purpose flour in baked goods, or as a breading for fish.

California is the world\u2019s largest grower of almonds, producing 80% of the global almond supply. Almond trees are entirely dependent on honeybees and wild bees to pollinate their blossoms and grow the almond drupe. Out of all almond products, almond milk and almond butter have shown the greatest growth in consumer demand. Almond milk sales grew by 250% between 2011 and 2015, and almond butter production has tripled since 2011.

For those of us seeking to improve our health, the notion of a superfood can be appealing. We may imagine a powerful food with special abilities like promoting weight loss or healing disease. There\u2019s no scientifically based or regulated definition for superfood, but generally, a food is promoted to superfood status when it offers high levels of desirable nutrients, is linked to the prevention of a disease, or is believed to offer several simultaneous health benefits beyond its nutritional value. Its inclusion in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary confirms its widespread use, which defines a superfood as \u201ca food (such as salmon, broccoli, or blueberries) that is rich in compounds (such as antioxidants, fiber, or fatty acids) considered beneficial to a person\u2019s health.\u201d The First Superfood Where did the term superfood originate? Interestingly, not from those who formally study food, such as nutrition scientists and dietitians. The earliest recorded example may have taken place in the early 20th century around World War I, used as part of a food marketing strategy. The United Fruit Company initiated an enthusiastic advertising campaign to promote its major import of bananas. It published informational pamphlets including Points About Bananas and the Food Value of the Banana. [1] Initially the company had advertised the practicality of bananas in a daily diet, being cheap, nutritious, easily digested, available everywhere, good when cooked and not cooked, and sealed by nature in a germ-proof package. To get people to eat more, they suggested adding bananas in cereal for breakfast, in salads for lunch, and fried with meat for dinner. However, the popularity of the term soared after being endorsed in medical journals, due to physicians publishing their findings of a banana diet to treat conditions like celiac disease and diabetes. [2] The American Medical Association announced that bananas in a child\u2019s diet would provide relief for celiac disease or cure it (gluten had not yet been discovered as the true culprit). Bananas soon bore an emblem of health, and mothers made bananas a dietary staple for their children and infants even if they did not have celiac disease. The United Fruit Company included these health benefits in its promotional material and the popular press flaunted headlines about bananas, birthing the banana diet craze. Superfoods = Super Sales The difference in the 21st century is that information now spreads at viral speed so that a new superfood seems to appear on a monthly basis. The essentials are in place: scientific research on a particular food, catchy headlines from the fast-paced popular press, as well as infomercials and marketing campaigns of involved food industries. Superfoods often translate into super sales that have created a billion-dollar industry. According to a Nielson survey, consumers are willing to pay more for foods perceived as healthy, and health claims on labels seem to help. Interestingly, foods already perceived as healthy that also carry a health claim show the greatest sales. [3] This may be due to providing added confirmation of a consumer\u2019s knowledge about a healthful food, increasing the likelihood they will purchase it. The survey also shows that about 80% of respondents see \u201cfood as medicine\u201d and eat certain foods to prevent health problems like obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. No surprise then that plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are generally perceived as health-promoting, often top superfoods lists. The food industry certainly has the incentive to market a product as a superfood, which boosts sales. According to Mintel research, in 2015 there was a 36% increase globally in the number of foods and beverages launched that were labeled as a \u201csuperfood,\u201d \u201csuperfruit,\u201d or \u201csupergrain,\u201d with the United States leading those product launches. [4] Quinoa and other ancient grains, chia seeds, and kale enjoyed consistent sales growth in 2017. A recent list of the top 13 trending ingredients based on data from food and beverage startup companies include pea protein, seaweed, ginger, turmeric, matcha, oats, barley, and chickpeas. [5] The Story of the Blueberry Another food star, blueberries, hit their peak in the early 21st century after an indirect endorsement from government-sponsored research. In 1991, a rating tool called the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) was created by scientists from the National Institute on Aging and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was used to measure the antioxidant capacity of foods. Antioxidants are molecules that may help reduce the amount of damaging free radicals in the body, and therefore are believed to be health-promoting. The USDA provided an ORAC database on its website highlighting foods with high ORAC scores, including cocoa, berries, spices, and legumes. Blueberries and other foods topping the list were heavily promoted as disease fighters even if the science was weak, from cancer to brain health to heart disease. However, 20 years later the USDA retracted the information and removed the database after determining that antioxidants have many functions, not all of which are related to free radical activity. [6] Despite the retraction, blueberry production in the U.S. doubled from 1998-2006, and has continued to increase every year through 2016 according to USDA data. [7] Some other sensationalized superfoods, from A to Z: a\u00e7ai, almond, avocado, broccoli, cacao, chia seeds, eggs, garlic, goji, green tea, kale, kefir, mangosteen, pomegranate, salmon, seaweed, wheatgrass The Bottom Line: Focus on a Super Plate, Not Just Superfoods Superfoods are often nutritious but it\u2019s clear that the term is more useful for driving sales than it is for providing optimal nutrition recommendations. A downside of superfoods is that the title alone may cause people to focus on a few specific foods, blinding them to other equally nutritious options that aren\u2019t as hyped. Variety in our diet is important not only to gain the benefit of eating a wide array of essential vitamins and minerals, but also to prevent one from eating too much (or too little) of a particular nutrient. It also keeps our meals interesting and flavorful! So yes, explore individual foods and learn how to select, prepare, and enjoy them\u2014but don\u2019t be distracted by the latest overhyped food or fad. Instead, focus on creating a \u201csuper plate\u201d full of different healthy and flavorful foods. Need some inspiration? Check out the Healthy Eating Plate to get started.

They are easy to store and transport, and as a result, are typically available year-round in the U.S. In this piece we\u2019ll explore how apples may benefit health and the best types for baking versus munching straight off the core. Source Of Fiber, insoluble and soluble Phytochemicals (quercetin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, anthocyanin) Vitamin C One serving, or one medium apple, provides about 95 calories, 0 gram fat, 1 gram protein, 25 grams carbohydrate, 19 grams sugar (naturally occurring), and 3 grams fiber. Apples and Health Apples are rich in quercetin and pectin, both of which are credited for supplying apples with their health benefits. [1] Quercetin is a flavonoid, a type of naturally occurring plant chemical that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Pectin is a type of soluble fiber that may help prevent constipation and have a modest effect on lowering LDL, the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. Pectin is also fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon, which produces short chain fatty acids that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders. [2,3] Fresh, whole apples offer the most nutrients. Discarding the skin removes much of the fiber and the majority of flavonoids. Dehydrating or drying the apples removes vitamin C, which is predominantly in the flesh. In addition, sugar (along with extra calories) is often added to dried apples. Clear apple juice undergoes filtering and pasteurization, which removes most of the flavonoids and fibers. [3] Overall research shows a benefit when adding apples to the diet. The studies below looked at the health effects of apples in the diet over time, or examined the effects of specific phytochemicals in apples. Cardiovascular disease Type 2 diabetes Weight management Cancer Should I be concerned about pesticides? Apples continuously top the list of fruits highest in pesticide residues. They often require more pesticides as they are particularly susceptible to bugs and disease. Although apples are generally washed before being sold, the amount of remaining residue is unknown and may vary widely (partly depending on the type and amount of pesticide applied). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have developed a national pesticide residue database called the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) to collect data each year on pesticide residues in food. One of the most common pesticides used on apples after harvest is diphenylamine, used to prevent apple scald or browning of the skin that can occur during storage. A 2016 analysis from the PDP found that 80% of 531 apple samples contained residues of this chemical at 0.002-3.8 ppm, which is below the EPA\u2019s tolerance level of 10 ppm. [12] A tolerance level is the maximum amount of residue allowed on a raw food. This amount is based on a review of numerous scientific studies to determine possible harmful effects the chemical could have on humans, the amount of residue likely to remain in or on the food, and the amount of the food that people typically eat. Although some pesticide residue can permeate into the flesh, washing and peeling the apple skin removes much of the pesticide. Apple skin supplies the majority of healthy phytochemicals and fiber, so it is not best to remove it. If one eats several apples a week and is unsure of the amount of pesticides used, purchasing organically grown apples may be an option, although direct evidence is not available that there is an important difference in health effects. Some general tips for cleaning apples: The Food and Drug Administration recommends washing all produce thoroughly (including organic) under running water before preparing or eating. Firm produce like apples may be scrubbed with a clean produce brush. They do not recommend washing produce with soap, detergent, or even commercial produce washes. The washes are intended for killing bacteria rather than removing pesticides, and studies have shown that water is just as, if not more, effective than produce washes for removing bacteria. [13] Baking soda is effective at removing bacteria and breaking down pesticide residues so they are more easily rinsed off, but this method requires a few extra steps. Soak the apple in a baking soda solution of 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 2 cups water for 10-15 minutes, then rinse well. To save time, soak a large batch of apples, rinse well, and then dry each thoroughly with a towel before storing in the refrigerator (as any remaining excess moisture can promote mold or spoilage). Keep in mind that the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables outweigh potential pesticide risks, and should not deter one from including apples as part of a healthful diet. Storage To prolong freshness, store in the refrigerator in the crisper drawer. They will usually remain fresh for at least 1-2 months, if not longer. Apples are a climacteric fruit, meaning that they continue to ripen after harvesting due to emitting a gas called ethylene. Cold temperatures slow down the production of ethylene. Even so, apples will still emit some ethylene when refrigerated and can speed the ripening of other produce stored nearby. Store apples in their own drawer apart from other produce to prevent this from happening. If stored at room temperature, the enzymes and ethylene gas in apples quicken ripening. They will last on your counter for about 1-2 weeks but the texture can change during this time. Serve There are at least a dozen types of apples found in U.S. supermarkets, but up to 100 varieties are available. Check out local farms and farmers markets for more unusual heirloom varieties. Some are best for cooking and baking, and others are enjoyed raw for snacking. They range from sweet to tart, and may produce a hearty crunch or a light crispy bite. Tart, mildly sweet apples with firm crisp flesh that don\u2019t become mushy at high temperatures are best for baking: Jonagolds, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Melrose, Cortland, Braeburn. Juicy and sweet flavors are often chosen for eating: Gala, Red and Golden Delicious, Fuji, McIntosh. If you prefer tart over sweet, baking apples can certainly be eaten as well! Some fun ways to enjoy apples: Cut one apple into thin slices and spread with nut or seed butter. Enjoy a sweet/salty, crunchy/creamy combo by pairing apple slices with thin slices of cheddar cheese. Apple sandwich: Remove the center and seeds of an apple with a corer and slice the apple into rounds about a \u00bd-inch thick. Spread one apple slice with nut or seed butter and sprinkle with granola or trail mix. Then place another apple slice on top. Oven-baked apple chips: Core apple and slice very thinly or with a mandoline. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet or parchment paper. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 225 degrees F for one hour (higher temperatures can burn the apples). Flip apple slices and bake for up to 1 hour more or until apple chips feel dry. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely. Waldorf salad: Chop 2 large apples into small chunks and add to large bowl with \u00bd cup walnuts, 1 sliced celery rib, and \u00bc cup raisins. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Prepare the dressing by combining \u00bd cup nonfat plain yogurt, 1-2 tablespoons mayonnaise, teaspoon of lemon zest, and pinch of pepper. Fold dressing into apple mixture and stir well. Apple, fennel, and endive salad: Thinly slice 2 large apples, 1 bulb of fennel, and 3 small endives. Squeeze over half of a lemon and add white balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Add chopped pecans for an additional crunch. More recipes featuring apples: Chicken, Shrimp, and Fruit Salad Roasted Butternut Squash Soup Did You Know? Apple juice and apple cider are different! Cider is produced when raw apples are mashed and pressed to extract the liquid. It is not filtered and sold either pasteurized or unpasteurized. This causes cider to appear cloudy, as it contains pulp and sediment. It is more acidic and contains more flavonoids than apple juice. Apple juice has been filtered to remove solids and pasteurized so that it remains fresher longer. Sugar is sometimes added. During filtration, the tart and bitter flavors from the natural apple flavonoids may be removed, so apple juice typically has a uniform sweet flavor. How do apples get their shape? Apples are among the oldest and most recognizable fruits in the world. But have you ever really considered an apple\u2019s shape? Using theory and experiments, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences show how apples get their distinct spherical shape, and the characteristic dimple at the top where the stem grows.

They are a popular food across many cultures. Perhaps best known as the star ingredient in guacamole, they are versatile and prepared in an array of dishes, or simply eaten plain with a spoon. Although not sweet, avocados are botanically classified as a fruit with a large berry and single center pit, grown from the Persea americana tree. They are believed to have originated in Mexico or Central America, with Mexico being the leading producer worldwide. [1] Their nutrition profile makes them a staple in various healthful meal plans. Avocados are a good source of fiber, and contain more fat (the good kind) than carbohydrate, so are popular on lower-carbohydrate diets such as with diabetes. Their heart-friendly fats do not increase blood cholesterol, which can provide satisfaction on a traditional cholesterol-lowering diet that is often low in fat and cholesterol. It is one the highest-fat plant foods, making it a popular inclusion in vegan and vegetarian diets. The slightly earthy but neutral flavor of avocados works well in sauces, salad dressings, sandwiches, baked goods, salads, and grain dishes to add richness. Source Of Fat (mostly monounsaturated 67%) Fiber (mostly insoluble but also soluble) B vitamins Vitamin C Vitamin E Vitamin K Folate Potassium Magnesium Carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin) A whole medium avocado contains about 240 calories, 13 grams carbohydrate, 3 grams protein, 22 grams fat (15 grams monounsaturated, 4 grams polyunsaturated, 3 grams saturated), 10 grams fiber, and 11 milligrams sodium. Along with their low sodium levels, avocados contain no cholesterol. Avocados and Health Avocados contain several nutrients including carotenoids, monounsaturated fats, potassium, and fiber that have been associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, especially when included as part of a balanced nutritious diet. The nutritional profile of avocados fits well with healthful dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and DASH diets. Published health research on avocados is largely funded by avocado industry groups; the research cited below attempts to include non-industry-funded studies. Cardiovascular disease Type 2 diabetes Eye health Microbiome Purchase Depending on the variety, avocados may be round or pear-shaped, green or black, and small or large. The skin is typically bumpy. The flesh when ripe is smooth and buttery. They are a climacteric fruit, which continues to ripen after harvesting. The Hass avocado is the most common type, available year-round. If you are planning to use an avocado immediately after purchase, choose a ripe one with dark green or almost black skin. It should yield to pressure when squeezed. Avocados with light green skin that are very firm are unripe and will need to sit a few days before eating. If the avocado has dark shriveled skin, dents, or spots of mushy flesh, it may be overripe and unpleasant to eat. Avocado oil is extracted from the flesh of pressed avocados. It can replace other liquid cooking oils and has a very high smoke point of almost 500\u00b0F. Avocado oil is often compared with olive oil because they are both rich in the fatty acid, oleic acid, but avocado oil has a more neutral flavor. [7] It can also be used to make a homemade salad dressing: whisk or blend together \u00bc cup avocado oil, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and 4 teaspoons balsamic or apple cider vinegar; add additional low-sodium spices like black pepper or garlic powder as desired. Storage Avocados are often sold with hard, unripe flesh, which will ripen in 2-3 days. You can leave the fruit at room temperature, or place in direct sunlight to speed ripening. You can also place the avocado sealed in a paper bag with a banana; the ethylene gases in the banana will speed ripening. When ripe, avocados will feel slightly soft when squeezed. The flesh of avocados is infamous for quickly turning brown once exposed to air, called enzymatic browning. Although unappetizing to see, the brown flesh is perfectly edible. Still, there are tips to slow or reduce browning after cutting into an avocado: Cover the flesh with lemon or lime juice. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap or place in a sealed airtight container and store in the refrigerator to reduce oxygen exposure. Store an avocado half with some sliced onion in a sealed airtight container; the sulfur compounds in the onion help preserve the avocado. Prepare Removing an avocado pit isn\u2019t as challenging as you might think. Although a popular method is to stab a knife into the pit of an avocado half and cleanly remove it, this carries the potential danger of stabbing your hand! Instead, place your index and middle finger on the flesh on each side of the pit, placing your thumb behind the avocado on the skin; push into the center with your thumb until the pit pops out. From there, slice, dice, or mash the flesh as desired to be used in recipes. The monounsaturated fat in avocados is stable in high heat and can be used not only in cooking but also in baking. Pureed avocado can be substituted for butter or oil in baking recipes, using a 1:1 ratio (1 cup butter = 1 cup avocado). Serve Here are some ideas to use avocado: Diced and sprinkled into salads, soups, tacos, or whole grains Blended into smoothies to thicken and add richness Mashed as a spread on sandwiches and crackers Mashed onto whole grain breakfast toast, sprinkled with blueberries and ground flaxseeds or hemp seeds Sliced and rolled into maki sushi Cut in half, drizzled with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice, and eaten with a spoon as a snack Did You Know? One serving of a medium avocado (half the fruit) has more potassium than a medium banana, 487 mg potassium versus 422 mg potassium, respectively. A ripe mashed avocado is sometimes used as a facial mask due its high content of hydrating oils and vitamin E.

Consider the term aquatic foods (also called blue foods), which include any animals, plants, and microorganisms that originate in bodies of water. Examples are: Finfish\u2014small pelagic fish (herring, sardines, anchovies), medium pelagic fish (bonito, mahi-mahi), large pelagic fish (tuna, swordfish), salmonids (salmon, trout), carps, cichlids (tilapia), cods (cod, haddock, pollock), and demersal fish (flounder) Crustaceans\u2014crabs, shrimp, krill, prawns, lobster Cephalopods\u2014octopus, squid Mollusks\u2014clams, cockles, sea snails, mussels, scallops Aquatic plants\u2014water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) Algae\u2014seaweed Other aquatic animals\u2014mammals, insects, sea cucumbers Aquatic foods can be farmed or wild-caught, and are sourced from inland waters like lakes, rivers, and wetlands; coastal areas like estuaries, mangroves, or near-shore; and marine or ocean waters. Despite currently being an important contribution to healthy diets for billions of people globally, aquatic foods are often undervalued nutritionally because their diversity tends to be restricted to protein or energy value, or framed as a monolithic category of \u201cseafood or fish.\u201d [1] However, there is broad diversity of aquatic foods produced throughout the world and available during every season. Currently, wild fisheries harvest over 2,370 species and aquaculture growers farm approximately 624 species. [2] Because aquatic foods are so nutrient rich, food technologists have innovated methods to create processed fish products, including fish powders for infants, fish wafers as a snack, and fish chutneys. [1] This page will focus primarily on animal sources of aquatic foods rather than plant sources. Source Of Omega-3 (DHA/EPA) polyunsaturated fatty acids Protein Zinc Iron Magnesium Selenium Iodine Copper Vitamin A Vitamins B6, B12 Vitamin D How do aquatic animals stack up against land-based animals, nutritionally? From abalone to zebra tilapia, the diversity of aquatic foods outsizes the limited variety of land-based animal foods available to most consumers. But how do they compare nutritionally? To explore this question, researchers created the first-ever Aquatic Foods Composition Database, capturing individual nutrient profiles (including minerals, vitamins, and fatty acids) for over 3,750 species. Their analysis found that the top 6 categories of nutrient-rich animal-source foods were all aquatic, with large and small pelagic fish, shellfish, salmonids, carps, and other aquatic mammals ranking higher than land-based foods including beef, lamb, veal, goat, chicken, and pork. [1] Although aquatic mammals are not consumed in the U.S., they can be a culturally and nutritionally important food in subsistence and indigenous populations. SEE THE FULL GRAPHIC COMPARING AQUATIC TO LAND-BASED ANIMAL-SOURCED FOODS Aquatic Foods and Health Certain aquatic animal foods are a major dietary source of two polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (PUFAs)\u2014docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These fatty acids are initially produced by certain types of algae, which are then eaten by aquatic animals so that the fats accumulate in their tissues or organs. Omega-3s are found in all aquatic foods, but particularly in the fatty tissue of oily fish like salmon and mackerel, the liver of lean white fish like cod and halibut, and the blubber or thick layer of fat under the skin of marine animals like seals and whales. Smaller amounts are also found in crustaceans, bivalves, and cephalopods. [3] Supplements of fish oil, algal oil, and krill oil also contain DHA and/or EPA. Much of the research on aquatic foods and human health focuses on these omega-3s. Cardiovascular disease Cognitive health Fetal development Research has also found that swapping red and processed meat with fish and seafood can lower the risk of diseases and premature death. One reason may be differences in types of fat: mostly saturated fat in red meat versus unsaturated fat in seafood. Data from six U.S. cohort studies found that higher intakes of red meat and processed meat were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, whereas fish was not. [17] Research from a large Danish cohort study found that replacing red and/or processed red meat with fish or poultry lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes and early death. [18-19] Consider swapping out red meat in some recipes for seafood: Marinate and bake fish instead of grilling burgers and ribs Try canned tuna or salmon instead of cold cuts in a sandwich Incorporate steamed mussels or canned mackerel or sardines into meals Bake/saut\u00e9 white fish instead of frying a steak Roast or grill salmon instead of beef, lamb, or ham Should I be concerned about contaminants in aquatic foods? Aquatic foods can contain toxins, infectious parasites, or chemical pollutants like heavy metals and organic compounds. Bivalve mollusks feed by filtering large amounts of seawater, which can collect harmful pathogens that cause gastrointestinal problems in sensitive people. Ciguatoxin is an example of a naturally occurring toxic substance found in some tropical fish. Certain species can carry small amounts of neurotoxic compounds like methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is believed that these chemicals can delay brain development in infants and modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [5] Those most at-risk for these exposures are pregnant and nursing women, breast-fed infants, and young children. As concerning as this sounds, it is important to weigh the risk versus benefit. A report from the FAO and WHO Expert Committee outlining the risks and benefits of fish consumption found that the benefits of dietary omega-3s outweighed the risks of mercury exposure in childbearing women. Eating fish during pregnancy lowered the risk of delayed fetal brain development compared with pregnant women who did not eat fish. [20,5] Studies have found dioxins and PCB levels in fish to be typically very low, and small exposures to these compounds in pregnant woman will not harm the fetus. Consider that more than 90% of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come not from aquatic foods but from land-based meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. There is also limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing an association with higher mercury intake (obtained mostly from aquatic foods) and increased cardiovascular disease. The small exposures to mercury may be offset by the several heart-protective nutrients found in fish and other aquatic species. Those who eat aquatic foods very frequently (5 or more servings a week) and vulnerable populations (pregnant/nursing women, infants, and toddlers) may limit intake of species highest in mercury (swordfish, shark, bluefin tuna, yellowfin or ahi tuna, canned white albacore tuna, king mackerel, marlin, golden bass). Good choices are cod, catfish, shellfish, oysters, mussels, shrimp, sardines, and scallops; see the Food and Drug Administration guide for other low-mercury seafood. Also check local advisories on levels of contaminants in freshwater fish from lakes and reservoirs, as these types tend to be higher in mercury and PCBs. If no specific guidelines are available, consume up to 6 ounces a week of fish from local waters but limit eating any other aquatic foods during that week. To minimize risk of harmful pathogens and parasites, cook and store aquatic foods to proper temperatures. See the Food and Drug Administration guidelines on selecting, storing, and serving seafood safely. Another potential risk are harmful alga blooms, or red tides, that can create toxic substances in seafood leading to symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, and skin rashes. The best way to avoid these toxins is to purchase seafood from reputable suppliers that have high standards for quality and safety. The impact of aquatic foods on health in developing countries Currently more than 3.5 billion people around the world are malnourished, with at least half of all children suffering from micronutrient deficiencies in 2019. [1] Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the greatest contributor to worldwide deaths. Aquatic foods may help to improve health by reducing both issues of nutrient deficiencies and CVD rates. Increasing global production and availability of aquatic foods will help reduce their cost by 26% and increase their consumption, which may then reduce consumption of red and processed meats that are associated with diet-related chronic diseases such as CVD. [1] It is also estimated that this shift to aquatic foods may prevent about 166 million micronutrient deficiencies that place people at increased risk for communicable diseases (e.g., bacterial infections, viruses) due to a weakened immune system. Aquatic foods are rich in several vitamins and minerals, protein, and essential polyunsaturated fats and can thus prevent deficiencies in key micronutrients, such as iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, folate, and vitamins A, B12, and D, that have led to 1 million premature deaths annually. [1] LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ROLE OF AQUATIC FOODS TO NOURISH NATIONS For Your Health and The Planet\u2019s Health Modern production of aquatic foods can be split into two different sectors: wild capture and aquaculture. Wild capture production involves harvested wild fish and other aquatic species from the ocean and freshwater sources. Aquaculture is the practice of farming aquatic plants and animals. In general, the production of any animal-based food tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than the production of plant-based foods, with red meat (especially beef and lamb) standing out for its disproportionate impact. However, the production of aquatic foods (through both wild capture and aquaculture) not only produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses less land than red meat production, but many aquatic animal foods also have less environmental impact than poultry production. [21] That said, beyond emissions and land use, it is important to consider where and how aquatic foods are produced, since environmental as well as social and economic impacts can vary widely in both wild capture and aquaculture sectors. [1] The percentage of wild marine fisheries classified as \u201coverfished\u201d has steadily increased over the past few decades. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the fraction of fish stocks that are within \u201cbiologically sustainable\u201d levels decreased from 90% in 1974 to just under 66% in 2017. [2] Beyond the challenges that overfishing presents for food security and human health, commercial fishing at current scales can also contribute to: Habitat destruction from trawling, a fishing method that indiscriminately captures sea creatures with a dragging net on the ocean floor Bycatch and discards \u2013 marine species caught unintentionally while targeting other species and sizes of fish Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing Issues around unfair distribution of trade benefits and food access Aquaculture is emerging to fill gaps in seafood supply from reductions in existing wild fish stocks. Today, aquaculture represents the world\u2019s fastest growing food production industry, based largely in Asia (China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh), Europe (Norway), and increasingly in Africa (Egypt). Despite its promise, aquaculture must be done responsibly. For example, insufficiently regulated aquaculture can result in both environmental stressors\u2014such as freshwater use and nitrogen and phosphorus emissions\u2014as well as negative interactions with wild fishery populations through the spread of disease, overuse of antibiotics, escaped species. [21] In summary, sustainably and equitably achieving the human health benefits of increased aquaculture production will require policies and technologies that minimize impacts on surrounding ecosystems, industries, and communities. [1] Examining the future of aquatic food systems In 2021, a series of scientific studies from the Blue Food Assessment\u2014an international joint initiative including over 100 scientists from more than 25 institutions\u2014found that global demand for aquatic foods is likely to double by 2050, which would be met primarily through increased aquaculture production rather than capture fisheries. In examining how these food systems can deliver healthy diets while being more sustainable, equitable, and resilient, the Assessment\u2019s research highlights the diversity of aquatic foods and potential innovations and improvements in fisheries management to address malnutrition, lower environmental footprints, and support human livelihoods. EXPLORE RESEARCH UPDATES FROM THE BLUE FOODS ASSESSMENT Bottom Line Recipe: Crispy Pan Seared White Fish with Walnut Romesco and Pea Shoot Salad Aquatic foods are a diverse category of nutrient-dense, protein-rich foods that can also be a healthful animal-based alternative when looking to cut down on red meat or other land-sourced animal foods. Misconceptions exist, such as having a strong off-putting odor (fresh fish should not smell!) or higher cost than other animal protein foods, which may deter people from choosing aquatic foods. However, many aquatic foods are a major source of omega-3 fatty acids and various nutrients that are helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, and that are vital for normal fetal development. They can also be delicious and satisfying, and incorporated into many meals like salads, stews, sandwiches, and main courses. Here are some recipes and ideas for cooking with aquatic foods.

Some people consider this iconic golden fruit a healthy choice while others avoid it, after seeing it on Internet lists of \u201c5 Worst Foods.\u201d Unfavorable claims suggest that bananas cause weight gain and constipation. An article from 1917 published in the Journal of the American Medical Association defended the nutritional value of bananas, citing rumored beliefs during that time: \u201cThe banana is a cause of indigestion and a treacherous dietary component\u2026\u201d [1] The scientific name for banana is Musa, from the Musaceae family of flowering tropical plants, which distinctively showcases the banana fruit clustered at the top of the plant. The mild-tasting and disease-resistant Cavendish type is the main variety sold in the U.S. and Europe. Despite some negative attention, bananas are nutritious and may even carry the title of the first \u201csuperfood,\u201d endorsed by the American Medical Association in the early 20th century as a health food for children and a treatment for celiac disease. Source Of Vitamin B6 Fiber Potassium Magnesium Vitamin C Manganese One serving, or one medium ripe banana, provides about 110 calories, 0 gram fat, 1 gram protein, 28 grams carbohydrate, 15 grams sugar (naturally occurring), 3 grams fiber, and 450 mg potassium. Types Banana (Cavendish) \u2013 Sometimes classified as a \u201cdessert banana,\u201d this classic type is mildly sweet when ripe. Choose bananas with green or clear yellow peels without bruising. The ripening process will change the peel from being thick and stiff to thin and more flexible, with brown spots surfacing until the entire peel darkens. For best flavor, wait until the banana is golden yellow with a few brown spots. With continued ripening, the entire peel turns brownish-black and the pulp begins to ferment and soften further while losing sweetness. The following are other banana varieties less commonly available in the U.S. Plantain (Green Banana) \u2013 Larger, starchier, and less-sweet version of Musa that is often used for cooking. When green, the plantain is unripe with a neutral flavor and firm flesh. In certain tropical regions including Central America, Africa, and the Philippines, the plantain is a major source of carbohydrate that is fried, boiled, or baked in a wide variety of dishes. If allowed to mature, the skin will yellow and develop a slightly sweet flavor that may be eaten raw or cooked. Red Banana \u2013 This variety is shorter and plumper than the Cavendish variety with a dark reddish-purple hue. A ripe red banana will be creamy and often sweeter than Cavendish bananas. Lady Finger \u2013 Thinner and slightly shorter than the Cavendish bananas, they are sweeter and eaten raw or as dessert. Bananas and Health Cardiovascular health Digestive health Weight control Do bananas have a high glycemic index? Do bananas cause blood sugar spikes and, if so, can they be included in the diets of those with conditions like type 2 diabetes and prediabetes? Some physicians recommend that patients with diabetes choose foods with a low glycemic index. The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the rise in blood sugar levels after eating a particular food. A GI score of 55 or less is rated as low, meaning that the food will not raise blood sugar significantly. The glycemic load (GL) is a more specific measure that accounts for not only a food\u2019s glycemic index but factors the amount of carbohydrate in one serving of that food. A score of 10 or less is rated as low GL. According to the International Glycemic Index Database, ripe bananas have a low GI of 51, with slightly under-ripe bananas even lower at 42; they have a moderate GL of 13 and 11, respectively. Why is the glycemic load score higher if the glycemic index is low? It may be due to the higher carbohydrate content of bananas (there are 28 grams in one medium banana vs. about 19 grams in a medium apple); this will increase the glycemic load. However, the type of carbohydrate in bananas is classified as resistant starch, which functions similarly to dietary fiber. Resistant starch is not broken down in the small intestine so it causes less glucose to be released into the bloodstream. This produces a lower glycemic index and a greater feeling of satiety as the starch is digested slowly. Storage Store at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Do not refrigerate green bananas as this can disrupt normal ripening. To speed up ripening, store in a brown paper bag or place near ripe fruit, which emits ethylene gas that causes ripening. On the flipside, if you wish to slow ripening, store bananas away from other ripe bananas or fruits. Do not store in plastic bags as this traps excess moisture and may promote rotting. Banana \u201ctrees\u201d or hangers help expose a cluster of bananas to an even amount of oxygen, and promote gradual ripening by preventing excess pressure and moisture from collecting on the bananas at the bottom of the cluster. Fully ripe golden yellow bananas may be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed produce drawer. Refrigeration will preserve the flavor for another week, even if the peels continue to darken. If the banana peel has ripened to a mostly brown color, remove the peel and chop or mash the pulp to include in baked goods or freeze to be added into smoothies. Prepare Slice ripe banana into a fruit salad. Squeeze a bit of acid like apple cider vinegar, orange juice, lime, or lemon onto the bananas to prevent darkening too quickly. Substitute an equal amount of mashed banana for butter for dense baked goods like muffins, quick breads, and cookies. Using banana may cause the product to bake faster, so check for doneness several minutes earlier than usual or reduce the oven temperature by 25\u00b0F. The bananas will also add sweetness, so reduce the amount of added sugar in the recipe by one-quarter to one-half. For a frozen treat, slice a peeled ripe banana in half (in the middle) and insert a popsicle stick or skewer into the flat end. Dip banana into yogurt and coat evenly; sprinkle with nuts, chopped dried fruit, cinnamon, or other favorite toppings and freeze for several hours. For an easy dairy-free ice cream alternative, peel, chop, and freeze two medium bananas. Place into a blender or food processor and add a few tablespoons of liquid (water, dairy or plant milk, or coconut water). Blend until smooth. Add extra liquid if additional creaminess is desired. For a different flavor, add 1-2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder or nut/seed butter, a splash of vanilla extract and cinnamon, or \u00bd cup frozen berries.

In many countries, banana and plantain leaves are recycled as food wrappers, such as to hold tamales and meats. They are also used to cover or wrap various foods while cooking to help seal in flavor. Banana peels contain plant chemicals in the form of antioxidants, and have long been used in traditional and folk medicine as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory to promote wound healing such as for bug bites, minor burns, and sunburns. [4] As a simple home remedy, the inside of the banana peel is pressed on a wound for several minutes.

Sometimes called mini cabbages, they have appeared on \u201cmost hated vegetable\u201d lists due to their potentially bitter flavors caused by sulfur-containing compounds. Overcooking the vegetable, particularly by boiling, will intensify any bitter flavors and unpleasant odors. However, when properly cooked and seasoned, Brussels sprouts offer a natural, nutty sweetness. In the U.S. the majority of Brussels sprouts are grown in California, though they can likely be found at your local farmers markets. They are available throughout the year but peak growing season is in the fall through early spring. Source Of Vitamin C Vitamin K Folate Carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin) Fiber Brussels Sprouts and Health Brussels sprouts fall into the Brassica oleracea family of cruciferous vegetables that also includes broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and collard greens. Cruciferous vegetables contain a sulfur-containing phytochemical called glucosinolate, which is responsible for the distinctive odor and bitter flavor. Cooking and digestion break down glucosinolates into compounds called isothiocyanates that have been researched for their anti-cancer effects, such as protecting cells from DNA damage and preventing new blood vessels from growing in tumor cells.[1-3] However, there is no direct evidence that Brussels sprouts have anti-cancer effects in humans, and some evidence has suggested that they may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.[4] While we wait for further evidence, it makes sense to eat them no more than once per week, varying our diet with the many options of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Make Purchase Brussels sprouts that are bright green with tightly compacted leaves. Yellow or wilted leaves are signs of aging and deterioration. They can last 3 to 5 weeks at a freezing temperature of 32 F, and about 1 to 2 weeks refrigerated. Longer storage may cause discoloration, black spots on the leaves, wilting, and decay.[5] Older Brussels sprouts also tend to produce stronger odors. Rinse Brussels sprouts under cool running water to remove any debris. Slice off the tough bottom stems and remove any outer discolored leaves. Roasted: Halve the Brussels sprouts and arrange cut-side-down in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or in a baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and pinch of salt. Roast in a preheated oven at 400 F until browned on the exterior and tender on the inside. Smaller Brussels sprouts (about 1\u201d in diameter) should be roasted for 18 minutes, while those 1.5\u201d in diameter or larger may take 20-25 minutes. (Learn more about the science behind roasting cruciferous vegetables.) Steamed: Fill the bottom of a pot with 2 inches of water. Cover and bring to a boil. Place cleaned and trimmed Brussels sprouts in a steamer basket and insert into the pot. Turn heat to medium, cover pot, and allow to cook for 6-8 minutes or until just tender. Allow steam to escape by uncovering pot every few minutes to release the strong sulfur compounds. Shaved: Slice Brussels sprouts in half lengthwise. With cut side down, slice into thin rounds and then separate the leaves into shreds with your fingers. These can be used in salads or a quick saut\u00e9 with a little olive oil. Serve Add 1 cup of shaved Brussels sprouts to any salad, soup, or stew. Mix cooked Brussels sprouts with nuts (sliced almonds, walnuts, or pecans) and dried fruit (currants, raisins, or diced apricots). Season cooked Brussels sprouts: Drizzle with olive or sesame oil and a squeeze of lemon juice Sprinkle a finely grated tangy cheese such as Parmesan or Pecorino Drizzle with a combination of \u00bc cup of balsamic vinegar and 1-2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup Garnish with basic, chives, parsley, or thyme Brussels sprout chips: Peel away single leaves of Brussels sprouts and arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil. Drizzle with olive oil and roast at 375 F for 15-20 minutes or until browned and crispy.

Little did we know that those popular ceramic pets sprouting grass \u201chair\u201d were a foretelling of the even greater success their seeds would have in edible form 25 years later. Chia seeds are often referred to as a \u201csuperfood\u201d or functional food\u2014unregulated terms more useful in the marketing sphere than by nutrition experts who understand that there is no magic bullet or replacement for a healthful dietary pattern that relies on a variety of nutritious foods. Functional foods are touted to offer benefits beyond their nutritional value, such as lowering cholesterol or improving gut health. Not only listed as such, chia seeds are also used as a functional ingredient, added to less nutritious items like baked pastries and snacks, to improve their appeal to health-conscious consumers. Health claims about chia seeds include reducing appetite and weight, lowering triglycerides, and improving blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes. Chia seeds come from the plant Salvia hispanica L., and were at one time a major food crop in Mexico and Guatemala. Cultivated as a food source as early as 3500 BC, it was offered to Aztec gods in religious ceremonies. According to industry reports, the chia seed market is projected to reach more than 2 billion USD in sales by 2022. [1] Source Of Polyunsaturated fat, as omega-3 fatty acids Fiber Protein Calcium Phosphorus Zinc Two tablespoons of chia seeds (1 ounce or 28 grams) contain about 140 calories, 4 grams of protein, 11 grams of fiber, 7 grams of unsaturated fat, 18% RDA for calcium, and trace minerals including zinc and copper. They are the richest plant source of omega-3 fatty acids. Chia seeds are a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids that cannot be made by the body. [2] Chia Seeds and Health Chia seeds contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may prevent the development of various chronic diseases. Of particular interest by researchers is chia seeds\u2019 high content of alpha-linolenic (ALA) fatty acids. Sixty percent of the oil in chia seeds is from these omega-3 fatty acids. [2] However, available research has been more favorable towards a diet containing omega-3-rich foods rather than on chia seeds alone. In animal and human studies, omega-3 fatty acids have shown a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health (lowering cholesterol, regulating heart rhythms and blood pressure, preventing blood clots, decreasing inflammation). The fiber in chia seeds is mainly insoluble fiber and mucilage, the substance responsible for the gluey texture of moistened chia seeds that acts as a soluble fiber. [2] These fibers may help to lower LDL cholesterol and slow down digestion, which can prevent blood sugar spikes after eating a meal and promote a feeling of fullness. A large Chinese cohort of more than 63,000 individuals found that those with the highest intakes of omega-3 fatty acids from seafood and plant sources had a 17% reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with those who had the lowest intakes. [3] Few cohort studies include ALA plant sources of omega-3, but these oils are fairly common in the Asian diet. The Nurses\u2019 Health Study found a 40% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death in women who ate the highest amounts of ALA. [4] The Cardiovascular Health Study cohort with more than 5000 men and women, ages 65 years and older, found a 50% lower risk of fatal ischemic heart disease with higher intakes of ALA. [5] Food sources of ALA in these studies included whole grains, cooking oils, legumes, and soy. Animal studies have shown that chia seeds can beneficially affect cholesterol levels, weight loss, and increased satiety. [6] However, literature reviews and controlled trials in humans have not shown a specific benefit of chia seeds on cardiovascular risk factors including body weight, blood pressure, lipid levels, blood sugar, and inflammation. [6-8] These findings affirm that chia seeds do not act alone to benefit human health but may contribute to disease prevention when incorporated as part of a varied plant-rich diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors. Purchase People often wonder if chia seeds should be eaten ground instead of whole. The surface of chia seeds is delicate and easily breaks apart when exposed to moisture, so they are typically prepared with liquid foods (as seen with the recipe ideas below). In this way, they are absorbed and digested well in their whole form, unlike flax seeds. If eating the seeds dry, choosing ground chia seeds may help to improve absorption. Chia seeds last for 4-5 years without refrigeration. Store in a cool, dry spot. Make Chia Gel: Chia seeds absorb water quickly (up to 10 times their weight in liquid!). Place \u00bc cup seeds in 1 cup liquid, stir well, and cover. Allow to sit for about 15-20 minutes until the texture changes to a soft gelatin. Store in refrigerator for up to one week. Add to smoothies and soups to boost nutrient value and create a thicker, more satisfying consistency. Chia Pudding: To make a dessert variation, mix \u00bc cup of seeds with one cup of liquid such as milk (almond, soy, or dairy all work) or 100% fruit juice. Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes refrigerated. Add nuts, chopped fresh fruit, or cinnamon if desired. Chia Sprouts: Place chia seeds in a single layer (use only about a teaspoon to allow enough space to grow) in a terracotta saucer or unglazed clay dish. Spray the seeds with water several times and cover with plastic wrap or a clear glass dish. Put in a sunny spot. Spray morning and evening until green sprouts appear, about 3-7 days. Use these microgreens to garnish salads and sandwiches. Egg Replacer: This may be used to replace whole eggs in baking. For 1 whole egg, mix 1 tablespoon of whole chia seeds or 2 teaspoons ground chia seeds with 3 tablespoons water. Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a raw scrambled egg. Serve Chia seeds are a highly versatile ingredient. They have little if any distinctive flavor, so they don\u2019t compete with other flavors in a dish. They also soften in the presence of liquid and become a less detectable texture. Commercially, they are added to cereals, crackers, beverages, breads, and other baked goods to boost their nutritional value. Basically, chia seeds can be added as long as there is moisture to hold the seed in place. Sprinkle a few teaspoons into breakfast cereal (hot or cold) salads, soups, or stews. Stir into salad dressings, sauces, marinades, or cake/muffin/bread batter. Use chia gel as a thickener added to smoothies, puddings, and soups (stir the gel into these foods after they are prepped or cooked). More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring chia seeds: Quinoa Chia Edamame Veggie Burger Did You Know? Chia seeds come in black and white varieties, but there is no difference in nutritional content. There are a few rare cautions when eating chia seeds. A case report presented at the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting in 2014 made headlines describing a patient who ate dry chia seeds followed by a glass of water. The seeds expanded in the esophagus and caused a blockage. Because they quickly swell after absorbing liquid, it is advised to eat chia seeds that have already been soaked in liquid or are served with a moist food, such as oatmeal or yogurt. Do not eat dry chia seeds by themselves. People who have dysphagia, a condition that causes difficulty in swallowing (as was the case with this patient) or other digestive issues, should eat chia seeds with care.

It is also known by its popular Spanish-derived name, the garbanzo bean. Kidney beans, black beans, lima beans, and peanuts are other familiar foods found in this legume family. These plants produce edible seeds, called pulses, that have high nutritional value. Two main varieties of chickpeas are the larger round light-colored Kabuli-type, common in the United States, and the smaller dark irregularly shaped Desi-type often used in India and the Middle East. Chickpeas appear in early recordings in Turkey about 3500 BCE and in France 6790 BCE. India produces the most chickpeas worldwide but they are grown in more than 50 countries. An excellent source of carbohydrate, protein, fiber, B vitamins, and some minerals, they are a nutritious staple of many diets. Source Of Protein Folate Fiber (both insoluble and soluble) Iron Phosphorus Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids including linoleic and oleic acids Chickpeas and Health Chickpeas and all pulses contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases [1-7] Diabetes: Both dried and canned chickpeas have a low glycemic index and low glycemic load, and contain amylose, a resistant starch that digests slowly. These factors help to prevent sudden surges in blood sugar and insulin levels, which can improve overall blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. [1-3,5-7] Gut Flora: Chickpeas contain a soluble fiber called raffinose, a type of oligosaccharide that is fermented in the colon by beneficial bacteria called Bifidobacterium. As bacteria break down this fiber, a short chain fatty acid called butyrate is produced. Butyrate plays a role in reducing inflammation in the cell wall of the colon, promoting regularity in the intestines, and possibly preventing colorectal cancer by promoting cell apoptosis (death). [1,3,4] Heart Disease: Chickpeas contain a plant sterol called sitosterol that is structurally similar to cholesterol in the body. It interferes with the body\u2019s absorption of cholesterol and thereby can help to lower blood cholesterol levels. The fiber and unsaturated fats in chickpeas may also favorably affect blood lipid levels. [1-3,5-7] Obesity: High fiber foods can help to promote a feeling of fullness and satiety by delaying digestion and adding bulk to meals. The satiating effect of the high fiber and protein content of chickpeas may help with weight management. [1-3,5,7] Make Fresh chickpeas in their pods Chickpeas are widely available dried or canned. Occasionally you may find young, fresh green chickpeas in their pods at farmers\u2019 markets. Dried: Sort through the beans to check for and remove small stones or debris, then place in a strainer and rinse well. To speed up the cooking time, dry beans may be presoaked by covering with water and allowing to sit for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Some people who feel bloated after eating beans may find that presoaked beans are better tolerated, as this reduces the amount of oligosaccharides that are responsible for the uncomfortable side effects. Cook: For 1 cup of dry garbanzo beans, add 3 cups of water or broth. Add to pan and bring to a boil. When boiling, reduce the heat to low-medium and simmer for 60-90 minutes or until desired tenderness. Add more water if the beans do not reach desired tenderness and further cook time is needed. Using presoaked beans will reduce the cook time by 25%. Canned: Place in a strainer, drain, and rinse well. This will remove about 40% of the sodium, or you can purchase low sodium or no-salt-added canned versions. These do not need additional cooking but hold up well when added to cooked or baked dishes. Serve Chickpeas have a nutty buttery flavor and creamy texture that can enhance many recipes. There are various ways to incorporate cooked chickpeas: Add to salads, soups, and stews. Use a food processor or blender to grind into a paste and add to veggie burgers or meatless meatballs. Season and roast for a tasty snack. Blend with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice to make a hummus spread. Mash and use in baking as a replacement for flour. Crunchy roasted chickpeas More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring chickpeas: Crunchy Roasted Chickpeas Hummus Vegetarian Shepherd\u2019s Pie Chickpeas with Spinach and Tomatoes Did You Know? Roasted and ground chickpeas have been used as a caffeine-free alternative to coffee for centuries. The beverage is also available as ready-to-brew commercial brands in some grocery stores. Don\u2019t throw out chickpea liquid, either from canned beans or from cooking the bean! It is called aquafaba, a thick liquid containing a mix of starch and trace amounts of protein, with emulsifying, binding, and thickening properties. It works well as a flavorless, odorless egg replacer in recipes: 1 tablespoon of aquafaba = 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons = 1 egg white, and 3 tablespoons = 1 one whole egg. It can also be whipped to replace the eggs in meringues or mayonnaise. Unlike many canned vegetables, canned chickpeas retain much of their nutritional value and are comparable to dried cooked versions.

Fueling the coconut oil trend, celebrity endorsements have claimed the ingredient to help blast away belly fat, curb appetite, strengthen the immune system, prevent heart disease, and stave off dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A survey found that 72% of Americans rated coconut oil as \u201chealthy,\u201d though only 37% of nutrition experts agreed. [1] Coconut oil is popular in several trending diets including ketogenic and Paleo diets. As consumer demand for plant-based foods increases, coconut oil has become a popular fat choice for its rich flavor with a mild coconut aroma. Source Of Coconut oil is 100% fat, 80-90% of which is saturated fat. This gives it a firm texture at cold or room temperatures. Fat is made up of smaller molecules called fatty acids, and there are several types of saturated fatty acids in coconut oil. The predominant type is lauric acid (47%), with myristic and palmitic acids present in smaller amounts, which have been shown in research to raise harmful LDL levels. Also present in trace amounts are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Coconut oil contains no cholesterol, no fiber, and only traces of vitamins, minerals, and plant sterols. Plant sterols have a chemical structure that mimics blood cholesterol, and may help to block the absorption of cholesterol in the body. However, the amount found in a few tablespoons of coconut oil is too small to produce a beneficial effect. Coconut Oil and Health Many of the health claims for coconut oil refer to research that used a special formulation of coconut oil made of 100% medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), not the commercial coconut oil most available on supermarket shelves. MCTs have a shorter chemical structure than other fats, and so are quickly absorbed and used by the body. After digestion, MCTs travel to the liver where they are immediately used for energy. The theory is that this quickly absorbed form promotes satiety and prevents fat storage. Coconut oil contains mostly lauric acid, which is not an MCT. Lauric acid is absorbed more slowly and metabolized like other long-chain fatty acids. So the health benefits reported from a specially constructed MCT coconut oil that contains medium-chain triglycerides other than lauric acid cannot be applied directly to commercial coconut oils. [2] Although epidemiological studies find that groups of people who include coconut as part of their native diets (e.g., India, Philippines, Polynesia) have low rates of cardiovascular disease, it is important to note that many other characteristics, dietary and other, could be explanatory. Also, the type of coconut they eat is different than what is used in a typical Western diet. These groups do not eat processed coconut oil, but the whole coconut as coconut meat or pressed coconut cream, along with an indigenous diet of foods rich in fiber and low in processed and sugary foods. [2] A literature review on the use of coconut products (oil, milk, flesh, or cream) included 21 observational and clinical studies. [2] The epidemiological studies observed people from Samoa, the Philippines, New Zealand, and New Guinea consuming whole coconut as part of their traditional diets. Overall their diets were similar: coconut flesh and milk, fresh fruit, vegetables, and fish. Studies found that those who ate higher amounts of coconut oil had increased beneficial HDL cholesterol levels but also increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. Eight small short-term clinical trials lasting from 5-8 weeks with a range of 9-83 participants were examined with an intervention of a coconut oil diet. When compared with a butter or unsaturated fat (olive or safflower oil) diet, coconut oil raised total cholesterol, HDL, and harmful LDL levels more than unsaturated oils, but not more than butter. Coconut oil was also found to raise total and LDL cholesterol to a greater or similar degree as other saturated fats like beef fat and palm oil. The authors concluded that because of coconut oil\u2019s effects on raising blood cholesterol including harmful LDL and in some cases triglycerides, and because its cholesterol-raising effects were comparable to other saturated fats, the oil should not be viewed as a heart-healthy food and should be limited in the diet. In a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials, coconut oil was found to increase both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels in participants, compared with nontropical vegetable oils (e.g., sunflower, canola, olive). [3] Coconut oil increased total cholesterol by about 15 points, LDL by 10 points, and HDL by 4 points. Coconut oil also increased these values when compared with another tropical oil, palm oil: total cholesterol increased by about 25 points, LDL by 20 points, and HDL by 3 points. The analysis did not find that coconut oil versus other vegetable oils had any significant effect on body weight, waist circumference, or body fat percentage. The American Heart Association (AHA) issued a scientific advisory statement in 2017 to replace saturated fats (including coconut and other tropical oils) with unsaturated fats. Based on a review of seven controlled trials, coconut oil was found to raise harmful LDL cholesterol levels. The AHA advised against the use of coconut oil, and suggested limiting all saturated fat. For those at risk for or who have heart disease, they advise no more than 6% of total calories from saturated fat, or about 13 grams based on a 2000-calorie diet. One tablespoon of coconut oil comes close to that limit at about 12 grams of saturated fat. [4] Coconut oil contains as many calories and total fat as other fat sources, about 120 calories and 14 grams of fat per tablespoon. Coconut oil has a unique flavor and is best used in small amounts as a periodic alternative to other oils in baking and cooking, in context of a healthy eating pattern. Purchase and Storage Coconut oil is made by pressing fresh coconut meat or dried coconut meat called copra. Virgin coconut oil uses fresh meat, while refined coconut oil typically uses copra. Unlike olive oil, the terms \u201cvirgin\u201d and \u201cextra virgin\u201d are not regulated with coconut oil. There is no difference in products labeled with these terms. Virgin or Extra Virgin (interchangeable terms): If using a \u201cdry\u201d method, the fresh coconut meat of mature coconuts is dried quickly with a small amount of heat, and then pressed with a machine to remove the oil. If using a \u201cwet\u201d method, a machine presses fresh coconut meat to yield milk and oil. The milk is separated from the oil by fermentation, enzymes, or centrifuge machines. The resulting oil has a smoke point of about 350 degrees Fahrenheit (F), which can be used for quick saut\u00e9ing or baking but is not appropriate for very high heat such as deep-frying. You may also see the following terms on labels of coconut oil: Expeller-pressed\u2014A machine presses the oil from coconut flesh, often with the use of steam or heat. Cold-pressed\u2014The oil is pressed without use of heat. The temperature remains below 120 degrees F; this is believed to help retain more nutrients. Refined: The copra is machine-pressed to release the oil. The oil is then steamed or heated to deodorize the oil and \u201cbleached\u201d by filtering through clays to remove impurities and any remaining bacteria. Sometimes chemical solvents such as hexane may be used to extract oil from the copra. The resulting oil has a higher smoke point at about 400-450 degrees F, and is flavorless and odorless. Partially Hydrogenated: The small amount of unsaturated fats in coconut oil is hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated to extend shelf life and help maintain its solid texture in warm temperatures. This process creates trans fats, which should be avoided. Store coconut oil in a cool dark location in a sealed container or in the refrigerator. The shelf life will vary, depending on the type of processing and how it is stored. Refined coconut oil generally lasts for a few months, whereas virgin coconut oil may last for 2-3 years if stored properly away from heat and light. Signs of spoilage include mold, a yellow tint, or \u201coff\u201d odors or flavors. Make Coconut oil has a melting point of 78 degrees F. If the oil liquefies on a very warm day, stir well before using. When substituting coconut oil for butter or vegetable shortening, use 25% less coconut oil than the amount of butter listed in the recipe due to its higher percentage of fat solids. Use refined coconut oil if you do not want a coconut flavor. Saut\u00e9 vegetables in one tablespoon of virgin coconut oil to vary the flavor. Add a tablespoon of virgin coconut oil to sauces and curries to enhance flavor. Did You Know? The Philippines is the greatest worldwide producer of coconut oil. Indonesia and India are the next largest producers. The Philippines, European Union, United States, and India are the greatest consumers of coconut oil. Coconut oil is an effective moisturizer for skin and hair. Using a small amount, gently massage directly into skin. For dry or frizzy hair, apply a small amount to the hair shaft and leave in for desired time (a few minutes to overnight), and then wash out.

At that time, the Maya from Central America, the first connoisseurs of chocolate, drank it as a bitter fermented beverage mixed with spices or wine. Today, the long rows of chocolate squares sitting neatly on your store shelves are the end result of many steps that begin as a cacao pod, larger than the size of your hand. Seeds (or beans) are extracted from the pod and fermented, dried, and roasted into what we recognize as cocoa beans. The shells of the bean are then separated from the meat, or cocoa nibs. The nibs are ground into a liquid called chocolate liquor, and separated from the fatty portion, or cocoa butter. The liquor is further refined to produce the cocoa solids and chocolate that we eat. After removing the nibs, the cocoa bean is ground into cocoa powder that is used in baking or beverages. Dark chocolate contains 50-90% cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, whereas milk chocolate contains anywhere from 10-50% cocoa solids, cocoa butter, milk in some form, and sugar. Though dark chocolate should not contain milk, there may be traces of milk from cross-contamination during processing, as the same machinery is often used to produce milk and dark chocolate. Lower quality chocolates may also add butter fat, vegetable oils, or artificial colors or flavors. White chocolate does not contain any cocoa solids and is made simply of cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. Source Of Iron Copper Magnesium Zinc Phosphorus Flavanols Dark Chocolate and Health Cocoa is rich in plant chemicals called flavanols that may help to protect the heart. Dark chocolate contains up to 2-3 times more flavanol-rich cocoa solids than milk chocolate. Flavanols have been shown to support the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the endolethium (the inner cell lining of blood vessels) that helps to relax the blood vessels and improve blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure. [1,2] Flavanols in chocolate can increase insulin sensitivity in short term studies; in the long run this could reduce risk of diabetes. [3,4] Observational studies support the benefits of cocoa flavanols. The link between blood pressure and high cocoa intake was described in a study of the Kuna Indians, an isolated tribe who live on the Caribbean Coast of Panama. [5] Hypertension was extremely uncommon in this group, even among older ages, and even with a dietary salt intake that is greater than most Western populations. When the Kuna migrated to urban environments and changed their diets, their rates of high blood pressure increased. Notably, their traditional intake of cocoa as a beverage was very high, at more than five cups daily of either home-grown or Colombian cocoa powder rich in flavanols. The urinary levels of flavanols in the island-dwelling Kuna were significantly higher and their rates of death from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes significantly lower than their counterparts living in urban centers. Other observational studies suggest a link between high cocoa or chocolate intake of 6 grams daily (1-2 small squares) and a reduced risk of heart disease and mortality, possibly in part by reducing blood pressure and inflammation. [6,7] Dark chocolate is high in calories (150-170 calories per ounce) and can contribute to weight gain if eaten in excess. However, chocolate, like nuts can induce satiety, so the longer term implications for weight control are not clear. It also contains a moderate amount of saturated fat, which can negatively affect blood lipid levels, though its heart-protective effects from flavanols appear to outweigh the risk. Choosing dark chocolate and eating modest quantities may offer the greatest health benefits. Should I be concerned about heavy metals in dark chocolate? Purchase and Storage Choose 70% dark chocolate or higher to obtain the most flavanols. Though keep in mind that the higher the percentage of cocoa solids, the greater the bitter flavor. Store in a cool dry area (65-70 F) in a tightly sealed container. Do not refrigerate, which can promote the chocolate to \u201cbloom,\u201d a whitish coating caused by sugar rising to the surface due to excess moisture. Bloom does not affect flavor but does not look appealing. If stored properly, dark chocolate will last up to two years. Serve To melt: Dark chocolate should be heated gradually to prevent scorching. This may be done on a stove top on low heat or in a microwave oven on 50% power. Break chocolate into smaller pieces and place in pan or microwave to heat. Stir continually (or after each minute) to ensure even heating. Drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of melted dark chocolate over oatmeal, yogurt, or fresh fruit for an easy healthful snack. Serve a few squares of dark chocolate or chocolate curls with fresh fruit and nuts for an easy elegant dessert. Blend 1-2 tablespoons of unprocessed cocoa with one large frozen banana for a dairy-free version of chocolate ice cream. Because the bitter flavor increases with a higher percentage of cocoa solids, try taking a small piece and allowing it to melt slowly in your mouth. This technique may offer a different, more pleasurable experience than quickly chewing and swallowing the chocolate. Did You Know? Cocoa is sometimes treated with alkali, or Dutch-processed, to improve the flavor and appearance. However this causes a significant loss of flavanols. Natural cocoa, found in the baking aisle, retains the most flavanols. [11] The higher percentage of cocoa solids, the higher the caffeine content. Two ounces of 70% dark chocolate contains about 50-60 mg caffeine. In comparison, an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains 100-200 milligrams of caffeine. If your chocolate has developed bloom, no need to throw it out! You can remove the bloom by melting the chocolate, stirring it well, and then allowing it to slowly cool back into a solid. Chocolate is derived from an intensive process of farming, harvesting, and transport, often employing less expensive labor or child labor overseas. \u201cFair-Trade\u201d labeled chocolate certifies that the chocolate has been manufactured at a fair wage and with the exclusion of child labor.

So what changed? While it\u2019s true that just one large egg yolk has 200 mg of cholesterol\u2014making it one of the richest sources of dietary cholesterol\u2014eggs also contain additional nutrients that may help lower the risk for heart disease. In addition, the moderate amount of fat in an egg, about 5 grams, is mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. It\u2019s also crucial to distinguish between dietary cholesterol and cholesterol in the blood, which are only weakly related. The focus on dietary cholesterol alone was de-emphasized as more attention was placed on the influence of saturated and trans fat on blood cholesterol. Accordingly, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 removed the prior recommendation to limit consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day. [1] Given their history, \u201care eggs healthy?\u201d has become a frequently asked nutrition question. To answer this, it\u2019s important to look at eggs not only on their own, but in context of the entire diet, especially when compared to foods they may replace (and vice-versa). Source Of Cholesterol Protein Choline Biotin \u2013 Vitamin B7 Vitamin A Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin Eggs and Health Research on moderate egg consumption in two large prospective cohort studies (nearly 40,000 men and over 80,000 women) found that up to one egg per day is not associated with increased heart disease risk in healthy individuals. [2] Eggs were previously associated with heart disease risk as a result of their high cholesterol content. However, a solid body of research shows that for most people, cholesterol in food has a smaller effect on blood levels of total cholesterol and harmful LDL cholesterol than does the mix of fats in the diet. [2-4] Of course, this research doesn\u2019t give a green light to daily three-egg omelets. While a 2008 report from the Physicians\u2019 Health Study supports the idea that eating an egg a day is generally safe for the heart, it also suggests that going much beyond that could increase the risk for heart failure later in life. [5] You also need to pay attention to the \u201ctrimmings\u201d that come with your eggs. To your cardiovascular system, scrambled eggs, salsa, and a 100% whole-wheat English muffin is a far different meal than scrambled eggs with cheese, sausages, home fries, and white toast. People who have difficulty controlling their total and LDL cholesterol may also want to be cautious about eating egg yolks and instead choose foods made with egg whites. The same is true for people with diabetes. In studies including the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, heart disease risk was increased among men and women with diabetes who ate one or more eggs a day. [2,4] For people who have diabetes and heart disease, it may be best to limit egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. Furthermore, to truly assess eggs and heart health, we need to examine how they stack-up to foods we might choose in their place\u2014the classic nutrition substitution analysis. Using some common breakfast options as an example: While eggs may be a much better choice than sugary, refined grain-based options like sweetened breakfast cereals, pancakes with syrup, muffins, or bagels, they may fall short of other options. A bowl of steel-cut oats with nuts and berries, for example, will be a much better choice for heart health than an egg-centric breakfast. Consumption of whole grains and fruit predict lower risk of heart disease, and when it comes to protein, plant sources like nuts and seeds are related to lower cardiovascular and overall mortality, especially when compared to red meat or eggs. [6] The bottom line: While eggs may not be the optimal breakfast choice, they are certainly not the worst, falling somewhere in the middle on the spectrum of food choice and heart disease risk. For those looking to eat a healthy diet, keeping intake of eggs moderate to low will be best for most, emphasizing plant-based protein options when possible. Eggs in the news Findings from a recent study may be rekindling the debate about the role of dietary cholesterol and egg consumption in cardiovascular disease, but the results should be viewed in the context of existing research. A CLOSER LOOK AT THE STUDY Storage and Food Safety Food safety is a top priority when handling raw eggs. A contaminated hen can transmit Salmonella inside the egg if the shell has not completely formed. Salmonella can also penetrate egg shells, which have tiny open pores. Look for a sell-by date on egg cartons; eggs will generally last for four to six weeks after this date. Avoid packages with cracked eggs, which can increase risk of bacterial contamination. Discard a cracked egg if you discover one after purchase. Promptly refrigerate eggs in their carton at 40\u00b0F or below, in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Avoid storing in side doors where the temperature varies. Cook eggs until the whites and yolks have solidified, to prevent food-borne illness. Egg dishes should reach an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F. If using recipes for raw or undercooked eggs, use pasteurized eggs that are heat-treated to destroy bacteria. Don\u2019t allow cooked eggs or egg dishes to sit at room temperature for longer than two hours. Wash your hands and any surfaces with soap and water that have come in contact with raw eggs. Free-Range? Farm-Fresh? A look at egg carton labels Prepare and Serve Hardboiled: (Avoid overcooking hardboiled eggs, as evidenced by a green ring around the yolk or egg whites seeping out of the shell.) Place desired amount of eggs in a single layer in a pot. Fill with enough water to cover eggs completely. Bring water to a gentle rolling boil and allow to cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat, cover the pot, and allow eggs to sit in the water for 10-12 minutes. Remove from pot and rinse eggs with cool water. Peel and serve, or store in refrigerator for up to one week. Add chopped hardboiled eggs to salads or eat whole as a snack. Mash 1/4 of an avocado on a slice of whole grain toast. Top with hardboiled egg slices and a sprinkle of black pepper or red pepper flakes. Replace the mayo in an egg salad with a similar quantity of hummus or mashed avocado with a squeeze of lemon and pinch of salt. Easy egg scramble: Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a frying pan on low-medium heat. Add 1 cup finely chopped vegetables of choice (e.g., tomato, bell pepper, onion, garlic, broccoli, baby spinach or arugula, mushroom, zucchini) and stir until vegetables are slightly wilted. Add 2 beaten eggs (or 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites) to mixture and stir gently until eggs solidify. Add a pinch of salt and pepper or a sprinkle of mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. Egg \u201cmuffins:\u201d In a medium bowl, beat 12 whole eggs (or desired equivalent in egg whites; 1 whole egg = 2 egg whites) and set aside. Heat 1-2 teaspoons olive oil in a fry pan on medium heat and stir-fry 1 cup finely chopped vegetables of choice (see above). Divide and add cooked vegetables into a 12-cup muffin tin sprayed with nonstick spray. Pour egg mixture over the vegetables. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin is clean. Allow muffins to cool in pan for a few minutes before removing. Store in refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month. Did You Know? While chicken eggs are the most common variety (especially in the U.S.), eggs from a range of birds\u2014including ducks and quail\u2014are also consumed worldwide. Brown eggs are not more nutritious than white. The color and size of an egg are determined by the breed of hen, which can produce white, cream, brown, blue, green or speckled eggs! The color of the yolk is also not reflective of nutritional value but the type of poultry feed. Eggs vary in available sizes from medium to jumbo, but eggs graded \u201clarge\u201d are the standard size preferred in recipes.

They are a type of legume that is native to Western Asia and North America. Lentils are one of the earliest domesticated crops, seen in the diets of ancient Rome and Egypt. Many countries enjoy lentils as a dietary staple, as they offer an earthy, mild, nutty flavor that works well in various recipes. Canada leads the world\u2019s production of lentils, followed by India. Source Of Protein Folate Fiber (both insoluble and soluble) Iron Potassium Manganese Lentils and Health Lentils are low in sodium and saturated fat, and high in potassium, fiber, folate, and plant chemicals called polyphenols that have antioxidant activity. [1] These nutritional properties have led researchers to study their effects on chronic diseases. Lentils also contain slow-digesting resistant starch that delays the absorption of carbohydrates with blood sugar-lowering effects, as well as being a source of prebiotics that feeds gut flora to help prevent digestive diseases. [1] Animal studies have shown that lentils can lower blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose. [1,2] Human studies have found that lentils may improve cholesterol levels in people with diabetes and may protect against breast cancer in women. [3,4] Learn more about the health-related research on the broader category of legumes. Purchase The most common types of lentils available in the U.S. are green, brown, black, red, yellow, and orange lentils. Within these categories are specific varieties like the green Puy (lentilles du Puy) or French lentils, or the black Beluga lentils. They may be sold as whole lentils or split with the husks removed. Whole lentils with husks intact take longer to cook and will retain their shape; split lentils without husks cook very quickly and break down into a puree. These differences in texture will determine in which recipes they may be used. Lentils are available dried or canned. Storage Dried lentils keep for one year in a tightly sealed container in a dark, dry, cool location. After cooking, lentils will keep for one week in the refrigerator or up to three months in the freezer. Make Before cooking, place the lentils in a strainer and sort through them to check for and remove small stones or debris. Then rinse well. Pre-soaking is not necessary as lentils cook quickly. Combine 3 cups of liquid (water, stock) with 1 cup of clean dry lentils in a medium pot. Bring water to a boil, then cover pan and reduce heat to medium to simmer. Cook until lentils are tender, about 20-30 minutes for whole lentils (typically black, green, brown) and 10-15 minutes for split lentils (typically yellow, red, orange). The total time can be adjusted based on the desired texture. If you desire firmer whole lentils for salads, reduce the cook time; if you desire a softer mushier texture using split lentils, add more time. Split red lentils cook quickly and can break down into a thick pureed texture. They are best used to thicken soups and stews. Whole green and black lentils retain their shape and are an excellent addition to salads and whole grains; they may also be seasoned and served on their own. Canned or vacuum-packed lentils are precooked and ready to add to recipes. Rinse well before using to reduce sodium content. Sprouted lentils are eaten raw and offer a different crunchy texture, but which some people find easier to digest. Serve Lentils are highly versatile. They have a rich, earthy texture and will give any dish a boost of fiber and nutrients. They can add thickness and bulk to a recipe. Because of their hearty texture and protein content, they are sometimes used as an alternative for meat. Here are a few ways to incorporate cooked lentils: Toss into salads or cooked whole grains, or fold into an omelet mixture before cooking. Make a pasta sauce thicker and heartier by adding lentils. Substitute cooked yellow or red lentils for chickpeas in a hummus recipe. Reduce the meat mixture in a recipe such as for chilis, stews, taco and pepper fillings, and replace that amount with lentils to add more bulk and nutrients. Use a food processor or blender to grind lentils into a paste and stir into a veggie burger mixture or meatless meatballs.

Traditional and folk medicine practitioners laud the bell-shaped fungi for their healing and cleansing properties. All varieties of mushrooms are low in calories and fat, and contain modest amounts of fiber and various nutrients. Perhaps the more interesting properties of mushrooms are their non-nutritive plant substances\u2014polysaccharides, indoles, polyphenols, and carotenoids in which cell and animal studies have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. [1] Mushrooms are also recognized by chefs for their ability to create savory rich flavors called umami, thanks to the presence of an amino acid called glutamate, which is also found in meats, fish, cheeses, and simmering soups. Although considered a vegetable, mushrooms are neither a plant nor animal food. They are a type of fungus that contains a substance called ergosterol, similar in structure to cholesterol in animals. Ergosterol can be transformed into vitamin D with exposure to ultraviolet light. Mushrooms vary in appearance with more than 10,000 known types, but generally they are distinguished by a stem, fleshy rounded cap, and gills underneath the cap. China and the U.S. are among the top five producers of mushrooms worldwide. Source Of B vitamins (B2, B3, folate, B5) Phosphorus Vitamin D Selenium Copper Potassium Are mushrooms a good source of vitamin D? The quick answer is maybe. Because mushrooms sold in supermarkets are usually grown in dark, controlled environments indoors, they will contain little if any vitamin D. But some manufacturers expose mushrooms to ultraviolet (UV) light to increase their content of vitamin D, either by natural sunlight or a UV lamp. A substance in mushrooms called ergosterol then produces vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), a form found only found in plants. Vitamin D2 is also added to fortified foods and supplements. The other main form of vitamin D is D3 (cholecalciferol) found in animal foods (egg yolks, oily fish) and supplements. Both will effectively raise blood levels of vitamin D, though D3 may be absorbed slightly better and break down more slowly than D2. [2] The amount of vitamin D mushrooms contain varies widely and depends on how long the mushrooms are exposed to UV light. Estimates show that fresh wild mushrooms like chanterelles and morels can contain up to 1200 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving, whereas mushrooms grown in darkened conditions like white button, shiitake, and oyster contain less than 40 IU. [3] However, button mushrooms that are exposed to sunlight can produce up to 400 IU vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving though the exact amount depends on factors related to their UV exposure such as the time of day, season, latitude, and duration. Mushrooms treated with UV lamps can produce even higher amounts of vitamin D. Even after harvesting, mushrooms can continue to produce vitamin D, whether exposed to UV light from the sun or a lamp. Dried mushrooms also contain the vitamin. Some estimates show dried mushrooms to contain about 600 IU of vitamin D2 per 3.5 ounces if stored in dark, cool, dry conditions for up to 6 months (the vitamin may start to break down after that time). [3] Humidity and cooking mushrooms in water do not appear to affect vitamin D content in mushrooms, but cooking them in fat (such as oils) can cause the vitamin to leach out because it is fat-soluble. Mushrooms and Health Edible mushrooms like maitake and shiitake have also been used as medicine throughout history. Other mushrooms that are too tough to eat have been used solely for medicinal purposes such as reishi. Plant chemicals and components in mushrooms may exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects, but the exact mechanism is still unclear and an area of active research. [4] Animal and cell studies show that mushrooms can stimulate the activity of immune cells, macrophages, and free radicals that can stop the growth and spread of tumor cells and cause existing tumor cells to die. [5] Various polysaccharides in mushrooms including beta-glucans are believed to exert these cancer-fighting properties. [4,6] Cognition Gut health Cardiometabolic diseases and cancer Purchase There are thousands of varieties of mushrooms, with different colors, shapes, and sizes. Because some wild mushrooms can cause stomach upset or allergic reactions, or may even be poisonous, your safest bet is to stick to supermarket varieties and avoid picking and eating raw wild mushrooms on your own. The common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is the most common in the U.S. It is the mildest-tasting mushroom and can be eaten raw or cooked. Other types of mushrooms available for sale include: Chanterelle: the cap is a wavy golden trumpet-like shape Cremini (baby bella): a young Portobello mushroom that is dark and firm Enoki: long, thin white stems with small white caps that are eaten raw or cooked Maitake: a head that resembles flowering leaves Morel: the cap is a spongy dimpled oblong shape Oyster: a fan-shaped delicate cap Porcini: a reddish-brown rounded cap with a thick cylindrical stem Portobello: a large brown thick cap with rich juicy flavor that work well as a meat substitute Shiitake: a dark brown umbrella cap with a thin cream-colored stem Mushrooms that have been specially treated with UV light may carry a label on the front of the package that says \u201cUV-treated\u201d or \u201crich in vitamin D,\u201d or display the exact amount of vitamin D they contain. Is a truffle a mushroom? This pricey delicacy typically reserved for restaurant dishes is a type of fungus that is generally classified as a mushroom, though there are slight differences. Truffles grow underground attached to the roots of trees, whereas mushrooms grow above ground. They don\u2019t have a stem, which is distinctive of other mushrooms, and look like a small brown lumpy potato. Truffles can have a strong flavor and aroma in contrast to the mild earthy or even neutral flavor of mushrooms. Common mushrooms grow year round, while truffles have a short growing season. Some truffles are famously expensive, at thousands of dollars per pound, such as the white truffle that grows about 3 months of the year and is difficult to find underground. Because of their rarity and top price, they may be served sparingly as fresh shavings or infused into sauces, and are often paired with rich cheese and meat dishes. Storage Select mushrooms with firm whole caps with an even texture. They should be refrigerated until use, but ideally within one week. Do not wash or clean them until just before using. Storing in a brown paper bag with the top open will help to absorb moisture and keep them from spoiling, as opposed to tight plastic wrapping that traps moisture. Because they are about 80-90% water, mushrooms do not freeze well, becoming mushy when defrosted. Make Mushrooms are delicate and should be cleaned gently. Either place them under gentle running water to release any dirt or brush dirt off with a dampened paper towel. Cooking mushrooms in high-temperature water such as boiling and microwaving may cause its water-soluble nutrients (B vitamins, potassium) to escape in the cooking water. Saut\u00e9ing quickly over high heat, or simmering over low heat, such as in soups, are ideal cooking methods for preserving nutrients. Add chopped mushrooms into salads, omelets, scrambled eggs, stir-fries, pasta sauces, chilis, or soups. Saut\u00e9 mushrooms in olive oil and add to cooked pasta or whole grains. Grill large portobello mushroom caps. Remove the stems and gills if desired. Marinate the mushrooms for 10 minutes in a favorite sauce. Grill for about 3 minutes each side until they caramelize. Mushrooms make a great replacement for meat because of their umami flavor. Replace about a quarter to a half of the meat in a recipe with chopped mushrooms. What is umami? Umami is considered the fifth basic taste, alongside sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. It is a savory flavor created by glutamates in food, most commonly found in meat, fish, sauces, soups, cooked, tomatoes, cheeses, soy sauce, and fermented foods. Mushrooms are one of the few plants foods that have strong umami flavor. Umami flavors can enhance low-sodium foods, reducing the need for added salt. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a processed form of glutamate and flavor enhancer in soups, Chinese foods, and processed meats. Some people describe temporary symptoms after eating foods high in MSG including headaches, flushing, and even chest pain. However, there is no definitive research to show that MSG causes these symptoms. The best treatment if one consistently experiences these symptoms is to avoid foods with MSG.

Not all mushrooms are edible. Wild mushrooms with white gills or a ring around the stem are considered poisonous. Some other inedible mushrooms look like edible mushrooms, so unless one is trained in recognizing wild mushrooms, it\u2019s best to find your mushrooms at the market!

It may be less recognized as an aquatic food on your dinner plate. But certain types of \u201cseaweed\u201d (the common name for countless species of marine plants and algae) have been consumed globally for centuries and are a staple of East Asian and Pacific cuisines. They are rich in polysaccharides, a type of carbohydrate, that is used by the food industry as a thickener and emulsifier. These polysaccharides also act like dietary fibers and promote gut health as a prebiotic food source for beneficial gut bacteria. Seaweed has been labeled a functional food or nutraceutical because of its disease-preventive components, like polyphenols, carotenoids, and omega-3 fatty acids. Because of this, seaweed or its components are sometimes supplemented to foods to improve their nutritional and antioxidant profile. An example would be adding seaweed polysaccharides to noodles, flour, or biscuits. [1] Yet the evidence from human studies substantiating health claims about seaweed, particularly as a nutraceutical supplement, is still lacking. [2] As the common name suggests, much of our seaweed, called macroalgae, are marine algae harvested from the ocean. Algae and other aquatic plants (such as water spinach, or Ipomoea aquatica) also grow in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. However not all of species of algae are edible, and some may even be toxic. This page primarily focuses on marine algae, of which there are several thousand types classified into three main groups: Brown algae, or Phaeophyceae Kelp \u2013 kombu, wakame Fucus \u2013 hijiki Red algae, Rhodophyceae \u2013 nori or purple laver, dulse, carrageen Green algae, or Chlorophyceae \u2013 sea grapes, sea lettuce, chlorella Source Of Seaweed is low in calories due to its high content of fiber and water, but potentially rich in minerals absorbed from seawater. It also contains an amino acid called glutamic acid, which is converted into glutamate that imparts a rich umami flavor when added to recipes. However, it is important to note the wide variation in nutrient content depending on the species of seaweed, and the location and time of harvest. It may contain: Fiber, soluble and insoluble Polysaccharides Polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (DHA and EPA) Iodine (Laminaria and other brown seaweed) Potassium Iron (Sargassum brown seaweed) Magnesium (Laminaria japonica brown seaweed) Sugar alcohol (mannitol, sorbitol) Phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids) Sodium varies widely: 100 grams or about 1/4 cup raw provides 9 mg in agar, 48 mg in laver, 233 mg in kelp, 872 mg in wakame Does seaweed contain vitamin B12? Nori (purple laver), the dried edible seaweed used to make sushi rolls, is sometimes promoted as a plant source of vitamin B12. [3] It does contain small amounts of active vitamin B12, but the amount varies among types of seaweed, with some containing none. Vitamin content may also vary depending on the region from which it is harvested. Therefore, it is not considered a reliable food source of this vitamin. Seaweed and Health Seaweed is not a major source of dietary protein, especially because it tends to be eaten in small quantities, but also the digestibility of the protein in the gut may be low. Interestingly, even among seaweeds that contain less protein, it is a high-quality protein containing all nine essential amino acids. Seaweed is very low in fat but contains small amounts of polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-3 fatty acids. [4] Seaweed is a good source of various fibers, including polysaccharides, agar, alginate, carrageenan, and cellulose. These fiber types have long been used by the food industry to help improve the texture and stability of processed food products due to their thickening and emulsifying properties. In the human digestive system, they bind to water and reduce speed of digestion, which in the case of most fibers, can help prevent constipation, control blood sugars, and promote satiety and weight loss. [5] Epidemiological research on associations of dietary seaweed and cancer, mainly from Japan, has not shown any clear associations. [6] A large prospective study of Japanese men and women showed that diets including seaweed were associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and deaths from any cause. [7] Research is still in its early stages on the health-promoting properties of seaweed and seaweed components in supplement form, with mostly laboratory and animal studies and small randomized trials. However, larger human trials are needed because it is unclear how well these seaweed components are absorbed and digested in the body. Proposed benefits include Weight control. Some research suggests alginate, a fiber in brown seaweed, suppresses hunger and reduces calorie intake. [8,9] Alginate and beta glucan in seaweed may prevent blood sugar surges and control appetite by slowing digestion. [2] The fermentation of seaweed fibers by bacteria in the colon into short-chain fatty acids is also associated with weight regulation. Prebiotic. Laboratory and animal studies have shown the prebiotic effects of polyphenols and fibers like polysaccharides (fucoidans, alginate, carrageenans) in seaweed. [2,10,11] These fibers are fermented by bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids that support gut health, protect against pathogens, and promote immunity, as well as support the growth of healthful gut bacterial strains. [11] Anticancer. Fucoidan is a polysaccharide found in brown seaweed that is sold in supplement form, labeled by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe). Laboratory studies show that it can slow blood clotting (acting as a blood thinner), lower cholesterol, and may prevent the growth of cancer cells and have immune-boosting effects, but human studies are needed. [1,2] Antioxidant. Plant chemicals called polyphenols are bound to the cell walls of seaweed, which have been shown in some studies to have anticancer and antioxidant effects by protecting the cells from damage. Animal studies have shown that these seaweed polyphenols may also affect the breakdown and absorption of glucose and fats, causing a reduction in total cholesterol and blood glucose. [2] Algal oil: An alternative to fish oil Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat found in some fish and plant foods. They are essential to the body and found in many cell membranes, including the brain and eyes. DHA and EPA are two main forms of omega-3s. Although research shows that food sources of omega-3s are more strongly associated with health benefits than supplements, fish oil supplements are quite popular. A plant-based and environmentally-friendly alternative to fish oil is algal (or algae) oil that also contains omega-3s, mostly DHA. Algal oil is extracted from seaweed and other types of algae. Oily fish like salmon obtain DHA and EPA by eating algae. Some research has shown that the health benefit of algal oil supplements may be comparable to fish oil supplements. [12,13] The unsaturated fats in algal oil supplements are susceptible to oxidation and spoilage, so they should be stored in a cool dark area and used by the expiration date. Potential adverse effects Seaweed is sometimes labeled a \u201csuperfood,\u201d rich in plant chemicals and minerals, increasing the chance that people may want to consume it daily or even several times a day. Processed seaweed products like seaweed chips are growing in popularity as a low-calorie alternative to potato chips. But there are safety concerns when overeating seaweed, mainly due to a high concentration of trace minerals and heavy metals in certain types: Iodine. Seaweed, especially kombu, is one of the richest food sources of iodine, a trace element that the body needs in small amounts. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iodine in adults is 150 micrograms daily, and the tolerable upper limit is 1,100 micrograms. One serving of dried nori, about 10 grams of dry weight, contains 232 micrograms of iodine (155% of the RDA). A serving of processed seaweed chips (about 5 grams) contains about 80 micrograms of iodine. In comparison, the average intake of seaweed in Japan is about 10 grams a day. [6] Excessive intakes can sometimes lower the production of thyroid hormones and lead to a condition called hypothyroidism. However, because iodine content varies so widely among seaweeds, it is difficult to provide accurate dietary guidance on seaweed intake and thyroid health. Studies have found that regular intake of seaweed (several servings a week) can increase blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, which is a risk factor for hypothyroidism. [14] Generally, high iodine intakes do not cause health problems in most healthy people, but certain groups may be more sensitive to excessive iodine and should limit their intake of seaweed products. These include people with existing thyroid disorders, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (excess production of thyroid hormones), school-aged children, and infants. [15] Heavy metals. Both fresh and dried seaweed may contain heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium, or lead, depending on the habitat from which they were sourced. [16] Seaweed absorbs these metals when growing in contaminated areas, such as from industry or poor sewage systems. Consuming these seaweeds in small or infrequent amounts carries low risk to human health, but a regular or high intake may increase risk. Some seaweeds contain inorganic arsenic, which is considered toxic and poses health risks; it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, and an increased incidence of lung, skin, and bladder cancers. [2,6] However, the type of arsenic in most seaweeds is called arsenosugars, which is not the inorganic type though its health effects are unclear. A few seaweed types contain high amounts of inorganic arsenic like Laminaria digitate (a tough inedible brown species) and hijiki. Hijiki is commonly sold in Japanese restaurants and supermarkets as an ingredient in soups, salads, and appetizers. There is no documented evidence of health problems from arsenic intake in hijiki; however, health organizations from some countries including the United Kingdom and Australia have recommended avoiding hijiki. [17,18] It is also included on California\u2019s Proposition 65 list of foods that contain chemicals found to cause cancer or birth defects. If hijiki is a concern to you, check the ingredients list on food labels of seaweed products (or contact the manufacturer if the type is not specified) and ask restaurants if hijiki is used in their seaweed dishes. Low-arsenic seaweed types that are safe to eat include wakame, kombu, and nori. Seaweed supplements may also contain these heavy metals, as they are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to consumers. The type and location of harvest of seaweed extracts used in the supplements is not required information to be disclosed by supplement companies, nor is it known if these industries conduct thorough analysis of their nutrient and metal concentrations. [5] Other effects. Other potential side effects when eating seaweed include a laxative effect or irritation of the digestive tract in sensitive individuals. This is more commonly seen when people eat seaweed in large amounts or very frequently. Is carrageenan safe to eat? Purchase Various types of seaweed are sold dried in Asian food markets and online. Nori (used in sushi) is the most recognized type in the U.S. and is available in many supermarkets. Fresh seaweed from oceans, rivers, and lakes can be polluted with heavy metals or other contaminants in the water that are not necessarily removed when washing or cooking the seaweed. Therefore, if you are looking to harvest your own fresh seaweed, it is advisable to research the water source and learn about any local water quality testing guidelines. Storage Keep dried seaweed in an airtight container in a dark dry spot. It can last for years and may still taste good after the \u201cbest buy\u201d date, but exposure to light, humidity, and oxygen can reduce nutrient content, texture, and flavor. Do not store dried seaweed in the refrigerator because of the higher humidity. It can last many months in a freezer if packed in an airtight container. Make Dried seaweed can be softened by soaking in warm water for a few minutes. Seaweed does not need to be cooked before eating. It can be added to salads or hot dishes like soups and casseroles. Many seaweed types are a source of umami flavor from its high glutamate content. It is often added to soups (such as dashi broths), stews, and sauces to create a richer, deeper flavor. The following are common types and uses: Nori \u2013 Roasted, dried, and pressed into sheets. Eaten dry, it is used to wrap sushi rolls, added to stir-frys, or crumbled into soups. It is also popular as seaweed chips or snacks. Hijiki \u2013 Dried into small twigs, it is added to stir-fries and stews. It may also be rehydrated in water and added to salads or eaten on its own. Hijiki may contain high levels of inorganic arsenic, so low to moderate consumption is advised. Wakame \u2013 This type is rehydrated into a bright green color, often used in seaweed salads and miso soups. Dulse \u2013 Has a distinctive reddish color. Sold as dried leaves, flakes, or a powder. It can be crisped by toasting in a pan or frying in oil, creating a taste that mimics bacon. It rehydrates quickly in water and may be added to soups or noodle dishes. The powdered form is used as a seasoning for soups, meats, and fish. Kelp \u2013 Dried and sold as flakes, this can be sprinkled into cold or hot dishes as a seasoning. Kelp is also sold raw as low-carbohydrate \u201cnoodles.\u201d Kombu \u2013 A type of kelp known for its salty umami flavors that is used to make dashi, an Asian soup base. It is sold dried or pickled. Kombu, like most kelp, may contain very high amounts of iodine, so should be eaten in moderation. Arame \u2013 The long brown strands are rehydrated and eaten as is or added to salads and stir-fried meals. Did You Know? Most edible seaweed today is obtained through seaweed farming, which uses saltwater tanks or farming plots in the sea, rather than harvesting wild from the ocean.

Although they are often found on holiday tables covered in marshmallows or mixed with added sweeteners, there\u2019s no need! True to their name, sweet potatoes have a naturally sweet flavor, which is further enhanced through cooking methods like roasting. They are also one of the top sources of beta-carotene\u2014a precursor to vitamin A. Unlike a potato (edible tubers of the nightshade family), the sweet \u201cpotato\u201d is a large edible root within the morning glory family. They\u2019re also different from yams, which are edible tubers within the lily family and native to Africa and Asia. Chances are the \u201cyams\u201d found in your local supermarket are actually a variety of sweet potato. True yams are distinguishable by their blackish/brown, bark-like skin and white or purple-toned flesh. Source Of Vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene Vitamin B6 Vitamin C Potassium Fiber Sweet Potatoes and Health Sweet potatoes with orange flesh are richest in beta-carotene. Sweet potatoes with purple flesh are richer in anthocyanins. Beta-carotene and anthocyanins are naturally occurring plant \u201cphyto\u201d chemicals that give vegetables their bright colors. These phytochemicals are researched for their potential role in human health and disease prevention. If swapping sweet potatoes for white potatoes, you\u2019ll still want to go easy on the portions: Though sweet potatoes are a rich source of beta carotene, they have a high glycemic index and glycemic load\u2014almost as high as that of a white potato. Most people don\u2019t eat sweet potatoes in the same over-sized quantities as they do white potatoes, which is perhaps why research studies haven\u2019t found sweet potatoes to be a major culprit for weight gain and diabetes. Make Store sweet potatoes in a cool, dry place. They are more perishable than you might think, so it is best to use them within a week of purchase. Before cooking, scrub the skins well as these are edible and nutritious. Pierce the potato with a fork 4-5 times, which allows steam to escape. If cooking in an oven, place on a lined baking sheet in a preheated oven to 400 F. Bake for 45-60 minutes or until flesh is tender. Allow potatoes to cool a few minutes before slicing. If microwaving, place on a microwave-safe dish and heat on high 8-10 minutes. Turn potatoes bottom side up halfway through cooking to ensure even heating. Allow potatoes to cool a few minutes before slicing. If boiling on the stove, peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Rinse well in a colander. Transfer potatoes to a pot and add water until cubes are completely covered. On medium-high heat, cover the pot and let potatoes simmer until tender, usually about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and season as desired. Serve Add cooked, diced sweet potatoes to soups or salads. For a quick meal, slice a baked sweet potato in half and top with cooked beans, broccoli, and feta cheese or Greek yogurt. For mashed sweet potatoes: Use a fork, masher, or blender to puree the cooked potatoes. Add liquid such as water, broth, or milk if a smoother consistency is desired. Season with a dash of salt, pepper, spices, or herbs as desired. For roasted sweet potato wedges: Wash and cut a medium sweet potato into wedges. Coat with olive oil and spread in a single layer on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and herbs or spices if desired. Bake at 375 F for 25-35 minutes or until the insides are tender and the outsides are crisp.

In addition to the root, sweet potato leaves and shoots are also edible and commonly eaten in some countries. Boiling sweet potatoes retains more beta-carotene and makes the nutrient more absorbable than other cooking methods such as baking or frying. Up to 92% of the nutrient can be retained by limiting the cook time, such as boiling in a pot with a tightly covered lid for 20 minutes. Cooking with the skin on further helps to minimize leaching of nutrients including beta-carotene and vitamin C.

The word vinegar derives from the French \u201cvin aigre,\u201d or sour wine. It has been traced back to 5000 B.C.E. in Babylon, not just for cooking but as a medicine, a preservative, and a drink to boost strength and promote wellness. Legend describes vinegar\u2019s discovery when a forgotten wine was left in storage for several months, causing it to ferment and turn sour. Vinegar is a combination of acetic acid and water made by a two-step fermentation process. First, yeast feed on the sugar or starch of any liquid from a plant food such as fruits, whole grains, potatoes, or rice. This liquid ferments into alcohol. The alcohol is then exposed to oxygen and the acetic acid bacteria Acetobacter to ferment again over weeks or months, forming vinegar. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires vinegar to contain at least 4% acetic acid, but may range up to 8% in commonly used vinegars. Although acetic acid is responsible for the tart and pungent flavors and odors we recognize, vinegar also contains trace vitamins, mineral salts, amino acids, and polyphenolic compounds [1]. Flavors range from sour to savory to sweet. Some vinegars, such as balsamic, can be left to ferment up to 25 years. Vinegars and Health Early records from China, the Middle East, and Greece describe vinegar for medicinal purposes: as a digestive aid, an antibacterial balm to dress wounds, and treatment for cough. Today, vinegar is often touted as an all-purpose treatment for everything from minor ailments to chronic diseases. To be clear, existing scientific research does not support the use of vinegar as an effective treatment for any of these conditions. However, some animal studies and small human studies have suggested a health benefit from vinegar, which has fueled its popularity in mainstream media. Below we take a look at some of the most popular health claims associated with vinegar, and review the limited research behind them. Nutrients Vinegar is low in calories and nutrients. Depending on the type, one tablespoon of vinegar contains anywhere from 2 to 15 calories. The lowest calorie versions like distilled vinegar have no nutrient value; others contain trace amounts of nutrients. Because most vinegars are free of sodium and sugar, they are an ideal ingredient to flavor foods on restricted diets. However, not all are calorie-free. Some vinegars are a blend of grape juice and wine vinegar, sometimes with added sugar, so it is important to read the nutrition facts label and ingredients list to know exactly what you are getting. How To Use The acidity or sourness of vinegar brightens the flavor of food and adds balance to a rich dish. It is found in popular kitchen staples like salad dressings, marinades, sauces, mayonnaise, and ketchup. Vinegar can change the texture of foods. It breaks down the chemical structure of protein, such as when used as a marinade to tenderize meats and fish. Vinegar can also be used to make cottage cheese by adding it to milk. The acid in vinegar separates the milk\u2019s solid curds from the liquid whey. Quick-Pickled Beets and Fennel Vinegar may be used to pickle food, a preservation method that extends the shelf life of perishable foods by killing bacteria. Pickling involves soaking a food in a brine solution made from vinegar, water, salt, and sugar, which also changes the food\u2019s flavor. There are several types of vinegars available. Specialty vinegars may have added herbs like basil, clove, or cinnamon, or are sweetened with fruit juices. The following are common types and how they are used: White Distilled: Made by fermentation of a distilled alcohol, which often originates from fermented grains. Note that the role of grains is only indirect in their use to make alcohol, which is then distilled to produce a water solution of nearly pure ethyl alcohol, followed by fermentation into a solution of nearly pure acetic acid (in water). This process accounts for the lack of savory, aromatic flavors found in wine vinegars. The resulting acidity is ideal for pickling because it does not alter the color of fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s also a popular inexpensive choice for cleaning. Balsamic: Made from fermented grape must (whole pressed grapes). This thick dark brown vinegar may taste a little sweeter and mellow in comparison with other vinegars. It can be used in salad dressings and marinades, or simmered into a thick sauce called a \u201creduction\u201d to be drizzled onto fruit or ice cream. Rice: Made from fermented rice. Not too acidic with a milder, sweeter flavor. Used for dishes with Asian flavors like sushi, pickled vegetables, and stir-frys. Wine: Made from red or white wine. Has an acidic and sharp flavor that varies with the type of wine used. Used in marinades and salad dressings, and for cooking meat and fish. Apple Cider: Made from the liquid of crushed apples. Lower acidity than other types with a faint apple flavor. Used for salads, salad dressings, marinades, and sweeter dishes. Malt: Made from fermented un-hopped beer. Has a strong acidic flavor that is selected for sauces or dips. With so many varieties, try gifting a new flavor experience to someone on your holiday gift list. Flavored: A vinegar base (usually wine vinegar) that is infused with fruit purees or herbs like rosemary or sage to create unique flavors for vinaigrette dressings and marinades.

After cooking, the next most popular use for vinegar\u2014particularly white vinegar\u2014is cleaning. While the 5% acetic acid in vinegar is strong enough to kill some household pathogens, it does not kill them all (e.g., salmonella) and is not recommended as a replacement for commercial disinfectants. [1] However, distilled white vinegar is an inexpensive, nontoxic \u201cgreen\u201d product that may be useful for certain household chores. It appears to work particularly well on removing mineral deposits and soap scum, such as in sinks, drains, and shower stalls.

Sometimes displayed as seasonal table decorations, they are best appreciated when featured as a star ingredient in a wide range of recipes. Compared to their summertime cousins, winter squashes have a denser texture and flavor with firm flesh that holds up well in hearty soups, stews, casseroles, breads, and desserts. For the quickest enjoyment, the flesh may be scooped and eaten straight from its shell after cooking. Their seeds are also edible and nutritious. The most common varieties found in supermarkets include butternut, delicata, spaghetti, kabocha, hubbard, acorn, sweet dumpling, and sugar pumpkins (these are firmer, sweeter, and less stringy than the larger carving pumpkins). Source Of Carotenoids: beta carotene (a precursor to vitamin A), lutein, zeaxanthin Protein Vitamin C Vitamin B6 Fiber Magnesium Potassium Winter Squash and Health Generally, a diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar which can help keep appetite in check. And while several nutrients in squash like the carotenoids, vitamin C, polysaccharide fibers, and minerals such as potassium and magnesium have been researched individually for their role in health and chronic disease prevention, there is a lack of epidemiological studies or controlled trials looking at specific health benefits of winter squash. Historically, winter squash has been used in some cultures as a medicinal plant to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, and inflammation. [1] Diabetes: Squash is a dense, filling food despite being fairly low in calories (45-90 calories per cup cooked, depending on type) with a low glycemic index and load. Butternut squash, for example, has almost half the amount of carbohydrate of a sweet potato. Squash also contains polysaccharides, a type of indigestible fiber that can prevent blood sugar from rising after eating, as shown in animal studies. The protein and unsaturated oils from the seeds may also have a moderating effect on blood sugar. [1] Cancer: Certain compounds in squash like beta-carotene and lutein are classified as flavonoids that may help to protect human cells from the damaging effects of oxygen. Flavonoids have been researched extensively for their possible role in affecting or inhibiting cancer cell growth. [2] Heart health: Winter squash is rich in potassium (about 500 mg in 1 cup of cooked butternut or acorn squash), which can help to counteract the deleterious effects of sodium on blood pressure. Decreased cholesterol was observed when giving pumpkin polysaccharides to healthy and diabetic mice. [1] Select Choose squash that has a firm exterior and no soft spots, or cracks. Unlike some fruits that develop a softer exterior as they ripen, the rind of winter squashes becomes even firmer as they mature. The skin should be matte and hard to pierce with your fingernail, not shiny and soft, which would indicate an unripe squash. A squash with soft areas, or a moldy stem is well past its prime. You can also use the tap test. Knock on the skin with your knuckle: if it sounds hollow, it is ripe; if it sounds dull, the squash may either be unripe or spoiled. If you have purchased an unripe squash, place in a warm sunny spot. Plenty of sunlight is key for the squash to ripen. If it is mature and ripe, store the squash in a cool dark area in your kitchen but do not refrigerate. Although some squash may last several months in the right storage conditions, it is recommended to use them within one month for best flavor. Prepare If you are new to cooking squash and feel the thick surface, you might wonder \u201cHow do I get into it?\u201d The hard rinds of winter squash allow them to be stored for up to several months, but they also present a challenge when attempting to safely slice with a knife. Rinse winter squash under cold running water before cutting. Use a vegetable brush if needed to remove any debris. After drying, you have a few options depending on the type: A vegetable peeler is a good tool to remove the skin from butternut squash or sugar pumpkins, but microwaving first can make it easier. Pierce the skin of the squash in several places with a knife. Microwave the squash for about 3-4 minutes (or longer if a very large squash). This helps to soften the skin for more effortless peeling. Eat the skins of thin-skinned squash like delicata. Slice in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop, and roast. Or you may slice into smaller strips before cooking. If you wish to use the squash as a \u201cbowl\u201d but the skin is too thick to easily slice in half, such as with acorn or spaghetti squash, make a few knife slits around the squash. Microwave for about 5 minutes, cool, and then slice in half. It is now ready for cooking. Make Squash is versatile and retains its flavor whether roasting, boiling, steaming, microwaving, or simmering in a stew. Dry heat as with roasting helps to caramelize the natural sugars in the squash. The dense textures of all squash types will add heartiness with whatever cooking method is used. Choose from the following options: Shape: Whole, halved into two \u201cbowls\u201d and stuffed, long slices, cubes, smaller dice, or mashed. Cooking Method: Roast: After softening the skin using the microwave method above, slice squash in half, remove the seeds and stringy material, and place cut-side up on baking sheet. Rub with oil and season with herbs and spices as desired. Flip the squash cut-side down and roast in a 400 F preheated oven for 25-45 minutes (depending on the size) or until flesh is fork tender. The skin should be soft and make an indent if you press your finger into it. Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes before handling. If cooking whole, place washed squash on ungreased baking sheet and insert a few knife pricks throughout. Roast for 45-60 minutes, depending on size, at 350 F or until skin is very tender and easy to prick with a fork. Cool for a few minutes and then cut squash in half carefully, as steam may escape. Remove seeds with a spoon or scoop. Boiled: Remove the skin from the squash and cut in half. Remove the seeds and stringy material (save these to roast separately later or to make a stock). Cut the squash into 1-inch chunks and place in a large saucepan, adding enough water to cover the squash. Bring to a gentle boil, cover, and simmer until the flesh is desired tenderness, about 10-15 minutes. To steam, follow the above directions but place squash in a steamer basket. Microwaved: Remove the skin and cut in half, removing the seeds. Place on microwave-safe plate cut-side down and heat on high for 5-10 minutes depending on size, or until tender. Let stand for a few minutes before handling. Stewed: Remove the skin and seeds and slice into uniform small chunks. Mix into soups, stews, or casseroles at the beginning of the cooking time. Serve: Mashed: After removing the seeds and skin of a cooked squash, mash or puree the flesh with 1-3 tablespoons of oil (more if a larger squash) and a pinch of salt or spices as desired (try ground cumin, chili powder, black pepper, coriander, oregano, sage, ginger, or cinnamon). Stuffed: Prepare a \u201cstuffing\u201d by mixing together any cooked grain (e.g., brown rice, quinoa, farro, bulgur), chopped nuts, dried fruit, and herbs. Using the roasting cooking method above with two squash halves, first make a small cut on the bottom of each half (to make a sturdy flat surface) and then roast the squash. Halfway through the cook time, remove the squash from the oven and fill the center of each half with stuffing. Continue cooking until squash flesh is tender. Spaghetti: After roasting spaghetti squash, allow to cool for a few minutes. Using a fork, scrape the flesh repeatedly to create noodles. Place noodles into a bowl and toss with your favorite pasta sauce, or mix with a drizzle of olive oil and chopped herbs. Burgers: Use a food processor or wooden spoon to roughly mash the squash and then add as a filling to veggie burgers or meatless meatballs. Butternut Squash Soup Tip: Cooked squash freezes and reheats well, so prepare extra squash to freeze for another day and another recipe! More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring winter squash: Roasted Squash with Pomegranate Butternut Squash Soup Did You Know? Squash seeds make a delicious snack. Wash and dry the seeds with a paper towel. Don\u2019t worry about removing all the stringy material as these will shrivel when roasted. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzle with oil; mix the oil into the seeds with your hands to coat well. Sprinkle a pinch of salt or any other herbs or seasonings desired (if you prefer sweeter, try cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, or nutmeg). Roast at 275-300 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until seeds start to brown. It is preferred to cook seeds at a lower temperature in order to prevent the breakdown of the unsaturated fats. Which squash skins can you eat? All winter squash skin is technically edible but the thinner the skin, the more pleasant the texture is, such as with delicata, acorn, and sweet dumpling. Thicker skins are usually too tough to chew and enjoy, so they might be saved instead to make a vegetable stock. Winter squash is technically classified as a fruit, but for culinary purposes is treated like a vegetable.

That isn\u2019t the case for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also called omega-3 fats and n-3 fats). These are essential fats\u2014the body can\u2019t make them from scratch but must get them from food. Foods high in omega-3 include certain fish and seafood, some vegetable oils, nuts (especially walnuts), flax seeds, and leafy vegetables. What makes omega-3 fats special? They are needed to build cell membranes throughout the body and affect the function of the cell receptors in these membranes. They also provide the starting point for making hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of artery walls, and inflammation. In addition, they can bind to receptors in cells that regulate genetic function. Due to these effects, omega-3 fats can help prevent heart disease and stroke, may help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis, and may play protective roles in cancer and other conditions. [1] Types of Omega-3s There are two main types of omega-3 fats that have essential roles in human health: EPA and DHA: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) come mainly from cold-water fish, so they are sometimes called marine omega-3s. Salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines contain high amounts of EPA/DHA. EPA and DHA can be made from another omega-3 fat called alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), so they are more accurately termed \u201cconditionally essential\u201d fats. But because the conversion from ALA to EPA/DHA may not be sufficiently efficient, EPA/DHA are best obtained directly from food sources. ALA: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the most common omega-3 fatty acid in most Western diets, is found in plant oils (especially canola, soybean, flax), nuts (especially walnuts), chia and flax seeds, leafy vegetables, and some animal fats, especially from grass-fed animals. ALA is a true essential fat because it cannot be made by the body, and is needed for normal human growth and development. It can be converted into EPA and DHA, but the conversion rate is limited so we are still uncertain whether ALA alone can provide optimal intakes of omega-3 fatty acids. [1] Omega-3 Fats and Health The strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of omega-3 fats has to do with heart disease. These fats appear to help the heart beat at a steady clip and not veer into a dangerous or potentially fatal erratic rhythm. [2] Such arrhythmias cause most of the 500,000-plus cardiac deaths that occur each year in the United States. Omega-3 fats also lower blood pressure and heart rate, and improve blood vessel function. At higher doses, they lower triglycerides and may ease inflammation, which plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. [2] Given the wide-ranging importance of marine omega-3 fatty acids, it is important to eat fish or other seafood 1-2 times a week, particularly fatty (dark meat) fish that is richer in EPA and DHA. [3] This is especially important for women who are pregnant or hoping to become pregnant and nursing mothers. From the third trimester until the second year of life, a developing child needs a steady supply of DHA to form the brain and other parts of the nervous system as DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain. Many women shy away from eating fish because of concerns that mercury and other possible contaminants might harm their babies, [4] yet the evidence for harm from lack of omega-3 fats is far more consistent, and a balance of benefit vs. risk is easily obtained by limiting intake of the types of fish higher in mercury. (To learn more about the controversy over contaminants in fatty fish, read Fish: Friend or Foe.) Researchers are also looking at the effects of marine and plant omega-3 fats on prostate cancer. Results from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and others show that men whose diets are rich in EPA and DHA (mainly from fish and seafood) are less likely to develop advanced prostate cancer than those with low intakes of EPA and DHA. [5] At the same time, some studies show an increase in prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer among men with high intakes of ALA (mainly from supplements). However, this effect is inconsistent. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, for example, there was no link between ALA intake and early, late, or advanced prostate cancer. [6] Also, in a recent analysis, ALA intake was not associated with higher risk of prostate cancer after about 2005. [7] This is consistent with concerns that partial hydrogenation of ALA in vegetable oils was responsible for the increase in prostate cancer; partial hydrogenation was greatly reduced after 2005 as part of efforts to reduce consumption of trans fats. Unlike EPA/DHA, there is much less research on the health benefits of ALA. Though part of the health benefits of ALA may be attributed to its conversion to EPA/DHA, ALA alone may offer modest protection against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [8] However, more observational studies and clinical trials are needed. ALA is an important source of omega-3 fats for those who have a fish allergy or who eat a vegan diet. Can\u2019t I just take a fish oil pill? Is grass-fed beef a good source of omega-3 fats? The Omega-3 to Omega-6 Ratio: Separating Claims from the Evidence Most Americans take in far more of another essential fat\u2014omega-6 fats\u2014than they do omega-3 fats. Like omega-3 fats, omega-6 fats are a critical part of the structure of every cell of our body and are building blocks for hormones that regulate inflammation, narrowing of blood vessels, and blood clotting. Normally, these are important functions that protect the body from injury and infection, but a popular claim is that an excess intake of omega-6 fats can over-stimulate these functions, causing more harm than benefit. In addition, because omega-3 and omega-6 fats compete for the same enzymes to produce other fatty acids, it is believed that eating an excess of one type may interfere with the metabolism of the other, thereby reducing its beneficial effects. [15] Some researchers have proposed that a higher intake of omega-6 fats compared with omega-3 fats (also referred to as the omega-6/omega-3 ratio) could contribute to the development of chronic health conditions, like cardiovascular disease and cancer, but this has not been supported by evidence in humans. [1,16] Very consistently, carefully controlled feeding studies do not show that omega-6 fats increase inflammatory factors. [17] Many studies and trials in humans support cardiovascular benefit of omega-6 fats. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats wasn\u2019t linked with heart disease risk because both of these fats were beneficial. [18] In a large prospective study of men and women who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at the start of the study, the highest intakes of omega-6 fats were more strongly linked with lower death rates from these diseases than intakes of omega-3 fats. [19] There is no question that many Americans could benefit from increasing their intake of omega-3 fats, but there is also evidence that omega-6 fats reduce cardiovascular risk factors and heart disease. Thus, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio is not a useful indicator of the healthfulness of a food or diet. Like many essential nutrients, it is possible that too much can cause problems. However in the U.S. diet, we have not been able to find individuals or groups who are consuming excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids. What is conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)? This is a type of omega-6 fat found naturally in dairy, beef, and vegetable oils. It is also a popular dietary supplement, produced by chemically changing the structure of polyunsaturated vegetable oils. CLA supplements have been researched as a weight loss aid by reducing body fat; however findings have conflicted. Some studies show a modest short-term weight loss while others show no weight changes. Some reported negative side effects include loose stools and fatty liver that may occur when taken in high dosages in supplements.

The global pre-workout supplement market size alone was estimated to reach $13.98 billion in 2020 and almost double in size to $23.77 billion by 2027. [2] Fitness gurus and blogs touting these products as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, and explosive muscle growth in combination with complicated scientific-sounding names and labels might have you believing you can\u2019t effectively exercise without them. But do these supplements live up to the hype, and are they even necessary\u2014or in some cases, safe? Like other dietary supplements in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not review workout supplements for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to consumers. It\u2019s a good idea to research their effects and ingredients and consult with your physician before adding them to your fitness routine. What happens to the body during physical activity? When we exercise, our bodies use three main sources of fuel: carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Carbohydrates, which are stored in the liver and skeletal muscles in the form of glycogen, provide the most efficient source of energy during exercise. Glycogen can be easily metabolized into glucose, which provides immediate energy to fuel the brain, nervous system, and muscles during exercise. The body\u2019s glycogen supply can provide enough fuel for 90\u2013120 minutes of vigorous activity. The depletion of glycogen stores in the body creates the feeling of \u201chitting a wall\u201d during exercise. As glycogen stores are depleted, the body begins to break down fat to burn for fuel, especially during low- to moderate-intensity activity. In the latest stages of prolonged exercise when glycogen stores are at their lowest, the body begins to break down skeletal muscle protein for glucose production. Physical activity can also induce muscle growth, also known as hypertrophy. Weight lifting and other resistance training exercises are commonly used to increase skeletal muscle mass, but cardiovascular exercise like running can also spur muscle growth. Physical activity causes structural damage to muscle fibers, especially when muscles are challenged with multiple repetitions of heavy weights. The body\u2019s repair response involves fusing broken muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands, which in turn increases muscle size. A variety of factors influence how rapidly muscles grow with exercise, including the amount of weight lifted and the number of repetitions. LEARN MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Here we review the scientific evidence behind some of the most popular ingredients in workout supplements. Pre-Workout Supplements Pre-workout supplements are designed to provide energy and aid endurance throughout a workout. They are typically taken 15-30 minutes before a workout, but can also be consumed during exercise. Below are common ingredients found in pre-workout supplements that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have highlighted as having evidence-based uses in sports nutrition. [3] These supplements have also been categorized as apparently safe and having strong evidence to support efficacy by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. [4] However, it is important to consult a physician or dietitian before using these supplements, as they are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness. Beta-Alanine Beta-alanine is an amino acid that is produced in the liver and also found in fish, poultry, and meat. When dosed at 4\u20136g/day for 2\u20134 weeks, this supplement has been shown to improve exercise performance, particularly for high-intensity exercise lasting 1\u20134 minutes, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or short sprints. It has also been shown to reduce neuromuscular fatigue, particularly in older adults. [5] How does it work? During exercise the body breaks down glucose into lactic acid, which is then converted into lactate. This produces hydrogen ions, which lower muscle pH levels. This acidity reduces muscles\u2019 ability to contract, causing fatigue. [6] Beta-alanine increases muscle concentrations of carnosine, which is a proton buffer that reduces muscle acidity during high-intensity exercise, which in turn reduces overall fatigue. [5] This supplement is often combined with sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which also reduces muscle acidity. A common side effect of beta-alanine supplementation is paresthesia, or a skin tingling sensation, [3] but this effect can be attenuated by taking lower doses (1.6g) or using a sustained-release instead of a rapid-release formula. [5] In short, this supplement can help you exercise at high-intensity for a longer period of time, which could potentially lead to increased muscle mass. The International Society of Sports Nutrition has asserted that \u201cbeta-alanine supplementation currently appears to be safe in healthy populations at recommended doses,\u201d but it is important to consult with your doctor before beginning supplementation. Caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that is often included in pre-workout supplements, as it has been shown to benefit athletic performance for short-term high intensity exercise and endurance-based activities. [7] It is important to understand that these studies have been conducted with Olympic and competition athletes, and thus the average individual who exercises recreationally should consult with a doctor before using caffeine as a supplement. For high performance athletes, the International Olympic Committee recommends 3\u20136mg caffeine/kg of body weight consumed an hour before exercise. [7,8] Evidence also suggests that lower caffeine doses (up to 3mg/kg body weight, ~200 mg) taken before and during prolonged exercise can increase athletic performance. [9,10] Mechanistically, caffeine increases endorphin release, improves neuromuscular function, vigilance, and alertness, and reduces perception of exertion during exercise. [10,11] Despite some benefits from smaller doses, larger doses of caffeine (>=9mg/kg of body weight) have not been shown to increase performance, and may induce nausea, anxiety, and insomnia. [11] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers 400 milligrams of caffeine to be a safe amount for daily consumption, but some pre-workout supplements may exceed this amount in a single serving or fail to disclose the amount of caffeine they contain, so it is important to always review the label of any supplement before consumption. Caffeine powder is also marketed as a stand-alone pre-workout supplement, but the FDA has advised against using this product, as even very small amounts may cause accidental overdose. Powdered caffeine has been linked to numerous deaths\u2014a single tablespoon (10 grams) is a lethal dose for an adult, but the product is often sold in 100-gram packages. [12] Creatine Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in skeletal muscle that is synthesized in the body from amino acids and can be obtained from red meat and seafood. In the body, it helps produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for muscles. Creatine is a popular workout supplement marketed to increase athletic performance, especially for weight training. Research suggests that creatine supplementation increases muscle availability of creatine, which in turn can enhance exercise capacity and training adaptations in adolescents, younger adults, and older adults. [13] Specifically, these adaptations allow for individuals to increase training volume (e.g., the ability to perform more repetitions with the same weight), which in turn can lead to greater increases in lean mass and muscular strength and power. [14-16] Although the exact mechanisms through which creatine improves performance have not been identified with certainty, various theories have been investigated, including the potential for creatine to stimulate muscle glycogen levels. [17,14] Creatine supplementation is primarily recommended for athletes who engage in power/strength exercises (e.g., weight lifting), or for athletes who engage in sports involving intermittent sprints and other brief repeated high-intensity exercises (e.g., soccer, basketball). [13] The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends an initial dosage of 5g of creatine monohydrate (~0.3g/kg body weight) four times daily for 5\u20137 days to increase muscle creatine stores; once muscle creatine stores are fully saturated, stores can be maintained by ingesting 3\u20135 g/day. [13] Many powdered creatine supplements recommend this regimen in the directions on their packages. The Society also notes that an alternative supplementation protocol is to ingest 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days. [13] While the scientific literature has generally found supplementation to be safe at these levels, [18] creatine may not be appropriate for people with kidney disease or those with bipolar disorder. It is important to consult a doctor before taking this supplement. Of note, creatine supplementation has been shown to increase total body water, which causes weight gain that could be detrimental to performance in which body mass is a factor, such as running. [14] The International Society of Sports Nutrition, the American Dietetic Association, and the American College of Sports Medicine have all published statements supporting creatine supplementation as an effective way of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training for high-performance athletes. [19-21;3] Post-Workout Supplements A variety of post-workout supplements are marketed to consumers to increase muscle mass through enhanced muscle repair, recovery, and growth. Below is a review of some of the most common ingredients in post-workout supplements. Carbohydrates Replenishing glycogen stores after a workout with sufficient carbohydrate intake is important for muscle recovery, and beginning the next workout with sufficient muscle glycogen stores has been shown to improve exercise performance. [22-24] However, normal dietary intake is typically sufficient to restore muscle glycogen stores after low-intensity exercises, such as walking, yoga, or tai chi (3\u20135 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day), and even for moderate-intensity exercise, such as one hour or more of walking, jogging, swimming, or bicycling at modest effort (5\u20137 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day). [24] Post-workout supplementation with carbohydrates and protein within 24\u201336 hours is only recommended following strenuous physical activity, which includes one hour or more of vigorous exercise such as interval training, running, swimming, bicycling, soccer, or basketball at a moderate to intense effort (where one can only carry on brief conversations or cannot speak); in this case, 6\u201312 g carbohydrates/kg body weight per day is recommended to be consumed after exercise to fully restore muscle glycogen stores. [24] Protein Recommended levels of daily protein intake for the general population (0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight, or about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight) are estimated to be sufficient to meet the needs of nearly all healthy adults. [25] Recommendations for protein supplementation during exercise vary based on the type of exercise being conducted: endurance training (e.g., long-distance bicycling) or resistance training (e.g., weight lifting). Very few studies have investigated the effects of prolonged protein supplementation on endurance exercise performance. A review conducted by the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that protein supplementation in the presence of adequate carbohydrate intake does not appear to improve endurance performance, but may reduce markers of muscle damage and feelings of soreness. [26] On the other hand, individuals who engage in high-intensity resistance training may benefit from increased protein consumption to optimize muscle protein synthesis required for muscle recovery and growth, but research is inconclusive, with the majority of studies investigating the effects of protein supplementation on maximal strength enhancement finding no benefit. [26] The extent to which protein supplementation may aid resistance athletes is highly contingent on a variety of factors, including intensity and duration of training, individual age, dietary energy intake, and quality of protein intake. For individuals engaging in strenuous exercise to build and maintain muscle mass, the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends an overall daily protein intake of 1.4\u20132.0 g/kg of body weight/day. [26] This can be ingested in the form of protein foods or protein powder. Spotlight on protein powder Powdered protein can come from a variety of sources, including eggs, milk (e.g., casein, whey), and plants (e.g., soybeans, peas, hemp). [27] Some protein powders contain protein from multiple sources; for instance, a vegan option might include protein derived from peas, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and alfalfa. Protein powders are dietary supplements and are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness. They can often contain non-protein ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, thickeners, added sugars, non-caloric sweeteners, and artificial flavoring. If you choose to consume protein powder, it is important to read the nutrition and ingredient labels beforehand so you know what you\u2019re buying. Some sources of protein supplements: Casein and whey are proteins found in cow\u2019s milk; roughly 80% of milk proteins are casein, while the other ~20% are whey. [28] Both proteins should be avoided by people who have trouble digesting dairy. Casein and whey contain all essential amino acids and are easily absorbed by the body, but their speed of absorption differs. [29,30] Whey protein is water soluble and rapidly metabolized into amino acids. Casein, on the other hand, is not soluble in water and is digested more slowly than whey\u2014when ingested, it forms a clotted gel in the stomach that provides a sustained slow release of amino acids into the bloodstream over several hours. [31] Studies examining protein supplementation for resistance training suggest that whey\u2019s faster digestion could be beneficial for gains in skeletal muscle mass compared to casein in both young men and in trained bodybuilders. [32,33] Another study, however, found that both proteins resulted in increased amino acid concentrations in the body compared to a placebo, with no significant differences between casein and whey for amino acid uptake or muscle protein balance. [34] Due to casein\u2019s slower rate of absorption, it is often touted on health blogs as being useful for weight loss because it could hypothetically promote fullness, especially if ingested before periods of fasting, such as before bed. However, multiple studies have found no clear evidence that casein is more effective than any other protein source for satiety or weight loss. [35,36] Soy protein powder is derived from soybeans, and unlike many plant-based proteins, it contains adequate levels of all essential amino acids. It is a common alternative to milk protein for vegans or people with dairy sensitivities or allergies. Soy protein is absorbed fairly rapidly by the body, although it is not as bioavailable as animal-based proteins. One study found that soy protein promoted muscle protein synthesis significantly more than casein protein when consumed by healthy young men at rest and after leg resistance exercise, but that soy protein was inferior to whey protein in increasing muscle protein synthesis. [32] A review of studies on milk- and soy-based protein supplementation also found that whey protein was better able to support muscle protein synthesis compared to soy protein in younger and older adults. [37] Pea protein powder is made from yellow split peas, and can be an option for vegans or people with allergies or sensitivities to soy or dairy. Pea protein is rich in eight of the nine essential amino acids; it is low in methionine, which can be obtained from other sources including rice and animal proteins. There is limited research on the effects of pea protein. One double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study found that men aged 18 to 35 years who ingested 50 grams of pea protein daily in combination with a resistance training program over 12 weeks experienced similar increases in muscle thickness compared to those who ingested the same amount of whey protein daily. [38] However, all participants experienced similar increases in muscle strength, with no significant difference between those who supplemented with pea protein, whey protein, or a placebo. Hemp protein powder is derived from the seeds of the hemp plant. Although there is little research on the use of hemp protein powder as a workout supplement, it contains omega-3 fatty acids and a number of essential amino acids. However, it is not a complete protein, as it has relatively low levels of lysine and leucine. [39,40] Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) Three out of the nine essential amino acids have a chemical structure involving a side-chain with a \u201cbranch\u201d, or a central carbon atom bound to three or more carbon atoms. These three amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). They can be obtained from protein-rich foods such as chicken, red meat, fish, and eggs, and are also sold as dietary supplements in powdered form. BCAAs are key components of muscle protein synthesis, [41] and research has shown that leucine in particular drives protein synthesis and suppresses protein breakdown. [42-43] Although short-term mechanistic data suggests that leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, [44] longer-term trials do not support BCAAs as useful workout supplements. For example, a trial of leucine supplementation during an 8-week resistance training program did not result in increased muscle mass or strength among participants. [45] Studies have generally failed to find performance-enhancing effects of BCAAs such as accelerated repair of muscle damage after exercise. [46] Another reason to be cautious of a high intake of BCAAs is its potentially negative effect on glucose metabolism and diabetes. BCAAs, particularly leucine, can disrupt the normal action of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose. In an epidemiological study composed of three large cohorts of men and women followed for up to 32 years, a higher intake of BCAAs (obtained mainly from meats) was associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [47] Chocolate Milk Although you may not think of it as a \u201csupplement,\u201d a number of pro athletes have begun to promote chocolate milk as an ideal post-workout beverage due to its combination of protein, carbohydrates, water, and electrolytes (in the form of sodium and calcium). A review of the effects of chocolate milk on post-exercise recovery found that chocolate milk provided similar or superior results compared to water or other sports drinks, [48] while another review found that low-fat chocolate milk was an effective supplement to spur protein synthesis and glycogen regeneration. [49] However, the authors noted that evidence is limited and high-quality clinical trials with larger sample sizes are warranted. Of note, many studies of chocolate milk as a post-workout supplement are sponsored by the dairy industry, which may introduce bias. Chocolate milk generally contains high amounts of added sugars and saturated fat, and is likely most useful for athletes conducting high-intensity exercise for multiple hours a day, such as professional swimmers competing in the Olympics. However, for most individuals conducting moderate-intensity physical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling, water is a healthier alternative as a post-workout beverage. Electrolytes Many supplements include electrolytes, which are chemicals that conduct electricity when mixed with water, and include sodium, potassium, and calcium. Electrolytes are important for hydration and the regulation of nerve and muscle function; for example, calcium, sodium, and potassium all work together to help muscles contract properly. The body loses electrolytes through sweating, so sports drinks (which typically contain carbohydrates/sugar and electrolytes) and other electrolyte supplements are often marketed as being necessary after a workout. However, the American College of Sports Medicine has asserted that there is little evidence of any difference in performance between those who drink beverages containing carbohydrates and electrolytes compared to those who drink plain water after exercising for less than one hour. [50] Sports drinks and other electrolyte supplements are generally only appropriate for people exercising vigorously for more than an hour, especially if causes them to sweat heavily. Learn more about sports drinks here. Bottom Line Workout supplements such as caffeine and creatine may be used to enhance exercise performance for high-intensity, strenuous physical activity, such as training to run a marathon or power lifting. However, a healthy diet with adequate amounts of healthy carbohydrates, protein, and water is sufficient to fuel the body for moderate amounts of physical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling. As workout supplements are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness, you should consult with a doctor before incorporating them into your exercise routine and discuss if there are any potential contraindications if you have existing medical conditions.

You may have also heard that eating a lot of red meat\u2014especially processed meats\u2014may be linked to certain cancers. Now, new research suggests a possible connection between high-heat meat cooking and type 2 diabetes. The study, published in Diabetes Care by researchers from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition, found that frequent use of high-heat cooking methods (such as broiling, barbecuing/grilling, and roasting) to prepare beef and chicken increased the risk of type 2 diabetes. [1] Based on data from three large cohorts followed for 12 to 16 years\u2014including more than 289,000 men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study\u2014researchers found that participants who most frequently ate meats and chicken cooked at high temperatures were 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those who ate the least. There was also an increased risk of weight gain and developing obesity in the frequent users of high-temperature cooking methods, which may have contributed to the development of diabetes. Of note, this research demonstrated that cooking methods might contribute to diabetes risk beyond the effects of meat consumption alone. Other key highlights from the study: Participants who ate red meat and chicken that were cooked to a well-done or charred level showed a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those who ate meat and chicken that were lightly browned. There was no association found between broiling fish and type 2 diabetes risk, although the authors noted that there were fewer data available overall on cooking methods for fish intake, so the smaller number of people may have made it difficult to see an association. Information was also not available on cooking methods of other meats like lamb and pork. According to the authors, the exact mechanisms contributing to the increased risk are not known, but they cite the potential role of harmful chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and nitrosamines (from nitrates and nitrites added to meats as a preservative) formed during high-heat cooking. These chemicals may spur an inflammatory response, interfere with the normal production of insulin, or promote insulin resistance in which the body cannot use insulin properly to regulate blood sugar levels. It has been established that a high intake of red and especially processed meats can increase the risk of conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, certain cancers, and early death. Possible reasons include the presence of heme iron, a type of iron found in all animal foods, and the processing of meats (e.g., curing, smoking), both of which may promote the formation of cancer-causing compounds during high-heat cooking methods. This study found that certain cooking methods\u2014regardless of how much meat was eaten\u2014increased disease risk; and chicken as well as red meat cooked at high temperatures increased risk. Those who have or are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes who eat meat, chicken, and fish regularly may choose cooking methods that use lower temperatures, or brief periods of high heat, such as with slow cookers, baking, sous-vide, boiling, steaming, stewing, and stir-frying, while avoiding high-heat and open-flame methods like grilling, barbecuing, broiling, and roasting. \u201cOur research suggests that not only the amount and types of meat but also the cooking methods can make a difference in diabetes risk,\u201d said Gang Liu, a Research Fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition and lead author of the study. \u201cTo lower diabetes risk, it is important to reduce red and processed meat consumption, which can be replaced by other protein sources such as chicken, fish, and plant-protein foods. This study further suggests that when cooking meats, chicken, or fish, it may be better to avoid high-temperature cooking methods including grilling or barbecuing, and instead choose moderate-temperature cooking methods such as stir-frying, saut\u00e9ing, boiling, or steaming.\u201d Related Preventing Diabetes Grilling, high-temperature cooking linked with high blood pressure [Harvard Chan News] A Healthy Summertime Picnic References Liu G, Zong G, Wu K, Hu Y, Li Y, Willett WC, Eisenberg DM, Hu FB, Sun Q.

Chan School of Public Health Degrees & Programs Admissions Faculty & Research Open Primary Navigation Home / News / Substituting healthy plant proteins for red meat lowers risk for heart disease Food, Nutrition, Diet Substituting healthy plant proteins for red meat lowers risk for heart disease By Staff Writer April 9, 2019 Share Post Study is first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to look at health effects of red meat in diet by swapping it for other types of foods For immediate release: April 9, 2019 Boston, MA \u2013 Diets that replaced red meat with healthy plant proteins led to decreases in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), according to a new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Purdue University. The study is the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the health effects of red meat by substituting it for other specific types of foods. The study was published in the journal Circulation. \u201cPrevious findings from randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of red meat on cardiovascular disease risk factors have been inconsistent. But our new study, which makes specific comparisons between diets high in red meat versus diets high in other types of foods, shows that substituting red meat with high-quality protein sources lead to more favorable changes in cardiovascular risk factors,\u201d said Marta Guasch-Ferr\u00e9, research scientist in the Department of Nutrition and lead author of the study. The study included data from 36 randomized controlled trials involving 1,803 participants. The researchers compared people who ate diets with red meat with people who ate more of other types of foods (i.e. chicken, fish, carbohydrates, or plant proteins such as legumes, soy, or nuts), looking at blood concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and blood pressure\u2014all risk factors for CVD. The study found that when diets with red meat were compared with all other types of diets combined, there were no significant differences in total cholesterol, lipoproteins, or blood pressure, although diets higher in red meat did lead to higher triglyceride concentrations than the comparison diets. However, researchers found that diets higher in high-quality plant protein sources such as legumes, soy, and nuts resulted in lower levels of both total and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat. The results are consistent with long-term epidemiologic studies showing lower risks of heart attacks when nuts and other plant sources of protein are compared to red meat, the authors said. The findings also suggest that the inconsistencies found in prior studies regarding the effects of red meat on cardiovascular risk factors may be due, in part, to the composition of the comparison diet. They recommended that future studies take specific comparisons into account. \u201cAsking \u2018Is red meat good or bad?\u2019 is useless,\u201d said Meir Stampfer, professor of epidemiology and nutrition and senior author of the study. \u201cIt has to be \u2018Compared to what?\u2019 If you replace burgers with cookies or fries, you don\u2019t get healthier. But if you replace red meat with healthy plant protein sources, like nuts and beans, you get a health benefit.\u201d The authors recommended adherence to healthy vegetarian and Mediterranean-style diets, both for their health benefits and to promote environmental sustainability.

Conclusions were primarily based on the evidence for colorectal cancer. Data also showed positive associations between processed meat consumption and stomach cancer, and between red meat consumption and pancreatic and prostate cancer. Meat processing such as curing (e.g. by adding nitrates or nitrites) or smoking can lead to the formation of potentially cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals such as N-nitroso-compounds (NOC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Meat also contains heme iron, which can facilitate production of carcinogenic NOCs. Cooking \u2013 especially high-temperature cooking including cooking meats over a flame (e.g., pan-frying, grilling, barbecuing) \u2013 can also produce carcinogenic chemicals, including heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) and PAHs. To help further explain the report findings we spoke with Kana Wu, a member of the IARC Monograph Working Group for this report and a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The IARC Working Group said red meat is \u201cprobably\u201d carcinogenic, but several studies showed no clear association. Can you explain why it\u2019s probably carcinogenic? In large population studies, but not all of them, greater red meat consumption has been associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer. Although these studies were not entirely consistent, results of laboratory studies led the IARC working group to conclude that red meat is probably carcinogenic. Some reports in the media, particularly those from the meat industry, promote red meat consumption as part of a healthy and balanced diet. Is this true? While it is true that red meat has nutritional value \u2013 it is rich in protein, minerals and vitamins (e.g., vitamin B12) \u2013 many studies have also shown that high consumption of red meat can increase the risk of colorectal cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, and may lead to higher risk of dying of those diseases (when compared to other good sources of protein, such as poultry, fish or legumes). Thus, much evidence suggests that an optimally healthy diet would be low in red meat. The IARC/WHO classified processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen, the same category as tobacco smoking and asbestos. Some media reports have indicated that eating bacon or hot dogs is as bad as smoking. Is this true? It has been known for a while that high consumption of red or processed meat can adversely affect health, including raising risk of colorectal cancers and some other cancers. So the conclusions drawn by the IARC Working Group are consistent with what we already know. However, the way the media has reacted to last week\u2019s IARC/WHO announcement has created a lot of confusion and this requires clarification: IARC/WHO does not assess the size of risk The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) used clearly defined guidelines to identify hazards (qualitative evaluation), i.e. whether an agent can cause cancer, but IARC does not assess level or the magnitude of risk (quantitative assessment). In other words, the IARC/WHO evaluates the evidence not risk. As stated by the Director of IARC Christopher Wild, \u201cThe IARC evaluations are important in enabling governments and international regulatory agencies to conduct risk assessments, in order to balance the risks and benefits of eating red meat and processed meat and to provide the best possible dietary recommendations.\u201d As an example, the US Dietary Guidelines Committee issued a review of diet and health earlier this year; among the conclusions was that consumption of red meat should be low for both human and planet health. Smoking vs. high consumption of processed meat Even though smoking is in the same category as processed meat (Group 1 carcinogen), the magnitude or level of risk associated with smoking is considerably higher (e.g., for lung cancer about 20 fold or 2000% increased risk) from those associated with processed meat \u2013 an analysis of data from 10 studies, cited in the IARC report showed an 18 percent increased risk in colorectal cancer per 50g processed meat increase per day. To put this in perspective, according to the Global Disease Burden Project 2012, over 34,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to high processed meat intake vs. 1 million deaths per year attributable to tobacco smoke. High consumption of red or processed meat also increases risk of other chronic diseases and mortality It is important to keep in mind that the above estimates pertain to cancer deaths only. It is well known that besides increasing the risk of some cancers, high red and processed meat intake can also increase risk of other chronic and potentially life threatening diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke and type II diabetes compared to other protein sources such as poultry, legumes and fish. Our group at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School and others have also found higher rates of total mortality with higher intake of red or processed meat. In fact, according to 2013 data from the Global Burden of Disease Project, the number of total deaths (including deaths from cardiovascular disease or diabetes and colorectal cancers) attributable to a diet high in processed meat was 644,000. Some people purchase \u201cnitrate-free\u201d processed meats, a fairly new food trend. Could that help make processed meat less carcinogenic? So-called \u201cnitrate-free\u201d processed meats are often preserved with celery juice, a plant rich in nitrate. The source of nitrate added for meat preservation will likely not matter. Furthermore, processed meats can also contain other carcinogenic compounds such as PAHs which can be formed during smoking of meat (e.g. salami). Processed meats, particularly those containing red meat also contain heme iron, which can enhance the formation of carcinogenic compounds (NOCs) in the body. Until we know more about the exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between processed meat and cancers, it is best to treat those nitrate-free processed meats the same as any other processed meats and limit intake. How about chicken or turkey hot dogs, or turkey bacon \u2013 are those safer to eat than bacon or hot dogs containing red meats such as beef or pork? Chicken and turkey hot dogs and turkey bacon may also contain preservatives such as nitrates. However, those meats contain less heme iron than processed meats made from red meats. A good alternative is to replace red or processed meat with unprocessed, fresh chicken or turkey, which is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals. Also to be considered are nuts, peanuts, soy, and legumes, such as hummus. Are processed meats made from so-called \u201corganic\u201d meats safer? Processed meats made from so-called \u201corganic meats\u201d are generally treated with natural nitrate such as celery juice or smoked as well. At this point there is insufficient data to conclude whether those meats are safer than the \u201cnon-organic\u201d meats. The media has reported that 50g/day consumption of processed meat can risk for colorectal cancer from an average 5 percent lifetime risk to 6 percent. This does not sound like much of an increase in risk. 50g processed meat is equivalent to about 6 slices of bacon or one hot dog. The 5 percent to 6 percent increase in risk of colorectal cancer reported in the media is a population average, but this estimate does not take into account that for certain subgroups (e.g., those who are also obese, are physically inactive or consume diets high in sugar, saturated fat etc., or are more genetically susceptible) the absolute risk can be higher. As mentioned above, high consumption of red and processed meat is associated with higher risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, not just colorectal cancers and high processed meat consumption is estimated to account for about 644,000 deaths worldwide. Thus, in making dietary choices, it is important to consider all the consequences, not just risk of one disease. Are there any specific types of processed meats that should be avoided more than others? IARC evaluated consumption of total processed meat, not one specific type of meat, because data relating specific subtypes of processed and red meat to risk of cancers are currently limited. Therefore, it is not yet possible to draw a conclusion on whether specific types of meats are safer. Overall, it is best to limit consumption of any processed meat. I heard that red meat production can affect the environment, is this true? Dr. Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition and Chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, recently addressed this topic. How much red or processed meat, if any, can I eat? What do you recommend? Studies have shown that the higher the intake of processed meat, the higher the risk of colorectal cancers and other chronic diseases (dose-response). This does not mean you have to cut out all red and processed meats from your diet. In our Healthy Eating Plate we suggest avoiding processed meat and consuming red meat occasionally at most. Ideally, we should be thinking of red meat as we do lobster, having it for a special occasion if we like it. This is how red meat is consumed in many traditional eating cultures, such as the Mediterranean diet. Other organizations have also recommended limiting consumption of red meat for better health, including the American Heart Association, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Cancer Society. For example, the WCRF recommends to limit intake of red meat to 500g per week and to avoid processed meat.

A new study published in the Aug 1 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that a bowl of lentils and quinoa may have done you more good than that meatloaf. The study reviewed protein intakes of more than 131,000 women and men from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. After tracking their diets for up to 32 years, the authors found that a higher intake of red meat, especially processed versions (sausage, bacon, hot dogs, salami), was linked to a higher risk of death, while a higher protein intake from plant foods carried a lower risk. These plant proteins appeared the most protective from heart disease deaths, especially among participants with at least one of the following unhealthy lifestyle habits: smoking, heavy alcohol intake, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity. Overall, our findings support the importance of the sources of dietary protein for long-term health outcomes,\u201d says Mingyang Song, MD, ScD, a research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cWhile previous studies have primarily focused on the overall amount of protein intake, from a broad dietary perspective, the particular foods that people consume to get protein are most important. The authors suggest swapping red and processed meat with healthy, plant proteins like nuts, beans, legumes, and cereals. If you do eat animal protein, choose mostly poultry and fish, which were not related to premature death in this study. Vegetarians may rejoice over these findings, but if you\u2019re skeptical of tofu, try these tips to gradually add more plant protein into your diet. Make a meatless version of your favorite chili recipe by replacing the meat with plenty of beans: hearty kidney beans, chickpeas, or pinto beans. Add 3 tablespoons of hemp seeds to your breakfast yogurt or oatmeal. Add \u00bd cup rinsed, drained canned beans to your salads. Instead of cheese, try hummus onto your sandwiches. Instead of processed meats, spread almond, peanut, or sunflower seed butter on whole grain toast. Feeling more adventurous?

The quick answer is that it can be either, but it all depends on the individual. What is Gluten? Gluten is a protein naturally found in some grains including wheat, barley, and rye. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a \u201cstretchy\u201d quality\u2014think of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily. Other grains that contain gluten are wheat berries, spelt, durum, emmer, semolina, farina, farro, graham, khorasan wheat, einkorn, and triticale (a blend of wheat and rye). Oats\u2014though naturally gluten free\u2014often contain gluten from cross-contamination when they are grown near, or processed in the same facilities as the grains listed above. Gluten is also sold as wheat gluten, or seitan, a popular vegan high-protein food. Less obvious sources of gluten include soy sauce and modified food starch, however gluten-free options of these products are available and labeled as such to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s gluten-free labeling rule. Gluten and Health Benefits Gluten is most often associated with wheat and wheat-containing foods that are abundant in our food supply. Negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet. There is little published research to support these claims; in fact published research suggests the opposite. In a 2017 study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease, researchers found no association between long-term dietary gluten consumption and heart disease risk. [1] In fact, the findings also suggested that non-celiac individuals who avoid gluten may increase their risk of heart disease, due to the potential for reduced consumption of whole grains. Many studies have linked whole grain consumption with improved health outcomes. For example, groups with the highest intakes of whole grains including wheat (2-3 servings daily) compared with groups eating the lowest amounts (less than 2 servings daily) were found to have significantly lower rates of heart disease and stroke, development of type 2 diabetes, and deaths from all causes. [2-5] Gluten may also act as a prebiotic, feeding the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in our bodies. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharide is a prebiotic carbohydrate derived from wheat bran that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon. These bacteria are normally found in a healthy human gut. Changes in their amount or activity have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. [6,7] When Gluten Is a Problem What\u2019s not great about gluten is that it can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one\u2019s immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation. The side effects can range from mild (fatigue, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea) to severe (unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, intestinal damage) as seen in the autoimmune disorder celiac disease. Estimates suggest that 1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease, or about 1% of the population, but about 83% of them are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions. [8,9] Research shows that people with celiac disease also have a slightly higher risk of osteoporosis and anemia (due to malabsorption of calcium and iron, respectively); infertility; nerve disorders; and in rare cases cancer. [10] The good news is that removing gluten from the diet may reverse the damage. A gluten-free diet is the primary medical treatment for celiac disease. However, understanding and following a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging, possibly requiring the guidance of a registered dietitian to learn which foods contain gluten and to ensure that adequate nutrients are obtained from gluten-free alternatives. Other conditions that may require the reduction or elimination of gluten in the diet include: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, also referred to as gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) or gluten intolerance\u2014An intolerance to gluten with similar symptoms as seen with celiac disease, but without the accompanying elevated levels of antibodies and intestinal damage. There is not a diagnostic test for GSE but is determined by persistent symptoms and a negative diagnostic celiac test. Wheat allergy\u2014An allergy to one or more of the proteins (albumin, gluten, gliadin, globulin) found in wheat, diagnosed with positive immunoglobulin E blood tests and a food challenge. Compare this with celiac disease, which is a single intolerance to gluten. Symptoms range from mild to severe and may include swelling or itching of the mouth or throat, hives, itchy eyes, shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhea, cramps, and anaphylaxis. People who test negative for this condition may still have gluten sensitivity. This condition is most often seen in children, which most outgrow by adulthood. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)\u2014A skin rash that results from eating gluten. It is an autoimmune response that exhibits itself as a persistent red itchy skin rash that may produce blisters and bumps. Although people with celiac disease may have DH, the reverse is not always true. It is important to note that gluten is a problem only for those who react negatively to it, or test positive for celiac disease. Most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives, without any adverse side effects. Does gluten cause brain fog? Some evidence shows that people who eat gluten but have a severe intolerance to it, such as with celiac disease, have a slightly higher risk of developing cognitive impairment. Reports of \u201cbrain fog\u201d are not uncommon in people just prior to a diagnosis of celiac disease or in those who have been diagnosed but mistakenly ate foods containing gluten. But does this side effect occur in people without a true gluten intolerance, and can the reverse be suggested in that the avoidance of gluten might sharpen the mind? A large cohort study disagrees. Almost 13,500 middle-aged women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II without celiac disease were followed for 28 years to observe any potential links between gluten intake and mental ability. [15] No significant differences were found in cognitive scores (measuring reaction time, attention, memory, etc.) comparing women with the highest and lowest gluten intakes. The lack of association remained even after excluding women with a dementia or cancer diagnosis. Unless a person has diagnosed celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a gluten sensitivity, current evidence does not support that eating gluten increases inflammation in the brain or negatively affects brain health. What Is a \u201cGluten-Free Diet\u201d? This is essentially a diet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients including B vitamins, magnesium, and iron, it\u2019s important to make up for these missing nutrients. Along with consuming naturally gluten-free foods in their whole form like fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, fish, eggs, and poultry, the following whole grains are also inherently gluten-free: Quinoa Brown, black, or red rice Buckwheat Amaranth Millet Corn Sorghum Teff Gluten-free oats It\u2019s also key not to rely on processed gluten-free foods that may be high in calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and low in nutrients, such as gluten-free cookies, chips, and other snack foods. Often, these foods are made with processed unfortified rice, tapioca, corn, or potato flours. The gluten-free food industry has grown 136% from 2013 to 2015 with almost $12 billion in sales in 2015. Interestingly, studies show that people who do not have celiac disease are the biggest purchasers of gluten-free products. [11] Consumer surveys show that the top three reasons people select gluten-free foods are for \u201cno reason,\u201d because they are a \u201chealthier option,\u201d and for \u201cdigestive health.\u201d [12] For those who are not gluten-intolerant, there is no data to show a specific benefit in following a gluten-free diet, particularly if processed gluten-free products become the mainstay of the diet. In fact, research following patients with celiac disease who change to a gluten-free diet shows an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This could be partly due to improved intestinal absorption, but speculation has also focused on the low nutritional quality of processed gluten-free foods that may contain refined sugars and saturated fats and have a higher glycemic index.

Studies may seem to present conflicting conclusions about soy, but this is largely due to the wide variation in how soy is studied. Results of recent population studies suggest that soy has either a beneficial or neutral effect on various health conditions. Soy is a nutrient-dense source of protein that can safely be consumed several times a week, and probably more often, and is likely to provide health benefits\u2014especially when eaten as an alternative to red and processed meat. Soy is exalted as a health food by some, with claims of taming hot flashes, warding off osteoporosis, and protecting against hormonal cancers like breast and prostate. At the same time, soy is shunned by others for fear that it may cause breast cancer, thyroid problems, and dementia, though these claims have not been substantiated. Whether published in a popular press article or a well-designed clinical study, some debate about soy remains. As a species within the legume family, nutrition scientists often label soy as a food with potential for significant health benefits. However, due to contrary research that suggests possible negative effects of soy in certain situations, there has been a hesitancy to wholeheartedly promote soy. Part of the uncertainty is due to the intricacy of soy\u2019s effects on the body. Soy is unique in that it contains a high concentration of isoflavones, a type of plant estrogen (phytoestrogen) that is similar in function to human estrogen but with much weaker effects. Soy isoflavones can bind to estrogen receptors in the body and cause either weak estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity. The two major soy isoflavones are called genistein and daidzein. Soy isoflavones and soy protein appear to have different actions in the body based on the following factors: Type of study. Is it being examined in a study with animals or humans? Soy may be metabolized differently in animals, so the outcomes of animal studies may not be applicable to humans. Hormone levels. Because soy can have estrogenic properties, its effects can vary depending on the existing level of hormones in the body. Premenopausal women have much higher circulating levels of estradiol\u2014the major form of estrogen in the human body\u2014than postmenopausal women. In this context soy may act like an anti-estrogen, but among postmenopausal women soy may act more like an estrogen. Also, women with breast cancer are classified into hormone type\u2014either hormone positive (ER+/PR+) or hormone negative (ER-/PR-) breast cancer\u2014and these tumors respond differently to estrogens. Type of soy. What type of soy is being studied: Whole soy foods such as tofu and soybeans, processed versions like soy protein powders, or soy-based veggie burgers? Fermented or unfermented soy foods? If supplements are used, do they contain isoflavones or soy protein? Thus, there are many factors that make it difficult to construct blanket statements about the health effects of soy. Aside from their isoflavone content, soy foods are rich in nutrients including B vitamins, fiber, potassium, magnesium, and high-quality protein. Unlike some plant proteins, soy protein is considered a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot make which must be obtained from the diet. Soy foods are also classified as fermented or unfermented (see table with examples, below). Fermented means that the soy food has been cultured with beneficial bacteria, yeast, or mold. Some believe that fermenting soy improves its digestibility and absorption in the body, as this process partially breaks down soy\u2019s sugar and protein molecules.

If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, these strategies can help you cut-back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. You might think a plate devoid of meat is incomplete\u2014questioning whether it will fill you up, be too expensive, give you enough protein, be lacking in flavor or texture, etc. If that\u2019s been your experience, don\u2019t be discouraged. While this approach doesn\u2019t incorporate any animal products, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to remove them from your diet completely. Rather, it shares some simple strategies for creating filling, delicious, and even budget-friendly plant-based preparations. Start here: Incorporate umami: alongside sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, umami is the fifth well-recognized taste, which is typically described as a \u201csavory, meaty taste.\u201d True to its description, umami foods often include red meats and poultry, eggs and certain cheeses, and a wide range of seafood. However, there are a number of umami-packed plant-based foods that can provide this savory, meaty, rich taste when you\u2019re cooking without animal foods. For example, fermented products like soy sauce and miso; sea vegetables; green tea; toasted nuts and seeds; savory spices like cumin and smoked paprika; and a range of vegetables, including tomatoes, asparagus, winter squash, sweet potatoes, and carrots. Roasting, grilling, saut\u00e9ing and caramelizing vegetables increases the umami as well, as this process breaks down the protein to release the flavor. Mushrooms also stand out for their umami-rich flavor, which, combined with their \u201cmeaty\u201d texture can make a great replacement for beef. Build texture, protein, and satiety with legumes and nuts: Legumes (like beans, soybeans, peas, lentils), nuts (like almonds, walnuts, and pecans), and seeds (chia, hempseed) can stand in for animal-based protein foods, while providing an array of other nutrients. Same goes for products made from them, such as nut butters and soy foods (like tofu or tempeh) or other plant-based products, like veggie burgers (note that with any highly processed product, plant-based or not, it\u2019s important to look out for extra sodium, saturated fat from tropical oils, or other additives). Legumes are worth calling out in particular, for human health and planetary health. For example, just one cup of cooked lentils provides 18 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber, and it has virtually no saturated fat (for comparison, 4 ounces of ground beef provides 14 grams of protein, no fiber, and 11 grams of saturated fat). And beyond their lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions, legumes are also known for helping replace nitrogen in the soil. Texturally, lentils even resemble ground beef when cooked, and when paired with umami-packed vegetables, like mushrooms, can even mimic the taste. Try them anywhere you\u2019d used crumbled cooked ground beef. For example: Hearty lentils, savory portabella mushrooms, umami-packed tomatoes, and saut\u00e9ed onions combine with brown rice to deliver a surprisingly \u201cmeaty\u201d bell pepper filling\u2014but without the red meat. GET THE RECIPE. For building the rest of the dish, incorporate minimally processed whole grains, which will boost texture and also provide some protein. Cook your whole grains in low-sodium vegetable broth for even more flavor. What else can I do? As you can see (and try for yourself, following these tips!), plant-based meals can indeed be filling and flavorful on their own. However, if you happen to have leftover chicken or feel like having an egg or some cheese, these tips can help provide a solid base for incorporating animal-based foods into your meals.

If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, these strategies can help you cut-back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. People have varying perceptions of what they consider to be \u201cmeat.\u201d Although technically defined as any animal flesh consumed for food, some may only think of red and processed animal products as \u201cmeats,\u201d while poultry and fish are viewed as separate categories. This may be a helpful approach, since the variety of meats and other animal products can have different effects on our own health, and the health of the planet. Start here: While a key goal should be getting more veggies and other quality plant-based foods in your diet, this step towards reducing red meat is pretty straightforward: incorporate a reasonable amount of poultry (like chicken and turkey) and a variety of seafood (from fish to mollusks). If you were planning to make a dish with red meat in a \u201cstarring role,\u201d consider poultry and fish in its place. Finding some new favorite recipes is a great start; but here are some simple swaps that will come in handy for a range of recipes: Marinate and pan-fry chicken or fish instead of grilling burgers and ribs Swap in ground turkey for ground beef Think sliced fresh chicken or canned tuna over cold cuts of any kind Bake/saut\u00e9 a chicken breast or some white fish, instead of frying a steak Roast a turkey, chicken, or salmon rather than beef, lamb, or ham You may be familiar with a classic beef-stuffed bell pepper, but have you ever tried other versions of this easily customizable dish? This stuffed pepper recipe ventures into new flavor territory with a stuffing of spicy chicken, black beans, and a mixture of veggies. GET THE RECIPE. Take it a step further: This strategy comes in handy when you\u2019re designing a meal around animal-based protein, but what about giving plant-based foods some more of the spotlight? This next strategy boosts healthy plant-based foods like beans, nuts, whole grains, and other veggies, while still providing enough protein and ways to incorporate some of your favorite animal-based foods: Consume less meat, enjoy more variety SEE THE TIPS.

If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, these strategies can help you cut-back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. On the dinner plate \u201cstage,\u201d we often think about animal-based protein as the \u201ccenter of attention \u201d with everything else\u2014like veggies\u2014playing a supporting role. An easy (and often cost-effective) way to diversify your diet is to flip this old paradigm by reducing the portion of meat and other animal products, and sharing the spotlight with plant-based foods. Start here: This approach is all about variety! It boosts healthy plant-based foods, while still providing ways to incorporate some of your favorite animal-based foods. You can do this any number of ways, but here are a few ideas to get you started: Focus on hearty plant-based proteins, whole grains, and plenty of produce. Endless combinations of these foods can provide a filling foundation for your plate. For example: Legumes (like beans, soybeans, peas, lentils), nuts (like almonds, walnuts, and pecans), and seeds (chia, hempseed) can be satiating options of plant-based protein. Nuts and seeds also contain healthy fats, while legumes are full of fiber. If you\u2019re skeptical, check out these cooking strategies for savory and hearty plant-based protein. Minimally processed whole grains can also be a source of protein and satiety. Brown rice is one option, but try a variety of grains for new textures and flavors: quinoa, farro, bulgur, buckwheat, and more. Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits, and incorporate a rainbow of colors: dark greens, reds, oranges, yellows, and even purple. For animal-based foods besides meat, eggs can be a good choice. Think beyond breakfast: hardboiled as a snack or chopped into salad; soft boiled and added to a soup; scrambled into a stir-fry; or fried sunny-side up and placed on top of roasted veggies, savory grains, and legumes. If you enjoy dairy foods, this approach is a great way to include them in moderation\u2014 good for both your health and the planet\u2019s health (although not as much as beef, producing dairy foods also has a considerable environmental impact). You\u2019re probably already practicing this when you incorporate a bit of sharp or flavorful cheese into a dish. For example, parmesan grated on top of a minestrone soup; or cubed feta in a Greek salad (not macaroni and cheese, cheeseburgers, and three-cheese pizza). While yogurt topped with nuts and berries makes a great breakfast, you can also try mixing a spoonful with herbs, spices, and olive oil for a quick and creamy dressing on warm whole grains. Using a bell pepper as a vessel can yield an endless number of delicious and creative filling combinations. They\u2019re also perfect for meal prep and portable for lunchboxes. We tried a few variations of this classic dish beyond the typical beef-stuffed version. GET THE RECIPES. As mentioned, this approach can include meats\u2014but just in much smaller proportions. Since meats are often sold at a higher price point, an added benefit is that you may get more \u201cmileage\u201d by cutting/slicing/shredding and using them in small amounts (rather than a single large piece per person). Poultry and fish are particularly good for this. Chicken and turkey can go further when it\u2019s: used as a topping over a scoop of lentils and crunchy green beans, and drizzled with zippy mustard dressing; mixed into a veggie-packed stir-fry; or rolled into a wrap with hummus, sundried tomatoes, cucumbers, and olives. If you cook for multiple people, try roasting a whole chicken or turkey on a weekend and then slicing-up the leftovers to incorporate in any number creative plant-based dishes throughout the week. Leftover fish also works great as an addition to salads, paired with veggies for a fish taco filling, or scrambled with eggs and placed atop some whole grain toast for a savory breakfast. This approach can even make some room for red meats on occasion, with processed meats used sparingly. For example, rather than a whole burger patty of beef, you can blend-in \u201cmeaty\u201d and umami-packed chopped mushrooms. Or, if you particularly enjoy the taste of bacon, you could consider using a slice to flavor the base of a soup where beans, grains, and vegetables provide the bulk of the protein. Take it a step further: Variety is a smart approach\u2014but your meals don\u2019t have to include meat or other animal-based foods in order to be tasty and satisfying. The plant kingdom offers plenty of options to choose from, and this next approach provides simple strategies to incorporate them into filling, delicious, and even budget-friendly dishes: Prioritize hearty and savory plant-based preparations SEE THE TIPS. More plate upgrades: Swap out red meat for healthier meats If you\u2019re thinking of a meal that features red meat, see if you can replace it with a better option, like poultry or seafood. Eat a little less red meat, any way you can Assess how often you eat red meat, and see if one of these strategies can help you find a way to cut back a bit.

If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, these strategies can help you cut-back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful. It may seem obvious, but one of the first steps you can take in reducing your consumption of red meat is to simply eat a little less of it! Start here: This approach can be a range of steps on its own. Figure out what works for you, and keep moving forward. \u201cLess\u201d can be a variety of strategies. For example: Focus on eating at least one type less: For your health, perhaps start with reducing the processed meats in your diet like bacon, sausages, and cold cuts (note that with processed meats it\u2019s not just red meat that may be a problem, but any processed meat, like turkey bacon or lunch meat, and chicken sausage). Then move onto the red meat you consume most often, like beef, pork, and lamb. For your health and the health of the planet, try focusing on reducing your consumption of lamb and beef especially. Beef is one of the most impactful animal foods to produce. In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related greenhouse gas emissions\u2014a key contributor to climate change. If you eat red meat multiple times a day\u2014for example, breakfast sausages, a ham sandwich for lunch, and steak at dinner\u2014try cutting down your consumption to once a day. If you eat red meat once a day, see if you\u2019re able to reduce the portion size a bit. A single instead of a double hamburger? A few fewer slices of bacon? Or, if a recipe calls for a pound of beef, maybe you can buy just half and adjust a few other ingredients? If you\u2019ve ever had ground beef in a pasta sauce, you\u2019ve already experienced this concept. Alongside the saut\u00e9ed veggies and simmered tomatoes, ground beef provides some flavor and texture\u2014but at a quantity much less than if you were serving whole meatballs over the pasta; or if you cut out the pasta altogether and served a slice of meatloaf with tomato sauce. With this strategy, there\u2019s no change in flavor, but it can be an upgrade for your health. For example: You\u2019re probably familiar with a stuffed pepper, which is typically filled with a large portion of ground beef, rice, and tomatoes. With just a few simple tweaks, we created a healthier version with no change in flavor. GET THE RECIPE From there, how about eating red meat fewer times per week? Or only eating it on the weekends? Once a week? Once every other week? A few times each month? Only when you\u2019re dining out? You could also try saving red meat only for special occasions, like a holiday, birthday, or an event. For example, think about eating beef as a splurge, rather than an everyday option\u2014the way many of us think about lobster. Take it a step further: It\u2019s important to remember when you\u2019re cutting out red meat to replace it with healthy options\u2014not refined grains or highly-processed foods. For example, if you\u2019re thinking of a meal with red meat as the star, see if you can replace it with a better option, like poultry or seafood: Swap out red meat for healthier meats SEE THE TIPS.

Our objective was to examine the relation between foods which are major dietary protein sources and incident CHD. Methods and Results We prospectively followed 84,136 women aged 30-55 years in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study with no known cancer, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. Diet was assessed by a standardized and validated questionnaire and updated every four years. During 26 years of follow-up, we documented 2,210 incident nonfatal infarctions and 952 deaths from CHD. In multivariable analyses including age, smoking, and other risk factors, higher intakes of red meat, red meat excluding processed meat, and high-fat dairy were significantly associated with elevated risk of CHD. Higher intakes of poultry, fish, and nuts were significantly associated with lower risk. In a model controlling statistically for energy intake, one serving/day of nuts was associated with a 30% (95% CI: 17% to 42%) lower risk of CHD, when compared to one serving/day of red meat. Similarly, when compared to one serving/day of red meat, a lower risk was associated with one serving/day of low-fat dairy (13%; 95% CI: 6% to 19%), poultry (19%; 95% CI: 3% to 33%), and fish (24%; 95% CI: 6% to 39%). Conclusions These data suggest that high red meat intake increases risk of CHD, and that CHD risk may be reduced importantly by shifting sources of protein in the U.S. diet. Keywords: Coronary disease, Diet, Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Women Introduction With the exception of fish, relatively few foods that are major sources of dietary protein have been examined in relation to incident coronary heart disease (CHD). The relation of these foods to CHD may not be predicted by the composition of their individual nutrients due to either synergy or antagonism among the nutrients or because of the presence of other constituents in the foods. While neither animal protein nor vegetable protein has been associated with CHD risk1, other nutrients in protein-rich foods, such as saturated fat 2-3, polyunsaturated fat 3-4, and vitamins E, B6, and folate 5 have been associated with risk. We have previously reported on the relation between red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products in relation to CHD risk over 14 years 2. We observed that red meat was not significantly associated with CHD, but increasing poultry and fish intake was associated with a decreased risk. A clear understanding of the relation between these food groups and CHD risk over a longer period of time, as well an examination of the individual foods that contribute to each food group and the relation of other major dietary protein sources and CHD risk, would allow individuals to reduce their risk by substituting one protein source for another. This type of dietary change may be easier to accomplish than trying to substitute one nutrient for another or one dietary pattern for another. We therefore examined the relation between major sources of dietary protein and the development of coronary heart disease in a large cohort of women with 26 years of follow up. Methods Study Population The Nurses\u2019 Health Study began in 1976 when 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30-55 years and residing in eleven U.S. states provided detailed information on their medical history and lifestyle. Every two years, follow-up questionnaires have been sent to update information on potential risk factors and to identify newly diagnosed cases of CHD and other diseases. In 1980, a 61-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was included to assess intake of specific foods. In 1984, the FFQ was expanded to include 116 food items. Similar questionnaires were used to update dietary intake in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002. As in our previous analyses, we excluded those who left more than ten items blank on the 1980 FFQ, those with implausibly low or high scores for total food or energy intake (i.e., less than 2094 kJ (500 kCal) or greater than 14650 kJ (3500 kCal) per day), and those with previously diagnosed cancer, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease (including a history of coronary artery bypass grafting) 1-3, 6. The final 1980 baseline population consisted of 84,136 women. The study was approved by the Committee on the use of Human Subjects in Research at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. All subjected gave informed consent to participate. Ascertainment of Diet To calculate intakes of specific protein sources, a commonly used unit or portion size for each food was specified on the FFQ (e.g., one slice of processed meat or one hamburger patty) and the nurse was asked how often on average during the previous year she had consumed that amount (for portion sizes, see online-only supplemental material). Nine responses were possible, ranging from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cmore than six times per day.\u201d The major protein sources on the FFQs include: chicken with and without skin, chicken sandwich, regular and lean hamburger, beef/pork hot dogs, chicken/turkey hot dog, processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/lamb mixed dish, beef/pork/lamb main dish, beef liver, chicken liver, skim or low fat milk, whole milk, yoghurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, and hard cheese. The reproducibility and validity of the FFQs in measuring food intake have been previously described in detail 7-11 Women were divided into fifths of cumulative average intake of various protein sources in order to reduce within-person variation and best represent long term diet. These averages were calculated by calculating the mean of all FFQ intakes from all available FFQs up to the beginning of a follow up interval. The cumulative average intake was then associated with CHD incidence from the time of the last returned questionnaire until the next follow up cycle. If dietary data from a particular FFQ was missing, then that FFQ cycle\u2019s cumulative average would be the last cumulative average carried forward. We stopped updating a participant\u2019s cumulative average intake when she developed an intermediate outcome on the causal pathway between diet and CHD, such as diabetes, hypertension, angina, or hypercholesterolemia. We also stopped updating diet at the diagnosis of cancer or stroke or after coronary artery bypass. This was done because changes in diet after these diagnoses or events may bias the diet-disease association; ie, these diagnoses can be confounders 2-3. In sensitivity analyses, however, we examined cumulative average intake that was continually updated even after intermediate outcomes. Ascertainment of Endpoint The primary endpoint for this study was nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease occurring after the return of the 1980 FFQ but before June 1, 2006. After report of an infarction, permission to obtain medical records was requested and these were reviewed by study physicians with no knowledge of the subjects\u2019 self-reported risk factor status. Myocardial infarction was confirmed using the World Health Organization criteria: symptoms plus either diagnostic electrocardiographic changes or elevated cardiac enzymes 12. Infarctions that required hospital admission and for which confirmatory information was obtained by interview or letter, but for which no medical records were available, were designated as probable (527/2210 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction, or 24%). We included all confirmed and probable cases in our report because results were similar after probable cases were excluded. Deaths were identified from state vital records and the National Death Index or were reported by next of kin or the postal system. Follow-up for deaths has been shown to be more than 98% complete 13. Fatal coronary heart disease was defined as a fatal myocardial infarction only if confirmed by medical records, next-of-kin or contact person, autopsy report, or if coronary heart disease was listed as cause of death on the death certificate and there was evidence of previous coronary disease. We considered sudden death within one hour of the onset of symptoms in women with no other plausible cause of death other than coronary disease as fatal CHD; these cases constituted 146/952 or 15% of fatal CHD cases. Fatal coronary heart disease was designated as presumed if the underlying cause on the death certificate was CHD but no records were available. These cases constituted 193/952 or 20% per cent of fatal CHD cases. Analyses limited to confirmed cases yielded similar results as analyses with both confirmed and presumed cases. Data Analysis We evaluated the individual associations between red meat, poultry, canned tuna, dark and light-fleshed fish, nuts, and beans in relation to the risk of CHD. We also examined protein source \u201cgroups\u201d - total meat (including chicken with and without skin, chicken sandwich, hamburger, beef and chicken/turkey hot dog, processed meat and processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/lamb as a mixed and main dish, beef and chicken liver), red meat (hamburger, beef hot dog, processed meat and processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/lamb as a mixed and main dish), poultry (chicken with and without skin, chicken sandwich, and chicken/turkey hot dog ), fish (canned tuna, dark and light fleshed fish, and breaded fish), high-fat dairy (whole milk, ice cream, hard cheese, full fat cheese, cream, sour cream, cream cheese, butter, low-fat dairy (skim/low-fat milk, 1% and 2% milk, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheeses, low-fat cheese, sherbert) - and their relation to CHD. We also analyzed the ratio of red meat to poultry and red meat to poultry plus fish in relation to incidence of CHD. We estimated the association between animal and vegetable protein and incidence of CHD. We investigated the effect of \u201csubstituting\u201d a serving of one major protein source for another by including both as continuous variables in the same multivariable model. The difference in their coefficients plus their covariance was used to estimate the relative risk and 95% CI for the substitution 14. Person-years of follow-up for each participant were calculated from the return of the 1980 FFQ to the date of the first CHD event, death, or June 1, 2006, whichever came first. The relative risk was computed using a proportional hazards regression model, with the rate in a specific fifth divided by that in the lowest fifth, with adjustment by age in months and calendar time (2-year follow up period). Median values of intake for each fifth were used to test for a linear trend across fifths. In multivariable proportional hazards models, in addition to age and calendar time, we simultaneously controlled for intakes of total energy (Kcal), cereal fiber (g/day), alcohol (g/day), and trans unsaturated fatty acids (g/day), as well as other potential non-dietary confounding variables. These variables were updated biennially and include body mass index (<22, 22-24, 24-25, 25-27, 27-29, 29-30, 30-32, 32-35, 35-40, >40), physical exercise (<3, 3-9, 9-18, 18-27, 27+ metabolic equivalents/week), cigarette smoking (never, past, current 1-14 cig/day, current 14-25 cig/day, current 25+ cig/day), menopausal status (pre-menopausal, postmenopausal with no history of hormone replacement, postmenopausal with a history of hormone replacement, postmenopausal with current hormone replacement), parental history of early myocardial infarction (defined as infarction before age 65 for participant\u2019s mother or before age 55 for a participant\u2019s father), years of multivitamin use, vitamin E supplement use (yes/no), and aspirin use at least once per week (yes/no). The last value was carried forward for one 2-year cycle to replace missing values. If the last value was missing, than a missing value indicator was created. In the models with animal and vegetable protein, we built two models: the first included the main exposures plus the above covariates, while the second included main exposures plus the above covariates and saturated fat, mono-unsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Neither the diagnoses of diabetes, angina, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, nor use of the medications that are prescribed to treat these diseases, were included in any of the multivariable models, as these may all be considered intermediate outcomes on the causal pathway between diet and CHD. However, in sensitivity analyses, these intermediates outcomes were included. Results During 2,050,071 person-years of follow-up from 1980 through 2006, we documented 2210 nonfatal infarctions and 952 deaths from coronary heart disease. Our follow-up rate (defined as person-years contributed by study participants until their last returned FFQ or death divided by person-years contributed by study participants until death) was 97%. Between 1980 and 2002, red meat consumption decreased from a median intake of 1.06 to 0.49 servings/day, while poultry consumption increased from 0.14 to 0.28 servings/day and fish consumption remained unchanged. Characteristics of the study participants during the 26 years of follow-up, averaged according to proportion of person-time in each fifth of intake, are shown in Table 1. High red meat consumption was associated with higher rates of smoking, angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, lower physical activity, increased intake of trans fat, and decreased intake vitamin E and multivitamins. The major groups of protein sources were not highly correlated with each other: the Spearman correlation coefficient of red meat with poultry was \u22120.09; red meat with fish \u22120.17; and poultry with fish 0.39.

Higher intakes of poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy sources were significantly associated with decreased risk (Table 2). When we controlled for age, follow-up period, and smoking status, the significant associations seen in the age-adjusted analyses remained. In multivariable analyses (Table 2) which adjusted for dietary and non-dietary cardiovascular disease risk factors, the associations were reduced in magnitude but remained significant for all the protein groups except low-fat dairy. Fruit and vegetable intake was only weakly to moderately correlated with intake of all the major protein sources and further adjustment for it had no effect on the risk associations. Egg intake was not associated with risk in either age-adjusted or multivariable models. Table 2.

In age-adjusted analyses, animal protein was associated with increased risk and vegetable protein was associated with decreased risk (animal protein relative risk (RR) across fifths: 1.00, 0.94, 0.96, 0.96, 1.14, p for trend 0.01; vegetable protein RR across fifths: 1.00, 0.84, 0.77, 0.69, 0.62, p for trend <0.0001). In the multivariable analyses, vegetable protein but not animal protein remained significantly associated with decreased risk (vegetable protein RR across fifths: 1.00, 0.88, 0.85, 0.80, 0.72, p for trend <0.001). However, when we included polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and saturated fat in the multivariable models, we found no relation between animal or vegetable protein and CHD risk. When we continued updating a participant\u2019s diet even after she had been diagnosed with angina, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cancer, or stroke, or had a coronary artery bypass, we saw similar associations with red meat as when we stopped updating diet at these diagnoses (relative risk for highest fifth = 1.31, 95% CI 1.15 \u22121.50, p for trend < 0.0001); however, poultry, fish, and high-fat dairy were no longer associated with CHD risk. When we stopped updating diet at the diagnosis of an intermediate outcome and also controlled for their presence in the multivariable model, red meat, poultry, fish, and high-fat dairy all remained significantly related to risk of CHD. In the analyses of individual protein sources, higher intake of the red and processed meats were associated with increased risk, while higher intakes of fish, nuts, and beans were associated with decreased risk (Table 3). When compared to one serving/day of red meat, one serving/day of nuts, fish, poultry, or dairy was associated with a decreased risk of CHD (Figure 1). One serving/day of nuts was associated with a 30% (95% CI: 17% to 42%) lower risk of CHD when compared to one serving/day of red meat. Similarly, when compared to one serving/day of red meat, one serving/day of low-fat dairy was associated with a 13% (95% CI: 6% to 19%) lower risk, one serving/day of poultry was associated with a 19% (95% CI: 3% to 33%) lower risk, and one serving/day of fish was associated with a 24% (95% CI: 6% to 39%) lower risk.

Open in a new tab Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for coronary heart disease associated with replacement of major dietary protein source for another When compared to one serving/day of fish, one serving/day of dairy products was associated with an increased risk, while one serving/day of nuts or beans was not significantly associated with risk. Discussion In this prospective cohort study with 26 years of follow-up, we observed that a higher consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. The positive association was independent of established dietary and non-dietary cardiovascular risk factors as well as fruit and vegetable intake. When compared to red meat, intakes of dairy, poultry, fish, and especially nuts, were associated with substantially lower risk of coronary disease. To date, only a few prospective and case-control studies have examined major dietary protein sources and risk of CHD. Snowdon et al followed 25,153 California Seventh-Day Adventists between 1960 and 1980 and observed that that daily meat consumption was associated with a 70% greater risk of fatal CHD in men and 37% greater risk in women 15. Gramenzi et al conducted a case-control study among women with 287 cases and 649 controls: women who consumed ham and salami more than 2 times per week had a significant 60% increased odds of myocardial infarction 16. Sinha et al followed 322,263 men and 223, 390 women in the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP study for 10 years, documenting 71,252 deaths, including 5,356 deaths from cardiovascular disease among women. They reported an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among women consuming high intakes of red and processed meats (red meat: RR = 1.50 for highest versus lowest fifth; processed meat: RR = 1.38 for highest versus lowest fifth) 17. In an earlier analysis of the Nurses Health Study with 14 years of follow up, increasing the ratio of red meat to poultry plus fish was associated with a highly significant positive association 2. A separate analysis with 16 years follow-up showed that higher fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of CHD 4. Compared to these studies, our analysis here has a longer follow up period and greater precision in dietary measurement due to a greater number of cases and repeated dietary questionnaires. When we continued updating diet throughout follow-up, we no longer observed significant associations between poultry, fish, or high-fat dairy and CHD risk. This suggests other diseases and events do in fact lead nurses to change their diets and thus their presence confound the diet-disease association. Red meat, however, continued to be significantly related to CHD risk even when we continually updated diet and when we controlled for the intermediate outcomes. These results suggest a strong association between red meat and CHD, independent of measured confounders and known intermediate outcomes. The positive association between total meat and CHD risk is likely driven by the high amount of red meat that makes up total meat intake (Spearman coefficient of correlation 0.94). The strong association between red meat and CHD is not entirely explained by processed meat intake, as red meat remained associated with CHD risk even after excluding processed meat. Dietary iron, and particularly the heme iron found in red meat, has been positively associated with myocardial infarction and fatal CHD in most 18-22, but not all studies 23-24. Through its effect on systolic blood pressure, the high sodium content of processed meats may be associated with CHD risk 25-26. Compounds created by cooking red meat, including heterocyclic amines and advanced glycation end-products, may also be linked with CHD 27-34. Compared to polyunsaturated fat, high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol have been linked with increased CHD risk 2-3. A recent meta-analysis reported that saturated fat consumption was not significantly associated with CHD risk 35; however, in this meta-analysis saturated fat was compared to other calorie sources, mostly refined carbohydrates, and high intake of refined carbohydrates has been associated with a high risk of CHD 36. In another recent meta-analysis, with findings similar to ours, total red meat and processed red meat were both positively associated with risk of CHD 37; however, in this meta-analysis, red meat was compared to other sources of calories and the published data did not allow for an explicit comparison with protein sources. When major sources of protein, such as nuts and fish, are used to replace red meat, saturated fat and heme iron and sodium decrease, while intake of polyunsaturated fat increases. The benefit on CHD risk of such a substitution is thus likely to be due to multiple simultaneous changes in nutrient intake. Our analysis has several important strengths and limitations. The 26 year follow-up with updated dietary data, high follow up rate, and large number of study participants provided excellent power to detect differences in relative risks across fifths (for example: power for test for trend across five quantiles, with 3,162 cases and 80,974 controls and a two-sided test with alpha 0.05 was 99.67% 38). The ability to measure and control for known cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable models permitted less biased estimates of the independent association of protein-rich foods with CHD risk. Measurement of dietary data is imperfect and measurement error would likely lead to an underestimate of the true effect of the exposures with outcome 6. The repeated dietary data serves to reduce random error to some extent. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual and unmeasured confounding due to the observational nature of this study. In conclusion, in this large study of U.S. women, we found that greater consumption of red meat was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease. Compared to the same number of servings of red meat, consumption of fish, poultry, dairy products, and especially nuts was associated with lower risk. These finding suggest that the risk of coronary heart disease may be reduced importantly by shifting the sources of protein in the U.S. diet.

We examined the relation between foods that are major protein sources and risk of stroke. Methods We prospectively followed 84,010 women aged 30\u201355 years at baseline and 43,150 men aged 40\u201375 years at baseline without diagnosed cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Diet was assessed repeatedly by a standardized and validated questionnaire. We examined the association between protein sources and incidence of stroke using a proportional hazard model adjusted for stroke risk factors. Results During 26 and 22 years of follow-up in women and men, respectively, we documented 2,633 and 1,397 strokes, respectively. In multivariable analyses, higher intake of red meat was associated with an elevated risk of stroke, while a higher intake of poultry was associated with lower risk. In models estimating the effects of exchanging different protein sources, compared to one serving/day of red meat, one serving/day of poultry was associated with a 27% (95% CI: 12% to 39%) lower risk of stroke, nuts with a 17% (95% CI: 4% to 27%) lower risk, fish with a 17% (95% CI: 0% to 30%) lower risk, low-fat dairy with an 11% (95% CI: 5% to 17%) lower risk, and whole-fat dairy with a 10% (95% CI: 4% to 16%) lower risk. We did not see significant associations with exchanging legumes or eggs for red meat. Conclusions These data suggest that stroke risk may be reduced by replacing red meat with other dietary sources of protein. Keywords: men, women, diet, protein, nutrition, stroke Introduction A diet high in protein, compared isocalorically to one high in carbohydrate, lowers blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke, and improves plasma lipids 1. Yet foods that are major protein sources vary greatly in their non-protein constituents and thus may have different relationships to risk of stroke, but these relationships have not been closely examined. In a recent meta-analysis of two observational studies, red meat intake was not significantly associated with incident stroke, and the paucity of data was noted 2. Higher fish intake has been associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke in men 3 and thrombotic stroke in women 4. No significant associations were seen between intakes of eggs, nuts, or whole-fat dairy products 5-6 and stroke risk. Understanding which protein-rich foods are associated with stroke risk is important because substituting one for another may be easier for individuals to accomplish than substituting one nutrient for another, or one dietary pattern for another. We have previously reported on the relation between major dietary protein sources and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in women 7. Higher intakes of red meat and whole-fat dairy products were associated with a higher risk of CHD, while higher intakes of nuts, fish, and poultry were associated with a lower risk. To better understand the relations between dietary protein sources and risk of stroke, we investigated these in two large prospective cohorts of men and women. Materials and Methods Study Populations The Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS) began in 1976 when 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30\u201355 residing in the U.S. provided information on their medical history and lifestyle. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HFPS) began in 1986 when 51,529 male dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, and veterinarians aged 40\u201375 years and residing in the U.S. provided information on their medical history and lifestyle. Every two years, follow-up questionnaires have been sent to update this information. In 1980, a 61-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was included to assess intake of specific foods in NHS. Expanded questionnaires updated dietary intake in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002. In 1986, a 131-item FFQ assessed intake of specific foods in HPFS and similar questionnaires were used to update dietary intake in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. As in our previous analysis, we excluded participants with excessive blank items on their baseline FFQ, implausibly low or high energy intake, and those with previously diagnosed cancer, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease (including a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) 7. The final baseline populations consisted of 84,010 women and 43,150 men. The study was approved by the Committee on the use of Human Subjects in Research at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Return of a questionnaire was considered to imply consent. Ascertainment of Diet To calculate intakes of specific protein sources, a commonly used unit or portion size for each food was specified on the FFQ and the participant was asked how often on average during the previous year he or she had consumed that amount, with answers ranging from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cmore than six times per day\u201d (for portion sizes, see online-only Data Supplement at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). The major contributors to protein intake reported on the FFQs included: unprocessed red meat (hamburger, beef, pork, and lamb), processed red meat (beef hot dog, processed meats such as bologna and salami, and bacon), poultry (chicken with and without skin, chicken sandwich, and chicken/turkey hot dog ), whole-fat dairy (whole milk, ice cream, hard cheese, full fat cheese, cream, sour cream, cream cheese, butter), and low-fat dairy (skim/low-fat milk, 1% and 2% milk, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheeses, low-fat cheese, sherbet). We also evaluated fish (canned tuna, dark and light fleshed fish, and breaded fish), eggs, nuts, and legumes (dry beans, peas, soy, and tofu). In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated total processed meat (processed red meat plus chicken/turkey hot dogs), poultry excluding chicken/turkey hot dogs, whole-fat dairy excluding ice cream, and low-fat dairy excluding sherbet. The reproducibility and validity of the FFQs in measuring food intake have been previously described 8\u201310. Ascertainment of Stroke When participants reported a stroke, we obtained permission to review their medical records. Stroke was classified as ischemic (thrombotic, embolic, or unspecified non-hemorrhagic), hemorrhagic, or of unknown type, according to criteria in the National Survey of Stroke 11. Subarachnoid hemorrhages were distinguished from intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Nonfatal strokes for which confirmatory information was obtained by interview or letter but no medical records were available and no neuro-imaging was available were designated as probable (223/1098, or 20%, of cases in men and 641/2153, or 30%, of cases in women). Deaths were identified from state vital records, the National Death Index, next-of-kin, or the postal system. Stroke was confirmed as fatal by medical records or autopsy report. Fatal stroke was designated as probable if stroke was reported on the death certificate or reported by next-of-kin, but no medical records were available. These constituted 31% (93/299) of cases in men and 43% (207/480) of cases in women. We included confirmed and probable cases in our report because results were similar after probable cases were excluded. Data Analysis We first assessed whether intermediate outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, angina, or CABG/PCI) were associated with a subsequent change in dietary protein intake; these associations were weak and thus these intermediate diagnoses could not be important time-dependent confounders. Therefore, to avoid misclassification of participants\u2019 long-term diet, we continued updating each person\u2019s intake throughout follow-up using data from all repeated FFQs (see online-only Data Supplement for expanded methods at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). Participants were divided into quintiles of cumulative average intake of major dietary protein sources to reduce within-person variation and best represent long-term diet. These averages were calculated by taking the mean of all reported FFQ intakes up to the beginning of a 2-year follow-up interval. The cumulative average intake was then used to predict stroke incidence from the time of the last returned questionnaire until the next follow up cycle. If dietary data from a particular FFQ was missing, we carried forward the most recent cumulative average value. We evaluated associations between foods used as categorical and continuous variables and incidence of total stroke, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. To compare with previous analyses 3\u20134, we evaluated the relation between fish intake less than once per month versus intake more than once per month and risk of stroke. Person-years of follow-up were calculated from the return of the baseline FFQ to the date of the first stroke event, death, or June 1, 2006 (NHS) or January 31, 2008 (HPFS), whichever came first. The relative risk (RR) was computed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model. The model was stratified on age (months) and calendar time (2-year time intervals), and included dietary protein sources (servings/day) and also intakes of total energy (Kcal), cereal fiber (g/day), alcohol (g/day), fruit and vegetables (servings/day), trans unsaturated fatty acids (g/day), and potential non-dietary confounding variables, which were updated biennially: body mass index (BMI, 10 categories), physical exercise (<3, 3\u20139, 9\u201318, 18\u201327, 27+ metabolic equivalents/week), cigarette smoking (never, past, current 1\u201314 cig/day, current 14\u201325 cig/day, current 25+ cig/day), menopausal status in women (pre-menopausal, postmenopausal with no history of hormone replacement, postmenopausal with a history of hormone replacement, postmenopausal with current hormone replacement), parental history of early myocardial infarction (before age 60), years of multivitamin use, vitamin E supplement use (yes/no), and aspirin use (yes/no). Neither the diagnoses of diabetes, angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CABG/PCI, or myocardial infarction, nor use of medications prescribed to treat these conditions (including statins and beta-blockers), were included in the multivariable models, as these may be considered intermediate outcomes on the causal pathway between diet and stroke. However, in sensitivity analyses, intermediate diagnoses were included. The median values for each quintile of cumulative average food intake were used as a single variable to test for linear trend across quintiles and to estimate the relative risk for a one-serving/day increase in intake. Relative risks and standard errors for each quintile from each cohort were pooled in fixed-effects models to calculate summary estimates. To examine for potential effect modification of the association between stroke risk and total red meat intake by adiposity, we stratified our multivariate model on body mass index (< 25 versus \u2265 25) and, separately, tested the significance of an interaction with a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with the interactions terms to the model with only the main effects. Most study participants were Caucasian, precluding evaluation of potential differences by race. To evaluate the relation between a change in red meat intake with the risk of stroke, we created \u2018change\u2019 variables equal to the simple updated red meat intake (intake reported during each questionnaire year) minus the baseline red meat intake, and then included these variables, plus baseline intake, in our multivariate model. To estimate the relative risk of total stroke associated with substituting one serving/day of one major protein source for another, we fit a multivariable proportional hazards model including all the above covariates and all major protein sources entered as continuous variables (servings/day). The difference in the coefficients for two protein sources, plus their covariance, was used to estimate the relative risk and confidence interval for the substitution 7. Results During 2,041,679 person-years of follow-up from 1980 through 2006 in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, and 833,660 person-years of follow-up from 1986 through 2008 in the Health Professionals\u2019 Follow-up Study, we documented 1,397 strokes (including 165 intraparenchymal hemorrhages, 829 ischemic strokes, 53 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 350 of unspecified type) in men and 2,633 strokes (including 235 intraparenchymal hemorrhages, 1383 ischemic strokes, 240 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 775 of unspecified type) in women. Characteristics of the study participants during follow-up, averaged according to proportion of person-time in each quintile of intake, are shown in Table 1. High red meat consumption was associated with a higher rate of smoking, lower physical activity, increased intake of trans fat, and decreased intakes of vitamin E and multivitamins in both men and women. The major groups of protein sources were not highly correlated with each other (see online-only Data Supplement at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). Table 2.

Both processed and unprocessed red meat were significantly associated with risk; the association with processed meat was stronger in men and the association with unprocessed red meat was stronger in women but, for both foods, a test of heterogeneity by sex was not significant. Controlling for intermediate outcomes did not materially change these results (see online-only Data Supplement at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). Poultry and nut consumption were associated with a lower total stroke risk in women, and poultry consumption was associated with lower risk in the pooled analysis. We did not observe significant association between intake of fish, dairy, eggs, or legumes and risk of stroke. A trend toward reduced risk was observed with fish intake more than once per month compared to less than once per month or never (RR in men 0.85, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.15; RR in women 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.06). Risk seen with total processed meat, poultry excluding chicken/turkey hot dogs, whole-fat dairy excluding ice cream, and low-fat dairy excluding sherbet were similar to main findings for processed red meat, poultry, whole-fat dairy, and low-fat dairy. All findings were generally similar when ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were separately evaluated (Table 3 and online-only Data Supplement at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). We did not observe significant effect modification of red meat intake and stroke risk by body mass index in either men or women. Table 2.

Compared to those with an increase of 0.6 servings/day during follow-up, men with the greatest decrease (median for quintile of change = \u22120.93 servings/day) had a 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.99) risk. Compared to those with an increase of 0.3 servings/day, women with the greatest decrease (median for quintile of change = \u22121.16 servings/day), had a risk of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.99). The pooled risk for men and women was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.94). Results were in a similar direction when the analysis was restricted to only those participants with the highest red meat intake at baseline, although findings were not statistically significant. In estimating the effect of substituting one protein source for another, we combined data for men and women since we did not observe significant between-study heterogeneity (Q statistic p value > 0.05 for substitutions). When compared to one serving/day of red meat, one serving/day of poultry, nuts, fish, or dairy was associated with a decreased risk of stroke (Figure). When compared to one serving/day of red meat, one serving/day of poultry was associated with a 27% (95% CI: 12% to 39%) lower risk of stroke, nuts with a 17% (95% CI: 4% to 27%) lower risk, fish with a 17% (95% CI: 0% to 30%) lower risk, low-fat dairy with an 11% (95% CI: 5% to 17%) lower risk, and whole-fat dairy with a 10% (95% CI: 4% to 16%) lower risk.

Open in a new tab * Q statistic p value for between-study heterogeneity (null hypothesis is that there is no heterogeneity) for estimate of effect of substitutions > 0.05; RR and 95% CI for substitutions not shown here: poultry for fish: 0.89 (0.68,1.16); nuts for fish: 0.99 (0.80,1.23); nuts for poultry: 1.11 (0.90,1.37) Discussion We observed that higher consumption of red meat was associated with a higher risk of stroke; both processed and unprocessed red meat contributed to this excess incidence. Poultry intake was associated with lower risk. These associations were independent of other major protein sources, fruits, and vegetables, as well as of other stroke risk factors. Compared to red meat, intake of poultry, nuts, and both whole-fat and low-fat dairy were associated with a lower risk. Earlier studies have found an increased risk of stroke with red meat intake, with as little as one serving per day 6, 12\u201313. In a recent meta-analysis, intake of both unprocessed and processed red meat were associated with a non-significant modestly increased risk of total stroke (14% and 17%) 2. However, only two studies had separated unprocessed from processed red meat, and the meta-analysis included a total of 1,700 cases. Our findings, with more than twice the number of cases included in the meta-analysis, are largely in agreement with earlier findings on the association between red meat and ischemic stroke. Fish intake has been associated with a lower risk of stroke in some 3\u20134, 14 but not all 15 studies. We did not observe a statistically significant association between fish intake and stroke risk. Poultry intake was more strongly associated with lower stroke risk than was fish intake, especially among women, for ischemic stroke, and when substituted for red meat; substituting poultry for fish was also associated with a trend toward a lower stroke risk (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.68,1.16). Both whole-fat dairy and low-fat dairy were associated with lower stroke risk when substituted for red meat. The caloric content for a 1 oz serving of mixed nuts is 168 Kcal and for a cooked or broiled 15% fat hamburger patty is 192 Kcal 16. Three slices of cooked, broiled, or pan-fried bacon has 129 Kcal and\ufffda cup of plain low-fat yogurt has 154 Kcal 16. Thus, substituting nuts or yogurt for bacon at breakfast, for example, or yogurt or nuts in a salad for a hamburger at lunch or dinner could maintain energy balance. Multiple mechanisms might mediate the relationship between protein sources and stroke risk. A diet high in protein, when compared to a diet high in carbohydrate, may lower blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke, and improve plasma lipids 1. Prior analyses from our group found that a lower intake of total animal protein was associated with higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke in women 17 but not in men 18. However, this mechanism alone would not account for the different associations of various protein sources with stroke risk. A lower intake of saturated fat has been associated with a trend toward higher stroke risk in some but not all studies, 19 perhaps mediated by low total serum cholesterol levels, reduced platelet aggregation, increased vascular fragility, and increased risk for hemorrhage 17. Such mechanisms could partly explain, for example, why dairy foods were associated with lower stroke risk. In a recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, higher milk intake was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward lower stroke risk (per 200 ml/d, RR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.05); insufficient data were available to separately evaluate low-fat versus whole-fat milk 20. In contrast, through its effects on blood pressure, 21 sodium may account for part of the association seen between processed red meat and ischemic stroke risk. Heme iron, found in processed and unprocessed red meat, has been associated with coronary heart disease 22 and diabetes 23. Higher intakes of potassium, magnesium, and calcium have been associated with reduced stroke risk 24: one or more of these nutrients may help explain the reduction in risk seen when dairy products are substituted for red meat. The reasons for risk reduction seen with higher poultry intake, especially when compared to fish, are not certain, but we note that processing and cooking methods for poultry likely differ from other protein sources, as does the nutrient content, and higher poultry intake has been associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease 7. Compared to red meat, poultry has lower amounts of heme iron and higher amounts of polyunsaturated fat. Our analysis has important strengths and limitations. We separately examined total, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke outcomes. We accounted for other lifestyle factors and dietary habits over time to minimize effects of time-dependent confounding. The long cohort follow-up with updated dietary data, high follow-up rate, and large number of participants provided power to detect clinically relevant differences in risks. Although we reduced measurement error in these prospective studies by the use of repeated assessment of diet, some error is inevitable. However, this error should be independent of stroke and would likely lead to an underestimate of the true associations. Misclassification of dietary covariates could create bias in unpredictable directions. The ability to control for known cardiovascular disease risk factors, assessed repeatedly during follow-up, in multivariable models reduced bias, but we cannot exclude the possibility of residual and unmeasured confounding. Summary In conclusion, greater red meat consumption was associated with a higher risk of stroke. Compared to the same number of servings per day of red meat, consumption of poultry, nuts, or dairy products was associated with lower risk. Similar to what we have observed for coronary heart disease 7, shifting sources of protein in the U.S. diet may contribute to the prevention of stroke.

Design We examined agricultural supply and dietary intake databases from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US Department of Health and Human Services and the FAO to describe their methodology and to report the most recent estimates for meat and protein consumption. Results Together, loss-adjusted agricultural supply data and dietary recall data provide the best available estimates of US consumption; the most recent sources indicated that US citizens (ages 2 years and over) consume 4\u00b74\u20135\u00b79 oz (125\u00b79\u2013166\u00b75 g) of total meat and 6\u00b72\u20137\u00b74 oz-eq (175\u00b72\u2013209\u00b74 g-eq) from the USDA Protein Foods Group per day. Meat constitutes the majority of intake within the Protein Foods Group, and red meat and processed meat constitute the majority of total meat intake. Nutrient supply data indicate that total meat represents an estimated 43\u00b71 % of the total protein available in the US food supply, but without any loss-adjusted nutrient data, per capita protein intake is best estimated by dietary recall data to be 79\u00b79 g/d. Conclusions In order to address public health concerns related to excess meat and/or protein consumption, practitioners, educators and researchers must appropriately use available data sources in order to accurately report consumption at the population level. Implications for comparing these estimates with various recommended intakes are discussed.

An increasing number of epidemiological studies have shown a connection between meat consumption (especially red and processed meat) and health problems such as heart disease( Reference Pan, Sun and Bernstein 1 , Reference Sinha, Cross and Graubard 2 ), stroke( Reference Kaluza, Wolk and Larsson 3 ), diabetes( Reference Pan, Sun and Bernstein 4 , Reference Micha, Wallace and Mozaffarian 5 ), obesity( Reference Vergnaud, Norat and Romaguera 6 ) and certain cancers( Reference Pan, Sun and Bernstein 1 , Reference Sinha, Cross and Graubard 2 , Reference Cho, Spiegelman and Hunter 7 \u2013 Reference Norat and Riboli 10 ). Environmental scientists have implicated meat production, particularly industrial animal production systems, in contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and resource depletion and pollution( 11 ). Additional concerns include animal welfare, food safety, occupational and community health, and social and economic justice( 11 ). Noting the health and environmental problems associated with high meat consumption, public health experts have called for a reduction in consumption of meat and other animal products in high-income countries( Reference Horrigan, Lawrence and Walker 12 , Reference McMichael, Powles and Butler 13 ). Similarly, the UN Environment Programme\u2019s 2012 report concluded, \u2018experts agree that developed countries should reduce their relative consumption of meat and dairy products\u2026\u2019( 14 ) (p. ix). Meatless Monday, a campaign launched in 2003 with the goal of encouraging individuals to \u2018cut out meat one day a week\u2019, has since become a global movement with programmes in more than thirty countries. Given the disproportionate meat consumption in developed nations (and the USA in particular)( Reference Daniel, Cross and Koebnick 15 ), the current paper focuses primarily on meat consumption in the USA. In order for educators, scholars and advocates to effectively address these health and environmental concerns and to develop recommendations for more healthy and sustainable levels of meat consumption, a critical first step is to provide an accurate estimate of consumption. However, conflicting consumption estimates are widespread in the literature and in media sources, depending on the data source, analysis and definition of \u2018meat\u2019. Footnote * For example, Daniel et al. (2011) used national dietary intake data to estimate average US total meat intake per person to be 4\u00b75 oz/d (128 g/d)( Reference Daniel, Cross and Koebnick 15 ). In April 2012, The Economist reported on international meat consumption statistics using FAO agricultural supply data and showed that the USA is the second highest meat-eating country with a per capita estimate of 125 kg/year, or about 12\u00b70 oz/d (340\u00b72 g/d)( 16 ). Dietary intake and agricultural supply data are created using very different methodologies, making reconciling these large discrepancies a daunting task. Concerns are also being raised over developing dietary guidelines around meat consumption using underestimated dietary intake data( Reference Hallstr\u00f6m and B\u00f6rjesson 17 ). Furthermore, in many data sources, meat intake is difficult to unravel from protein intake since meat is often categorized with other protein-rich foods and has become virtually synonymous with protein. Historically, the national Dietary Guidelines and food guides from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Health and Human Services have included \u2018meat\u2019 in the title of this food group even though it contained red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and beans (i.e. \u2018Meat Group\u2019 from the 1992 Food Guide Pyramid, \u2018Meat and Beans Group\u2019 from the 2005 MyPyramid). However, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2010 and the MyPlate food guidance system renamed the group \u2018Protein Foods Group\u2019 to encompass protein-rich sources of foods in the US diet (meat, seafood, eggs, soya-based products, legumes, nuts and seeds). Yet these \u2018protein foods\u2019 supply only half (53\u00b71 %) of the protein available in the US food supply; other important contributors of protein in the US food supply include grain products, dairy products and vegetables( 18 ). This subtle shift in food group terminology (from \u2018meat\u2019 to \u2018protein foods\u2019) has had several important implications for the communication and understanding of dietary guidance regarding meat and protein consumption; therefore, the present paper includes data on both meat and protein to help elucidate a discussion of these implications. Specific federal guidance on daily meat consumption is generally lacking in the USA despite the growing body of evidence to support reducing meat intake, particularly of red and processed meats. Notably, one of the four major findings of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee involved meat intake, with the recommendation to: \u2018Shift food intake patterns to a more plant-based diet... and consume only moderate amounts of lean meats, poultry, and eggs\u2019( 19 ) (p. 2). However, the 2010 DGA ultimately included only broad recommendations to decrease saturated fat intake; choose a variety of protein foods; and increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and seafood( 20 ). The MyPlate food guide( 20 ) and related USDA Food Pattern tables( 21 ), which translate the DGA into suggested amounts and types of foods to consume, recommend 5\u00b75 meat ounce-equivalents Footnote \u2020 (oz-eq)/d( 20 ) (155\u00b79 g-eq/d) from the Protein Foods Group for most individuals consuming a 2000 kcal (8368 kJ) diet. Within the omnivore dietary pattern, this can include up to 4\u00b75 oz (127\u00b76 g) of meat (including meat, poultry and seafood) per day. Leading health organizations, including the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research( 22 ), have more specifically addressed the need for reducing the intake of red and processed meat. After their independent, scientific review of all of the available cancer literature, the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research found convincing evidence that red and processed meat increase the risk of colorectal cancer and recommended limiting red meat to 10\u00b76 oz (300 g) per week or 1\u00b75 oz/d (42\u00b79 g/d) and avoiding processed meat completely( 22 ). The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee also found the evidence substantial enough to recommend reducing intake of red and processed meat in favour of plant-based alternatives in its most recent scientific report( 23 ). Ultimately, understanding the methods, strengths and limitations of the various meat and protein data sources is critical for accurate interpretations and applications. The present paper seeks to provide clarity on the meanings and conclusions of the two main types of data sources available for estimating US meat and protein consumption: (i) agricultural supply; and (ii) dietary intake. We describe these two different methods commonly used for estimating meat and protein consumption in terms of their relative strengths and limitations, provide the most recent data available, and then make recommendations for appropriate applications and interpretations. Focusing primarily on US data, the goal of the paper is to increase understanding of meat and protein consumption data among practitioners, educators and researchers and to facilitate greater accessibility of these data for messaging to target audiences about the health impacts of meat consumption. Methods Overview In order to provide estimates of US meat and protein consumption, we accessed US national (USDA) and international (FAO) agricultural supply, as well as national dietary intake (Department of Health and Human Services) databases. In this Methods section, we describe both types of data sources and their underlying methodology. Agricultural supply data The primary source of US agricultural supply data is the Economic Research Service (ERS) arm of the USDA. The ERS Food Availability Per Capita Data System measures US food supply based on production estimates and does not measure actual intake. Information about data collection and analysis, as well as data sets in MicroSoft\u00ae Excel format, are available on the ERS website( 24 ). Three data series are maintained and updated annually: (i) unadjusted food availability; (ii) loss-adjusted food availability; and (iii) nutrient availability. An international source from FAO also collects agricultural supply data by country. US Department of Agriculture food availability (unadjusted) The Food Availability data set( 24 ) measures the amount of food (by type of commodity) available for human consumption in the USA. Data have been collected since 1941, and are estimated as far back as 1909. Data are available for total meat, as well as meat types, including red meat (beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton), poultry (broilers, mature chicken, turkey), and fish and seafood. \u2018Total food availability\u2019 consists of the sum of beginning stock, production and imports minus the sum of \u2018measurable nonfood uses\u2019, such as exports, farm inputs, industrial uses and ending stock. Not all non-food uses are feasible to measure, so the estimates can include, for example, meat that ultimately is used in pet food or exported as an ingredient in processed food. The estimates for meat availability are based on slaughtering facilities\u2019 records, so the reported data refer to the \u2018carcass weight\u2019. The carcass weight includes not only the edible meat portion, but also the bones, fat, ligaments, tendons and inedible trimmings. The ERS also provides data on \u2018retail weight\u2019, which may or may not include bone, fat and added water; and \u2018consumer (boneless, trimmed) weight\u2019, which includes separable fat but not bones. US Department of Agriculture loss-adjusted food availability To more closely estimate actual food intake, the ERS has developed a preliminary data series called \u2018loss-adjusted food availability\u2019 data( 24 ), with estimates calculated as far back as 1970. The loss-adjusted data are constructed by subtracting non-edible parts of foods and estimated losses (including losses at \u2018farm-to-retail\u2019, \u2018at retail\u2019 and \u2018at consumer\u2019 levels) from the food availability data. For example, in the case of chicken, the 2012 loss percentage from farm-to-retail weight was 39\u00b78 %, retail was 4\u00b70 % and consumer was 15\u00b70 %. Currently, the farm-to-retail loss is based on commodity weight. Retail-level loss rates were obtained by comparing 2005\u20132006 supplier shipment data with point-of-sales data from over 600 stores of six large supermarket chains( Reference Buzby, Wells and Axtman 25 ). Consumer-level loss rates were obtained by comparing food purchasing data (scanned Universal Product Code labels from approximately 40 000 households and random-weight foods from approximately 7500 households in 2004) and food consumption data (based on the 2003\u20132004 National Heath and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which included two 24 h dietary recalls from approximately 10 000 individuals)( Reference Muth, Karns and Nielsen 26 ). The loss-adjusted data series also combine the data into food groups to facilitate comparison to federal dietary recommendations. However, unlike the MyPlate Protein Foods Group, the USDA loss-adjusted food availability protein foods grouping does not include seeds, soya products, and may or may not include legumes. US Department of Agriculture nutrient availability (unadjusted) Nutrient availability data are estimates of the amount of nutrients available for human consumption in the USA by type of commodity and are calculated by multiplying the amount of each nutrient found in the edible portion of each commodity. The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion maintains the data and bases its calculations on ERS unadjusted food availability data. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion website provides the most recent data tables, which show total protein per capita and percentage of protein contribution from major food groups for the years 1909\u20132010( 18 ). We include these data for their relevancy to estimating protein consumption and to help distinguish data on protein (the macronutrient) from data on protein-rich foods. FAO food availability While the primary focus of the present paper is US data sources, useful comparisons of US agricultural supply can be made to international data sources. The FAO compiles food production and disappearance data from 190 FAO member countries dating back to 1961. The data are made publicly available annually on the online database, FAOSTAT, and the most recent available data set is for 2011( 27 ). Food Balance Sheets show the total per capita availability for human consumption for specific food items (\u2018per capita supply\u2019), which is based on the total amount produced in and imported into the country (\u2018supply\u2019), adjusted for exports and uses other than for human consumption (\u2018utilization\u2019)( 27 ). The Food Balance Sheets also specify the amount of protein supplied by these food items. FAO per capita food supply data represent the quantity of food that reaches the consumer; adjustments are made for losses at the farm, distribution and processing levels, but not for consumer waste( 27 ). FAO categorizes total meat as the sum of beef, goat, sheep, pork, poultry and other game; fish and seafood are a separate category( 27 ). Dietary intake data In addition to agricultural supply data, the federal government also collects dietary intake data, namely through 24 h dietary recalls (24HR) and FFQ, to estimate the amount of foods and nutrients actually consumed by individuals. In the present paper we focus on the NHANES dietary intake interview component, What We Eat in America (WWEIA). Maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, NHANES provides data on the health and nutritional status of the US population through a combination of interviews and physical assessments( 28 ). To create a nationally representative sample, participants are assigned a numerical sample weight which incorporates several types of adjustment, including the probability of unequal selection in the sample, some types of non-response, and sizes of sub-populations of age, sex and racial/ethnic categories( 29 ). Currently, WWEIA involves two days of 24HR. Footnote * The National Center for Health Statistics is responsible for obtaining a nationally representative sample, while the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service processes the data using the food and nutrient databases it maintains. The most recent WWEIA (2011\u20132012) contains easily accessible data tables that provide estimates of average consumption of meat, protein foods and protein at the population level, by sex and age, by race/ethnicity and by income. The Food Pattern Equivalent Intake Data Tables( 30 ) provide intake estimates for meat and protein foods. The Nutrient Intake Data Tables( 31 ) provide intake estimates for protein as a macronutrient. For more detailed analyses, researchers can download data from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS)( 32 ) and the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED)( 33 ). FPED classifies meat intake reported in the 2011\u20132012 WWEIA 24HR into the defined ounce-equivalents of the MyPlate Protein Foods Group. Meat is defined as \u2018cooked lean meat\u2019; as a result, any \u2018excess fat\u2019 Footnote \u2020 consumed in meat products is included in the discretionary solid fat group. FPED subgroups in the Protein Foods Group include: (red) meat (unprocessed beef, pork, veal, lamb and game); poultry (unprocessed chicken, turkey and other); cured meat (processed meat such as sausage and luncheon meats); organ meats (red meat and poultry); seafood (fish and shellfish high in n-3 fatty acids and fish and shellfish low in n-3 fatty acids); eggs; soya products; and nuts and seeds. At the researcher\u2019s discretion, legumes can be counted in either the Vegetable Group or the Protein Foods Group, but not in both groups simultaneously. Footnote \u2021 Results Per capita availability and intake estimates Meat estimates The most recent USDA Food Availability data indicate that the amount of meat (red meat, poultry and fish) available in the 2012 US food supply was 11\u00b76 oz/capita per d (330\u00b70 g/d); after adjusting for estimated losses, the availability was 5\u00b79 oz/capita per d (166\u00b75 g/d). International FAO data, most recently accessible from 2011, indicate that the amount of meat (red meat, poultry and fish) available in the food supply at that time was 13\u00b75 oz/capita per d (382\u00b74 g/d). According to 2011\u20132012 NHANES, WWEIA data, the average daily amount of cooked lean meat (red meat, poultry, fish; excess fat excluded) consumed by individuals ages 2 years and over was 4\u00b74 oz/d (125\u00b79 g/d). The amount of processed meat (frankfurters, sausage and luncheon meats; excess fat excluded) was 1\u00b70 oz/d (27\u00b78 g/d), or 22 % of total meat consumed. See Table 1 for further details.

The FAO treenuts and oilcrops categories (oilcrops include peanuts, coconuts, and seed oils such as sesame seed) were combined to create a comparable \u2018nuts and seeds\u2019 category. |||| The USDA MyPlate Protein Foods Group includes total meat, eggs, soya products, nuts and seeds, and may or may not include legumes. ERS agricultural supply data do not include soyabean products or seeds in this group. Protein Foods Group estimates The 2012 food availability estimate for foods included in the USDA Protein Foods Group (meat, eggs, nuts and legumes; ERS data on soya products and seeds unavailable) was 13\u00b79 oz/d (393\u00b74 g/d); after adjusting for estimated losses, the availability was 7\u00b74 oz/d (209\u00b74 g/d). The latter can also be reported as \u2018meat ounce-equivalent\u2019 servings( 24 ), 7\u00b76 oz-eq (215\u00b72 g-eq). The 2011 FAO estimate for protein-rich foods (total meat, eggs, nuts and legumes) was 15\u00b79 oz/d (451\u00b70 g/d). Based on the 2011\u20132012 NHANES, WWEIA intake data, the amount of food from the MyPlate Protein Foods Group (red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, soya products, nuts, seeds, legumes) consumed was 6\u00b72 oz-eq/d (175\u00b72 g-eq/d) per capita (ages 2 years and over), 8\u00b73 oz-eq/d (234\u00b75 g-eq/d) for males (ages 20 years and over) and 5\u00b72 oz-eq/d (148\u00b73 g-eq/d) for females (ages 20 years and over). See Table 1 for further details. Protein estimates Per capita protein estimates are available from NHANES dietary intake data, USDA nutrient availability data and FAO nutrient availability data. The USDA and FAO protein availability data do not account for losses; as such, these data are not suitable proxies for protein consumption estimates. For protein intake, dietary intake data provide the more appropriate estimate of consumption. According to 2011\u20132012 NHANES, WWEIA data, the average daily amount of protein consumed by individuals ages 2 years and over was 79\u00b79 g, which represented 14\u00b79 % of total energy. For adults (ages 20 years and over), the average daily protein intake was 98\u00b78 g for males (15\u00b74 % of energy) and 68\u00b71 g for females (14\u00b79 % of energy). While unadjusted nutrient data are not useful for estimating the total amount of per capita protein consumed in the US food supply, the total protein data (120 g/d, 2010 USDA unadjusted; 109\u00b72 g/d, 2011 FAO) are useful as a reference point for estimating the per capita percentage of total protein contribution by food type. According to 2010 USDA protein availability data, meat products (red meat, poultry and fish) represented an estimated 43\u00b71 % of the total protein available per capita in the US food supply. Within the meat group, red meat accounted for over half of the protein availability (60\u00b79 %), while poultry accounted for 31\u00b75 % and fish accounted for 7\u00b76 %. Animal products (including meat, dairy and eggs) represented an estimated 65\u00b76 % of the total protein available in the US food supply. Other major sources of protein in the food supply included grain products, vegetables, legumes, nuts and soya. 2011 FAO data estimates indicated that approximately 65 % of the protein available was from animal sources (70\u00b77 g) and 35 % was from plant sources (38\u00b75 g). Dietary intake data have also been used to report the per capita percentage of protein contribution (typically by food type, as opposed to food group). For example, O\u2019Neil et al.( Reference O\u2019Neil, Keast and Fulgoni 34 ) used 2003\u20132006 NHANES data to rank food sources of protein in adults ages 19 years and over; the leading protein contributors were poultry (14\u00b74.%) and beef (14\u00b70 %). See Table 2 for protein estimates. Table 2 Protein contribution of major food groups to the US diet based on agricultural supply data USDA, US Department of Agriculture; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. * Agricultural nutrient supply data are unadjusted for losses. As a result, these data are not appropriate for estimating total protein consumption; however, they are useful for estimating the percentage of protein contribution by food group. Dietary intake data provide the best estimate of total consumption (79\u00b79 g/d for individuals ages 2 years and over). 2011\u20132012 NHANES protein intake data tables can be accessed at ttp://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/1112/Table_1_NIN_GEN_11.pdf. \u2020 2010 USDA protein availability data tables can be accessed at http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/USFoodSupply-1909-2010. \u2021 2011 FAO protein availability data tables can be accessed at http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/FBS/E. FAO categories were compiled to be comparable to USDA categories. In the FAO system, the above Vegetables category includes vegetables+starchy roots; Legumes, nuts and soya=pulses+treenuts+oilcrops; Dairy products=milk excluding butter; Fats and oils=animal fats+vegetable oils; and Miscellaneous/Other=alcoholic beverages+spices+stimulants. Discussion Choosing an appropriate data source The present paper describes two major categories of data for estimating per capita meat consumption: agricultural supply and dietary intake. An understanding of the definitions, strengths and limitations associated with each data source is critical to appropriately applying these data. Agricultural supply is an objective measure of food availability, but does not directly measure intake. Dietary intake, on the other hand, is a direct estimate of intake, but is hampered by self-report bias. Objective measures of household food purchasing behaviour, such as researcher-conducted household food inventories, food purchase records and receipts, and Universal Product Code scans( Reference French, Shimotsu and Wall 35 ), although proxies for intake, might improve the accuracy of intake estimates. While less biased than self-report measures, these are still not perfect measures; they require adjustment for food waste and, as the data are presented as average consumption per household member, they do not account for differences in consumption between household members. In the UK, for example, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs tracks the annual food and drink purchases of approximately 6000 households using self-report diaries of all food purchases in its Family Food data set( 36 ). These purchases are used to approximate energy and nutrient intakes, which according to one study most closely match predicted intakes from physical activity energy expenditures compared with FAO agricultural supply data and the UK\u2019s National Diet and Nutrition Survey (a dietary recall survey akin to NHANES)( Reference Millward 37 ). Although an equivalent annual data source does not exist in the USA, the USDA surveyed the first nationally representative sample of 4826 households about household food purchases and acquisitions in its National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) in 2012\u20132013( 38 ). FoodAPS data files have not yet been publicly released and it is not yet known whether these data sets will include estimates of energy and nutrient intakes. An important limitation of both agricultural supply and dietary intake data sources is that an average does not capture the extent to which there is meaningful variation between individuals (some individuals eat little or no meat, while others consume very high amounts). Additionally, \u2018per capita\u2019 refers to individuals aged 2 years and over, and consumption varies by age and other demographic factors. While sub-population data for dietary intake data are available to investigate differences in average consumption of groups categorized by different demographic factors, such data still do not account for variation between individuals within demographic groups. Agricultural supply data cannot adjust for either of these limitations. We provide a summary of the various data sources commonly used to estimate per capita (ages 2 years and over) meat and protein consumption amounts and trends (Table 1); however, it is important to note that direct comparisons between data sources are problematic given the differing definitions of meat and data collection methods. Using agricultural supply data to estimate US meat and protein consumption amounts can potentially lead to misleading and inconsistent conclusions. For instance, the per capita total meat (red meat, poultry, fish) availability estimate is 13\u00b75 oz/d (382\u00b74 g/d) using FAO data, 11\u00b76 oz/d (330\u00b70 g/d) when using USDA unadjusted data and 5\u00b79 oz/d (166\u00b75 g/d) when using USDA loss-adjusted data. Agricultural supply data provide an objective measure that can be a useful indicator of consumption patterns or trends over time (from 1909 with the unadjusted and from 1970 with the loss-adjusted), but should not be interpreted as actual consumption amounts. For agricultural supply data, the USDA loss-adjusted food availability data set provides a more realistic proxy for consumption than the unadjusted data set on a per capita basis, but is not a direct measure of consumption. The unadjusted food availability and nutrient availability data sets are not adjusted for losses and should not be used as a proxy for consumption. The accuracy of the FAO global food supply data ultimately depends on the quality of the data provided by each country, which may have been produced using different methods and assumptions. Still, this level of data permits sufficient international comparisons and has been widely referenced in reports produced by FAO and other global organizations( 39 ). Dietary intake data have the distinct advantage of directly estimating consumption, but with known strengths and limitations. One important limitation is that individuals systematically under-report total energy and protein intakes in dietary recalls. One study found that the disparity between reported energy intakes across 1971\u20132010 NHANES surveys and estimates of total energy expenditure (TEE) was 18 % of TEE for women (\u2212365 kcal/d (\u20131527 kJ/d)) and 10 % of TEE for men (\u2212281 kcal/d (\u20131176 kJ/d))( Reference Archer, Hand and Blair 40 ). Findings from the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition (OPEN) Study, in which 24HR were compared with unbiased biomarkers of energy and protein intakes (e.g. doubly labelled water and urinary nitrogen), indicated significant under-reporting in 24HR( Reference Subar, Kipnis and Troiano 41 ). In that study, under-reporting of TEE was slightly greater than under-reporting of protein intake. On average, men under-reported TEE by 12\u201314 % and protein intake by 11\u201312 % in 24HR and women under-reported TEE by 16\u201320 % and protein intake by 11\u201315 %. Because under-reporting tends to vary between foods( Reference Krebs-Smith, Graubard and Kahle 42 ), TEE and protein intake, these estimates might not serve as accurate proxies for estimating Protein Foods Group under-reporting. Dietary recalls can also be hampered by random error, since they represent only a snapshot in time and are not necessarily representative of what an individual typically consumes from day to day or throughout different seasons. To address this issue, the National Cancer Institute pioneered a sophisticated statistical analysis that aims to represent a person\u2019s usual (long-term average) daily intake of a nutrient or food( 43 ). For many research purposes, usual intake is the preferred type of analysis; however, when reporting usual intake at the population level (as is the case in the current paper), these adjustments are unnecessary( 29 ). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, NHANES day 1 dietary recall is an appropriate measure of the population\u2019s usual or long-term average intake( 44 ). Despite these limitations of self-report recall data, in a large nationally representative sample such as NHANES, a single 24 h recall should provide a useful, although likely under-reported, estimate of the average meat intake at the population level. In contrast to agricultural supply data, dietary intake data can be used to estimate consumption of sub-populations based on age, sex, ethnicity or other factors. However, the most common application of NHANES data on meat intake in the mainstream and scientific literature is to report on national average intake amounts using the most recently available NHANES, WWEIA data from FPED; but these analyses can vary widely depending on the researchers\u2019 purposes, years of data used, sample selection criteria, and definition and categories of \u2018meat\u2019 used( Reference Daniel, Cross and Koebnick 15 , 16 , Reference Wang and Beydoun 45 ). FPED is a useful database for obtaining food group consumption estimates from NHANES dietary recall data, although analysis using this database requires NHANES data training and access to statistical software. As a result, NHANES data are also not as accessible for analysis of intake trends over time compared with the USDA food availability databases. Processed meat has its own category in FPED, which allows important assessments of processed meat consumption, but unfortunately the category combines processed red meat and poultry, so it is not possible to provide a total estimate of red meat or poultry consumption that includes both processed and unprocessed meat. Additionally, all of the meat categories are defined as cooked lean meat \u2013 excess fat is not included in the total and is instead placed into a separate food category. Regarding the sources of protein as a macronutrient, USDA and FAO agricultural supply data are useful for estimating protein consumption trends and percentages available in the food supply, but not for estimating actual consumption amounts since they are not adjusted for all losses. FNDDS 5\u00b70 can be used to obtain protein consumption estimates from NHANES dietary recall data and is probably the best source for estimating consumption of this macronutrient. Estimated ranges for US per capita meat, protein foods and protein consumption Unfortunately, there are no data sources that provide a flawless estimate of average US per capita consumption of meat and protein-rich foods. However, loss-adjusted agricultural supply data and dietary recall data provide better estimates than unadjusted agricultural supply data. Despite methodological differences, some useful comparisons can be made between loss-adjusted agricultural supply and dietary intake data to provide estimated ranges for per capita US meat and protein consumption. Namely, the ERS\u2019 loss-adjusted availability data set that includes conversions to MyPlate meat ounce-equivalent servings can be fruitfully compared with NHANES intake data and dietary recommendations. For instance, the per capita total meat (red meat, poultry, fish) consumption estimate is 5\u00b79 oz-eq/d (166\u00b75 g-eq/d) using the 2012 loss-adjusted agricultural supply data, which is similar to the estimated 4\u00b74 oz-eq/d (125\u00b79 g-eq/d) for total cooked lean meat obtained from 2011\u20132012 NHANES dietary intake data. This similarity can be expected since the agricultural supply loss adjustment at the consumer level is based in part on NHANES data. The per capita consumption from the Protein Foods Group is 7\u00b76 oz-eq/d (215\u00b72 g-eq/d) using the 2012 loss-adjusted agricultural supply data (including total meat, eggs, nuts and legumes), compared with the estimated 6\u00b72 oz-eq/d (175\u00b72 g-eq/d) obtained from 2011\u20132012 NHANES data (including total meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, soya products and legumes). There are no loss-adjusted agricultural supply nutrient data, so protein intake must be estimated using NHANES data (79\u00b79 g/capita; 98\u00b78 g or 15\u00b74 % of energy for adult males and 68\u00b71 g or 14\u00b79 % of energy for adult females). Data comparisons to dietary recommendations One important application of these data is the comparison of meat and protein consumption estimates to established dietary recommendations in order to determine how a population is meeting its nutritional needs. While these comparisons abound in the media and other lay reports, they are often fraught with error and should be interpreted as cautiously as the consumption estimate used. As mentioned in the introduction, specific US federal guidance on daily meat consumption is generally lacking, although broad recommendations can be found in the 2010 DGA( 20 ) and more detailed recommendations based on energy intake can be found in the MyPlate food guide( 20 ) and in the USDA Food Pattern tables( 21 ). These sources suggest that individuals consuming a 2000 kcal (8368 kJ) diet should consume approximately 5\u00b75 oz-eq/d( 22 ) (155\u00b79 g-eq/d) from the Protein Foods Group with anywhere from 0 to 4\u00b75 oz/d (0 to 127\u00b76 g/d) coming from meat, poultry or seafood( 21 ). Based on our above estimated current intake ranges for the Protein Foods Group (6\u00b72\u20137\u00b76 oz-eq (175\u00b72\u2013215\u00b72 g-eq)) and for total meat (4\u00b74\u20135\u00b79 oz/d (125\u00b79\u2013166\u00b75 g/d)), we could conclude that Americans well exceed these recommendations. However, caution should be given in generalizing these conclusions since using the 2000 kcal (8368 kJ) reference intake does not apply to all Americans. With the more broad recommendations in the 2010 DGA to diversify protein sources, we can comfortably conclude that Americans are not yet achieving this goal since meat constitutes the majority of intake from the Protein Foods Group (71 %, 2011\u20132012 NHANES; 78 %, 2012 USDA loss-adjusted). Consumption of red and processed meat also greatly exceeds the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research\u2019s recommendations to limit red meat to 1\u00b75 oz/d (42\u00b79 g/d) and to avoid processed meat completely( 22 ). Loss-adjusted food availability data from 2012 indicate that the average per capita consumption of red meat (processed and unprocessed) is 3\u00b71 oz/d (88\u00b75 g/d) or 53 % of the total meat intake; while NHANES 2011\u20132012 data indicate that the US consumption is 1\u00b76 oz/capita per d (44\u00b72 g/d) for unprocessed red meat (35 % of the total meat; data on total red meat are not available) and 1\u00b70 oz/capita per d (27\u00b78 g/d) for processed meat (red meat and poultry; 22 % of the total meat). Epidemiological studies have illuminated the increased health risks associated with red and processed meat consumption( Reference Sinha, Cross and Graubard 2 , Reference Kaluza, Wolk and Larsson 3 , Reference Micha, Wallace and Mozaffarian 5 \u2013 Reference Norat and Riboli 10 ), along with the decreased health risks associated with replacing red meat for equal servings of poultry, fish and plant-based foods( Reference Pan, Sun and Bernstein 1 , Reference Pan, Sun and Bernstein 4 , Reference Daniel, Cross and Graubard 46 ). With this preponderance of evidence, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee most recently recommended reducing intake of red and processed meat in favour of plant-based alternatives in its scientific report released in February 2015( 23 ). For protein as a macronutrient, comparisons of mean intake estimates to federal recommendations are more difficult to make. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine establishes nutrient reference values for the USA and Canada, called Dietary Reference Intakes( 47 ). For protein, Dietary Reference Intakes include the RDA (0\u00b780 g/kg per d for most adults) and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; 0\u00b766 g/kg per d for most adults). The RDA is \u2018the average daily nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group\u2019( 47 ) (p. 3) and is intended for assessing the probability of inadequate intake for an individual( 48 ). The EAR is \u2018the average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group\u2019( 47 ) (p. 3) and is intended for assessing the prevalence of inadequate intake for groups( 48 ). Although mean intake (as reported in the present paper) is commonly compared with both the EAR and RDA, neither comparison is considered appropriate for assessing adequate nutrient intake of groups( 48 ). However, the EAR can appropriately be compared with usual intake (average daily intake over time) for the purpose of assessing the risk of protein deficiency in a population( 48 , Reference Moshfegh, Goldman and Cleveland 49 ). This comparison involves an analysis of the usual intake distribution, rather than a simple comparison to the population mean intake( 48 , Reference Moshfegh, Goldman and Cleveland 49 ). An example of an appropriate application is the USDA\u2019s comparison of NHANES 2001\u20132002 usual intake data to the EAR, which found very little risk of protein deficiency in the US population: protein consumption fell under the EAR in only 3 % of the population( Reference Moshfegh, Goldman and Cleveland 49 ). Conclusion Meat consumption is a hotly debated topic. Public health concerns include not only meeting nutritional requirements, but also reducing the incidence of chronic diseases and global food insecurity. A critical first step in addressing these issues is to accurately estimate the amount of meat consumption at the population level. The present paper sought to clarify and summarize the various agricultural supply and dietary intake data sources available for estimating US meat, protein foods and protein consumption. We caution practitioners, educators and researchers when interpreting or choosing among these estimates for meat, protein foods and/or protein to be aware of their respective strengths, limitations and appropriate applications as described throughout this paper. Despite the various limitations, complexities of the data sources and the current lack of federal guidance on meat consumption, we can comfortably conclude that there is ample room within the typical US diet to maintain adequate protein intake while shifting dietary patterns to include more nutrient-dense plant-based foods and less animal-based foods. Specific federal recommendations regarding amount of meat intake, and red and processed meat intake in particular, could make a significant step towards raising awareness and improving public health.

Footnotes * Meat and protein foods consumption data are typically reported in ounces in the USA and in grams internationally. Protein (as a macronutrient) data are typically reported in grams in the USA and internationally. To maintain applicability and readability to a diverse readership, we report meat and protein foods intake in both ounces and grams. To convert ounces to grams, we multiplied the number of ounces (rounded to two decimal places) by 28\u00b73495. \u2020 The use of \u2018ounce-equivalents\u2019 allows comparisons within food groups. In the MyPlate Protein Foods Group, an ounce-equivalent is equal to 1 oz of cooked lean meat. We have also included a conversion from ounce-equivalents to gram-equivalents (g-eq) to report the amounts in metric units. * Historical and methodological details are available on the NHANES website, available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. \u2020 The allowable amount is 2\u00b763 g of fat per ounce of meat. The amount that exceeds the allowable amount is considered excess fat. \u2021 Legumes can be included in either the Vegetable Group or the Protein Foods Group. However, the amount of legumes (in ounces) must be multiplied by four in order to convert to a meat ounce-equivalent. Where applicable, we converted legumes to meat ounce-equivalents prior to inclusion in the protein foods category. References 1 Pan, A, Sun, Q, Bernstein, AM et al.

How will FDA ensure that animal producers and veterinarians are no longer using the affected medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes like growth enhancement or feed efficiency? 1. What is FDA doing? FDA is taking action to promote the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food animals. The goal of the strategy is to work with industry to protect public health by releasing two documents to help phase out the use of medically important antimicrobials in food animals for production purposes (e.g., to enhance growth or improve feed efficiency), and to bring the therapeutic uses of such drugs (to treat, control, or prevent specific diseases) under the oversight of licensed veterinarians. The first document, New Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI #209 (Guidance #213), provides guidance for drug companies to voluntarily revise the FDA-approved labeled use conditions to (a) remove the use of antimicrobial drugs for production purposes; (b) add, where appropriate, scientifically-supported disease treatment, control or prevention uses; and (c) change the marketing status from over-the-counter to Veterinary Feed Directive for drugs administered through feed or to prescription status for drugs administered through water in order to provide for veterinary oversight or consultation. In order to help phase in veterinary oversight of those drugs that move from OTC to VFD status once changes are made in line with the guidance, FDA is also releasing a proposed rule for public comment that would update the agency\u2019s existing regulations relating to VFD drugs. The use of VFD drugs in feed requires specific authorization by a licensed veterinarian based on procedures outlined in the agency\u2019s VFD regulations. The VFD proposed rule is intended to update the existing VFD process to clarify and increase the flexibility of the administrative requirements for the distribution and use of VFD drugs. Such updates to the VFD process will assist in the transition of OTC products to their new VFD status. Back to the top 2. What are antimicrobial drugs and antimicrobial resistance, and what is the difference between an antibiotic and an antimicrobial? Antimicrobial drugs include all drugs that work against a variety of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. An antibiotic drug is effective against bacteria. All antibiotics are antimicrobials, but not all antimicrobials are antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance is when bacteria or other microbes become resistant to the effects of a drug after being exposed to it. This means that the drug, and similar drugs, will no longer be effective against those microbes. Antimicrobial resistance is a complex phenomenon with many causes. We know that all uses of antimicrobials, whether in humans or animals, can spur resistance. Sometimes resistance even occurs spontaneously. Back to the top 3. What do you mean by \u201cproduction purposes\u201d? \u201cProduction purposes,\u201d as used in the two documents FDA is releasing, refers to the use of these products with the intent of enhancing growth (to make animals grow faster) or to improve feed efficiency (the animals need less food to gain weight). Back to the top 4. What types of drugs are the focus of FDA\u2019s strategy? This action focuses on antimicrobial drugs that are: \u201cMedically important\u201d drugs* (i.e., important for treating human disease); Currently FDA-approved to be used for production purposes, such as to enhance growth or improve feed efficiency; Available over-the-counter; and Used in feed or drinking water of food-producing animals. *A list of medically important drugs is available in Appendix A of Guidance for Industry #152, Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to Their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concern. Back to the top 5. Why are you taking this collaborative (voluntary) approach? FDA believes that the collaborative approach is the fastest way to implement the changes outlined in Guidance #213. We have worked with stakeholders, including animal pharmaceutical companies, to encourage their cooperation on this important public health issue, and we are confident in their support. The key aspect of FDA\u2019s strategy is the request that animal drug sponsors (those who own the right to market the product) voluntarily work with FDA to revise the approved use conditions for their medically important antimicrobial drug products to remove production uses (such as growth enhancement or feed efficiency), and bring the remaining therapeutic uses under veterinary oversight. Once manufacturers voluntarily make these changes, products can no longer be used for production purposes and therapeutic use of these products would require veterinary oversight. FDA also believes strongly that sick animals need treatment, and that these antimicrobial drugs should remain available for the purposes of treating, controlling or preventing disease in food-producing animals. We consider this approach to be the most effective way to implement such changes in a way that is protective of both public and animal health. In contrast, initiating regulatory action would require that the agency proceed on a product by product basis, would likely create significantly more disruption to animal health/agriculture industry, and would require significantly more resources and time to implement. This collaborative approach, as outlined in GFI #213, is the quickest way to achieve the greatest degree of public health protection. Back to the top 6. How can FDA ensure that animal producers won\u2019t use these products the same way they always have, under the guise of \u201cpreventing\u201d disease? First, once product labeling is voluntarily changed, it will be a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to use these products in feed for production purposes. In addition, FDA\u2019s regulations on extralabel use do not permit drugs to be used in an extralabel manner for production purposes, whether administered through feed or otherwise, since the regulations do not permit extralabel use for nontherapeutic purposes. Second, it is important to note that all the products affected by this plan are currently available as over-the-counter (OTC) products. A key component of FDA\u2019s plan is to transition these products from their current OTC status to one that will require producers to have a prescription or order from a licensed veterinarian to obtain these products. FDA believes that the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs intended for use in food-producing animals should involve the oversight of licensed veterinarians given the importance of their scientific and clinical training and knowledge. In the case of prevention, a veterinarian practicing judicious use principles would consider relevant factors to determine the risk of a specific bacterial disease and whether it would be appropriate in a particular situation to use medically important antimicrobials for prevention purposes. For example, the veterinarian would consider the way the drug acts against the particular bacteria in question, whether it can effectively get to the place of infection, and how long the drug maintains effective levels at the site of infection. Other important factors veterinarians consider when determining whether a particular drug is appropriate for preventive use include whether: (1) there is evidence that the drug will be effective in treating the particular disease, (2) such preventive use is consistent with accepted veterinary practice, (3) the use is intended to address particular bacteria, (4) the use is appropriately targeted to animals at risk of developing a specific disease, and (5) there are no reasonable alternatives for intervention. For example, a veterinarian may determine, based on the client\u2019s production practices and history, that weaned beef calves arriving at a feedlot in bad weather after a lengthy transport are at risk to develop bacterial respiratory infection. In this case, the veterinarian might choose to preventively treat these calves with an antimicrobial approved for prevention of that bacterial infection. On the other hand, FDA would not consider a judicious use for prevention to be the administration of a drug to apparently healthy animals in the absence of any information that such animals were at risk of a specific disease. Back to the top 7. Why is the involvement of a veterinarian important? Currently, most antimicrobial drugs approved for use in food-producing animals through their feed or water are available over-the-counter. FDA believes that the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs intended for use in food-producing animals should involve the oversight of a licensed veterinarian, given the benefit of that individual\u2019s scientific and clinical training. This is because judicious use involves accurately identifying bacterial disease that is present or likely to be present, and selecting the suitable antimicrobial drug. The veterinarian\u2019s decision to use a specific approved drug or combination drug is based on factors such as the way the drug acts against the particular bacteria in question, whether it can effectively get to the place of infection, and how long the drug maintains effective levels at the site of infection. Back to the top 8. How will FDA determine whether its strategy has had a positive impact on slowing antimicrobial resistance to these drugs? FDA recognizes that it is important to identify ways to assess the effect of the changes over time. With this in mind, FDA recently proposed revisions to the annual summary report External Link Disclaimer of the amount of antimicrobials sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals and solicited public comment on these proposals. In addition, FDA currently collects data on antimicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens as part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. FDA is currently working in collaboration with other agencies including USDA and CDC to explore approaches for enhancing current data collection efforts. FDA anticipates seeking additional public input as it develops these enhancements. Back to the top 9. How will FDA ensure that animal producers and veterinarians are no longer using the affected medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes like growth enhancement or feed efficiency? FDA has been working closely with the American Veterinary Medical Association, other veterinary associations, and animal producer organizations, as well as holding listening sessions around the country to hear concerns from both producers and veterinarians. Based on this outreach, we are confident that animal producers and veterinarians understand the role that they play in ensuring that these important drugs are used appropriately and judiciously. By law, drugs administered through feed must be used according to the approved labeling. In addition, the extralabel use of approved drugs in animals by or on the lawful order of licensed veterinarians is limited to situations where the health of an animal is threatened or suffering or death may result from failure to treat. Therefore, once manufacturers voluntarily make these changes, medically important antimicrobial drugs can no longer be used for production purposes, and their continued use to treat, control, or prevent disease in food animals will require an order or prescription from a licensed veterinarian.

Although the data in the protein scorecard, and in the chart, are global means for current agricultural production\u2014masking variations among locations, production systems, and farm management practices\u2014they enable general comparisons across food types. Unlike many other studies, the comparison of food types in the protein scorecard and the chart incorporates both land used for pasture and greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in land use, using the GlobAgri-WRR model. \u201cFish\u201d data in the scorecard are for aquaculture (farmed fish) only. However, data from Tyedmers et al. (2005) and Monterey Bay Aquarium/Seafood Watch (2015) suggest that for production-related emissions and on a global mean basis, capture (wild) fisheries and aquaculture emissions are of a similar order of magnitude. While capture (wild) fisheries do not cause land-use change or land-use change emissions, if unsustainably managed they can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we felt comfortable overall listing \u201cfish\u201d on the scorecard as relatively on par with other lower-impact animal-based proteins on (eggs, poultry, pork). More detail on the resource use and environmental impacts of different food types is available in the Working Paper Shifting Diets for a Sustainable Food Future. See discussion around Figure 2 and Boxes 3\u20135. Notes on retail prices of different foods: Plant-based proteins can be cheaper than animal-based ones. For example, based on average US retail prices in 2013, the price per gram of protein ranged from 0.9 cents for dried lentils, 1.1 cents for wheat flour, 1.2 cents for dried black beans, and 2.3 cents for dried white rice, to 2.7 cents for eggs, 2.9 cents for milk, 3.1 cents for fresh whole chicken, and 4.4 cents for ground beef (Authors\u2019 calculations based on retail price data given in USDA/ERS 2015a, USDA/ERS 2015b, BLS 2015; and nutrient content data given in USDA 2015). Overall, our approach was to identify the least-processed type of food in each scorecard category, because processing adds to retail price and would distort comparisons among categories. To obtain other retail prices not available in the USDA and BLS datasets, the authors used the following sources (current 2016 prices as 2013 prices were not available): Scorecard category Food name Retail price per pound (US$) Protein content (100g) Calculated price per g protein (US cents) Source Corn Corn flour 0.47 8.46 1.23 http://www.walmart.com/c/kp/corn-flour Soy Soybeans, roasted, salted 3.99 38.55 2.28 https://nuts.com/snacks/soybeans/roasted-andsalted-whole.html Fish Tilapia fillets (farmed) 3.79 20.08 4.16 http://seafoodinternationaldigital.com/tilapia-sales-strengthen-at-us-supermarkets/ Lamb & goat Lamb stew meat 5.53 20.21 6.03 https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lswlnvfeatures.pdf Nuts Raw almonds 8.99 21.15 9.37 http://www.thenutbox.com/Nuts-s/1.htm Because retail prices can vary between markets and over time, we presented them as general ranges ($, $$, $$$) so as not to give of a false impression of precision.

Accessible at: http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/frequently-asked-questions/#CP2. Land use and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated by GlobAgri-WRR model. Water use estimates are from authors\u2019 calculations using data from Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011, 2012). The following additional information about the water use estimates are summarized from Hoekstra et al. (2011) and Water Footprint Network (2016): The water use estimates are divided into \u201cblue\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d water footprints. \u201cBlue water footprint\u201d represents the volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result of the production of a crop or animal-based food (i.e., irrigation). \u201cWater consumption\u201d refers to the volume of freshwater used and then evaporated or incorporated into a product. It also includes water abstracted from surface or groundwater in a watershed and returned to another watershed or the sea (but not to the watershed from which it was withdrawn). \u201cGreen water footprint\u201d represents the volume of rainwater consumed during the production of a crop or animal-based food, and is equal to the total rainwater evapotranspiration (from fields and plantations) plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop. In the case of grazing land, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2012) only calculate the evapotranspiration for the portion of grass consumed by animals (versus all of the water evapotranspired from the entire surface area). This narrower scope helps to explain why green water use in the chart does not more closely track total land use as calculated by GlobAgri-WRR (especially for cattle, which rely heavily on grasses for feed). Freshwater availability on earth is determined by annual precipitation above land. One part of the precipitation evaporates and the other part runs off to the ocean through aquifers and rivers. Both the evaporative flow and the runoff flow can be made productive for human purposes. The evaporative flow can be used for crop growth or left for maintaining natural ecosystems; the green water footprint measures which part of the total evaporative flow is actually appropriated for human purposes. The runoff flow\u2014the water flowing in aquifers and rivers\u2014can be used for all sorts of purposes, including irrigation, washing, processing, and cooling. The blue water footprint measures the volume of groundwater and surface water consumed. Since freshwater availability on earth is limited, it is important to know how it is allocated over various purposes, to inform discussions around use of water for maintaining natural ecosystems versus production of food or energy, or around the use of water for basic needs versus production of luxury goods. Water footprint estimates, when overlaid with maps of water stress, can also identify \u201chotspots\u201d where water footprint reduction is most urgent. Data are from the most recent years possible. Most data are from 2009. Data on aquaculture production are from 2008 (as reported in Hall et al. 2011 and Waite et al. 2014), and data on water use efficiency are from 1996\u20132005 (as reported in Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011, 2012).

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Uppsala, Sweden. Participants From a random population sample, 43 396 Swedish women, aged 30-49 years at baseline, completed an extensive dietary questionnaire and were followed-up for an average of 15.7 years. Main outcome measures Association of incident cardiovascular diseases (ascertained by linkage with nationwide registries), overall and by diagnostic category, with decreasing carbohydrate intake (in tenths), increasing protein intake (in tenths), and an additive combination of these variables (low carbohydrate-high protein score, from 2 to 20), adjusted for intake of energy, intake of saturated and unsaturated fat, and several non-dietary variables. Results A one tenth decrease in carbohydrate intake or increase in protein intake or a 2 unit increase in the low carbohydrate-high protein score were all statistically significantly associated with increasing incidence of cardiovascular disease overall (n=1270)\u2014incidence rate ratio estimates 1.04 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.08), 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06), and 1.05 (1.02 to 1.08). No heterogeneity existed in the association of any of these scores with the five studied cardiovascular outcomes: ischaemic heart disease (n=703), ischaemic stroke (n=294), haemorrhagic stroke (n=70), subarachnoid haemorrhage (n=121), and peripheral arterial disease (n=82). Conclusions Low carbohydrate-high protein diets, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Introduction Overweight and obesity are risk factors for several common chronic diseases,1 and they have become endemic in most economically developed countries and beyond.2 3 Increased physical activity is one way of counteracting excessive energy intake, but reducing this intake is also important.4 Many dietary regimens have been proposed as conducive to weight control, invoking various mechanisms including increased satiety.5 6 The most popular among these diets emphasise reduction of carbohydrate intake, thereby encouraging high protein intake,7 as high fat diets are generally avoided in most Western societies. Low carbohydrate-high protein diets may have short term effects on weight control,8 9 but concerns have also been expressed, notably with respect to cardiovascular outcomes.10 11 Although low carbohydrate-high protein diets may be nutritionally acceptable if the protein is mainly of plant origin and the reduction of carbohydrates applies mainly to simple and refined ones, the general public do not always recognise and act on these qualifications. During the past few years, several cohort studies have evaluated the long term health effects of low carbohydrate-high protein diets, with emphasis on cardiovascular diseases. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study in the United States, diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein were not associated with increased incidence of ischaemic heart disease.12 Three smaller studies in Europe, however, indicated statistically significant increases in cardiovascular mortality in relation to low carbohydrate-high protein diets. One of these studies was from the same cohort of relatively young Swedish women as the investigation reported here (but presented data only on 75 cardiovascular deaths from shorter follow-up),13 the second study was based on middle aged Greek men and women,14 and the third study investigated elderly men in Sweden.15 Willett has considered possible reasons for the discrepant results of the European studies and the American one, including differences in the main dietary sources of protein (animal versus plant) and the prevalence of obesity in the studied populations.16 Given the importance of the topic and the widespread use of low carbohydrate diets for weight control, particularly among women, we followed up the women in the Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort,13 focusing on incidence of cardiovascular diseases and using the valuable registry resources available in Sweden. Methods Participants Women aged 30-49 years, residing in the Uppsala healthcare region in Sweden in 1991-92, were the source population for the Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort. For this cohort, 96 000 women were randomly selected from four age strata (30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49), invited by mail to participate, and asked to fill in a questionnaire and return it in a pre-paid envelope.17 A total of 49 261 questionnaires were returned. Questionnaire and dietary assessment The questionnaire used in the study was self administered and recorded information on several lifestyle variables (including detailed smoking and alcoholic drinking habits), anthropometry, and history of diagnoses of major diseases and conditions, including medical diagnosis of hypertension. For the assessment of physical activity, women rated their overall level of activity (that is, activities in the house and occupational and recreational physical activity) on a five point scale with examples attached to levels 1 (low), 3, and 5 (high). Dietary intakes were assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire,18 19 in which women recorded their frequency and quantities of consumption of about 80 food items and beverages, focusing on the six month period before their enrolment in the study. We formed 11 food groups from the food items: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, dairy products, cereals, meat and meat products, fish and seafood, potatoes, eggs, sugars and sweets (all measured in g/day), and non-alcoholic beverages (measured in mL/day). Alcoholic beverages were listed in a separate category, and we calculated the amount of ethanol. On the basis of the Swedish national food administration database,20 we translated food consumption into macronutrient and energy intakes. We estimated the energy adjusted intakes of protein and carbohydrates for each woman, using the \u201cresidual method.\u201d21 This method allows evaluation of the \u201ceffect\u201d of an energy generating nutrient, controlling for the energy generated by this nutrient, by using a simple regression of that nutrient on energy intake to calculate the residual. For each woman, we assigned a score from 1 (very low protein intake) to 10 (very high protein intake), according to her tenth of energy adjusted total protein intake, and an inverse score from 1 (very high carbohydrate intake) to 10 (very low carbohydrate intake), according to her tenth of energy adjusted total carbohydrate intake. We studied the scores for high protein and low carbohydrate intake both separately and after adding them together to create a composite low carbohydrate-high protein score (ranging from 2 to 20), which simultaneously assessed the position of each woman in terms of protein and carbohydrate intake. Thus, a woman with a score of 2 was one with very high consumption of carbohydrates and very low consumption of proteins, whereas a woman with a score of 20 was one with very low consumption of carbohydrates and very high consumption of proteins. The use of energy adjusted residuals was necessary, because all energy generating nutrients are generally strongly positively associated with total energy intake. After controlling for energy intake, however, distinguishing the effects of a specific energy generating nutrient is all but impossible, as a decrease in the intake of one is unavoidably linked to an increase in the intake of one or several of the others.22 Nevertheless, in this context, a low carbohydrate-high protein score allows the assessment of most low carbohydrate diets, which are generally high protein diets,7 because it integrates opposite changes of two nutrients with equivalent energy values. Follow-up The primary outcome under investigation in this study was a first diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, as defined by ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, 9th revision) codes 410-414, 430-438, and 440 and ICD-10 codes I20-I25, I60-I67, I69, I70, and I74. We also studied ischaemic heart disease (ICD-9 410-414; ICD-10 I20-I25), ischaemic stroke (ICD-9 433-438; ICD-10 I63-I67, I69.3, I69.4, and I69.8.), intracerebral haemorrhage (ICD-9 431-432.9; ICD-10 I61-I62 and I69.1-I69.2), subarachnoid haemorrhage (ICD-9 430; ICD-10 I60 and I69.0), and peripheral arterial disease (ICD-9 440; ICD-10 I70 and I74) separately. We used linkages with nationwide Swedish registers, by means of the unique national registration numbers, for the follow-up of the cohort with respect to hospital discharges, death, and emigration. Information on dates of death by cause, as well as on dates of emigration to 31 December 2007, came from the Swedish Bureau of Statistics. Information on discharge diagnoses by date to 31 December 2007 came from the Swedish in-patient registry. We defined the date of return of the questionnaire during 1991-92 as the start of follow-up. We calculated observation time from the date of entry into the cohort until the occurrence of a first diagnosis of the cardiovascular event under study, death from the cardiovascular disease under study without a previous diagnosis of this cardiovascular disease, or censoring. For overall cardiovascular diseases, censoring was on account of emigration, the end of the observation period, or death from any cause other than cardiovascular disease. For the specific cardiovascular outcomes, censoring was on account of emigration, the end of the observation period, death from any cause other than the specific cardiovascular disease studied, or occurrence of cardiovascular disease other than the one studied. Statistical analysis Of the 49 261 Swedish women who returned the questionnaire, we excluded 1350 women from the analyses because of events before or at the cohort enrolment (10 emigrated, 136 had previous cardiovascular events, 621 had energy intake outside the extreme 1% centiles of the population energy intake (<1846.6 or >12 473.9 kJ/day), and 583 women had not filled in the food frequency questionnaire), leaving 47 911 women for the statistical analyses. After exclusion of women with missing data on any of the model covariates, 43 396 women remained for use in the statistical analyses. No major differences existed between the women excluded on account of missing data and the women who contributed to the study. For each cardiovascular diagnostic category, we had about 680 000 person years of follow-up. The participating women and the number of incident cases of cardiovascular disease (overall and by specific diagnostic categories) that occurred among them were distributed by non-nutritional covariates, and we calculated age adjusted incidence rate ratios by using Poisson regression models. We also calculated summary statistics of daily dietary intakes of energy generating nutrients. Subsequently, we tabulated the distribution by low carbohydrate-high protein score of the person time, the number of incident cases of cardiovascular disease (overall and by diagnostic categories), and the corresponding crude incidence rates per 10 000 woman years. We calculated incidence rate ratios, for all cardiovascular diseases combined and for each category of cardiovascular disease, by using survival analysis with attained age as the primary underlying timescale.23 Specifically, we fitted Poisson regression models by splitting the follow-up-time (that is, attained age between cohort entry and exit) into two year intervals and then allowing for one parameter for each such interval and an offset parameter equal to the logarithm of the observed risk time in each interval. For each participant, we considered only the first cardiovascular event. Poisson regression is commonly used in survival analysis and gives approximately the same parameter estimates and likelihood ratios as Cox proportional hazards regression when the length of follow-up is split into finer intervals (here we used two year intervals).24 25 We used, alternatively, the high protein score, the low carbohydrate score, and the additive low carbohydrate-high protein score as the primary exposure variable, introducing the scores, alternatively, as ordered or categorical variables. We ensured that the parameter for each of high protein, low carbohydrate, and low carbohydrate-high protein score was approximately constant across time by visual inspection of the estimated log rates and by calculating likelihood ratio tests for parameters capturing the high protein, low carbohydrate, and low carbohydrate-high protein exposure by time (attained age) interactions. We adjusted the models for the following variables as reported at enrolment: height (cm, continuously), body mass index (<25, 25-29.99 and \u226530, categorically), smoking status (never smokers, former smokers of <10 cigarettes, former smokers of 10-14 cigarettes, former smokers of 15-19 cigarettes, former smokers of \u226520 cigarettes, current smokers of <10 cigarettes, current smokers of 10-14 cigarettes, current smokers of 15-19 cigarettes, and current smokers of \u226520 cigarettes, categorically), physical activity (from 1 (low) to 5 (high), categorically), education (\u226410, 11-13, and \u226514 years in school, categorically), report of ever being diagnosed as having hypertension (yes versus no), energy intake (per 1000 kJ/day, continuously), unsaturated lipid intake (per 10 g/day, continuously), saturated lipid intake (per 10 g/day, continuously), and alcohol intake (<5 g/day, 5-25 g/day, and >25 g/day, categorically). We used categories to accommodate trends that may not be log linear and also to take into account biological considerations or guidelines, as for body mass index and alcohol intake. In models evaluating the associations of the outcome variables with the low carbohydrate and the high protein scores, we repeated the analysis by also introducing the complementary score (that is, high protein in the models evaluating low carbohydrate and vice versa) without energy intake in the model. To examine whether the dietary exposure variables were differentially associated with the five distinct cardiovascular outcomes, we also fitted Poisson regression models including all five cardiovascular conditions simultaneously.26 The joint model, stratifying on cardiovascular outcome and under the proportional hazards assumption, allows the evaluation of separate associations between exposure and each outcome. This approach enabled us to test directly for heterogeneity in incidence rate ratios across the cardiovascular conditions by using likelihood ratio tests. We did this for the high protein, low carbohydrate, and low carbohydrate-high protein scores in separate models. Because the origin of proteins (animal versus plant sources) may have differential effects on the occurrence of cardiovascular events,27 28 we also evaluated the association of the cardiovascular outcomes with the low carbohydrate-high protein score, as well as the low carbohydrate and high protein scores, separately among women with intake of animal protein equal to or higher than the cohort median and among women with intake of animal protein lower than the cohort median. We calculated P values for interaction by likelihood ratio tests after the introduction of product terms of the respective scores (as continuous variables) with protein intake (as a two level categorical variable: above or equal to versus below the median). We used SAS versions 9.22 and 9.3 for all data management and statistical analyses (PROC GENMOD). We made all tests of statistical hypotheses on the two sided 5% level of significance corresponding to using two sided 95% confidence intervals. In addition, using R software 2.12.1, we calculated the variance inflation factor, to ensure that no problems were generated by co-linearity among the model covariates.29 Results Overall, the 43 396 women were followed up for an average of about 15.7 years and generated a total of 680 818 person years, with 1270 incident cardiovascular events (703 ischaemic heart disease, 294 ischaemic stroke, 70 haemorrhagic stroke, 121 subarachnoid haemorrhage, and 82 peripheral arterial disease). Table 1\u21d3 shows the distribution of the women in the cohort and the incident cardiovascular cases (overall and by diagnostic category) by non-nutritional variables. The table also shows the corresponding age adjusted incidence rate ratios for descriptive purposes only, as confounding influences by factors other than age are not accounted for. Nevertheless, several well known patterns are evident, including the reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases with increasing level of education and physical activity and the increased risk with tobacco smoking and history of hypertension. Table 1 Distributions of 43 396 women by non-nutritional variables: number of incident cases of cardiovascular diseases overall, ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and peripheral arterial disease with corresponding incidence rate ratios* in Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort View popup View inline Table 2\u21d3 shows representative values of the daily dietary intakes and gives an overview of the nutritional background of the women in the cohort. In this cohort of women, median intake of energy was 6390 kJ/day with 10th and 90th centiles of 4241 and 9053 kJ/day. The additive low carbohydrate-high protein score was positively correlated with protein intake (Spearman r=0.37), inversely correlated with carbohydrate intake (Spearman r=\u22120.30), and positively correlated with lipid intake (Spearman r=0.28 for saturated lipids; Spearman r=0.17 for unsaturated lipids), but, importantly, it was not correlated with energy intake (Spearman r=\u22120.004). Table 2 Daily dietary intakes of 43 396 women in Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort View popup View inline Table 3\u21d3 shows the women in the cohort, the person time generated, and the number of incident cases overall and for each diagnostic category as distributed by categories of low carbohydrate-high protein score. The corresponding crude incidence rates per 10 000 woman years are also shown. Although potential confounding influences have not been accounted for, the data in this table suggest that the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes tends to increase with increasing low carbohydrate-high protein score; the patterns are more regular in the more numerous categories of overall cardiovascular diseases and ischaemic heart disease. Table 3 Distributions of 43 396 women, person time, and number of incident cases per diagnostic category by value in low carbohydrate-high protein score and corresponding crude incidence rates per 10 000 woman years in Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort View popup View inline Table 4\u21d3 shows the fully adjusted (see table footnote) incidence rate ratios for overall cardiovascular diseases and the main diagnostic subcategories, per decreasing tenth of carbohydrate intake, increasing tenth of protein intake, and their addition (that is, per 1 unit increase in low carbohydrate and high protein scores and 2 unit increase in low carbohydrate-high protein score). In this table, the influence of potential confounding variables ascertained in the study has been accounted for, and a comparison with the results in table 3\u21d1 indicates the modest amount of confounding by these variables. A pattern of positive associations can be seen, which are statistically significant for all three scores with respect to the overall cardiovascular outcomes and for high protein and low carbohydrate-high protein scores with respect to the two more common subcategories\u2014that is, ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke. For each of the three scores, a formal statistical comparison of their associations with the distinct cardiovascular outcomes did not show statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity (P values for heterogeneity with the scores as continuous variables were 0.90 for the low carbohydrate score, 0.41 for the high protein score, and 0.79 for the low carbohydrate-high protein score). Thus, a one tenth decrease in carbohydrate intake or increase in protein intake or an increase in the low carbohydrate-high protein score by 2 units were all statistically significantly associated with increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases overall, with point estimates of 1.04 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.08), 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06), and 1.05 (1.02 to 1.08). When we evaluated the associations of various cardiovascular outcomes with low carbohydrate and high protein scores, mutually controlling for each other, but excluding total energy intake, the results were essentially unchanged. Table 4 Incidence rate ratios for overall cardiovascular diseases and main diagnostic subcategories, per decreasing tenth of carbohydrate intake, increasing tenth of protein intake, and their addition in Swedish Women\u2019s Lifestyle and Health Cohort View popup View inline Using the incidence rates in table 3\u21d1, we evaluated whether the trends shown in table 4\u21d1 were driven by the extreme score categories or whether they reflected an essentially smooth exposure-response pattern. With a low carbohydrate-high protein score of 6 or less as the baseline, the incidence rate ratio for overall cardiovascular diseases increased to 1.13 for women with a low carbohydrate-high protein score from 7 to 9, to 1.23 for those with a score from 10 to 12, to 1.54 for those with a score from 13 to 15, and to 1.60 for those with a score of 16 or higher. An underlying, fairly regular trend is thus apparent. Taking into account the fact that diet was assessed at recruitment only and could have changed over time, we also examined whether a tendency exists for the associations to weaken with longer follow-up. We examined the incidence rate ratios in the first 10 years and in the remaining 5.7 years of follow-up. We found a tendency towards attenuation in the later follow-up period. Thus, contrasting the earlier with the later follow-up period, for overall cardiovascular diseases the association per one tenth increase in the scores changed from 1.05 (1.01 to 1.09) to 1.03 (0.99 to 1.07) for the low carbohydrate score, from 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07) to 1.02 (1.00 to 1.05) for the high protein score, and from 1.06 (1.03 to 1.09) to 1.04 (1.00 to 1.07) for the low carbohydrate-high protein score. We further evaluated whether the associations evident in table 4\u21d1 were more pronounced among women whose protein intake was mainly of animal origin than among those whose protein intake was mainly of plant origin, by using the median intake of animal protein as cut-off value (40.9 g/day). We found a suggestion that the incidence rate ratios tended to be higher among women whose protein intake was mainly of animal rather than plant origin, although the formal tests for interaction were generally non-significant, except with respect to subarachnoid haemorrhage for the low carbohydrate-high protein score. For overall cardiovascular diseases, the incidence rate ratio per one unit increase in the low carbohydrate score was 1.06 (1.00 to 1.12) for women with animal protein intake above or equal to the median and 0.99 (0.93 to 1.06) for those with animal protein intake below the median (P for interaction=0.86); the results per 1 unit increase in the high protein score were 1.04 (1.00 to 1.08) and 1.03 (1.00 to 1.07) (P for interaction=0.92); and the results per 2 unit increase in the low carbohydrate-high protein score were 1.06 (1.01 to 1.12) and 1.03 (0.98 to 1.08) (P for interaction=0.93). For subarachnoid haemorrhage, the incidence rate ratio per 2 unit increase in the low carbohydrate-high protein score was 1.17 (1.00 to 1.38) for women with animal protein intake above or equal to the median and 0.90 (0.76 to 1.07) for those with animal protein intake below the median (P for interaction=0.04, without accounting for multiple comparisons). Discussion In a population based cohort study of 43 396 women followed up for an average of about 15.7 years and generating about 680 000 person years, 1270 incident cardiovascular events were recorded. After fine controlling for all assessed cardiovascular risk factors that could act as confounding variables, as well as for total energy and saturated and unsaturated fat intake, we found that women had a statistically significant 5% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events per 2 unit increase in the 20 unit low carbohydrate-high protein score. In practical terms, and taking into account the rough correspondence in the ranking of energy adjusted and crude tenths of intake, a 20 g decrease in daily carbohydrate intake and a 5 g increase in daily protein intake would correspond to a 5% increase in the overall risk of cardiovascular disease. We found no heterogeneity in the association of the low carbohydrate-high protein score with specific cardiovascular outcomes; the incidence rate ratio associated with a 2 unit increase in the low carbohydrate-high protein score varied from a statistically significant 1.04 for ischaemic heart disease to a statistically non-significant 1.07 for subarachnoid haemorrhage and a statistically significant 1.07 for ischaemic stroke. We consider this to be evidence of consistency, pointing to a common component in the dietary causes of the various cardiovascular outcomes. The results followed a fairly regular exposure-response pattern. Both high protein and low carbohydrate scores were statistically significantly associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases overall. The results with respect to high protein score were also statistically significant for the two more numerous cardiovascular disease categories\u2014namely, ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke. The associations of low carbohydrate, high protein, and low carbohydrate-high protein scores with cardiovascular outcomes were not, in general, statistically significantly different between women whose protein intake was mainly of animal origin and those whose protein intake was mainly of plant origin. Low carbohydrate diets, recommended for weight control, often contain less than 15% of energy intake from carbohydrates and about 30% of energy intake from proteins.30 Among the women studied, carbohydrate intake at the low extreme of the distribution was higher and protein intake at the high extreme of the distribution was lower than the respective intakes prescribed by many weight control diets. However, the underlying trend between low carbohydrate-high protein score and incidence of cardiovascular disease was essentially monotonic, indicating that our findings are applicable across the spectrum of carbohydrate and protein intakes of the participating women. Comparison with other studies At least four cohort studies have examined the association of low carbohydrate-high protein diets and mortality from or incidence of cardiovascular diseases overall or ischaemic heart disease as the most common among categories of cardiovascular disease. Halton and colleagues,12 reporting from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study in the United States, found that diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and fat were not associated with increased incidence of ischaemic heart disease in women. In three other population based cohort studies, however, including one based on the same cohort as the study reported here,13 low carbohydrate-high protein diets were statistically significantly positively associated with cardiovascular mortality among young women,13 in the general population in Greece,14 or among elderly men in Sweden.15 The results of this investigation, which focuses on incidence of cardiovascular outcomes, are compatible with this last set of studies. The results from the different cohorts, however, are not as divergent as they appear. Fung and colleagues,31 reporting from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in the United States, found that a low carbohydrate score was associated with a modest, statistically non-significant increase in cardiovascular mortality. When the results were examined with the animal or plant origin of the diet taken into account, a statistically significant positive association was seen with low carbohydrate diets of mainly animal origin, but a statistically significant inverse association was seen with low carbohydrate diets of mainly vegetable origin. In studies evaluating the incidence of stroke and ischaemic heart disease among men in relation to protein intake in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study,27 28 statistically non-significant positive associations of protein intake were reported for both outcomes; when the results were examined by animal or plant origin of protein, the associations were positive for both outcomes for animal protein, whereas they were statistically non-significantly inverse for vegetable protein with respect to both outcomes. Finally, a positive association between intake of red meat and risk of ischaemic heart disease among women was reported from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study.32 Thus, the results of the major US cohorts do indicate an increase, though generally not statistically significant, in risk of cardiovascular disease with higher protein intake, low carbohydrate intake, or both, but they point to a possible harmful effect driven by diets primarily of animal origin. The results of our study and those of the other European cohorts point to a statistically significant harmful effect of low carbohydrate and high protein diets in general.14 15 Differential effects by animal or plant origin of the diet were not examined in the earlier European studies, but in our study we were not able to document any effects, possibly on account of power limitations. Thus, the results of our study, although indicating that low carbohydrate-high protein diets tend in general to be detrimental to cardiovascular health, do not preclude that dietary regimens low in refined carbohydrates and high in plant proteins or unsaturated lipids could have no adverse effects on cardiovascular health. As also pointed out by Willett,16 one has to take into account differences in the sources of proteins in various populations, as well as the nature of carbohydrates consumed. Also, differences in the way protein sources, and perhaps also carbohydrate sources, are prepared and processed might explain, to a certain extent, diverging results from studies in different populations.33 With respect to the biomedical plausibility of our findings, vegetables, fruits, cereals, and legumes, which have been found in several studies to be core components of healthy dietary patterns,34 35 are important sources of carbohydrates, so that reduced intake of these food groups is likely to have adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Moreover, several studies have reported that meat consumption or high intake of protein from animal sources may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.31 36 Intervention studies have reported beneficial effects of regimens high in protein, low in carbohydrates, or both on blood lipids that could favourably affect cardiovascular risk, but the follow-up in these studies was short (one year or less).37 38 Of note, a study in mice has indicated that low carbohydrate-high protein diets may have substantial adverse vascular effects not reflected in serum markers but mediated through reduction of bone marrow and peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cells,11 which are considered a marker of vascular regenerative capacity.39 Strengths and limitations of study Our study has several strengths: the cohort was population based, the dietary questionnaire was validated, several potential confounding variables were ascertained in detail, and nationwide data linkage in Sweden allowed virtually complete follow-up and objective ascertainment of cardiovascular outcomes. The healthcare system in Sweden is publicly financed, and referral to hospital does not depend on insurance status or the financial background of the patient. Concerning the analytical strategy, we followed the substitution approach,21 22 taking into account the fact that energy generated by carbohydrates and proteins is equivalent and that a simple additive score reflecting the balance of intakes of these two energy generating nutrients was uncorrelated with total energy intake. Controlling for saturated and unsaturated fat intake and as finely as possible for other potential confounders, particularly smoking, minimised the potential for confounding bias. Among the weaknesses of the study are concerns about misclassification of dietary exposures, particularly as diet was assessed at enrolment only and was self reported through a food frequency questionnaire, which, however, is a standard practice in large cohort studies. With respect to capturing seasonality of consumption, participants were enrolled in a time frame longer than one year, and we expect that seasonal variation was balanced and therefore largely accounted for. In any case, errors in the ascertainment of diet are generally not correlated with errors in the ascertainment of incidence of cardiovascular disease and, hence, are unlikely to generate substantial confounding. The long interval between exposure and outcome is a source of concern, because certain participants may change their dietary habits during the intervening period. However, this is more likely to generate non-differential misclassification and, thus, attenuate the evaluated association. In fact, we saw a tendency for the incidence rate ratios to decline with longer follow-up. Information on waist:hip ratio was missing for a large fraction of the cohort, and data on drugs for cardiovascular diseases were not available (the relevant registry was not operational during most of the follow-up period). Finally, we did not have data on blood cholesterol, an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but even if such values were available, they would probably be, at least partly, intermediates in the association between diet and incidence of cardiovascular disease. As in all observational studies, residual confounding cannot be confidently excluded, but our control of potential confounders is as effective as that in other cohort studies with similar objectives. Conclusions and policy implications Having been generated from a cohort of relatively young women, the results of our study are directly relevant to a group that often resorts to weight control regimens that encourage restriction of carbohydrate with unavoidable increases in protein intake. Our results do not answer questions concerning possible beneficial short term effects of low carbohydrate or high protein diets in the control of body weight or insulin resistance. Instead, they draw attention to the potential for considerable adverse effects on cardiovascular health of these diets when they are used on a regular basis, without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates (complex versus refined) or the source of proteins (plant versus animal). What is already known on this topic Sporadic reports have suggested that low carbohydrate-high protein diets can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease Three European cohort studies relying on mortality have all provided supportive evidence, but a US cohort study based on incidence indicated no association What this study adds In a large cohort of women in Sweden, compelling evidence shows that low carbohydrate-high protein diets may increase cardiovascular risk Notes Cite this as: BMJ 2012;344:e4026 Footnotes We thank Pouran Almstedt for her help in data management.

Use liquid vegetable oils for cooking and baking. Olive, canola, and other plant-based oils are rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats. Try dressing up a salad or roasted vegetables with an olive oil-based vinaigrette. 2. Avoid trans fat. Read labels to find foods without trans fats. You should also scan the ingredient list to make sure it does not contain partially hydrogenated oils. In restaurants that don\u2019t have nutrition information readily available, avoid fried foods, biscuits, and other baked goods. Or, you may have the good fortune to be eating in a city like New York, Boston, or San Francisco, where trans fats have been banned (do keep in mind, just being trans free does not mean these are all healthy foods). 3. Eat at least one good source of omega-3 fats each day. Fatty fish (such as salmon and tuna), walnuts, and canola oil all provide omega-3 fatty acids, essential fats that our bodies cannot make. 4. Cut back on red meat and dairy foods. Try replacing red meat with beans, nuts, poultry, and fish whenever possible, and try reducing portion sizes of dairy products.

But truth be told, you can make hummus using any number of legumes. Lentils are a perfect example: grassy and earthier than chickpeas, they lend themselves nicely to this Levantine dip. Typically, chickpeas and other beans require long cooking times and even pre-soaking in baking soda to achieve a soft enough texture for hummus. But lentils cook to the perfect consistency in a flash, no kitchen hacks required, resulting in a super smooth hummus. We keep the flavors in our version classic: plenty of tahini, lemon, fresh garlic, and a dash of cumin. To dress up the dish, we pair our hummus with a simple, bright herb salad and plenty of assorted seeds. Tuck into this hummus with some pita or lavash\u2014the perfect light dinner or party-pleasing appetizer. Green Lentil Hummus with Herbs and Olives Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 16 quarter-cup servings (recipe makes about 4 cups) Ingredients: 1 \u00bc cups (8 \u00be ounces) green lentils, picked over and rinsed 1 teaspoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 8 cups water \u00bd cup plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice (4 lemons), divided 4 cloves garlic \u2154 cup tahini \u00bc teaspoon cumin \u00be cup fresh parsley, chopped coarse \u00bd cup fresh dill sprigs, chopped coarse \u00bd cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced thin 2 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 teaspoons lemon juice Kosher salt 2 tablespoons pepitas, toasted 2 tablespoons unsalted sunflower seeds, toasted Preparation: Bring lentils, 1 teaspoon salt, and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain lentils and set aside. Meanwhile, pulse \u00bd cup lemon juice, garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt in food processor until coarse puree forms, about 20 pulses. Let steep for at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Add tahini to processor with lemon juice mixture and process until smooth and well combined, 45 to 60 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and add cumin and lentils. Process until mixture is very smooth, about 4 minutes. Season with salt to taste and adjust consistency with up to 2 tablespoons additional water. Toss parsley, dill, olives, 2 tablespoons oil, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice together in small bowl. Season with salt to taste. Transfer hummus to large bowl and use back of large spoon to spread hummus, leaving well at center. Place herb salad in center of well. Sprinkle pepitas and sunflower seeds over top and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Serve with whole-wheat pita bread or whole-grain crackers. Leftover hummus can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 1 week.

It\u2019s a basic recipe that goes way back, with two types of \u201cstuffed peppers\u201d even featured in Fannie Farmer\u2019s 1896 Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. Of course, the idea of stuffing a bell pepper (or other pepper varieties) undoubtedly precedes this 19th-century culinary text. Recipes for stuffed peppers can be found in cuisines all over the world\u2014from Denmark\u2019s \u201cfyldte peberfrugter\u201d (stuffed with bulgur, kale, and mushrooms) to India\u2019s \u201cbharwa shimla mich\u201d (stuffed with a mixture of spiced vegetables). Indeed, using a bell pepper as a vessel can yield an endless number of delicious and creative filling combinations. Plus, exploring beyond the basic beef and rice combo is a perfect way to try some strategies to reduce red meat and elevate your plate. Stuffed peppers are also perfect for meal prep, portable for lunchboxes, and generally freeze well too if you want to make a larger batch ahead of time. The \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed bell pepper If you aren\u2019t familiar with this recipe, one serving typically packs about a quarter-pound of ground beef (saut\u00e9ed with onion and mixed with white rice, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese) into a large bell pepper. Not really an optimal recipe for our health. Beyond the refined rice, this quantity of red meat combined with cheese serves up quite a bit of saturated fat\u2014around 18 grams worth. Ready to get cooking? Here are a few recipe ideas to get you started: The Upgraded Basic features minor tweaks to the basic beef, rice, and tomato version, creating a healthier recipe with no change in flavor. The New Classic sticks to the classic flavor profile, but incorporates a hearty and savory mixture of lentils and portabella mushrooms. Variations: This recipe also serves as a solid base for incorporating some favorite animal-based foods in small amounts, such as a bit of flavorful cheese or an egg baked on top of the filling. The Southwestern ventures into new flavor territory with a stuffing of spicy chicken, black beans, and a mixture of veggies. The Upgraded Basic Although a diet high in red meat is not optimal for our own health (or the planet\u2019s health), just a few minor tweaks can upgrade this recipe without changing the flavor if you\u2019re looking to enjoy it on occasion. Compared to the typical \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed bell pepper recipe, using lean ground beef at half the amount (and just a little less cheese) cuts the saturated fat per serving down to about 9 grams. You\u2019re still getting plenty of protein\u2014nearly 22 grams per serving. We also added a bit more rice, but switched to brown rice for a nutritious boost, and swapped out tomato sauce for diced tomatoes to add texture and reduce the sodium. See the full recipe This recipe showcases just one of the many ways to try eating a little less red meat. You can also try swapping for a healthier meat like poultry or seafood, and explore new flavors in the process (for example, this pepper stuffed with spicy chicken and black beans). Or, you can stick with the familiar flavor profile but try some savory and hearty plant-based proteins instead. The New Classic True to its name, this recipe sticks to the classic taste of the \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed pepper recipe\u2014but with a new approach to those favorite flavors. Hearty lentils, savory portabella mushrooms, umami-packed tomatoes, and saut\u00e9ed onions combine with brown rice to deliver a surprisingly \u201cmeaty\u201d filling\u2014but without the red meat. At 12 grams of fiber and virtually no saturated fat per serving, this new classic is a major health upgrade. (Lentils are also known for helping replace nitrogen in the soil\u2014an upgrade for the planet\u2019s health as well!) Even better is that this recipe provides a solid base for further modification. For example: If you want to increase the plant-based protein content from 14 grams to 21 grams per serving, mix a half-cup of hemp seeds or hemp hearts into the filling\u2014boosting heart healthy unsaturated fats in the process. If you want to incorporate a bit of your favorite animal-based protein, you can sprinkle over some flavorful cheese; or, try cracking an egg on top of the filling before baking. See the full recipe \u201cThe New Classic\u201d stuffed pepper is just one example of how to create hearty and delicious plant-based preparations. These are both filling and flavorful on their own, but also can serve as a solid base to incorporate smaller amounts of animal-based foods\u2014a smart strategy to consume less meat and enjoy more variety. The Southwestern In looking to swap out red meat for healthier meats, you could certainly keep the basic flavor profile and use ground beef or turkey, but why not take advantage of the protein switch and try something new? This version takes a flavor trip to incorporate \u201cSouthwestern\u201d flavors of spicy chicken, black beans, corn, and green chilis. With 29 grams of protein (mostly from the black beans and the chicken), 16 grams of fiber, and only 3 grams of saturated fat, it\u2019s another health upgrade from the \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed bell pepper recipe. See the full recipe Once again, this recipe lends itself well to plenty of modifications. For example, you could easily swap out the chicken for a white fish, like tilapia. Or, a meatless version could increase the amount of black beans and add some roasted sweet potatoes for an additional flavor and texture. You could also try a completely different flavor profile that pulls from other cuisines. There are so many options beyond the basic beef recipe\u2014maybe you\u2019ll find a new favorite in the process! Related Elevate your plate Reducing red meat in our diets can be a win for our own health and the health of the planet. If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, these strategies can help you cut back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful.

Specifically, that savory, umami flavor comes from a naturally high concentration of glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is an amino acid that\u2019s essential to many natural chemical processes. Dissolved in water, glutamic acid separates into ions, of which the negatively charged glutamates are the real heavy-hitters. When we bite into a piece of parmesan or sip on a steamy cup of miso soup, those glutamates\u2014along with other molecules\u2014are delivering an intensely savory sensation, which we perceive as umami and delicious. But if we bite into a raw mushroom, it doesn\u2019t really taste all that savory. So how do we bring out the flavor and maximize umami? One way is to use a pressure cooker. Increased temperature and pressure caramelizes and breaks down mushrooms quickly, freeing up glutamates and resulting in a more flavorful base. Here we make a quick soup by first browning the mushrooms to build flavor. Soy sauce and wine add extra sweetness and savoriness. After pressure cooking, we even double down on umami, steeping sheets of glutamate-rich kombu in our finished stock. The finished soup is rich, meaty, and intensely savory. And the best part? The cooked mushrooms still have plenty of flavor and a pleasing, tender texture. We serve this soup simply, with soba and the leftover mushrooms\u2014as well as some fresh ones. But feel free to mix it up with this one. This recipe works best with a mix of mushrooms (cremini, button, shiitake, hen of the woods, chanterelles), but it\u2019s still great if you\u2019re on a budget and only have buttons or creminis on hand. Wild Mushroom Soup with Soba Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4 Ingredients: Soup 10 ounces mushrooms, cut into 1-inch pieces \u00bc cup plus 2 quarts water, divided \u00bc teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 clove chopped garlic 2 tablespoons dry white wine or dry vermouth 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 1 ounce dried shiitakes 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 ounce kombu, broken into 4 pieces Noodles 8 ounces soba noodles 2 ounces enoki mushrooms, trimmed 2 scallions, sliced thin 4 radishes, sliced thin Sesame oil for serving, optional Preparation: For the Soup: Stir mushrooms, 1/4 cup water, and salt in pressure-cooker pot. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and mushrooms release moisture, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are well browned, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine and soy sauce, scraping up any browned bits, and cook until wine has evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir in remaining 2 quarts water and peppercorns, lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 30 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure. Remove pot from heat and let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure, then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Return soup to simmer over low heat, stir in kombu, and cook until kombu has softened and doubled in size, about 10 minutes. Strain soup through fine mesh strainer set over bowl, pushing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve mushrooms in bowl, discarding kombu and peppercorns (Cooked peppercorns have a soft, berry-like texture. Leave them in if desired). For the Noodles: Bring 2 quarts water to boil in medium pot. Add soba and cook, stirring occasionally, until just al dente, about 5 minutes. Strain soba in fine mesh strainer and divide between bowls. Meanwhile, bring mushroom soup, cooked mushrooms, and enoki mushrooms to simmer in now-empty pressure-cooker pot over medium-low heat. Divide soup and mushrooms between bowls. Add radishes and scallions and serve, drizzling with sesame oil if desired.

Asparagus with Warm Tarragon-Pecan Vinaigrette Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen Cook Time 15-20 min. Serves 4-6 Ingredients: 1\u00bd pounds fresh asparagus (medium-thick) 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons sugar or light-colored honey 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup minced pecans 2 teaspoons minced or crushed garlic \u00bd teaspoon salt (or to taste) 1 to 2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon (or 2 teaspoons dried) Freshly ground black pepper Preparation: Break off and discard the tough bottom ends of the asparagus, then slice the stalks on the diagonal into 1\u00bd-inch pieces. Set aside. Combine the vinegar and sugar or honey in a small bowl and mix until uniform. (You might need to warm the honey for about 10 seconds in a microwave if it\u2019s too stiff.) Set aside. Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Add the pecans, turn the heat down, and saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, or until the nuts are fragrant and lightly toasted. Watch them carefully so they don\u2019t burn. Transfer the nuts to another dish and set aside. Return the pan to the stove, and increase the heat to medium-high. Wait about a minute, then add another tablespoon olive oil and swirl again to coat the pan. Toss in the asparagus, and stir-fry for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the asparagus is just barely tender. (Thicker asparagus will take longer.) Sprinkle in the garlic and salt during the last minute or so of cooking. Turn up the heat to high, and pour in the vinegar mixture, stirring as you go. Stir-fry over high heat for only about 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Stir in the tarragon, and add black pepper to taste. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, sprinkled with the reserved pecans.

That chewy, toothsome quality makes mushrooms a great staple for those following plant-based diets. Mushrooms owe their meatiness to chitin\u2014a polysaccharide and derivative of glucose\u2014which makes up the cell walls of most fungi. Chitin is fibrous, absorbs water well, and is tough to break down. In fact, because of that toughness, it\u2019s pretty hard to overcook mushrooms. They retain their texture even after hours of simmering. Here we pair briny, meaty oyster mushrooms with coconut for a warming dish you can whip up any night of the week. After searing the mushrooms, we simmer them in a mixture of coconut milk, garlic, and ginger. The mushrooms absorb the liquid and plump up, while retaining their meaty texture. We like these mushrooms over wild or black rice, with plenty of toasted macadamia nuts for crunch. But feel free to eat them over noodles, sweet potatoes, or just straight out of the pot. Braised Oyster Mushrooms, Coconut, and Macadamia Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 2 Ingredients: 1 13.5-ounce can light coconut milk 1 teaspoon cornstarch 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 ounces oyster mushrooms, torn into 2-inch pieces 1 clove garlic, grated \u00bd-inch piece of ginger, grated 1/4 teaspoon fish sauce (optional) 1 cup black rice or wild rice 1/2 cup toasted macadamia nuts, chopped Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving Preparation: Whisk coconut milk and cornstarch in medium bowl until combined and set aside. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, turning once, until golden brown on most sides, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in coconut milk mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mushrooms are tender and plump, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Season with fish sauce if desired and salt to taste. Set aside until ready to serve. Meanwhile, bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan. Stir in rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, bring to simmer, reduce heat to low, cover and cook until rice has absorbed water, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff rice with fork, cover and set aside. To serve, divide rice between two bowls. Spoon mushrooms over rice and pour coconut sauce on top. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and serve.

Ingredients (serves 6-8 people) one 3.5-4 lb. butternut squash 1 medium leek 1 small yellow onion 1 medium shallot 3 medium cloves garlic 1 medium carrot 1 Tablespoon honey or maple syrup 6 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock black pepper 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt extra virgin olive oil 3-4 sprigs parsley 2-3 sprigs thyme 10 whole black peppercorns 2 bay leaves small bunch of chives 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds Instructions Heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut the neck off of the squash and set aside. Cut the base in half through the root and scoop out the seeds. Put 1-2 sage sprigs in each half, lightly rub in olive oil, put on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and roast until very tender, 45-60 minutes. Cool the squash down, discard the sage, and scoop out the flesh and set aside. Peel the next of the squash and cut into 1/2\u201d pieces. Cut the root off of the leek(s) and remove the dark green leaves, keeping only the very light-green and white parts. Take off the outer layer. Cut the leek(s) in half vertically, then into half-moon slices about 1/2\u201d wide. Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don\u2019t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain. Cut the onion, shallot, and carrot into a 1/2\u201d dice. Smash the garlic cloves and roughly chop. Wrap the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a bundle of cheesecloth and tie with a string. If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth, omit the peppercorns, and tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaves in a string bundle. Add 2-3 Tablespoons of olive oil to a dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, shallot, carrot, garlic, and sweat for 5-8 minutes until translucent. Add the diced squash and cook for 4-5 minutes more. Add the honey/maple syrup and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Add the stock and herb bundle, turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat until the water is barely at a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes until the squash pieces are tender. Add the roasted squash to the soup pot and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove the herb bundle. Add about 3-4 Tablespoons of olive oil, and blend the soup in batches (or with a stick blender) until smooth. Season with kosher salt and black pepper to taste. For balsamic reduction Put the balsamic vinegar in a small pot over very low heat. Keep the vinegar on the heat until it has reduced to a semi-thick sauce. Make sure the vinegar never comes to a boil \u2013 it can burn very easily. This will take several hours. Once it starts to thicken, keep an eye on it and swirl it around semi-regularly. It will continue to thicken off of the heat, so pull it off when it is just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. For the pumpkin seeds Heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour the seeds into a single layer on a baking sheet, and roast for 3-6 minutes until toasted. Be careful not to burn. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. To finish Ladle soup into each bowl. Add a swirl of balsamic reduction, a few pinches of toasted pumpkin seeds, and a sprinkle of finely chopped chives.

This brassica is low in overall fiber when cooked (compared to say, carrots or broccoli), making it ideal for smooth purees and sauces. In fact, this soup is so smooth and creamy that you\u2019d be hard pressed to believe there isn\u2019t any dairy in it. And to elevate this soup even more, we blend in toasted walnuts to thicken the soup slightly. The walnuts also provide richness, a background sweetness, and a pleasant buttery quality. For some textural contrast, we serve the soup with some pan-roasted cauliflower and plenty of extra toasted walnuts. Cauliflower and Walnut Soup Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 6 Ingredients: 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds) 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, halved and sliced thin Salt 5 cups water \u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts \u00bd teaspoon mustard powder \u00bc teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon lemon juice Preparation: Pull leaves off cauliflower and trim stem. Using small knife, cut around core to remove; thinly slice core and reserve. Cut 1 cup of 1/2-inch florets from head of cauliflower; set aside. Cut remaining cauliflower crosswise into 1/2-inch thick pieces. Melt 2 tablespoons oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 6 minutes. Increase heat to high; add 4 1/2 cups water, sliced core, and half of sliced cauliflower; and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add remaining sliced cauliflower, return to simmer, and continue to cook until cauliflower is tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer. While soup simmers, melt remaining 4 tablespoons oil in 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Add reserved florets and cook, stirring frequently, until florets are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Off heat, stir in mustard powder and cumin. Remove skillet from heat and transfer florets to small bowl. Toss florets with lemon juice and season with salt to taste. Process soup and walnuts in blender until smooth, about 60 seconds. Rinse out pot. Strain pureed soup through fine-mesh strainer into pot, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return soup to simmer over medium heat, adjusting consistency with remaining water as needed (soup should have thick, silky texture but settle flat in bowl) and seasoning with salt to taste. Serve, garnishing individual bowls with browned florets, extra walnuts, and extra olive oil.

The beans contribute protein and fiber to the salad. Draining and rinsing canned beans reduces the sodium content by 40 percent. This recipe uses a few sodium-rich ingredients (e.g., anchovies and Parmesan cheese), and therefore it does not need any added salt. Caesar Salad Serves 6 Ingredients: For salad 6 large hearts of romaine, chopped For dressing 1 cup white, cannellini, or Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed \u00bd cup water 2 anchovies 4 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice 1 garlic clove 4 Tbsp. grated Parmesan \u00bd tsp. black pepper \u00bd cup extra virgin olive oil For croutons 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely minced \u00bd of an 18-inch whole wheat baguette, cubed Preparation: Croutons: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the olive oil and minced garlic. Add the cubed baguette and toss to coat. Spread the croutons on a baking sheet and bake for 5\u20138 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. Dressing: In the container of a food processor combine the beans, water, anchovy, lemon juice, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil to create a creamy, emulsified dressing. Chop heart of romaine. In a large mixing bowl combine the chopped lettuce and dressing, tossing well to ensure all of the lettuce is coated with the dressing. To serve, divide the salad among six salad plates, and garnish each plate with croutons.

Here we use them in a bright, citrusy dressing with a little kick. Blending walnuts in a base of ginger, garlic, and jalapeno gives plenty of heat. And instead of mustard or mayonnaise, the walnuts help to keep the sauce smooth and homogenous as we add the oil. The result is an ultra-smooth, creamy dressing that\u2019s perfect on salads. For this dish, we like the classic combination of endive and citrus: The sweetness of oranges balances the bitter sweetness of endive, while the bright acidity of the dressing ties the flavors together. This is the perfect fancy side dish for your next dinner party, or could serve as a refreshing light lunch.

Add cilantro and blend until just combined, 15 to 30 seconds longer. With blender running, drizzle in oil until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. Strain dressing through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Transfer dressing to bowl and season with salt to taste. For the Salad: Cut away peel and pith from oranges. Holding fruit over bowl, use paring knife to slice between membranes to release segments; set aside. Roughly chop remaining 3/4 cup walnuts. Spoon dressing on large plate or serving bowl. Shingle endive pieces on top of sauce and scatter orange segments over endive. Sprinkle with chopped walnuts, drizzle extra dressing and olive oil, and season to taste with flake sea salt. Serve.

Often these mixes contain miniature specimens of a greater assortment of leaves than you might otherwise purchase by the bunch (or at all). Often found in these mixes: dandelion greens, baby red mustard, tat soi, tiny kale, diminutive beet greens, and so on. Make sure they are perky and not at all wilted, and cook them that same evening, or at the very least, the next. They lose their spark if they sit around. Roasted garlic has a handsomely bitter flavor that is both deeper and milder than fresh garlic. Roasted and fresh team up really well together to embrace an assortment of greens. Remember to roast the garlic as much as several days ahead of time. Store it in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator until use. Furthermore, make this in two batches so the pan won\u2019t be crowded. Contact with the hot pan is key. Garlic-Braised Greens Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services Serves 4 Ingredients: 2 medium-sized bulbs garlic (tip sliced off near the top) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 to 10 cups or about a pound (packed) braising greens Salt to taste \u00bd to 1 teaspoon minced or crushed garlic Preparation: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a small baking tray with foil and brush lightly with olive oil. Stand the garlic bulbs root side-down on the prepared tray, and drizzle the open top surfaces (where you sliced off the tops) with a little olive oil. Roast in the center of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they feel soft when gently squeezed. Remove the tray from the oven, and let the bulbs cool until comfortable to handle. Separate the cloves, and squeeze each one over a small bowl, releasing the pulp. (Some cloves might keep their shape, while others turn to mush. All forms are welcome!) You can also peel all the garlic while it is still uncooked, and wrap the cloves in a tight little foil packet, spooning in about a teaspoon of olive oil. Roast the packet for about 20 to 30 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit or until the cloves are very soft. Stem the greens, if necessary. Leave them whole, if very small, or coarsely chop if medium-small. Your call. Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add half the remaining olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Toss in half of the greens, turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir-fry, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes, or until wilted. Stir in half the fresh garlic, sprinkle lightly with salt, if desired, then transfer to a medium-sized bowl, and set aside. Repeat this step with the remaining olive oil and greens. When the leaves have wilted and the fresh garlic is mixed in, reduce the heat to medium-low, and return the first batch of greens to the pan. Add the roasted garlic, turning everything together with tongs to combine. Add a little extra olive oil, if desired, and taste to adjust salt. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.

Drying is an age-old preservation technique, increasing shelf life indefinitely. But drying also intensifies the flavor of mushrooms, driving off moisture and leaving precious glutamates intact. Rehydrating unlocks all of these flavors, and best of all, dried mushrooms become meatier than ever before. Here is our take on classic marinated shiitakes\u2014one of the best ways to enjoy these fungi. After rehydrating the mushrooms, we slice them to increase surface area. Simmering the mushrooms in an intense mixture of soy sauce, wine, vinegar, and plenty of the reserved cooking liquid results in ultra-meaty gems of umami goodness. These mushrooms go well with anything, from soups to stews to salads and rice bowls. We serve ours simply, with fresh, crunchy cucumber and fragrant toasted sesame seeds. This dish is perfect with steamed rice as a light lunch, or as a side dish for a bigger feast. You can find dried shiitake mushrooms at any Asian grocery store, usually in bulk. Marinated Shiitake Mushroom and Cucumber Salad Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4-6 Ingredients: Mushrooms 4 cups (about 4 ounces) dried shiitake mushrooms 1 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce 3/4 cup sake or dry white wine 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1/4 cup honey 1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled Salad 1 seedless English cucumber, sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus extra for serving 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds Extra-virgin olive oil Preparation: For the Mushrooms: Bring 4 cups water to boil in large saucepan. Off heat, add mushrooms, cover, and let hydrate until mushrooms are softened and plump, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain mushrooms in fine-mesh strainer set over bowl; reserve liquid and set aside. Let mushrooms cool slightly, then cut into 1/4-inch slices. Add sliced mushrooms back to now-empty pot. Stir in 2 cups reserved cooking liquid, soy sauce, sake, vinegar, honey, and ginger until combined. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms absorb cooking liquid and turn brown, about 30 minutes. Off heat, cover pot and let mushrooms cool to room temperature. For the Salad: Toss cucumbers with lemon juice in large bowl. Arrange cucumbers on large plate, then arrange mushrooms over top. Pour 1/2 cup cooking liquid over salad and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil to taste. Serve.

A sudden dip in temperature coupled with excess moisture is enough to coax these fungi out of hiding. Hen of the woods, porcinis, chicken of the woods, oyster mushrooms, and chanterelles are just a small sampling of the varieties available\u2014free of charge\u2014to the discerning woodland forager. But even if you aren\u2019t trained to mushroom-hunt on your own, wild mushrooms tend to pop up in markets when cooler weather approaches. Here is a simple recipe that highlights the natural nutty, earthy qualities of wild mushrooms. Pan-roasting results in crispy edges but tender, juicy interiors. To complement the earthy and savory notes of these mushrooms, we make a quick sauce of coffee and soy sauce. The bitterness of the coffee brings out the bitterness of the mushrooms, so that the mushrooms taste even more\u2026well, mushroom-y. To provide some textural contrast and sweet, buttery notes, we add in toasted hazelnuts, plus a nice dusting of grated hazelnuts for that fancy, restaurant-quality vibe. For best results, look for varieties such as hen of the woods, chicken of the woods, oyster mushrooms, or butter oyster mushrooms. For the sauce, a light to medium roast coffee works best; dark roasts tend to be too bitter for this application. Pan Roasted Wild Mushrooms with Coffee and Hazelnuts Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 2 Ingredients: 1/4 cup brewed coffee 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon honey 3/4 teaspoon cornstarch 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 10 ounces wild mushrooms, separated into 2- to 3-inch pieces Salt and pepper \u00bc cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped, plus extra whole for serving Preparation: Whisk coffee, soy sauce, honey, and cornstarch in small saucepan until combined. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce is clear, slightly thickened and coats back of spoon, 1 to 2 minutes. Cover and set aside. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook until first side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are heated through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes longer. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste. To serve: Spoon coffee sauce on plate and sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts. Arrange mushrooms on top and grate extra hazelnuts over mushrooms. Serve.

The umami flavor in certain foods comes from glutamic acid, an amino acid associated with savory or meaty flavors. Mushrooms contain a significant amount of glutamic acid and are considered an umami-rich food. Other umami-rich foods include tomatoes, aged cheeses like Parmeggiano Reggiano, and fermented foods like fish sauce and soy sauce. This recipe aggregates a number of umami-rich foods to create a savory, meat-free sandwich. Portabella Sandwiches with Umami Sauce Recipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America Serves 4 Ingredients: For umami sauce \u00bc cup mayonnaise 1 \u00bd teaspoons reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d soy sauce \u00bd teaspoon Dijon-style mustard For caramelized onions 1 medium white or yellow onion, sliced 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil \u00bd teaspoon dried thyme For portabella mushrooms 4 large portabella mushroom caps, stems removed 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 3 teaspoons reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d soy sauce 3 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 4 whole grain rolls, toasted or warmed on the grill Preparation: Preheat your grill to medium-high. In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, soy sauce, and mustard. Set aside In a medium saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat combine the onions and olive oil. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until onions are brown and have developed caramelized flavor. Add the thyme, cook for additional 30 seconds, remove from heat, and set aside Brush the portabella mushroom caps with olive oil on both sides. Grill 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until tender. Assemble your sandwiches by placing a mushroom cap on the bottom of each bun. Top the mushroom with about \u00bc cup caramelized onions and 1 tablespoon of the umami sauce.

Try not to let them get mushy, but do make sure they are cooked through. Transfer to a serving bowl or platter.

This recipe celebrates it all! You remove the stems from the leaves and cook everything separately (enabling the stems to retain their glorious color), then recombine all the components, for a visually stunning side dish. Chard can carry a lot of silt\u2014and then retain a lot of water on its craggy leaves\u2014so wash and dry it thoroughly before you begin. Ruby Chard Decorated with Itself Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen Serves 4-6 Ingredients: 1 pound ruby chard, washed in several changes of water and thoroughly dried 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup minced red onion 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar Salt to taste Freshly ground black pepper \u00bd cup lightly toasted pine nuts (optional) Preparation: Use a very sharp knife to remove the stems from the chard leaves. Coarsely chop the leaves and set them aside. Trim and discard the very tips of the stems (as well as any dinged up edges), and mince the rest. Place a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add about 2 teaspoons of the olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Toss in the chard stems and the onion, turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir-fry for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with salt, if desired, then transfer the mixture to a medium-sized bowl, and set aside. Without cleaning it, return the pan to the stove over medium heat. Pour in the vinegar, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to very low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour this slightly reduced vinegar over the stem\u2013onion mixture in the bowl. Return the still-uncleaned pan to the stove over medium heat, wait another minute, then add the remaining olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Turn up the heat to medium-high, and toss in the chard leaves. Cook quickly, turning with tongs as you go, until the leaves are wilted. This will only take a couple of minutes. You can salt the leaves lightly while they cook if you wish. When the leaves are done to your liking, transfer them to a serving plate or bowl, and taste to adjust salt. Add black pepper to taste, then spoon the stem mixture over the top, being sure to include all the juices. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, topped with pine nuts, if desired.

You can steam, boil, or stir-fry broccoli or rapini. Nina likes to blanch these types of vegetables in advance until near-tender, refresh them, and then stir-fry over very high heat just before serving. Spicy Broccolini with Red Pepper Recipe courtesy of Nina Simonds Serves 6 Ingredients: 2 pounds broccolini, rapini, Chinese or western broccoli or flowering rape 2 tablespoons virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon crushed dried chili flakes 1 small red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into \u00bc-inch dice 6 cloves garlic, smashed with the flat edge of a knife, skins removed, and sliced thinly 1 teaspoon salt to taste Juice of \u00bd lemon, or about 2\u00bd tablespoons Preparation: Cut away the tough end of the broccolini or rapini, and peel away the tough outer skin from the stems. Separate the stalks or tougher part of the vegetable from the more tender part (flowerets). Cut the stalks into 1-inch lengths and separate the flowerets. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil, add the tougher part (stalks) of the vegetable and cook for about 2 minutes or until almost tender, but al dente. Add the remaining part of the vegetable and cook for another minute, or until the vegetable is tender. Drain and refresh briefly in cold water. Drain again. Heat a wok or a heavy skillet, add the oil, and heat until hot, about 15 seconds. Add the chili flakes, red pepper, and sliced garlic. Stir-fry over medium-high heat for 2 minutes or until the red pepper is slightly tender. Add the broccolini and toss lightly over high heat to mix for a minute. Add the lemon juice and salt and toss lightly to mix. Stir together and taste for seasoning, adjusting if necessary. Scoop onto a platter or into a bowl and serve.

The filling of chickpeas and vegetables gives the pie a nice \u201cbite,\u201d making this recipe a top contender for any holiday gathering. Ingredients (Serves 8) 1/2 lb. chickpeas, dried 2 bay leaves (or, substitute 2 14.5oz cans of low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed) 1 lb. turnips 1 10-oz. container cremini or button mushrooms 2-3 medium carrots 1 large or 2 medium leeks 2 large stalks of celery 2 medium cloves garlic 3-4 sprigs sage 2 sprigs rosemary 4-6 sprigs thyme 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 2-4 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock 5 lbs. sweet potatoes 4 egg yolks 4 Tablespoons olive oil kosher salt, to taste 1 teaspoon black pepper Instructions For the chickpeas (omit these steps if using canned chickpeas) Soak chickpeas overnight in enough lightly salted water to cover them by 4\u201d. If you don\u2019t have the time, put the chickpeas in a pot, cover with lightly salted water (also about 4\u201d), bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let them sit for about 2 hours. Once the chickpeas have soaked, combine the chickpeas, soaking liquid, and the bay leaves in a soup pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a little over an hour, or until the chickpeas are tender but still retain a bit of texture. Strain the chickpeas and set them aside. For the carrots, turnips, and mushrooms Wash everything, and cut into evenly-sized 1/2\u201d pieces. Heat an oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine vegetables, and divide into batches so the baking sheet isn\u2019t overcrowded. Toss each batch in olive oil, and place on baking sheet. Roast each batch in the oven until browned and cooked through \u2013 this can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Set the roasted veggies aside when finished. To complete the filling Cut the root off of the leek(s) and remove the dark green leaves, keeping only the very light-green and white parts. Take off the outer layer. Cut the leek(s) into a small dice (about 1/4\u201d pieces). Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don\u2019t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain. Cut the celery into a small dice, and mince the garlic. Mince the herbs. Heat 2 Tablespoons olive oil in a 2 quart pot over medium-low heat, and add the leeks, celery, and garlic. Sweat the veggies for 5-8 minutes until translucent \u2013 keep the heat low so they don\u2019t color. Add the herbs, black pepper, and tomato paste, and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly so the tomato paste doesn\u2019t stick and burn. Add 4 Tablespoons olive oil to the pot, and then the whole wheat flour. Stir the flour and continue to cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly add the vegetable stock while stirring, starting with about 2 cups. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a simmer, then add more stock if necessary to bring the sauce to a thick stew-like consistency. Remove from the heat. Mix together the chickpeas, mushrooms, turnips, carrots, and filling \u2018base\u2019. You may not need all of the filling base \u2013 add a little at a time until you get to the desired consistency. It should be rich and fairly thick \u2013 not soupy. If needed, season to taste with kosher salt. Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Wrap each yam/sweet potato in aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven until completely soft, 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Scoop out all of the flesh from the sweet potatoes/yams and put in a mixing bowl with the olive oil and black pepper. Mash with a big fork or potato masher. Whip the egg yolks with a little kosher salt until smooth, and add to the bowl. Mix until everything is combined. To assemble and serve Heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread the filling in the bottom of a 9\u00d711\u201d casserole dish. Spread the mashed sweet potatoes/yams evenly on top. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned.

One strategy for incorporating more fruit into your diet is to eat fruit for dessert, or to create desserts that are mostly fruit. This dessert is an example of this strategy. Each serving of this dessert provides a full serving of fruit. The addition of whole grains, nuts, and olive oil make this a very satisfying dessert your family and guests will enjoy. Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp Recipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America Cook Time 35 - 40 min. Serves 12 Ingredients: 6 cups fresh or frozen rhubarb (about 1 \u00bd pounds), cut into \u00bd-inch pieces 3 cups fresh strawberries, quartered \u00bc cup light brown sugar 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon or orange peel 1 cup old-fashioned oatmeal \u00bd cup almond flour or finely ground almonds \u00bd cup brown sugar 1/3 cup whole wheat flour 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Preparation: In a large mixing bowl combine the rhubarb, strawberries, brown sugar, and lemon or orange zest. Toss well so all of the fruit is covered in sugar. Spread the fruit into an even layer on the bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch ceramic or glass baking dish. In a medium mixing bowl combine oatmeal, almond flour, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, melted butter, and olive oil. The mixture should be crumbly. Use a large spoon to sprinkle this mixture over the fruit. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes, until the topping is browned and the fruit is soft. Serve warm with a small scoop of vanilla yogurt or ice cream.

Ancient grains like barley, farro, and wheat berries, or even brown rice provide plenty of earthy notes on their own. But with a little heat and time, these grains undergo a unique transformation: They become toasty, nutty, and take on flavors reminiscent of caramel and even umami-rich soy sauce. Here we take advantage of this idea by roasting portobello mushrooms in toasted, hulless barley grains. Wrapping the mushrooms creates steam while roasting, concentrating the barley flavors while keeping the mushrooms tender and juicy. After roasting, we blend some of the barley to create a rich, nutty sauce that gets a little extra boost from miso. We cook the rest of the roasted barley and incorporate it into a fresh fennel salad to serve along with the mushrooms. This is a complex, deeply savory mushroom dish that highlights what is possible with relatively few ingredients. Be sure to use hulless barley, as opposed to unhulled or pearled barley. For best results, use a high-powered blender in step 3. Barley Roasted Portobello and Fennel Salad Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4 Ingredients: 1 cup (7 ounces) hulless barley, toasted 4 (4- to 6-ounce) portobello mushrooms 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 cup vegetable oil, divided 1 teaspoon Kosher salt 1 bulb fennel, sliced thin, fronds reserved 1 tablespoon white miso 1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus extra for serving Preparation: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees F. Line 13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and spray with baking spray. Spread barley on parchment in even layer. Brush mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil and season on both sides with salt. Place mushrooms, stem-side down on barley. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil, crimping edges to seal. Roast mushrooms until fragrant and tender, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove foil and let mushrooms cool until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to cutting board, cleaning any barley from gills. Cut mushrooms into \u00bd-inch slices and set aside. Add 1/2 cup roasted barley to pot along with 3 cups water. Bring barley to boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until barley is just tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain barley and set aside. Meanwhile, transfer remaining 1/2 cup roasted barley to blender jar and blend on high speed until barley resembles coarse powder, about 2 minutes. With blender running, pour remaining 3/4 cup vegetable oil in steady stream and blend until mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes longer. Add miso and blend until smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Strain barley oil through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, stirring solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Whisk in lemon juice until smooth and combined and set aside. To Serve: Combine fennel, cooked barley, and 2 tablespoons barley sauce in bowl and toss to coat evenly. Pour remaining barley sauce on large serving platter. Place fennel salad on top and drizzle with lemon juice to taste. Arrange mushrooms on fennel and drizzle with any remaining sauce. Sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve.

If the mixture gets too dry, add a small amount of skim milk or egg white to loosen it (begin with 1 tablespoon of either skim milk or egg white). Drop 2-ounce balls onto a hot dry griddle and flatten gently with your palm (if the mixture sticks to your palms, you can dip your hand in water).

It\u2019s different and delicious, with the addition of a few non-traditional spices\u2014and it\u2019s a great way to slip some of that nutritious wonder-grain, quinoa, into your diet. Couscous-Quinoa Tabouli Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen Serves 6 to 8 Ingredients: 1 cup uncooked quinoa 1 cup uncooked instant couscous \u00be cup boiling water 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 2 cups (packed) minced fresh parsley (flat or curly-leaf) 1 cup minced fresh mint 3-4 scallions, finely minced 1 cup minced red onion (about 1 small onion) 1 or 2 small (6-inch) cucumbers, peeled, seeded if necessary, and diced 1 heaping teaspoon minced garlic \u00bd teaspoon cinnamon \u00bd teaspoon salt (possibly more to taste) Freshly ground black pepper to taste 4-6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 or more tablespoons fresh lemon juice (to taste) Optional garnishes Tiny cherry tomatoes, for garnish (cut in half if not really tiny) A few toasted walnuts, minced Toasted pita bread Preparation: Place the quinoa in a strainer and rinse under cold running water. Transfer to a small saucepan, add 1\u00bc cups water, and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat way down, and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and fluff thoroughly with a fork to let heat escape. Set aside. (Continue to fluff the quinoa from time to time as you prepare the other ingredients, so the grains stay dry and separate.) Place the couscous in a medium-large bowl, and add the boiling water. Cover with a plate and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the plate, and fluff with a fork as you did with the quinoa. Then add the quinoa to the couscous, and fluff mightily. (It\u2019s very important to the texture of this dish that the grains be separate and \u201ctender-dry.\u201d They will borrow moisture from the other ingredients, and you don\u2019t want the salad to turn to mush.) Meanwhile, lightly toast the seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are fragrant. Cover and stir often, so they don\u2019t burn. Transfer to an electric spice grinder or a mortar and pestle. Grind to a powder, and add this to the cooked grains. Set the bowl aside until the grains have cooled at least to room temperature. When the grains have cooled, use a fork to stir in all the remaining ingredients except the optional garnishes. Cover tightly and chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve cold, topped with cherry tomatoes and/or minced walnuts, and with some toasted pita bread on the side, if desired.

The muffins from this recipe weigh about 2 ounces, contain 120 calories, and are made with a mixture of whole wheat, white, and almond flour. (You don\u2019t need to buy almond flour; you can make your own almond flour by grinding whole almonds in your food processor.) All of the butter was replaced with canola oil. And the amount of fresh blueberries was doubled. Orange zest adds a zingy background note that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the blueberries. The result is a moist, flavorful blueberry muffin that will provide longer lasting energy compared to the usual coffee shop muffin. Blueberry Muffins Serves 18 muffins or 30 mini muffins Ingredients: 1 cup (120 g) whole wheat pastry flour \u00be cup (90 g) white whole wheat flour \u00bc cup (26 g) almond flour 1 tsp. (4 g) baking powder \u00bd tsp. (4 g) baking soda \u00bd tsp. (2 g) salt 1 tsp. (2 g) orange zest 1 \u00bd cups (200 g) fresh blueberries 2 eggs 1\u00bc cups (286 g) low fat (1%) buttermilk 4 Tbsp. (42 g) brown sugar 6 Tbsp. (78 g) canola oil 1 Tbsp. (14 g) orange juice, freshly squeezed \u00bd tsp. (4 g) vanilla Preparation: Place the rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit Line muffin tins with paper liners. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest. Add the fresh blue berries and toss gently to coat the blueberries in flour. This will help keep the blueberries suspended in the batter versus falling to the bottom. In a medium mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then whisk in the buttermilk, brown sugar, canola oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Don\u2019t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled or lumpy. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until most of the flour is incorporated. The mixture can be slightly lumpy; don\u2019t over mix. Divide the batter among the 18 prepared muffin cups. Bake 12 to 14 minutes, until the muffins are golden brown around the edges.

(8 g) orange zest 2 egg whites Preparation: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line muffin tins with paper liners. Pour boiling water over the dried cranberries and allow them to soak for 10 minutes. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients. In the bowl of a stand mixer that is outfitted with a paddle attachment, place the egg yolk, oil, agave, buttermilk, vanilla, and yogurt and mix for two minutes until combined. Add the dry ingredients in three stages, mixing on low speed and scraping the sides of the bowl with each addition. Drain the cranberries, discard the water, and add the cranberries to the batter along with the orange zest. Mix to combine. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white to medium peaks. Add a small amount of the egg whites to the batter and stir to combine (this will help lighten the batter a bit). Fold the remaining egg whites into the batter, carefully so as not to deflate the whites. Scoop into muffin tins. Fill the tins three-quarters full. Bake 20 to 22 minutes.

Plain kitchen scissors are the best utensil for cutting dried tomatoes. Tiny yellow cherry tomatoes look and work best in this dish. If you can only get larger ones, cut them in half. If you can only get red ones, that will be okay, too. Chopped Roma tomatoes will work as well. Fantastic Bulgur Dish Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services Cook Time 50 min. Serves 6 Ingredients: 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups tiny cherry tomatoes (\u00bd pound)\u2014yellow ones, if available, or diced Roma tomatoes \u00bd cup dried tomatoes, minced (1 ounce) 1 tablespoon minced garlic \u00be teaspoon salt 1\u00bd cups coarse bulgur 2 cups water (room temperature or warmer) \u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes to taste 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice to taste 2 to 3 teaspoons light-colored honey to taste Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted Roasted walnut oil Wedges of lemon Preparation: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep nonstick skillet. Add the cherry tomatoes and saut\u00e9 over high heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in the dried tomatoes and the salt. Continue cooking over high heat for about 2 to 3 minutes longer (cherry tomatoes might begin to pop open from the heat, and that\u2019s fine). Turn the heat down. Add the garlic and bulgur (and a little more oil, if it seems dry), and saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes. Stir in the water, bring to a boil, then turn the heat down as low as possible. Cover and simmer for 35 minutes or until the bulgur is tender. Transfer to a serving bowl, and fluff with a fork to let the steam escape so that the bulgur won\u2019t become mushy. Taste to adjust salt, then add red pepper flakes, lemon juice, honey, and black pepper to taste. Serve hot or warm, topped with walnuts and a drizzle of roasted walnut oil, and garnish with lemon wedges.

Traditional risotto requires carnaroli or arborio rice, but there are plenty of other grains you can use. Farro is the perfect example. It\u2019s easy to cook, but doesn\u2019t turn mushy as easily as traditional rice varieties. Here we pair whole, unhulled farro with our earthy Walnut Pesto. Cracking about half the farro in a blender is key to releasing enough starch from the grains to create a creamy, risotto-like texture. To keep the grains separate, we add liquid in stages. Stirring in the pesto at the very end of cooking ensures maximum freshness and maintains a vibrant green color in the dish. Farro Risotto with Walnut Pesto Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4 Ingredients: 1 cup whole farro 4 cups vegetable broth 2 cups water 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 onion, minced Salt and pepper 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 cup dry white wine 1 recipe Walnut Pesto \u2153 cup basil leaves, torn into \u00bd-inch pieces Preparation: Pulse farro in blender until about half of grains are broken into smaller pieces, about 6 pulses. Bring broth and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to low and cover. Meanwhile, heat oil in large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in farro, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Stir in the wine and continue to cook, stirring often, until the wine has been completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups broth mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in 2 more cups of the warm broth and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 \u00adminutes longer. Continue to cook risotto, stirring often and adding 1/2 cup remaining broth at a time as needed to keep pan bottom from becoming dry (about every 4 minutes), until grains are cooked through but still have bite, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in 1/2 cup pesto. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with remaining 1/2 cup pesto and basil.

The seeds and different types of flour add flavor, texture, and fiber, making a filling, satisfying loaf that is great for sandwiches or to go with salads. The basic recipe consists of water, yeast, whole wheat flour, and salt. You can add more seeds or more types of flour, or trade one type of seed or flour for another, as long the final dough is not sticky. Vitamin C helps the yeast work better. Together with lecithin and pectin, it also keeps the bread fresh longer and improves the texture. Hearty Whole Grain Bread Recipe courtesy of Liesbeth Smit Cook Time 45 min. - 1 hr. Serves 3 small, or 2 large loaves (about 30 slices) Ingredients: 4 cups warm water (110\u2013115 degrees Fahrenheit) 3 packets dry active yeast (1/4 ounce each) 1/2 cup whole grain buckwheat flour 1/2 cup whole grain barley flour 1 cup whole grain rye flour 4\u20135 cups whole wheat flour 4 grams salt Canola oil or canola oil spray, as needed Seeds and Grains 1 cup ground flax seeds (grind them in a coffee grinder, or buy milled flax seeds) 1/2 cup sunflower seeds 1/2 cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds) 3/4 cup whole rolled oats 1/2 cup wheat bran Bread Enhancers 2 crushed 500 milligrams vitamin C supplements (any store brand) 1 tablespoon lecithin (can be found in a natural foods store) 1 teaspoon pectin (can be found in a natural foods store) Preparation: Add 4 cups of warm water to a large bowl. Dissolve the yeast, and let it stand for a few minutes until bubbly. Add the bread enhancers (vitamin C, lecithin, and pectin) and stir. Then add the seeds, oats, and wheat bran and stir. Add the buckwheat, barley, and rye flours to the water-yeast mixture, a half cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Then, add the whole-wheat flour one cup at a time, stirring, until the dough is dry enough to knead by hand. Make sure to mix in the salt with the last cup of flour, because adding salt will diminish the activity of the yeast. Place the bread on a cutting board or counter top and start kneading: Fold the dough in half towards you and push away with the heels of your hands. Turn the dough one quarter turn and repeat the process for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and not sticky. For the first rise, put the ball of dough in a bowl coated with oil (canola oil spray is very handy). To prevent drying, also coat the top of the dough with a thin layer of oil. Cover the bowl with a wet dish towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm environment until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. (Placing the bread in an oven with the light on works well. You can also let the dough rise on top of the oven as it is preheating.) For a lighter-textured loaf, remove the dough from the bowl, fold the dough in half twice, and place it back in the bowl, covered, to let it rise a second time. After the second rise, deflate the dough by punching it gently. Carefully cut the dough into 2 or 3 equal pieces, and put each piece of dough in an oil-coated loaf pan. Bake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 to 60 minutes. When your kitchen smells like fresh baked bread and the bread is done, remove from the oven, turn the bread out of the pans onto a rack, and cool the loaves completely. This bread tastes great when it\u2018s toasted, and it is delicious served with hummus, guacamole, and chopped walnuts. The loaves also freeze well.

Serves 6 Ingredients: 2 pounds greens (chard, beet greens, escarole, or spinach), or 12 large handfuls 1\u00bd pounds shellfish (scallops, prawns, squid, or clams), cleaned If you are using scallops: Remove the muscles from each one. If you are using prawns: Remove the shells and devein if necessary. If you are using squid: Clean and cut into rings about \u00bd inch wide, keeping the tentacles in one piece unless they are large in which case you may cut them in half. If you are using clams: Allow 16 tiny clams in the shell per person, or about 8 to 10 out of the shell if they are larger. \u00bd-\u00be cup extra virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 12 garlic cloves, minced 2 teaspoons hot pepper flakes 2 cups tomatoes diced in \u00bd inch cubes or canned diced tomatoes or tomato sauce \u00bd cup dry white wine 1\u00bd cups chickpeas, cooked (optional) 1 pound whole grain pasta, cooked al dente Preparation: Cut greens into \u00bd-inch by 3-inch strips, then wash and drain. Boil the greens in a large quantity of salted water to soften them, about 5 minutes. Drain well, refresh with cold water to set the color, and drain again. Chop coarsely and set aside. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, add \u00bd cup of olive oil and saut\u00e9 the onion until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes or sauce if using, the optional chickpeas with some of their liquid, and the greens. Heat through. This should be a bit soupy. Season the shellfish with salt and pepper. You may steam them very briefly in the white wine and add the shellfish and wine to the greens. Alternately, you may add the wine along with the tomatoes and cook the shellfish directly in the pan with the greens until the shrimp turn pink, the scallops become opaque, and the squid turns white. The squid will cook in a matter of minutes. Taste the sauce and then season with salt and pepper. Toss with the cooked pasta. Serve at once.

Using pureed, canned chickpeas creates a very moist, tender muffin because the chickpea starch holds water so well. The addition of ground almonds to the batter contributes a hearty nuttiness as well as healthy fats. Pair these muffins with fresh fruit and yogurt for the occasional breakfast, or grab a muffin and a cup of tea or coffee for an afternoon snack. Lemon Chickpea Muffins Serves 12 muffins, or 28 mini muffins Ingredients: For batter 1\u00be cup (271 g) chickpeas from a 15 oz. can, drained and rinsed 1 Tbsp. (12 g) lemon zest 1 Tbsp. (12 g) orange zest 2 Tbsp. (28 g) fresh lemon juice 2 Tbsp.

(2 g) granulated sugar (optional) Preparation: Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line muffin tin with paper liners. Puree the chickpeas in a food processor until smooth. Add the lemon and orange zest, juice, olive oil, sugar, and egg yolks. Puree until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cardamom. Stir in the chickpea mixture, and then add the ground almonds. Whisk the egg whites until they hold semi-soft peaks. Fold the egg whites into the batter carefully, so not to deflate the egg whites. In a small bowl combine the ground or slivered almonds, sugar (optional), and cardamom. Set aside. Scoop batter into muffin tin. You can use a \u2153 cup to do this, but you\u2019ll only need to add a generous \u00bc cup of batter to each muffin cup. Sprinkle the muffin batter with some of the almond-cardamom mixture. Bake in the oven 12 to 13 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.

Quinoa Enchilada Casserole Prep Time 10 minutes Cook Time 1 hour Serves 4 Ingredients: For the Enchilada Sauce 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano or regular oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1 (14.5\u2011ounce) can diced tomatoes 1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste For the Casserole 2 cups Cooked Quinoa 3 tablespoons chopped Anaheim or other mild chile (about 1/2 chile) 2 cups cooked beans or drained and rinsed canned beans, such as black beans, chickpeas, pinto beans, or a combination 8 or 9 sprigs cilantro, chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon salt, or more as needed 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste 1 cup shredded cheese, such as cheddar or mozzarella 1 avocado, diced, for garnish 2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced, for garnish Preparation: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Make the enchilada sauce: Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Stir together the chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. Add the spices to the hot oil all at once. Cook, stirring, for a few seconds to allow the spices to become fragrant and infuse the oil with flavor without burning. Add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Puree directly in the pot with an immersion blender. (If the sauce is not deep enough to fully immerse the blender and prevent splattering, carefully transfer the sauce to a deep bowl or jar to blend. Return to the pan after blending.) Simmer for 5 minutes more to slightly reduce the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Set aside. (This sauce can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and reheated for quicker prep.) Assemble the casserole: In a 9\u2011inch square casserole dish, combine the quinoa, enchilada sauce, chile, beans, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and 3/4 cup of the cheese. Adjust the seasonings. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese evenly over the top. Bake until bubbling and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately, garnished with the avocado and fresh tomato. Recipe from Always Delicious by David Ludwig, MD, PH & Chef Dawn Ludwig. Published by Grand Central Life & Style.

This tasty salad is sure to go fast, so you may even want to double the recipe! Ingredients (Serves 8) 1 large bunch rainbow chard (or Swiss chard) 1 large bunch kale (any kind) 1 lb. Brussels sprouts 1/2 lb. shiitake mushrooms 1 Tablespoon maple syrup 1 teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked paprika 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper 1 bay leaf 1/2 cup dried wheat berries 2 oz. fresh goat cheese (if desired) extra virgin olive oil 1 large shallot 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard a few grinds of cracked black pepper 1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt 2 Tablespoons raw honey 1/4 cup sherry vinegar (or cider vinegar) 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil Instructions Wash the kale and chard thoroughly. If either is too tough to eat raw, wilt slightly in a pan with a little olive oil. Dry the leaves well. Tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Quarter the Brussels sprouts, removing any tough outer leaves. Heat 3 Tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Right before the oil is about to smoke, add the Brussels sprouts to the pan in an even layer. If you can\u2019t add them all in one layer, do them in batches. Sear the Brussels sprouts, flipping around occasionally, until dark brown and roasted. Add more olive oil if needed. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Heat 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a small soup pan over medium heat. Wash the wheat berries and drain off the excess water. Add the wheat berries to the pan, and toast them in the oil, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of kosher salt, the bay leaf, and cover with about 2\u201d of water. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer them until tender, 30-40 minutes. They should begin to pop open a bit. When you taste one, it shouldn\u2019t feel hard, but it should still have a good bite to it. When the wheat berries are done, strain and set aside to cool. For the mushroom \u201cbacon\u201d Heat an oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Trim the stems off of the shiitake mushrooms. Toss the caps in olive oil and kosher salt, and spread on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes until they start to get brown and roasted. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Mix the maple syrup, chipotle powder/paprika, and black pepper, and toss the mushrooms in the mixture until evenly coated. Return the mushrooms to the oven for 2-3 minutes until they start to crisp up again, then remove and set aside to cool on the baking sheet. For the dressing Cut the shallot into a small dice (1/4\u201d). Heat 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a small saute pan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallot is golden brown and caramelized, about 12-15 minutes. Add the shallot, mustard, black pepper, salt, honey, and vinegar to the blender, or to a cup just big enough around to fit a hand blender. Blend until fully combined. While the blender is running, slowly add the 3/4 cup of oil in a thin stream until fully incorporated. Add water if needed to thin out the dressing. To finish Add the goat cheese (if desired), Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, wheat berries, and about 2-4 Tablespoons dressing to a large mixing bowl. It\u2019s better to start with less dressing and add more later. Add the greens and toss the ingredients together until everything is coated with dressing and mixed well. Add extra dressing as needed.

It also makes a great sandwich spread. Spanish Romesco Sauce (Red Pepper and Almond Sauce) Recipe courtesy of Joyce Goldstein Serves 10 Ingredients: 2 ancho chiles, medium, or 1 rounded teaspoon ancho chile powder 1 cup almonds, blanched, or skinned hazelnuts, toasted, or combination of both 4 garlic cloves, large, minced 1 bell pepper, large red, roasted, seeded peeled, chopped 1 cup tomato, peeled, seeded, diced, fresh or canned 1 tablespoon smoked sweet pimenton pepper or sweet paprika \u00bd teaspoon smoked hot pimenton pepper or cayenne pepper 3 tablespoons red wine or sherry vinegar 1 teaspoon salt \u00be cup extra virgin olive oil Preparation: If using whole anchos, soak the chiles in hot water and cover for about 1 hour. Drain, remove the stems and seeds and cut into small pieces. Transfer the chile pieces, or ancho chile powder, if using, to a food processor along with the nuts, garlic, roasted pepper, tomatoes, pimenton, vinegar, and salt. Pulse a few times to make a chunky paste. Start adding the oil a tablespoon at a time until the mixture emulsifies. Taste. We are looking for sweetness from the peppers, nuttiness, and acidity. Add salt if necessary to bring up the flavors. Let the sauce rest for 15 minutes for the flavors to come together, taste again and then decide if you want it spicier, saltier, or more vinegary, and adjust accordingly. The sauce keeps, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. If the oil has risen to the top you may want to re-emulsify it in the food processor, or you can remix it back to a smooth consistency with a small whisk.

This pungent condiment goes great on everything\u2014slathered over chicken, right on top of fish, and especially mixed into pasta or rice dishes. And despite its convenience, store-bought pesto tends to be expensive and lacks the vibrancy of the homemade stuff. Here we have a riff on pesto that employs walnuts instead of more traditional pine nuts. To keep our pesto vibrant green, we blanch a mix of basil and parsley (which contains more chlorophyll), locking in the color and resulting in a pesto that stays green longer. Toasting walnuts gives our pesto an earthier, buttery flavor, while a healthy dose of pepper reinforces the pungency of basil. The resulting pesto is bold green, packs a punch, and goes great with everything\u2014though we might just as well eat it by the spoonful. Walnut Pesto Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves Makes about 1 cup Ingredients: 1 cup packed parsley 1 cup packed basil Salt \u00bc cup walnuts \u00bc cup (\u00bd ounce) parmesan cheese 3 cloves garlic \u00bd teaspoon pepper \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil Preparation: Fill medium bowl with ice water. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat; add parsley, basil, and \u00bd teaspoon salt, return to boil, and cook until herbs are bright green and wilted, about 45 seconds. Drain herbs in fine mesh strainer and transfer immediately to ice water. When herbs no longer feel warm to touch, drain in strainer again and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Transfer herbs to bowl of food processor (break up herbs with fingers to distribute evenly). Add walnuts, parmesan, garlic, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 20 pulses. With processor running, add oil in steady stream until mixture is smooth and combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

One of the beautiful things about red lentils (which are actually orange, but cook up to be yellow, so the name is confusing) is that they inadvertently mash themselves. Very thoughtful of them to pitch in. Simmer the lentils well ahead of time. This will take about 20 to 30 minutes. While they are simmering, start cooking the onions. The onions need to be very well done in order for this dish to achieve its highest potential. You have the option of \u201cspiking\u201d the olive oil with butter, which will give the dish a richer, more complex flavor. This is also perfectly fine without the butter\u2014something vegans will be glad to know. Cozy Red Lentil Mash Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services Serves 4 as a main dish, or 6 as a side dish Ingredients: 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (use the lesser amount if adding butter) 2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional) 3 cups minced sweet onion 2 cups uncooked red lentils 5 cups water 1 teaspoon salt 2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Black pepper, to taste Cayenne (if desired) Preparation: Place a large, wide skillet over medium heat and wait 1 minute. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the butter, if using, and let it melt into the olive oil. Then add the onions, shaking the pan to make sure they are distributed over the heated oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, and adding \u00bd teaspoon salt any time after the first 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, combine the lentils and water in an uncovered pot or kettle. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and let it cook undisturbed over the lowest possible heat until all the lentils are soft (approximately 10 to 30 minutes). To insure against burning the bottom, you can insert a heat-absorber underneath. After the onions have cooked for about 30 minutes, douse them with 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, mixing it in as you go. When the onions are very soft, and very sweet (about a few minutes later), add the lentils, stirring them in to combine well. Remove from the heat, and taste to adjust salt (it will need more) and vinegar (I usually end up adding another tablespoon or so). Season with black pepper and cayenne, and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. This stores well in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator, and reheats beautifully in the microwave.

Bring this mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook at this level for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the nuts to sit in the liquid overnight. Day 2 The following day preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Drain the peanuts in a colander and pat them dry. Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet and bake them in the middle of the oven for about 30 minutes, shaking the sheet occasionally to redistribute the nuts so they will brown evenly. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and check the peanuts every 10 minutes to catch them when they are fully roasted and no longer moist in the center. Allow to cool. Each of the additional nuts can be toasted to their own baking sheet in the same oven until a light golden, about 15 minutes. Season lightly with salt and allow to cool. Combine the cooled nuts with the dried fruit and candied ginger. Store the trail mix in an airtight container.

Add your own favorite blend of spices and toss some chickpeas in a salad, or grab a handful for a healthy snack. Ingredients One 15-oz can chickpeas (garbanzo beans) 1 Tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon spice or spice blend of choice (more/less to taste) Try dried spices like chili powder, cumin, curry powder, cayenne, cinnamon, or fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, oregano. Instructions Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Strain the chickpeas and rinse well, draining as much water as possible. Lay the chickpeas on a paper towel or dish cloth, and pat dry to absorb the water. For crispier chickpeas, roll the towel over the beans to remove the thin skins (this step is optional but it will further eliminate moisture when baking). Once fully dry, line a baking sheet and place the chickpeas in the oven to roast for 15 minutes (avoid crowding the baking sheet, especially if doubling the recipe). Remove chickpeas from the oven and drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the spices, making sure they are evenly coated. Place them back into the oven and roast for another 15 minutes (you may need more or less time, just keep an eye on them so they don\u2019t burn). When done, turn off the oven and keep its door slightly open as it cools down. Note that the chickpeas will be crunchiest following roasting, but can be stored for a few days at room temperature.

Along with yellow and white lentil varieties, red lentils are sold decorticated (with their skins removed), so they cook much quicker than do their black, brown, or green counterparts. In fact, red lentils easily cook down to mush if you\u2019re not careful, but that\u2019s a great quality to have when making soups or Indian-style daal. Here we have a hearty soup with some of those Indian influences\u2014just shy of a more authentic masoor dal\u2014using a few key pantry items. Blooming spices and tomato paste in an onion mixture creates layers of toasty flavor. And because these lentils cook and soften so quickly, there\u2019s no need for a blender or any special equipment. Instead, we simply use a whisk to lightly pulse the mixture, resulting in a soup with a pleasant, rustic texture. A splash of lemon juice gives brightness to the dish. Add a little naan or toasted bread, and salad, and you\u2019ve got a quick, simple soup makes the perfect light dinner. Curried Red Lentil Soup Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4-6 Ingredients: 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving 1 large onion, chopped fine Pinch salt 2 teaspoons curry powder \u00bd teaspoon ground cumin \u00bc teaspoon pepper Pinch cayenne 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 garlic clove, minced 4 cups chicken broth 2 cups water 10 \u00bd ounces (1 \u00bd cups) red lentils, picked over and rinsed 2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus extra wedges for serving Chopped fresh cilantro Preparation: Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, cumin, pepper, and cayenne, and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in broth, water, and lentils and bring to simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and about half are broken down, about 15 minutes. Whisk soup vigorously until it is coarsely pureed, about 30 seconds. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt to taste. Ladle soup into individual bowls, drizzle each portion with olive oil, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve with extra lemon juice. (Soup can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Thin soup with water, if desired, when reheating.)

But they don\u2019t have to be that way. Here\u2019s a dish of lentils prepared in the classic French style\u2014straight up, with simple aromatics and a little attention to detail. Cooking the lentils in a mixture of water, carrots, garlic, and bay leaves ensures plenty of base flavor. To keep the lentils from overcooking and to preserve their toothsome texture, we rinse the cooked lentils under cold water, washing out excess starch and stopping the cooking process. We fold the lentils and carrots back into a combination of rendered shallots, wine, stock, and a little more oil. To give some welcome brightness and a little kick, we finish the dish with a bit of whole grain mustard and a splash of red wine vinegar. This is a simple, hearty dish that\u2019s a great introduction to this versatile legume\u2014and a perfect way to stay warm on those bitter winter nights. You can use black (beluga) lentils, brown lentils, green lentils, or lentils du Puy for this recipe. Do not use red lentils or lentils with their hulls removed. French Style Lentils Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4 Ingredients: 1 cup black lentils, rinsed and picked over 4 cups water 1 carrot, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut into 4 pieces 1 garlic clove, smashed lightly 2 bay leaves Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 shallot, chopped fine 2 tablespoons sherry wine or dry white wine 3/4 cup low-sodium vegetable broth 2 teaspoons whole grain mustard, plus extra for serving 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, plus extra for serving 1/2 cup greek yogurt 2 tablespoons minced chives Preparation: Bring lentils, water, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt in 12-inch skillet to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, skimming any foam off top as it rises to surface, until lentils are just cooked through and have slight bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain lentils in colander set over large bowl, reserving carrots; discard garlic and bay leaves. Chop carrots into 1/4-inch pieces and set aside. Wipe skillet clean with paper towel. Run cold water over lentils until water runs clear, about 3 changes of water. Drain lentils and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in shallots and \u00bd teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in wine and cook until liquid has nearly evaporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and remaining 2 tablespoons oil, bring mixture to simmer, and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until mixture is smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Stir in lentils and reserved carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are heated through and well coated, about 2 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in mustard and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with chives and serve, passing extra mustard and vinegar.

Soy sauce is a concentrated source of sodium. Look for reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d versions, which contain 40 percent less sodium than traditional versions. Removing the added salt in this recipe will cut the amount of sodium per serving in half. Spicy Lemongrass Tofu with Asian Basil Recipe courtesy of Mai Pham Serves 4 Ingredients: 3 stalks lemongrass, finely chopped (about 5 tablespoons) 1\u00bd tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons chopped Thai bird chilies 1\u00bd teaspoons ground turmeric 2 teaspoons sugar 12 ounces tofu, drained, cut into \u00be-inch cubes 3 tablespoons canola oil 1 yellow onion, cut in half and thinly sliced lengthwise 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 teaspoon minced garlic \u00bc teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons roasted peanuts, chopped 2/3 cup Asian basil leaves (cut large leaves in half) Preparation: Pound the lemongrass and chilies with a mortar and pestle to pulverize them. Add soy sauce, turmeric, and sugar and mix well. In a large glass bowl combine pounded aromatic mixture with the tofu and turn gently to coat evenly. Marinate for 30 minutes. (This will be a dry marinade, with not much liquid.) Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a small sauce pot over low heat. Add the onions, shallots, and garlic. Season with salt. Let cook covered 1 minute, add 1 tablespoon water, and continue to cook covered until the onions are translucent and soft\u2014approximately 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside. Heat remaining oil in a large 12\u201d non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the marinated tofu. (There should be enough room in the pan for all the tofu pieces to be in a single layer.) Shake pan slightly and let the tofu brown all over, using chopsticks or wooden spoons to turn the tofu pieces periodically so they cook evenly. Cook, uncovered, until tofu is nicely browned and caramelized. Once the tofu is brown, add the onion mixture. Toss to warm and combine with the tofu. Adjust seasoning with a pinch of additional salt or sugar. Add half of the peanuts and Thai basil leaves. Remove from heat. Garnish with remaining peanuts and basil leaves and serve.

These tailed plants adorn many overpriced salads but you don\u2019t have to pay a premium to get your hands on some sprouts. They\u2019re easy to make, and none are easier to make than sprouted lentils. All you need to do is soak some dried lentils, drain them, rinse them, and let them sit. Over time, this repeated rinsing and draining jump-starts the germination process, and sprouts begin to form. Typically, lentils need to be cooked first to be easily digested. But sprouting neutralizes phytic acid and facilitates the bioavailability of nutrients like B vitamins and vitamin C. And on top of being good for you, sprouting opens new avenues for flavor: Sprouted lentils are grassy, crunchy, refreshing, and filling. Use them on slaws or salads, or crisp them up for a flavorful garnish. You can use most varieties of lentils, but green, black, and de Puy lentils work best. For best results, we don\u2019t recommend using red lentils, yellow lentils, white lentils, or any varieties with their skins removed. Sprouted Lentils Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves Makes about 4 cups Ingredients: 1 cup green, black, or de Puy lentils, rinsed and picked over Water Preparation: Place lentils in 1-quart container and fill with water.

To keep the salad crisp and refreshing, we salt cabbage for an hour to drain off extra moisture that would otherwise water down the dish. For an intense, savory but bright dressing, we pair toasted sesame oil and fresh lime juice. A dash of fish sauce brings a subtle funk and richness. We even add sliced celery, doubling down on the crunch factor. This slaw is perfect paired with a piece of fish or chicken, or enjoyed on its own for a light lunch. Sprouted Lentil, Cabbage, and Celery Slaw Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 6 Ingredients: 1 small head green cabbage, cored and chopped fine 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup sprouted lentils 2 ribs celery, sliced thin 2 scallions, sliced thin \u00bd cup chopped fresh cilantro 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil \u00bc cup lime juice (about 2 limes) 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, plus extra for serving \u00bd teaspoon ground cumin Preparation: Toss cabbage and salt in colander set over medium bowl. Let stand until wilted, about 45 minutes. Rinse cabbage under cold water, drain, dry well with paper towels, and transfer to large bowl. Add sprouted lentils, celery, scallions, and cilantro to bowl. Whisk olive oil, sesame oil, lime juice, fish sauce, sesame seeds, and cumin in small bowl until smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Divide slaw into bowls and garnish with extra sesame seeds. Serve.

Line a roasting or baking tray with foil, and slick very lightly with oil or add a light coating of nonstick spray. Spread out the eggplant cubes in a single layer, and roast until very tender (about 20 to 30 minutes, depending on their size). Meanwhile, spread out \u00bc cup of the vinaigrette in a shallow dish. When the eggplant is done, salt it lightly, and transfer to the dish, swishing it gently into the vinaigrette. Toss lightly, adding another 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette as you go. When it cools to room temperature, add the cucumber, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes (if using), and some red pepper flakes to taste. (You can also add some grated lime zest for more zing.) Let it sit to marinate for at least another 10 minutes, and as long as a day, covered and refrigerated. Serve at room temperature or cooled, topped with coconut tofu strips. For coconut-lime vinaigrette Combine the garlic, lime juice, coconut milk, salt, and sweetener in a bowl or jar with a lid. Whisk until combined, and then keep whisking as you drizzle in the oil to form an emulsion. When all the oil is incorporated set aside. If you are making this well in advance, cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before using. For coconut tofu strips Place a medium-sized skillet over medium heat and wait 1 minute. Add the oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Toss in the tofu strips with a dash or two of salt, and stir-fry (or \u201ctoss-fry\u201d) until heated through and beginning to get crispy. Sprinkle in the coconut, and if you like it a touch sweet, some sugar, and continue to cook and toss until the coconut is lightly golden and heavily aromatic. Serve at any temperature, sprinkled on your favorite rice or vegetable dish with compatible flavors.

Typically, the sauce consists of roasted tomatoes, garlic, almonds, oil, and some type of pepper. For our version, a handful of toasted walnuts provides a subtle sweetness, richness, and slightly thickens the sauce to a creamy consistency. In place of roasted tomatoes, we use jarred roasted red peppers, hitting all of those sweet, umami, savory notes. A splash of sherry vinegar brightens the sauce, providing enough acidity to complement a piece of fish or meat. Here we serve our romesco with a simple, crispy-skinned piece of fish and a bright, herbaceous salad on top. Any firm-fleshed, white fish works well here: We recommend striped bass, black bass, halibut, and snapper. If you prefer a sauce with a little less acidic punch, you may substitute red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar in Step 2. And if you\u2019re having trouble finding pea shoots, arugula, watercress, or any other light leafy green will do just fine. Crispy Pan Seared White Fish with Walnut Romesco and Pea Shoot Salad Recipe courtesy of Tim Chin Serves 4 Ingredients: Fish 4 (4- to 6-ounce) skin-on white fish fillets, 1 to 1\u00bd inches thick Kosher salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Sauce 1 (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained (8.5 oz dry weight) 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 1 clove garlic 1 teaspoon smoked paprika \u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons kosher salt \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil \u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts Salad 1 small shallot, minced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons lemon juice \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt \u00bc teaspoon pepper 2 cups pea shoots, cut into 2-inch pieces \u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts, chopped coarsely 2 tablespoons mint leaves, torn into 1/2-inch pieces Preparation: For the Fish: Using sharp knife score skin lengthwise at \u00bd-inch intervals, making \u00bc-inch-deep cuts, stopping \u00bd inch from top and bottom of filet. Season both sides of filets evenly with 2 teaspoons salt and place skin side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to 1\u00bd hours. For the Sauce: Meanwhile, place peppers, vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, smoked paprika, and cayenne in blender and blend on high speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. With blender running, slowly drizzle in oil until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add walnuts and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute longer. (For smoother sauce, strain sauce through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.) Transfer sauce to bowl and season with salt to taste. For the Salad: Whisk shallot, oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in large bowl until combined. Add pea shoots, walnuts, and mint and toss gently to combine. Season with salt to taste and set aside until ready to use. Remove fish from refrigerator and pat skin dry with paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Carefully slide fillets, skin side down, into skillet. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low; using fish spatula, firmly press fillets down for 20 to 30 seconds to create good contact between skin and skillet. Continue to cook, tilting skillet occasionally to distribute oil, until skin is well browned and flesh is opaque except for top \u00bc inch, 8 to 12 minutes. (If at any time during searing, oil starts to smoke or sides of fish start to brown, reduce heat so that oil is sizzling but not smoking.) Turn off heat. Flip fish and continue cooking until fish registers 125 degrees F/52 degrees C, about 30 seconds longer. Immediately transfer fish to large platter or wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Spoon dollops of sauce onto individual plates. Place fillets, skin side up, on top of sauce and serve with salad.

Serves 2 Ingredients: 1 pound salmon filet, skin-on \u00bc cup (4 tablespoons) white or red miso paste 1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) brown sugar 1.5 tablespoons mirin or rice wine 1.5 tablespoons sake Preparation: Wisk miso, brown sugar, sake, and mirin together in a small bowl until the sugar and miso are dissolved, forming a thick liquid. Place salmon skin-side down into a baking dish and coat evenly on all sides with the miso mixture. Pour any remaining miso mixture over the fish. Wrap the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. Submerge alder wood plank in water for 2 hours before grilling. Light gas or charcoal grill and clean grate. Place wet plank on grate and heat for 5 minutes. Rub excess miso glaze from surface of salmon and place skin-side down on plank. Grill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon filet, and how well done one desires the fish. Fifteen minutes produces fish with slightly translucent interior (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit), while twenty minutes produces fish with opaque center. Divide fish in two and serve with lemon slices. Serve with saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic, and roasted tomatoes stuffed with seasoned goat cheese.

Crisping them in a pan creates crunchy, toasty morsels that are something between popcorn, toasted nuts, and potato chips. Here we pair these crispy lentils with a simple but intense dish of poached shrimp in red curry. A splash of coconut milk rounds out the dish and gives body, and we serve the shrimp with plenty of fresh cilantro. Serve this dish with brown rice and plenty of limes for a light but satisfying dinner.

Add lentils and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain lentils on paper towel-lined plate. Season lentils with salt to taste and set aside. Whisk coconut milk and cornstarch in small bowl until smooth and combined and set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, ginger, and curry paste, and 1/8 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is dry and sticks to bottom of pot, 4 to 5 minutes. Add broth and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon, until mixture is combined and bubbling, about 30 seconds. Whisk in coconut milk mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened, combined, and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season sauce with salt to taste. Reduce heat to low, add shrimp, cover, and cook, flipping shrimp halfway through cooking, until shrimp are just opaque, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer shrimp to serving platter and pour sauce over shrimp. Sprinkle lentils and cilantro over shrimp, and serve.

Walnuts, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, give the dish a subtle, nutty flavor and delightful texture. Ingredients (Serves 8) 1 medium-large yellow onion 2 large stalks celery 1 clove garlic 1/2 lb. Italian chicken sausage (can be omitted for vegetarian option) 6-8 sprigs fresh sage 1 sprig rosemary 2 sprigs thyme 2 teaspoons dried sage 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper extra virgin olive oil 1 loaf whole wheat bread 1-2 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock 1/2-3/4 cup dried cranberries 3/4 cup walnuts, halves and pieces Instructions Cut the onion and celery into a small dice (1/4\u201d). Mince the garlic. Mince the leaves of the sage, rosemary, and thyme. The fresh and dried sage is essential \u2013 the other herbs are not. Cut the bread into 3/4\u201d cubes and set aside. If using, take the casings off of the sausage. Heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Arrange the walnut pieces on a baking sheet, and toast for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned. Heat 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan or dutch oven over medium heat. If using, put the chicken sausage in the pan, and break up into small pieces as it cooks. Cook the sausage for 8-12 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the sausage is browned. Add the onion, celery, garlic, another tablespoon of olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-low and sweat the veggies for 6-8 minutes until translucent. Add the minced herbs, dried sage, and black pepper, and stir frequently for 30 seconds. Add the bread cubes and another 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook the bread cubes, stirring constantly, for 5-6 minutes until everything is evenly mixed. Start to add the stock, a little at a time, scraping the bottom of the pan as you do so. Add stock until the bread is nicely moist, but not mushy. When the right consistency is achieved, add the walnuts and cranberries. Heat an oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour the stuffing into a 9\u00d711 baking dish, and bake for 15-25 minutes, checking frequently, until the top is lightly toasted.

Although traditional spice mixes rely on ground ginger and turmeric, the fresh roots add a bright flavor that can\u2019t be matched. The combination of sweet and savory in this sauce makes it a great companion to almost any protein. (See more recipes from Always Delicious). Moroccan Chicken Stew with Apricots Prep Time 10 minutes (plus overnight marinating) Cook Time 1 to 1.5 hours Serves 4 Ingredients: For the Moroccan Sauce: 1 (2\u2011inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into thin rounds 3 medium cloves garlic 1 (3\u2011 to 4\u2011inch) piece fresh turmeric, peeled, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional) 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves Dash of freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper 9 or 10 sprigs cilantro, stems and leaves coarsely chopped 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup water 1/2 teaspoon salt Dash of cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional) For the Chicken Stew: Moroccan Sauce (Ingredients above)) 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1\u2011inch cubes or slices 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, diced 2 medium carrots, cut into chunks (about 1 cup) 1 small sweet potato or 1/2 small winter squash, cut into 1\u2011inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups) 6 dried apricots, whole or diced, or 4 fresh apricots, quartered and pitted 1/4 cup water 1/4 teaspoon salt Preparation: Make the sauce: Place all the ingredients in a wide-mouthed mason jar or cup that will fit an immersion blender without splashing. Blend, working the blender in the jar until the garlic, ginger, and turmeric are smooth. Place a lid on the jar. For best results, set aside for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to develop. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Marinate the chicken: Place the sauce in a large zip-top bag, add the chicken, seal the bag, and massage to completely coat the chicken with the sauce. Place it in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight (or cook it immediately if you have less time). Prepare the stew: Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or stovetop-safe slow cooker insert over medium heat, or in a slow cooker on the saut\u00e9 setting. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken and sauce from the bag, carrots, sweet potatoes, apricots, water, and salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, or transfer the ingredients or the slow-cooker insert to the slow cooker. Cover and simmer for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours on the stovetop (longer, slow cooking creates a more savory dish) or cook on low in a slow cooker for up to 8 hours or according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If desired, remove the lid for the last 15 to 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Serve hot (stew pictured over Cauliflower Couscous).

You must weigh the benefits and risks. Alcohol\u2019s link with health is a bit Dr. Jekyll and a bit Mr. Hyde. Exactly which face it shows depends largely on who\u2019s drinking and how much. For most moderate drinkers, alcohol has overall health benefits. While moderate drinking can increase the risk of colon and breast cancer, these risks are trumped by the boost in cardiovascular health\u2014especially in middle age, when heart disease begins to account for an increasingly large share of disease and deaths. Non-drinkers, however, shouldn\u2019t feel the need to start drinking to improve their health. Heavy drinkers, with their increased risk of cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, and dependence should cut back or stop drinking altogether. A pregnant woman should also avoid alcohol, since it can cause brain damage to the unborn child. 5 Quick Tips: Staying Healthy with Alcohol If you don\u2019t drink, there\u2019s no need to start. For some people\u2014especially pregnant women, people recovering from alcohol addiction, people with a family history of alcoholism, people with liver disease, and people taking one or more medications that interact with alcohol\u2014the risks of drinking outweigh the benefits. There are other ways to boost your heart health and lower your risk of diabetes, such as getting more active, staying at a healthy weight, or eating healthy fats and whole grains. If you do drink, drink in moderation\u2014and choose whatever drink you like. Wine, beer, or spirits\u2014each seems to have the same health benefits as long as moderation\u2019s the word (no more than one drink per day for women, and no more than two drinks per day for men). To read more about whether the type of alcohol consumed has any effect on health, read \u201cIs Wine Fine, or Beer Better?\u201c Take a multivitamin with folic acid. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, a B vitamin that may help lower the risk of heart disease and cancers of the colon and breast. Those who drink may benefit the most from getting extra folate, since alcohol moderately depletes our body\u2019s stores. The amount in a standard multivitamin\u2014400 micrograms\u2014is enough, when combined with a healthy diet. To learn more about folate, check out the vitamins section of The Nutrition Source. Ask your doctor about your drinking habits. If you (or your friends) think you may have a problem with drinking, talk to a doctor or other health professional about it. He or she can help. Pick a designated driver. Alcohol and driving do not mix. If you\u2019ve been out drinking cocktails and it\u2019s time to head home, hand your car keys to someone who\u2019s been sipping seltzer all night.

About 99% of the body\u2019s calcium is stored in bones, and the remaining 1% is found in blood, muscle, and other tissues. In order to perform these vital daily functions, the body works to keep a steady amount of calcium in the blood and tissues. If calcium levels drop too low in the blood, parathyroid hormone (PTH) will signal the bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. This hormone may also activate vitamin D to improve the absorption of calcium in the intestines. At the same time, PTH signals the kidneys to release less calcium in the urine. When the body has enough calcium, a different hormone called calcitonin works to do the opposite: it lowers calcium levels in the blood by stopping the release of calcium from bones and signaling the kidneys to rid more of it in the urine. The body gets the calcium it needs in two ways. One is by eating foods or supplements that contain calcium, and the other is by drawing from calcium in the body. If one does not eat enough calcium-containing foods, the body will remove calcium from bones. Ideally, the calcium that is \u201cborrowed\u201d from the bones will be replaced at a later point. But this doesn\u2019t always happen, and can\u2019t always be accomplished just by eating more calcium. Recommended Amounts The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium for women 19-50 years of age is 1,000 mg daily; for women 51+, 1,200 mg. For pregnant and lactating women, the RDA is 1,000 mg. For men 19-70 years of age, the RDA is 1,000 mg; for men 71+ years, 1,200 mg. [1] Calcium and Health The reviews below specifically looked at the effect of calcium on various health conditions. Scroll down for links to more information on the health effect of specific foods rich in calcium. Blood pressure Cardiovascular disease Bone health Colorectal cancer Kidney stones Food Sources Calcium is widely available* in many foods, not just milk and other dairy foods. Fruits, leafy greens, beans, nuts, and some starchy vegetables are good sources. Dairy (cow, goat, sheep) and fortified plant-based milks (almond, soy, rice) Cheese Yogurt Calcium-fortified orange juice Winter squash Edamame (young green soybeans); Tofu, made with calcium sulfate Canned sardines, salmon (with bones) Almonds Leafy greens (collard, mustard, turnip, kale, bok choy, spinach) *Bioavailability of calcium Calcium is a large mineral and not so easy to break down in the gut. The amount of calcium listed on the Nutrition Facts label of a food product is the measure of calcium in the food, but not necessarily the amount the body will absorb. The amount that is actually absorbed and used by the body is called \u201ccalcium bioavailablity.\u201d Some foods have higher calcium bioavailability than others. For example, dairy foods have a bioavailablity of about 30% absorption so if a food label on milk lists 300 mg of calcium per cup, about 100 mg will be absorbed and used by the body. Plant foods like leafy greens contain less calcium overall but have a higher bioavailability than dairy. For example, bok choy contains about 160 mg of calcium per 1 cup cooked but has a higher bioavailability of 50%, so about 80 mg is absorbed. Therefore, eating 1 cup of cooked bok choy has almost as much bioavailable calcium as 1 cup of milk. Calcium-fortified orange juice and calcium-set tofu have a similar total amount of calcium and bioavailability as milk, while almonds have slightly lower total calcium and bioavailability of about 20%. This may be useful information for those who cannot eat dairy foods or who follow a vegan diet. A downside to some plant foods is that they contain naturally occurring plant substances, sometimes referred to as \u201canti-nutrients.\u201d Examples of anti-nutrients are oxalates and phytates that bind to calcium and decrease its bioavailablity. Spinach contains the most calcium of all the leafy greens at 260 mg of calcium per 1 cup cooked, but it is also high in oxalates, lowering the bioavailability so that only 5% or about 13 mg of calcium can be used by the body. The takeaway message is not to avoid spinach, which contains other valuable nutrients, but not to rely on spinach as a significant source of calcium since most of it will not be absorbed by the body. You can also schedule your meals so that you do not eat \u201ccalcium-binding\u201d foods like spinach at the same meal as calcium-rich foods or with calcium supplements. If you are scanning food labels to reach a specific amount of daily calcium, continue to aim for the RDAs set for your age group and gender. The RDAs are established with an understanding of calcium bioavailability in food. Also keep in mind that the exact amount of calcium absorbed in the body will vary among individuals based on their metabolism and what other foods are eaten at the same meal. In general, eating a variety of calcium-rich foods can help to offset any small losses. Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency Blood levels of calcium are tightly regulated. Bones will release calcium into the blood if the diet does not provide enough, and no symptoms usually occur. A more serious deficiency of calcium, called hypocalcemia, results from diseases such as kidney failure, surgeries of the digestive tract like gastric bypass, or medications like diuretics that interfere with absorption. Symptoms of hypocalcemia: Muscle cramps or weakness Numbness or tingling in fingers Abnormal heart rate Poor appetite A gradual, progressive calcium deficiency can occur in people who do not get enough dietary calcium in the long-term or who lose the ability to absorb calcium. The first early stage of bone loss is called osteopenia and, if untreated, osteoporosis follows. Examples of people at risk include: Postmenopausal women\u2014Menopause lowers the amount of estrogen in the body, a hormone that helps to increase calcium absorption and retain the mineral in bones. Sometimes physicians may prescribe hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone to prevent osteoporosis. Amenorrhea\u2014A condition where menstrual periods stop early or are disrupted, and is often seen in younger women with anorexia nervosa or athletes who physically train at a very high level. Milk allergy or lactose intolerance\u2014Occurs when the body cannot digest the sugar in milk, lactose, or the proteins in milk, casein or whey. Lactose intolerance can be genetic or acquired (not consuming lactose in the long-term may decrease the efficiency of lactase enzyme) Guidelines if you are taking calcium supplements for osteoporosis Toxicity Too much calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia. The Upper Limit (UL) for calcium is 2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. People over the age of 50 should not take more than 2,000 mg daily, especially from supplements, as this can increase risk of some conditions like kidney stones, prostate cancer, and constipation. Some research has shown that in certain people, calcium can accumulate in blood vessels with long-term high doses and cause heart problems. Calcium is also a large mineral that can block the absorption of other minerals like iron and zinc. Symptoms of hypercalcemia: Weakness, fatigue Nausea, vomiting Shortness of breath Chest pain Heart palpitations, irregular heart rate Did You Know? Certain nutrients and medications may increase your need for calcium because they either lower the absorption of calcium in the gut or cause more calcium to be excreted in the urine. These include: corticosteroids (example: prednisone), excess sodium in the diet, phosphoric acid such as found in dark cola sodas, excess alcohol, and oxalates (see Are anti-nutrients harmful?).

It is a fat-soluble vitamin that has long been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorus; both are critical for building bone. Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and reduce inflammation. Many of the body\u2019s organs and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, which suggest important roles beyond bone health, and scientists are actively investigating other possible functions. Few foods naturally contain vitamin D, though some foods are fortified with the vitamin. For most people, the best way to get enough vitamin D is taking a supplement because it is hard to eat enough through food. Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (\u201cergocalciferol\u201d or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin D3 (\u201ccholecalciferol\u201d). Both are also naturally occurring forms that are produced in the presence of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays, hence its nickname, \u201cthe sunshine vitamin,\u201d but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including humans. Vitamin D production in the skin is the primary natural source of vitamin D, but many people have insufficient levels because they live in places where sunlight is limited in winter, or because they have limited sun exposure due to being inside much of the time. Also, people with darker skin tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin D because the pigment (melanin) acts like a shade, reducing production of vitamin D (and also reducing damaging effects of sunlight on skin, including skin cancer). Recommended Amounts The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D provides the daily amount needed to maintain healthy bones and normal calcium metabolism in healthy people. It assumes minimal sun exposure. RDA: The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults 19 years and older is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily for men and women, and for adults >70 years it is 800 IU (20 mcg) daily. UL: The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for vitamin D for adults and children ages 9+ is 4,000 IU (100 mcg). Many people may not be meeting the minimum requirement for the vitamin. NHANES data found that the median intake of vitamin D from food and supplements in women ages 51 to 71 years was 308 IU daily, but only 140 IU from food alone (including fortified products). [1] Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion people have inadequate levels of vitamin D in their blood, and deficiencies can be found in all ethnicities and age groups. [2-4] In the U.S., about 20% of White adults and 75% of Black adults have blood levels of vitamin D below 50 nmol/L. [83] In industrialized countries, doctors are seeing the resurgence of rickets, the bone-weakening disease that had been largely eradicated through vitamin D fortification. [5-7] There is scientific debate about how much vitamin D people need each day and what the optimal serum levels should be to prevent disease. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released in November 2010 recommendations increasing the daily vitamin D intake for children and adults in the U.S. and Canada, to 600 IU per day. [1] The report also increased the upper limit from 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day. Although some groups such as The Endocrine Society recommend 1,500 to 2,000 IU daily to reach adequate serum levels of vitamin D, the IOM felt there was not enough evidence to establish a cause and effect link with vitamin D and health benefits other than for bone health. Since that time, new evidence has supported other benefits of consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D, although there is still not consensus on the amount considered to be adequate. Vitamin D and Health The role of vitamin D in disease prevention is a popular area of research, but clear answers about the benefit of taking amounts beyond the RDA are not conclusive. Although observational studies see a strong connection with lower rates of certain diseases in populations that live in sunnier climates or have higher serum levels of vitamin D, clinical trials that give people vitamin D supplements to affect a particular disease are still inconclusive. This may be due to different study designs, differences in the absorption rates of vitamin D in different populations, and different dosages given to participants. Learn more about the research on vitamin D and specific health conditions and diseases: Bone health and muscle strength Cancer Heart disease Type 2 diabetes Immune function Risk of premature death Cognitive decline Food Sources Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D3. The best sources are the flesh of fatty fish and fish liver oils. Smaller amounts are found in egg yolks, cheese, and beef liver. Certain mushrooms contain some vitamin D2; in addition some commercially sold mushrooms contain higher amounts of D2 due to intentionally being exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light. Many foods and supplements are fortified with vitamin D like dairy products and cereals. Cod liver oil Salmon Swordfish Tuna fish Orange juice fortified with vitamin D Dairy and plant milks fortified with vitamin D Sardines Beef liver Egg yolk Fortified cereals Is There a Difference Between Vitamin D3 and Vitamin D2 Supplements? If you purchase vitamin D supplements, you may see two different forms: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 is made from plants and is found in fortified foods and some supplements. Vitamin D3 is naturally produced in the human body and is found in animal foods. There is ongoing debate whether vitamin D3 \u201ccholecalciferol\u201d is better than vitamin D2 \u201cergocalciferol\u201d at increasing blood levels of the vitamin. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on blood levels found that D3 supplements tended to raise blood concentrations of the vitamin more and sustained those levels longer than D2. [76,77] Some experts cite vitamin D3 as the preferred form as it is naturally produced in the body and found in most foods that naturally contain the vitamin. Ultraviolet Light Vitamin D3 can be formed when a chemical reaction occurs in human skin, when a steroid called 7-dehydrocholesterol is broken down by the sun\u2019s UVB light or so-called \u201ctanning\u201d rays. The amount of the vitamin absorbed can vary widely. The following are conditions that decrease exposure to UVB light and therefore lessen vitamin D absorption: Use of sunscreen; correctly applied sunscreen can reduce vitamin D absorption by more than 90%. [78] Wearing full clothing that covers the skin. Spending limited time outdoors. Darker skin tones due to having higher amounts of the pigment melanin, which acts as a type of natural sunscreen. [79] Older ages when there is a decrease in 7-dehydrocholesterol levels and changes in skin, and a population that is likely to spend more time indoors. Certain seasons and living in northern latitudes above the equator where UVB light is weaker. [78] In the northern hemisphere, people who live in Boston (U.S.), Edmonton (Canada), and Bergen (Norway) can\u2019t make enough vitamin D from the sun for 4, 5, and 6 months out of the year, respectively. [78] In the southern hemisphere, residents of Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Cape Town (South Africa) make far less vitamin D from the sun during their winter months (June through August) than they can during their spring and summer months. [78] The body stores vitamin D from summer sun exposure, but it must last for many months. By late winter, many people in these higher-latitude locales are deficient. [79] Note that because ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer, it is important to avoid excessive sun exposure and in general, tanning beds should not be used. Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency Vitamin D deficiency may occur from a lack in the diet, poor absorption, or having a metabolic need for higher amounts. If one is not eating enough vitamin D and does not receive enough ultraviolet sun exposure over an extended period (see section above), a deficiency may arise. People who cannot tolerate or do not eat milk, eggs, and fish, such as those with a lactose intolerance or who follow a vegan diet, are at higher risk for a deficiency. Other people at high risk of vitamin D deficiency include: People with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) or other conditions that disrupt the normal digestion of fat. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that depends on the gut\u2019s ability to absorb dietary fat. People who are obese tend to have lower blood vitamin D levels. Vitamin D accumulates in excess fat tissues but is not easily available for use by the body when needed. Higher doses of vitamin D supplementation may be needed to achieve a desirable blood level. Conversely, blood levels of vitamin D rise when obese people lose weight. People who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, which typically removes the upper part of the small intestine where vitamin D is absorbed. Conditions resulting from prolonged vitamin D deficiency: Rickets: A condition in infants and children of soft bones and skeletal deformities caused by failure of bone tissue to harden. Osteomalacia: A condition in adults of weak and softened bones that can be reversed with supplementation. This is different than osteoporosis, in which the bones are porous and brittle and the condition is irreversible. Toxicity Vitamin D toxicity most often occurs from taking supplements. The low amounts of the vitamin found in food are unlikely to reach a toxic level, and a high amount of sun exposure does not lead to toxicity because excess heat on the skin prevents D3 from forming. It is advised to not take daily vitamin D supplements containing more than 4,000 IU unless monitored under the supervision of your doctor. Symptoms of toxicity: Anorexia Weight loss Irregular heart beat Hardening of blood vessels and tissues due to increased blood levels of calcium, potentially leading to damage of the heart and kidneys Did You Know? Catching the sun\u2019s rays in a sunny office or driving in a car unfortunately won\u2019t help to obtain vitamin D as window glass completely blocks UVB ultraviolet light.

De un vistazo, la imagen presenta ejemplos de las mejores opciones para comidas y \u201csnacks\u201d (tentempi\u00e9s, meriendas, bocadillos, refrigerios, piscolabis) saludables, y resalta la importancia de la actividad f\u00edsica como parte la f\u00f3rmula para mantenerse sano. (Version alterna con 'verduras' para descargar) Construyendo una dieta saludable y balanceada Comer alimentos variados mantiene nuestras comidas interesantes y llenas de sabor. Adem\u00e1s, es la clave para una dieta sana y balanceada pues cada alimento tiene una combinaci\u00f3n \u00fanica de nutrientes: tanto macronutrientes (carbohidratos, prote\u00ednas, y grasa) como micronutrientes (vitaminas y minerales). El Plato para Comer Saludable para Ni\u00f1os representa la base para ayudarnos a tomar las mejores decisiones sobre alimentaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s de llenar la mitad del plato con vegetales (verduras) y frutas de muchos colores (que tambi\u00e9n se deben elegir como \u201csnacks\u201d (tentempi\u00e9s, meriendas, bocadillos, refrigerios, piscolabis), llene la otra mitad con granos enteros y prote\u00edna saludable: Mientras m\u00e1s vegetales (verduras)\u2013 y mayor variedad \u2013 mejor. Las papas (patatas) y papas/patatas fritas (papitas) no se consideran vegetales/verduras por su efecto negativo en la az\u00facar de la sangre. M\u00e1s sobre vegetales/verduras > Consuma muchas frutas de todos los colores. Elija frutas enteras o en rebanadas (en lugar de jugos de frutas; limite jugos de fruta a un vaso peque\u00f1o al d\u00eda). M\u00e1s sobre frutas > Elija granos integrales o enteros, o alimentos hechos con granos que hayan sido m\u00ednimamente procesados. Mientras menos procesado sea un grano, mejor. Los granos integrales \u2013 trigo integral, arroz integral, quinoa, y productos hechos a partir de estos alimentos (como pasta integral y pan de trigo 100% integral) \u2013 tienen un menor efecto en la az\u00facar de la sangre y la insulina, comparado con el arroz blanco, pan blanco, masa de pizza, pasta, y otros granos refinados. M\u00e1s sobre granos integrales o enteros > Elija leguminosas (legumbres, lentejas, garbanzos, habichuelas, frijoles), guisantes y ch\u00edcharos, nueces, semillas, y otras opciones de prote\u00edna vegetal, adem\u00e1s de pescado, huevo, y aves. Limite las carnes rojas (res, cerdo, cordero) y evite embutidos (tocino/tocineta, jam\u00f3n, mortadela, \u2018hot dogs\u2019, salchichas). M\u00e1s sobre prote\u00edna saludable > Tambi\u00e9n es importante recordar que las grasas son una parte necesaria de nuestra dieta, y el tipo de grasa que consumimos es lo que m\u00e1s importa. Deber\u00edamos elegir regularmente alimentos con grasas insaturadas que son saludables (como pescado, nueces, semillas, y aceites vegetales saludables); y limitar los alimentos con alto contenido de grasa saturada (especialmente carne roja), y evitar las grasas trans, que no son saludables (provenientes de aceites parcialmente hidrogenados): Utilice aceites vegetales saludables como el de oliva extra virgen, canola, ma\u00edz, girasol, y de cacahuate/man\u00ed, para cocinar, en ensaladas y verduras/vegetales, y en la mesa. Limite la mantequilla a un uso ocasional. M\u00e1s sobre aceites saludables y grasas saludables > En nuestro plato, los l\u00e1cteos se necesitan en menor cantidad que otros alimentos: Elija leche sin sabores a\u00f1adidos, yogur natural, cantidades peque\u00f1as de queso, y otros l\u00e1cteos sin az\u00facar a\u00f1adida. La leche y otros productos l\u00e1cteos son una fuente conveniente de calcio y vitamina D, pero la cantidad \u00f3ptima diaria a\u00fan se debe determinar y la investigaci\u00f3n sobre esto a\u00fan se est\u00e1 desarrollando. Para los ni\u00f1os que limitan o evitan el consumo de leche, consulte a su m\u00e9dico sobre posibles suplementos de calcio y vitamina D. M\u00e1s sobre l\u00e1cteos > El agua debe ser la bebida principal a elegir con todas las comidas y \u201csnacks\u201d, al igual que cuando estamos activos: El agua es la mejor opci\u00f3n para calmar la sed. Es libre de az\u00facar y de f\u00e1cil acceso en cualquier grifo/llave/pluma. Limite el jugo \u2013 que puede tener la misma cantidad de az\u00facar que un refresco/soda \u2013 a un vaso peque\u00f1o al d\u00eda; y evite bebidas azucaradas como refresco/soda, aguas de fruta, y bebidas para deportistas, que proveen muchas calor\u00edas y ning\u00fan otro nutriente. Con el tiempo, consumir bebidas azucaradas puede ocasionar aumento de peso y aumentar el riesgo de diabetes tipo 2, enfermedades cardiovasculares, y otros problemas de salud. M\u00e1s sobre agua y escoger bebidas saludables > Por \u00faltimo, al igual que la elecci\u00f3n de alimentos adecuados, incorporar actividad f\u00edsica en nuestro d\u00eda y mantenerse activo es parte de la receta para mantener la salud: Cambie el \u201ctiempo pasivo\u201d por \u201ctiempo activo\u201d. Los ni\u00f1os y adolescentes deben tratar de lograr por lo menos 1 hora de actividad f\u00edsica al d\u00eda, y no necesitan tener equipo sofisticado o acceso a un gimnasio. La Gu\u00eda de Actividad F\u00edsica para los Estadounidenses sugiere escoger actividades no estructuradas para ni\u00f1os, como jugar a brincar la cuerda, o divertirse usando el equipo del parque. M\u00e1s sobre mantenerse activo > En general, el mensaje principal es enfocarse en la calidad de la dieta. El tipo de carbohidratos en la dieta es m\u00e1s importante que la cantidad de carbohidratos en la dieta, pues algunas fuentes de carbohidratos como verduras/vegetales (que no sean papas/patatas), frutas, granos enteros y leguminosas/legumbres/frijoles, son m\u00e1s saludables que el az\u00facar, papas/patatas, y alimentos hechos con harina refinada. El Plato para Comer Saludable para Ni\u00f1os no incluye bebidas azucaradas, dulces, ni alimentos chatarra o procesados (\u201cjunk food\u201d). Estos no son alimentos que se deban consumir a diario, y deben consumirse espor\u00e1dicamente o nunca. El Plato para Comer Saludable para Ni\u00f1os promueve el uso de aceites saludables en lugar de otros tipos de grasas. Sobre El Plato para Comer Saludable para Ni\u00f1os El Plato para Comer Saludable para Ni\u00f1os fue creado por expertos en nutrici\u00f3n de la Escuela de Salud P\u00fablica T.H.

Chloride carries an electric charge and therefore is classified as an electrolyte, along with sodium and potassium. It helps to regulate the amount of fluid and types of nutrients going in and out of the cells. It also maintains proper pH levels, stimulates stomach acid needed for digestion, stimulates the action of nerve and muscle cells, and facilitates the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide within cells. [1] Chloride is absorbed in the small intestine and remains in the body\u2019s fluids and blood. Any excess amount is excreted in urine. Chloride is usually bound to sodium, and therefore the amount in blood tends to coincide with sodium levels. Recommended Amounts AI: Adequate intakes are used when there is insufficient evidence to develop a recommended dietary allowance (RDA), and is established at an amount that ensures nutritional adequacy. The AI for chloride for people ages 14-50 and women pregnant or lactating is 2.3 grams daily, for ages 51-70 is 2 grams daily, and for ages 71+ is 1.8 grams daily. [2] Chloride and Health Research is not available on the association of chloride with specific diseases or health conditions. [1] Food Sources Chloride is naturally found in small amounts in meat and seafood, but the main sources in the Western diet are sodium chloride, or table salt, and as an additive and preservative in processed foods. Table salt, sea salt, Kosher salt Seaweed Shrimp High-sodium processed foods including deli meats, hot dogs, cheese, and potato chips High-sodium condiments including soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency A chloride deficiency is extremely rare in the U.S. where the average diet is high in sodium. Most foods that contain sodium will also provide chloride. [2] A loss of chloride in the body usually accompanies conditions that cause sodium losses. These include conditions that remove too much fluid from the body, such as prolonged diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive sweating. Diuretic medications that remove fluid through the kidneys can also cause decreased chloride levels. In cases of sudden, very high levels of blood glucose such as seen in people with diabetes, the kidneys will flush more sodium and water out of the body, leading to lower chloride levels. [2] Toxicity Toxicity from the diet is rare in healthy people. Excess chloride levels in the blood, called hyperchloremia, can be caused by severe dehydration, diarrhea, or metabolic problems in which the blood becomes too acidic, such as with kidney disease. A high salt diet can lead to an excessive intake of sodium chloride, which is associated with elevated blood pressure.

It is found naturally in some foods and is added to supplements and some salt seasonings. Iodine is needed to make the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, as well as regulating normal metabolism. Without enough iodine, these thyroid hormones do not work properly and can lead to an under-active or overactive thyroid gland, causing the medical conditions of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with various negative side effects in the body. Recommended Amounts RDA: The Recommended Dietary Allowance for iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) daily for adult men and women 19+ years, and 220 and 290 mcg daily for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. [1,2] UL: A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. The UL for iodine for adults 19+ years and pregnant and lactating women is 1,100 mcg daily. Iodine and Health Infant and childhood health Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism Food Sources Iodine is found in soil and the ocean, which varies in amount and will affect how much of the mineral is contained in a food. Iodine is found mainly in animal protein foods and sea vegetables, and to a lesser extent in fortified foods like breads, cereals, and milk. Seaweed (nori, kelp, kombu, wakame) Fish, shellfish (cod, canned tuna, oysters, shrimp) Table salts labeled \u201ciodized\u201d Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt) Eggs Beef liver Chicken Fortified infant formula Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency Iodine regulates metabolism, the conversion of energy obtained from food into energy to help cells function and grow. A deficiency of iodine can therefore prevent normal growth and development. This is especially dangerous in pregnant women and infants, in which miscarriage, stillbirth, stunted growth, and cognitive impairments (difficulties with reading, writing, talking, problem solving, social skills) can occur. In adults, an iodine deficiency of less than 10-20 mcg a day can lead to inadequate thyroid hormone production, called hypothyroidism, which disrupts normal metabolic functions like regulating heart rate, body temperature, and body weight. [2] A lump or swelling in the neck, called goiter, often accompanies hypothyroidism. Other signs of hypothyroidism include: Fatigue, lethargy Weakness Sensitivity to cold Constipation Dry skin and hair Weight gain People at risk for iodine deficiency include those who do not use iodized salt or supplements containing iodine, pregnant women, vegans who do not eat any animal foods, and those living in areas with low levels of iodine in the soil (e.g., mountainous regions). Toxicity High iodine intakes are usually well-tolerated in most healthy people and do not cause problems. [1] This has been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea that eat iodine-rich seaweed regularly. [3] But some people with autoimmune thyroid disease or who have a history of chronic iodine deficiency can be sensitive to receiving extra iodine, inducing conditions of iodine deficiency like hypothyroidism and goiter. [2,4] Excess iodine can also lead to too much thyroid hormone production, causing hyperthyroidism; signs of this condition are an increased metabolism that promotes weight loss, fast or irregular heartbeat, hand tremors, irritability, fatigue, and sweatiness. Sometimes even just a slight increase in dietary iodine above the RDA can cause iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in sensitive individuals. [4] Some epidemiologic studies have shown that high seaweed intakes are associated with an increased risk of certain types of thyroid cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, but the exact mechanism is unclear. [2,3] Excess iodine intake may come from use of high-dose supplements or overeating certain seaweeds and salts that contain iodine. Severe iodine poisoning is rare, but symptoms include fever; stomach pain; nausea; vomiting; a burning sensation of the mouth, throat, and stomach; and even coma. [2] Children, infants, the elderly, and those with existing thyroid disease are particularly vulnerable to iodine toxicity and iodine-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. [3,4] Did You Know? In the U.S., people obtain most of their dietary iodine from iodized salt and milk. Iodine supplements can interact with certain blood pressure medications and diuretics, including lisinopril, spironolactone, and amiloride, causing a dangerous buildup of potassium in the blood called hyperkalemia. Iodine is an ingredient in contrast agents that a person may take before having an X-ray or computed tomography (CT scan). It helps to absorb the rays so that clearer pictures of the body\u2019s organs can be seen.

It is sometimes referred to as an electrolyte because it carries a small electrical charge that activates various cell and nerve functions. Potassium is found naturally in many foods and as a supplement. Its main role in the body is to help maintain normal levels of fluid inside our cells. Sodium, its counterpart, maintains normal fluid levels outside of cells. Potassium also helps muscles to contract and supports normal blood pressure. Recommended Amounts The U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes state that there is not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for potassium. However, the National Academy of Medicine has established an Adequate Intake (AI) for potassium. [1] For women 14-18 years of age, the AI is 2,300 mg daily; for women 19+, 2,600 mg. For pregnant and lactating women, the AI ranges from 2,500-2,900 depending on age. For men 14-18 years of age, the AI is 3,000 mg; for men 19+, 3,400 mg. It is estimated that the average daily intake of potassium in adults is about 2,320 mg for women and 3,016 mg for men. [2] Potassium and Health The functions of sodium and potassium in the body are closely related and often studied together. The interplay of potassium and sodium Potassium and sodium are closely interconnected but have opposite effects in the body. Both are essential nutrients that play key roles in maintaining physiological balance, and both have been linked to the risk of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease. High salt intake increases blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, while high potassium intake can help relax blood vessels and excrete sodium while decreasing blood pressure. Our bodies need far more potassium than sodium each day, but the typical U.S. diet is just the opposite: Americans average about 3,300 milligrams of sodium per day, about 75% of which comes from processed foods, while only getting about 2,900 milligrams of potassium each day. [3,4] A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that: People who ate high-sodium, low-potassium diets had a higher risk of dying from a heart attack or any cause. In this study, people with the highest sodium intakes had a 20% higher risk of death from any cause than people with the lowest sodium intakes. People with the highest potassium intakes had a 20% lower risk of dying than people with the lowest intakes. But what may be even more important for health is the relationship of sodium to potassium in the diet. People with the highest ratio of sodium to potassium in their diets had double the risk of dying of a heart attack than people with the lowest ratio, and they had a 50% higher risk of death from any cause. [5] People can make a key dietary change to help lower their risk: Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits, which are naturally high in potassium and low in sodium, but eat less bread, cheese, processed meat, and other processed foods that are high in sodium and low in potassium. Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Bone health Kidney stones Is there any research behind Acid-Alkaline Diet claims? You may have heard of an acid-alkaline diet promoted for weight loss or cancer prevention. It became popular when authors claimed that eating certain \u201calkaline\u201d foods could counterbalance the effects of a high \u201cacidic\u201d diet that might otherwise lead to various chronic diseases. Most health experts rejected these claims because it is nearly impossible to dramatically change the pH of blood in healthy people through diet alone. The body tightly regulates the pH level in blood to about 7.4, because swinging to either extreme of too acid or alkaline can be life-threatening. However, there is some truth that the metabolism of certain foods can create bicarbonates, which neutralizes acids in the body. [1] Potassium-rich foods that have an alkalizing effect include fruits, vegetables, almonds, and lentils. One theory suggests that a long-term high intake of protein foods such as meats, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs, as well as cereal grains may create a condition called low-grade metabolic acidosis due to their high sulfate and phosphate content. [10,16] This occurs particularly if the diet does not contain enough counterbalancing potassium-rich foods. The condition is sometimes referred to as the \u2018\u2018acid-ash hypothesis,\u2019\u2019 which may cause a very slight drop in blood pH, though still falling within a normal range. Theories suggest that even a small change such as this may increase one\u2019s risk of developing conditions like kidney stones and bone loss. BOTTOM LINE: Although theories in this area are compelling, the evidence is still inconsistent and it has not been shown in controlled trials that diet can significantly change blood pH in healthy people. Therefore it is too early to make specific recommendations based on this theory. Food Sources Potassium is widely available in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Leafy greens, beans, nuts, dairy foods, and starchy vegetables like winter squash are rich sources. Dried fruits (raisins, apricots) Beans, lentils Potatoes Winter squash (acorn, butternut) Spinach, broccoli Beet greens Avocado Bananas Cantaloupe Oranges, orange juice Coconut water Tomatoes Dairy and plant milks (soy, almond) Yogurt Cashews, almonds Chicken Salmon Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency The kidneys work to maintain normal blood levels of potassium by flushing out excess amounts through urine. Potassium can also be lost through stool and sweat. At least 400-800 mg daily from food is needed because of normal daily losses. Any conditions that increase fluid losses beyond normal such as vomiting, diarrhea, and certain medications like diuretics can lead to a deficiency, called hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is most common in hospitalized patients who are taking medications that cause the body to excrete too much potassium. It is also seen in people with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis) that may cause diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients. It is rare for a potassium deficiency to be caused by too low a food intake alone because it is found in so many foods; however an inadequate intake combined with heavy sweating, diuretic use, laxative abuse, or severe nausea and vomiting can quickly lead to hypokalemia. Another reason is a deficiency of magnesium, as the kidneys need magnesium to help reabsorb potassium and maintain normal levels in cells. Fatigue Muscle cramps or weakness Constipation Muscle paralysis and irregular heart rate (with severe hypokalemia) Toxicity Too much potassium in the blood is called hyperkalemia. In healthy people the kidneys will efficiently remove extra potassium, mainly through the urine. However, certain situations can lead to hyperkalemia: advanced kidney disease, taking medications that hold onto potassium in the body (including NSAIDs), or people who have compromised kidneys who eat a high-potassium diet (more than 4,700 mg daily) or use potassium-based salt substitutes. Symptoms of hyperkalemia: Weakness, fatigue Nausea, vomiting Shortness of breath Chest pain Heart palpitations, irregular heart rate Did You Know? The chemical symbol for potassium is \u201cK,\u201d not to be confused with vitamin K. Salt substitutes are sometimes made from potassium chloride, which replaces some or all of the sodium chloride in table salt. Although those on salt-restricted diets may benefit from its much lower sodium content, potassium salt has a bitter aftertaste when heated so it is not recommended for cooking. Check with your doctor before trying a potassium salt, because extra potassium can be dangerous for people who have trouble eliminating excess amounts or who are taking medications that can increase potassium levels in the bloodstream.

A recent meta\u2010analysis by Graudal implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with BP reduction. However, Graudal's meta\u2010analysis included a large number of very short\u2010term trials with a large change in salt intake, and such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations for a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake. We have updated our Cochrane meta\u2010analysis. Objectives To assess (1) the effect of a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP and whether there was a dose\u2010response relationship; (2) the effect on BP by sex and ethnic group; (3) the effect on plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL), high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least 4 weeks. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta\u2010analyses, subgroup analyses and meta\u2010regression were performed. Main results Thirty\u2010four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta\u2010analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was \u201075 mmol/24\u2010h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was \u20104.18 mmHg (95% CI: \u20105.18 to \u20103.18, I2=75%) for systolic and \u20102.06 mmHg (95% CI: \u20102.67 to \u20101.45, I2=68%) for diastolic BP. Meta\u2010regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta\u2010analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was \u20105.39 mmHg (95% CI: \u20106.62 to \u20104.15, I2=61%) for systolic and \u20102.82 mmHg (95% CI: \u20103.54 to \u20102.11, I2=52%) for diastolic BP. In normotensives, the mean effect was \u20102.42 mmHg (95% CI: \u20103.56 to \u20101.29, I2=66%) for systolic and \u20101.00 mmHg (95% CI: \u20101.85 to \u20100.15, I2=66%) for diastolic BP. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic BP was significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Meta\u2010analysis of hormone and lipid data showed that the mean effect was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, I2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, I2=62%) for aldosterone, 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, I2=5%) for noradrenaline, 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: \u20100.25 to 13.64, I2=12%) for adrenaline, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.02 to 0.11, I2=0%) for cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.01 to 0.12, I2=0%) for LDL, \u20100.02 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.06 to 0.01, I2=16%) for HDL, and 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.02 to 0.09, I2=0%) for triglycerides. Authors' conclusions A modest reduction in salt intake for 4 or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. With salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in lipid levels. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a significant association between the reduction in 24\u2010h urinary sodium and the fall in systolic BP, indicating the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9\u201012 to 5\u20106 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.

Plain language summary Available in English Deutsch Espa\u00f1ol \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc Fran\u00e7ais Hrvatski Bahasa Malaysia Modest salt reduction lowers blood pressure in all ethnic groups at all levels of blood pressure without adverse consequences The public health recommendations in most countries are to reduce salt intake from the current levels of approximately 9\u201012 grams per day to less than 5\u20106 grams per day. Our pooled analysis of randomised trials of 4 weeks or more in duration shows that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure both in individuals with raised blood pressure and in those with normal blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure is shown in both whites and blacks, men and women. Additionally, our results show that a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake has no adverse effect on hormone and lipid levels. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population blood pressure and reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the fact that the lower the salt intake, the lower the blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5\u20106 grams per day will lower blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 grams per day will lower blood pressure more. Therefore, 3 grams per day should become the long\u2010term target for population salt intake. Authors' conclusions Available in English Deutsch Implications for practice Our meta\u2010analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake, as currently recommended, has a significant effect on BP both in individuals with raised BP and in those with normal BP. The fall in BP is observed in both whites and blacks, men and women. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, likely reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a dose\u2010response relationship, i.e. the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5\u20106 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect. Therefore, 3 g/d should become the long\u2010term target for population salt intake. Indeed, NICE has recommended a reduction in salt intake to 3 g/d by 2025 for UK adult population (NICE 2010). Many developed countries are now adopting a policy of reducing salt intake, firstly by persuading the food industry to reformulate food with less salt, as is occurring successfully in the UK (FSA 2008) and Finland (Karppanen 2006), and also encouraging people to use less salt in their own cooking and at the table. The major challenge now is to spread this out to all other countries, particularly developing countries where often salt intake is high and \u224880% of the global BP\u2010related disease burden occurs. All countries should adopt a coherent and workable strategy to reduce salt intake. A reduction in population salt intake will likely have major beneficial effects on health along with major cost savings in all countries around the world. Implications for research The evidence that relates salt intake to BP is very strong. The mechanisms whereby salt raises BP are not fully understood. The existing concepts focus on the tendency for an increase in extracellular fluid volume. Increasing evidence suggests that small increases in plasma sodium may have a direct effect on BP independent of extracellular volume (Friedman 1990; de Wardener 2004; He 2005). Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms, in particular, the role of plasma sodium in regulating BP.

There is much evidence demonstrating that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure (BP). The evidence comes from different types of studies including epidemiological, migration, population\u2010based intervention, genetic and animal studies, as well as treatment trials (Elliott 1996; Poulter 1990; Forte 1989; Lifton 1996; Denton 1995; He 2002). As raised BP throughout its range is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, a reduction in salt intake lowers BP and, therefore, would reduce cardiovascular risk. Indeed, both prospective cohort studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Strazzullo 2009;He 2011). Despite the evidence above, a recent meta\u2010analysis by Graudal et al (Graudal 2011; Graudal 2012) implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with the reduction in BP. However, Graudal et al's meta\u2010analysis (Graudal 2011; Graudal 2012) is flawed from a public health perspective, as they included a large number of very short\u2010term trials with a large change in salt intake, e.g. from 20 to less than 1 g/d for only 4\u20105 days, and such metabolic studies are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of time. We have updated our Cochrane meta\u2010analysis to determine the effects of a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL), high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides, as well as further sub\u2010group analyses to study the effects of salt reduction on BP by ethnic group and sex. Objectives Available in English Deutsch Our systematic review aimed to determine the effect of a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake on BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals and to assess whether there was a dose\u2010response to salt reduction. We also assessed the effect of salt reduction on BP by ethnic group and sex. Furthermore, we aimed to study the effect of salt reduction on plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Methods Available in English Deutsch Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies For inclusion, trials needed to satisfy the following criteria: 1. Random allocation either to a modestly reduced salt intake or usual salt intake (i.e. control). 2. No concomitant interventions (i.e. nonpharmacologic interventions, antihypertensive or other medications) in either group. 3. The reduction in 24\u2010h urinary sodium must be within the range of 40 to 120 mmol (i.e. 2.3 to 7.0 g/d salt). The reduction in 24\u2010h urinary sodium was calculated as UNa (Post) \u2010 UNa (Pre) for crossover trials, where UNa (Post) designated to the average 24\u2010h urinary sodium at the end of the reduced salt intake period and UNa (Pre) designated to the average 24\u2010h urinary sodium at the end of the usual salt intake period (i.e. control period). In parallel trials the change in urinary sodium was calculated as {[UNa (Post) \u2010 UNa (Pre)] reduced salt group} \u2010 {[UNa (Post) \u2010 UNa (Pre)] usual salt group}, where UNa (Post) designated to the average 24\u2010h urinary sodium at the end of follow\u2010up and UNa (Pre) designated to the average 24\u2010h urinary sodium at baseline. 4. Duration of salt reduction must have been for 4 or more weeks. Types of participants Studies of adults (18 years or older) with normal or raised BP, irrespective of gender and ethnicity, were included. Trials in children, pregnant women, or patients with other diseases rather than hypertension, such as diabetes, heart failure, were excluded. Types of interventions The intervention included was to reduce salt intake. Studies with concomitant interventions (i.e. nonpharmacologic interventions, antihypertensive or other medications) were excluded. One trial with factorial design (i.e. the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase II) was included (TOHP II 1997), however, in this trial the low salt arm (without weight intervention) was compared to the control group (without salt and without weight intervention). Types of outcome measures The main outcome measures extracted from each individual trial were the changes in systolic and diastolic BP, and 24h urinary sodium excretion. These were calculated as the differences between the reduced salt and the usual salt groups for mean change from baseline for parallel trials. For crossover trials, the changes were calculated as the mean differences between the end of reduced salt and the usual salt period. Other outcome measures included plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Search methods for identification of studies In our first meta\u2010analysis (He 2002), we developed a search strategy to search for randomised salt reduction trials. In this current update, our original search strategy was modified by Douglas Salzwedel, Trials Search Coordinator at the Cochrane Hypertension Group. Using the updated strategy, the following electronic databases were searched: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register 1948 to November 2012; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 11, 2012; Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to November 2012; Ovid Embase 1974 to November 2012 Additionally, we reviewed reference list of relevant original and review articles to search for more trials. There were no language restrictions. Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE with selected MeSH and free text terms for salt and blood pressure. The MEDLINE search strategy (Appendix 1) was translated into Embase (Appendix 2), CENTRAL (Appendix 3), and the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (Appendix 4) using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Data collection and analysis Data Extraction: Data were extracted independently by two persons (F.J. He and J.F. Li) using a standard form and differences were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (G.A. MacGregor). Relevant data recorded were characteristics of the study, design (parallel or crossover), type of the study (open, single\u2010blind or double\u2010blind), method of randomisation, method of blinding (use of placebo, random\u2010zero or automated sphygmomanometers, or BP observer\u2010blind), study duration, pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention results. For the purpose of pooled analyses, statistics that could be used to estimate the variance of the outcome measures were also recorded. Statistical Analyses: For each trial, we calculated the treatment effect for systolic and diastolic BP, and other outcome measures. For crossover trials, the treatment effect was the difference in outcomes between the end of reduced salt period and the end of usual salt (i.e. control) period. For parallel trials, the treatment effect was the difference between the two treatment groups in the change in outcomes from baseline to the end of follow\u2010up. For each trial, we also calculated the variance of the treatment effect for outcomes. This was derived from standard deviations or standard errors of paired differences between baseline and the end of follow\u2010up for each group in a parallel trial (Cappuccio 1991) or between the two treatment periods in a crossover trial, or if these statistics were not given, from confidence intervals, exact t or P values. If the exact variance of paired difference was not derivable, it was imputed either by inverting a boundary P value (e.g. P<0.05 became P=0.05) or assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between the initial and final measurement (Follmann 1992). To assess the mean effect sizes, we pooled the data by the inverse variance method in random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis. We used the I2 test to examine heterogeneity, with I2>50% considered to be important (Higgins 2003). To explore the source of heterogeneity, we performed meta\u2010regression analyses (multiple regression models) weighted by the inverse variance of the change in systolic or diastolic BP. The meta\u2010regression analysis was also used to examine whether there was a dose\u2010response relationship between the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium and the change in BP. We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect whether there was publication bias and Egger's regression test to measure funnel plot asymmetry (Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). Prespecified subgroupings included BP status (i.e. hypertensive or normotensive) and further subgroupings by ethnic group and sex. The purpose of the subgroup analysis was to determine whether there was a significant effect of salt reduction on BP in each group itself rather than identifying difference in the effect between groups. For the analysis stratified by ethnic group, trials were included in the group of \"white\" if \u226585% of participants were white. If the information on ethnic group was not available, the trial was excluded from this subgroup analysis. For hormone and lipid data, subgroup analyses were not performed because of the small number of trials that reported such outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5.2 software and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results Available in English Deutsch Description of studies The search strategy identified 3252 citations, of which we excluded 2995 on the basis of abstract and title. A detailed assessment was given to 257 papers, of which 227 were excluded and the reasons for exclusion were summarised in PRISMA Flow Diagram (Figure 1). Open in figure viewer Figure 1 PRISMA Flow Diagram A total of 30 papers met our inclusion criteria and were included in our meta\u2010analysis. Among these 30 papers, 4 included both hypertensive and normotensive individuals (Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N); Puska 1983 (H); Puska 1983 (N); Cappuccio 1997 (H); Cappuccio 1997 (N); Melander 2007 (H); Melander 2007 (N)). In our meta\u2010analysis, the main outcome data (i.e. BP) were recorded for hypertensives and normotensives separately. To avoid confusion in counting the number of trials, each of these 4 papers was counted as 2 trials. Therefore, our meta\u2010analysis included a total of 34 trials, of which 22 were in hypertensive individuals and 12 in normotensive individuals. In 3 studies (Morgan 1981 (F); Morgan 1981 (M); Nestel 1993 (F); Nestel 1993 (M); Watt 1985 (HH) offspring of two parents with high BP; Watt 1985 (LL) offspring of two parents with low BP) where subgroup data were reported only, they were entered for subgroups separately. For 3 trials that included both hypertensives and normotensives (Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N); Cappuccio 1997 (H); Cappuccio 1997 (N); Melander 2007 (H); Melander 2007 (N)), each had an additional entry for all participants, i.e. hypertensives and normotensives combined, where the data for lipids or hormones were reported. Therefore, there were a total of 40 entries in the table of Characteristics of included studies. For 2 papers (MacGregor 1989; Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N)) where 3 levels of salt intakes were studied, we included the high and intermediate levels (i.e. urinary sodium reduced from 190 to 108 mmol/24h) in one trial (MacGregor 1989) and in the other (Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N)) we included the high and low levels (i.e. urinary sodium reduced from 145 to 65 mmol/24h in hypertensive individuals and from 139 to 64 mmol/24h in normotensive individuals on the normal American diet). The characteristics of the trials included in the meta\u2010analysis are summarised in Table: \"Characteristics of included studies\". Risk of bias in included studies Criteria for the assessment of study quality were as follows. Allocation concealment Adequate: The randomisation method described did not allow participants and investigators to foresee assignment, e.g. a prior numbered or coded tablet containers of identical appearance prepared by an independent pharmacy, central randomisation. Unclear: Randomisation was stated, but no detailed information was provided on the method used to generate the random allocation sequence and the mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence. Inadequate: Method of randomisation allowed participants or investigators to foresee assignment, e.g. unsealed envelopes or alternate medical record numbers. Blinding Blinding of the investigator: yes/no/not stated. Blinding of the participant: yes/no/not stated. Blinding of the outcome assessor: yes/no/not stated. Incomplete outcome data addressed? Yes: Intention to treat analysis was undertaken, or all participants who were randomised, completed the study, or detailed information was reported on the number of participants who were lost of follow\u2010up after randomisation as well as reasons. Unclear: No information provided. No: Incomplete outcome data were not adequately addressed. The risk of bias assessments for the trials included in the meta\u2010analysis are shown in Table: Characteristics of included studies. Effects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) from usual to reduced salt intake in hypertensive and normotensive individuals; Summary of findings 2 Change in 24h urinary sodium (UNa) and blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive and normotensive individuals by ethnic group; Summary of findings 3 Change in 24h urinary sodium (UNa) and blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive and normotensive individuals by sex; Summary of findings 4 Change in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline and adrenaline; Summary of findings 5 Change in plasma lipids Effect on BP Trials in all individuals A total of 34 trials with 3230 participants were included. The characteristics of the trials included in the meta\u2010analysis are summarised in Table (Characteristics of included studies). The median age was 50 years (ranging from 22 to 73 years). Of the 34 trials, 23 used crossover design and 11 used paralleled comparisons. Twenty\u2010two of the 34 trials were double blind, 11 were BP observer blind, and 1 did not report any blinding procedure. The study duration varied from 4 weeks to 3 years (median: 4 weeks). The median BP on the usual salt intake was 141/86 mmHg. The median 24\u2010h urinary sodium on the usual salt intake was 160 mmol (9.4 g/d salt), ranging from 125 to 200 mmol (7.3 to 11.7 g/d salt). The pooled estimate of the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium from the usual to the reduced salt intake was \u201075 mmol (range \u201040 to \u2010118 mmol), equivalent to a reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d (range 2.3 to 6.9 g/d). This average reduction in salt intake is similar to that of the current public health recommendations. Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2 show the change in BP in individual trials included in the meta\u2010analysis and the mean effect size. The pooled estimates of changes in BP were \u20104.18 mmHg (95% CI: \u20105.18 to \u20103.18, P<0.00001, I2=75%) for systolic and \u20102.06 mmHg (95% CI: \u20102.67 to \u20101.45, P<0.00001, I2=68%) for diastolic BP (summary of findings Table for the main comparison). To explore the source of heterogeneity, meta\u2010regression analysis was performed with the change of BP (systolic or diastolic) as dependent variable and the independent variables included age (mean age of the participants in individual trials), BP status (hypertensive=1; normotensive=0), ethnic group (i.e. the proportion of whites as a continuous variable), and the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium. The results showed that the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium, age, BP status and ethnic group were all significantly associated with the change in systolic BP. The regression coefficients indicated that a 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/d salt) was associated with a decrease of 5.8 mmHg (95% CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) in systolic BP, a one\u2010year increase in age was associated with a 0.06 mmHg (95% CI: 0.006 to 0.116, P=0.030) greater decrease in systolic BP with salt reduction, being hypertensive was associated with a greater fall in systolic BP (P=0.042) compared with normotensives, and a larger proportion of whites (or a smaller proportion of blacks) was associated with a smaller fall in systolic BP (P=0.001). These 4 variables together explained 68% of the variance between studies. In a separate regression model, sex (i.e. the proportion of men as a continuous variable) was added to the independent variable list, and there was little change to the adjusted R2 (R2=0.68 without sex in the regression model and R2=0.70 with sex added to the regression model). Sex was not significantly associated with the change in systolic BP. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and 24\u2010h urinary sodium together explained 41% of the variance between studies. Among these 4 variables, only ethnic group was significant (P=0.021) and the other 3 variables were not significantly associated with the change in diastolic BP. When sex was added to the regression model, there was little change in the adjusted R2 (R2=0.41 and 0.44 for the regression model with and without sex respectively). Sex was not significantly associated with the change in diastolic BP. Trials in hypertensive individuals Nine hundred and ninety hypertensive individuals were studied in 22 trials (Table: Characteristics of included studies). Median age was 50 years (ranging from 24 to 73 years). Of the 22 trials, 16 used crossover design and 6 used paralleled comparisons. Fourteen of the 22 trials were double blind, 7 were BP observer blind, and 1 did not report any blinding procedure. The study duration varied from 4 weeks to 1 year (median: 5 weeks). The median BP on usual salt intake was 148/93 mmHg. The median 24\u2010h urinary sodium on the usual salt intake was 162 mmol (9.5 g/d salt), ranging from 125 to 191 mmol (7.3 to 11.2 g/d salt). The pooled estimate of the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium from the usual to the reduced salt intake was \u201075 mmol (range \u201053 to \u2010117 mmol), equivalent to a reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d (range 3.1 to 6.8 g/d). Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2 show the change in BP in individual trials included in the meta\u2010analysis and the mean effect size. The pooled estimates of changes in BP were \u20105.39 mmHg (95% CI: \u20106.62 to \u20104.15, P<0.00001, I2=61%) for systolic and \u20102.82 mmHg (95% CI: \u20103.54 to \u20102.11, P<0.00001, I2=52%) for diastolic BP (summary of findings Table for the main comparison). Meta\u2010regression with the change in BP as dependent variable and age, ethnic group and the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium as independent variables, showed that the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium and ethnic group were significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, whereas age was not significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 10.8 mmHg (95CI: 3.5 to 18.2, P<0.01) after adjusting for age and ethnic group. All 3 variables together explained 46% of the variance between studies. For diastolic BP, the 3 variables together explained 11% of the variance between studies and none of the 3 variables was significantly associated with the fall in diastolic BP. Trials in normotensive individuals Two thousand two hundred and forty individuals with normal BP were studied in 12 trials (Table: Characteristics of included studies). Median age was 50 years (ranging from 22 to 67 years). Of the 12 trials, 7 used crossover design and 5 used paralleled comparisons. Eight of the 12 trials were double blind and 4 were BP observer blind. The study duration varied from 4 weeks to 3 years (median: 4 weeks). The median BP on usual salt intake was 127/77 mmHg. The median 24\u2010h urinary sodium on the usual salt intake was 153 mmol (8.9 g/d salt), ranging from 128 to 200 mmol (7.5 to 11.7 g/d salt). The pooled estimate of the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium from the usual to the reduced salt intake was \u201075 mmol (range \u201040 to \u2010118 mmol), equivalent to a reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d (range 2.3 to 6.9 g/d). Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2 show the change in BP in individual trials included in the meta\u2010analysis and the mean effect size. The pooled estimates of changes in BP were \u20102.42 mmHg (95% CI: \u20103.56 to \u20101.29, P<0.0001, I2=66%) for systolic and \u20101.00 mmHg (95% CI: \u20101.85 to \u20100.15, P=0.02, I2=66%) for diastolic BP (summary of findings Table for the main comparison). Meta\u2010regression with the change in BP as dependent variable and age, ethnic group and the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium as independent variables, showed that the change in 24\u2010h urinary sodium was significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, whereas age and ethnic group were not significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 4.3 mmHg (95% CI: 0.1 to 8.5, P<0.05) after adjusting for age and ethnic group. All 3 variables together explained 51% of the variance between studies. For diastolic BP, the 3 variables together explained 43% of the variance between studies. Among these 3 variables, only ethnic group was significant (P=0.042) and the other 2 variables were not significantly associated with the change in diastolic BP. Further sub\u2010group analysis summary of findings Table 2 and summary of findings Table 3 show the pooled results of 24\u2010h urinary sodium and BP by ethnic group and sex for hypertensives and normotensives separately. There was a significant fall in systolic BP in both whites and blacks, men and women. The fall in diastolic BP was significant in most of the subgroups. There was only 1 trial in Asians (He 2009). Most of the participants in this trial were of South Asian origin (i.e. originating from the Indian subcontinent) and all participants had raised BP. The study showed that there was a significant fall in both systolic and diastolic BP with a modest reduction in salt intake (summary of findings Table 2). Effect on hormones and lipids Plasma renin activity Of the 34 trials, 14 reported the data of plasma renin activity. One study reported plasma renin concentration (Melander 2007) and it was excluded from the analysis for plasma renin activity. The median plasma renin activity was 1.07 ng/ml/hr on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in plasma renin activity was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, P<0.00001, I2=70%) (summary of findings Table 4). Aldosterone Of the 34 trials, 9 had plasma aldosterone measured. One trial (Benetos 1992) was excluded from the aldosterone analysis as the plasma aldosterone was extremely high after the unit conversion (235277.8 pmol/l on the usual salt and 269166.7 pmol/l on the reduced salt intake). The median plasma aldosterone was 299 pmol/l on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in aldosterone was 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, P<0.00001, I2=62%) (summary of findings Table 4). Noradrenaline Of the 34 trials, 6 reported the data of plasma noradrenaline. The median plasma noradrenaline was 351 pg/ml on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in plasma noradrenaline was 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, P=0.01, I2=5%) (summary of findings Table 4). Adrenaline Of the 34 trials, only 4 trials reported the data of plasma adrenaline. The median plasma adrenaline was 64 pg/ml on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in plasma adrenaline was 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: \u20100.25 to 13.64, P=0.06, I2=12%) (summary of findings Table 4). In addition to the above, one other trial reported that \"no changes were observed in plasma catecholamines\u201d (Schorr 1996), but data were not provided. Therefore, this trial was excluded from the above pooled analysis for noradrenaline and adrenaline. Cholesterol Of the 34 trials, 8 reported the data of plasma cholesterol. The median plasma cholesterol was 5.3 mmol/l on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in cholesterol was 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.02 to 0.11, P=0.18, I2=0%) (summary of findings Table 5). Two other trials reported no significant change in cholesterol (Chalmers 1986; Erwteman 1984), however, no data were provided for pooled analysis. LDL Of the 34 trials, 5 reported the data of plasma LDL. The median plasma LDL was 3.2 mmol/l on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in LDL was 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.01 to 0.12, P=0.11, I2=0%) (summary of findings Table 5). HDL Of the 34 trials, 6 reported the data of plasma HDL. The median plasma HDL was 1.3 mmol/l on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in HDL was \u20100.02 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.06 to 0.01, P=0.19, 16%) (summary of findings Table 5). One other trial reported no significant change in HDL, but data were not provided (Erwteman 1984), therefore, this trial was excluded from the pooled analysis. Triglycerides Of the 34 trials, 6 reported the data of plasma triglycerides. The median plasma triglycerides was 1.3 mmol/l on the usual salt intake. The pooled estimate of the change in triglycerides was 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: \u20100.02 to 0.09, P=0.22, I2=0%) (summary of findings Table 5). Study quality The risk of bias graph is shown in Figure 2. Among the 34 trials included in our meta\u2010analysis, 26 were judged to have adequate concealment of allocation of treatments (Table:Characteristics of included studies). In 8 trials the information on concealment of allocation was not available. Despite the fact that only 7 out of 34 trials performed intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, the percentage of participants who were lost of follow\u2010up after randomisation was small (6.7% on average). Open in figure viewer Figure 2 Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies. We included double\u2010blind, BP observer\u2010blind, and open studies due to the fact that 1) some trials e.g. the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)\u2010Sodium (Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N)), although non\u2010double\u2010blinded, were well conducted with good compliance to different diets; and 2) it is very difficult to make any dietary intervention study double\u2010blind. In relation to salt, this can only be done by the use of salt tablets (Slow Sodium and placebo). Among the 34 trials included in our meta\u2010analysis, 22 were double\u2010blind, 11 were BP observer\u2010blind and only one small trial in hypertensives was non\u2010blind. Re\u2010analysing the data by excluding the non\u2010blind study (Parijs 1973) showed that the results were unchanged. The mean net change in BP for hypertensive individuals was \u20105.35 mmHg (95%CI: \u20106.62 to \u20104.09) for systolic and \u20102.88 mmHg (95%CI: \u20103.58 to \u20102.18) for diastolic BP after the non\u2010blinded study was excluded. Publication bias We created the funnel plots by plotting the treatment effect against the reciprocal of the standard error of the treatment effect (Figure 3; Figure 4). For diastolic BP the funnel plots were symmetrical around the mean effect size line (asymmetry test: P=0.416) (Egger 1997). For systolic BP, the graphic plot was suggestive of bias (asymmetry test: P=0.025). This asymmetry of funnel plot might be because smaller studies showing no effect were under\u2010reported in the literature. However, in our meta\u2010analysis it is more likely to be due to the smaller effects of two larger and longer\u2010term trials (TOHP I 1992; TOHP II 1997). The smaller effects in these two trials are attributable to the smaller reduction of salt intake achieved in the longer\u2010term trials. When these two trials were removed from the analysis, the asymmetry test was not significant (P=0.247). Open in figure viewer Figure 3 Funnel plot to explore publication bias (systolic BP).

Discussion Available in English Deutsch Our meta\u2010analysis demonstrates that a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d on average, causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in individuals with both raised and normal BP. The BP falls, on average, by 5/3 mmHg in hypertensives and 2/1 mmHg in normotensives. Further subgroup analyses demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake leads to a significant fall in systolic BP in both whites and blacks, men and women. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake which will result in a lower population BP and, thereby, a reduction in strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. The effect of a chronic high salt intake is a gradual increase in BP throughout life. The INTERSALT study (International Study of Salt and Blood Pressure) suggested a strong relationship between salt intake and a progressive increase in BP with age, i.e. 0.4 mmHg per year for a 6 g/d salt intake (Elliott 1996). A reduction in salt intake is, therefore, likely to attenuate the rise of BP with aging, in addition to the immediate BP\u2010lowering effect. Dose\u2010response to salt reduction Our meta\u2010regression analysis shows a significant dose\u2010response relationship between the reduction in salt intake and the fall in systolic BP, i.e. the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. A reduction of 6 g/d in salt intake predicts a decrease of 5.8 mmHg in systolic BP after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. It is acknowledged that the does\u2010response relationship from meta\u2010regression (i.e. between\u2010study investigation) should be viewed as exploratory and may be potentially prone to confounding. Meta\u2010analysis with individual participant data would have an advantage both statistically and clinically (Riley 2010; Berlin 2002) and, if available, should be used in the future to explore the dose\u2010response relationship further. Nevertheless, the dose\u2010response relationship found in our study is consistent with that observed from rigorously controlled trials with multi\u2010levels of salt intake which provided the most persuasive evidence. There have been two trials that studied three levels of salt intake. The first one was the randomised double\u2010blind cross\u2010over study in 20 individuals with untreated essential hypertension, where salt intake was reduced from 11.2 to 6.4 and to 2.9 g/d, each for one month (MacGregor 1989). BP was 163/100 mmHg with a salt intake of 11.2 g/d, and reduced to 155/95 mmHg when salt intake was decreased to 6.4 g/d (i.e. a decrease of 8/5 mmHg). BP fell further to 147/91 mmHg when salt intake was reduced to 2.9 g/d (i.e. a further fall of 8/4 mmHg). After the trial was completed, individuals continued the lowest salt intake. Among the 20 participants, 19 were followed up for 1 year. In 16 individuals, BP remained controlled without any antihypertensive medication and the average BP was 142/87 mmHg with a salt intake of 3.2 g/d (MacGregor 1989). The other trial that has studied the dose\u2010response relationship is the DASH\u2010Sodium study. Over 400 individuals with normal or mildly raised BP were randomised to receive either the normal American diet (control group) or the DASH diet which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low\u2010fat dairy products. Within each group, participants were given 3 levels of salt intake (i.e. 8 to 6 and 4 g/d) in a randomised crossover manner, each for 4 weeks. The results demonstrated a clear dose\u2010response relationship both on the normal American diet and on the DASH diet. The fall in BP was greater at a lower level of salt intake, i.e. from 6 to 4 g/d compared with that from 8 to 6 g/d (Sacks 2001 (H); Sacks 2001 (N)). From the evidence above, it is clear that the recommendations to reduce salt from the current levels of approximately 9\u201012 g/d to 5\u20106 g/d will have a significant effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a much greater effect on BP. Therefore, 3 g/d should become the long\u2010term target for population salt intake. Indeed, the UK government's health advisory agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended a reduction in the population's salt consumption to 3 g/d by 2025 (NICE 2010). In USA, it is recommended that sodium intake should be reduced to less than 2.3 g/d (i.e. \u22486 g/d salt) for adults, with an even further reduction to 1.5 g/d (i.e. \u22484 g/d salt) for about half the population, including African Americans, all adults 51 and older, and those with hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease (IOM 2010). Study duration In spite of including studies of 1 month or more, the median duration of salt reduction in our meta\u2010analysis was only 5 weeks in the hypertensives and 4 weeks in the normotensives. Whether salt reduction has exerted its maximum effect by 4\u20105 weeks is not known, but much evidence would suggest that this is unlikely (Forte 1989). Among the 34 trials included in our meta\u2010analysis, two had duration of over 1 year (TOHP I 1992; TOHP II 1997) and both trials were in normotensive individuals. These two trials did not show a greater fall in BP compared with other trials in normotensive individuals. However, the reduction in salt intake achieved in these two trials was half that achieved in other trials. On average, salt intake was reduced by 2.4 g/d in these two longer\u2010term trials, whereas in the other trials in normotensives, salt intake was reduced by 4.8 g/d. These longer\u2010term studies clearly highlight the difficulty in keeping individuals on a lower salt intake due to the widespread presence of salt in nearly all processed, canteen and restaurant food. Variations of BP response to salt reduction Previous studies have shown that, for a given reduction in salt intake, the fall in BP was larger in individuals of African origin, in older people and in those with raised BP compared to whites, young people and individuals with normal BP respectively (Bray 2004; He 1998; He 2001). The results from our meta\u2010regression analyses are consistent with these observations. The term \"salt sensitivity\" has been commonly used to describe the variations of BP response to salt reduction. However, almost all of the studies on \"salt sensitivity\" have used a protocol of very large and sudden changes in salt intake. Such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations of more modest reduction in salt intake for a prolonged period of time. Our meta\u2010analysis demonstrates that a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake has a significant effect on BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, men and women, whites and blacks; although there is a variation in the extent of the fall in BP. These results in conjunction with other evidence (He 2010), particularly that a reduction in salt intake also lowers blood pressure in children (He 2006), provide strong support that salt reduction should be carried out in the whole population. A reduction in population salt intake lowers population BP. Even a small reduction of BP across the entire population would have a large impact on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease (Whelton 2002). Effect of salt reduction on hormones and lipids A recent meta\u2010analysis by Graudal et al (Graudal 2011; Graudal 2012) implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on plasma hormone and lipid levels which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with a long\u2010term fall in BP. However, Graudal et al\u2019s meta\u2010analysis included a large number of very short\u2010term trials with a large change in salt intake, e.g. from 20 to less than 1 g/d for only 4\u20105 days, and such metabolic studies are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of time. Our meta\u2010analysis demonstrates that, with a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake, there is no significant change in plasma cholesterol, LDL, HDL or triglycerides. Indeed, in Graudal et al's own meta\u2010analysis, the changes in lipids only occurred with short term trials, and a sub\u2010group analysis including trials with a duration of 4 or more weeks showed no significant change in lipid levels (Graudal 2011; Graudal 2012). When salt intake is reduced, there is a fall in extracellular volume and physiological stimulation of the renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system, as well as the sympathetic nervous system. These compensatory responses are bigger with sudden and large decreases in salt intake, and much smaller or minimal with a longer\u2010term modest salt reduction. Our meta\u2010analysis shows that, with a longer\u2010term modest reduction in salt intake, there is only a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. It is worth noting that all of the studies that were included in our meta\u2010analysis with these hormones measured, had a duration of only 4\u20106 weeks (median duration: 4 weeks). It is likely that such effects may attenuate over time. Indeed, a study by Beckmann et al demonstrated that a modest reduction in salt intake, along with a reduction in body weight and saturated fat for one year, significantly reduced arterial plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline in hypertensive individuals (Beckmann 1995). Salt reduction lowers BP by a similar mechanism to that of thiazide diuretics. Both stimulate the renin\u2010angiotensin system and, in the short term, the sympathetic nervous system. However, outcome trials have demonstrated that long\u2010term treatment with thiazide diuretics significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive individuals (ALLHAT 2002). Effect of salt reduction on cardiovascular risk There is much evidence that raised BP throughout its range starting at 115/75 mmHg is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (PSC 2002). A modest reduction in salt intake lowers BP and, therefore, would reduce cardiovascular risk. It was estimated that a reduction of 6 g/d in salt intake would reduce stroke by 24% and coronary heart disease by 18% (He 2003). This would prevent \u224835,000 stroke and coronary heart disease deaths a year in the UK and \u22482.5 million deaths worldwide. Both prospective cohort studies and outcome trials have shown that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Strazzullo 2009;He 2011). Two recent papers in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), however, claimed that a lower salt intake was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (Stolarz\u2010Skrzypek 2011) or a J\u2010shaped association existed between salt intake and cardiovascular risk (O'Donnell 2011). These two papers have many methodological flaws, e.g. measurement error in assessing daily salt intake, confounding factors not controlled for, and reverse causality (i.e. the low salt intake is the result rather than the cause of participants' illness) (He 2011a; He 2012). Therefore, the results from these studies should be interpreted with great caution. A meta\u2010analysis of 12 cohort studies showed that an increase of 5 g/d in salt intake was associated with a 23% increase in the risk of stroke and a 17% increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (Strazzullo 2009). Evidence from outcome trials of long term salt reduction is very limited due to the innate difficulty in conducting such trials. A recent meta\u2010analysis of 7 randomised trials by Taylor et al, published simultaneously in The Cochrane Library (Taylor 2011a) and the American Journal of Hypertension (Taylor 2011), claimed that \"Cutting down on the amount of salt has no clear benefits in terms of likelihood of dying or experiencing cardiovascular disease \" and The Cochrane Library\u2019s press release headline stated \u201cCutting down on salt does not reduce your chance of dying\u201d (Cochrane 2011). Both of these statements are incorrect. Despite this, these headline grabbing statements received very misleading worldwide media publicity. Among the 7 trials included in Taylor et al\u2019s meta\u2010analysis, one in heart failure should not have been included as the participants were severely salt and water depleted due to aggressive diuretic therapy (Paterna 2008). Additionally, the findings in patients with severe heart failure on multiple drug treatments are not generalisable to the general population. In the remaining 6 trials, there is a reduction in all clinical outcomes (all\u2010cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and events), although none of these are statistically significant. The non\u2010significant findings are most likely due to a lack of statistical power, particularly as Taylor et al analysed the trials for hypertensives and normotensives separately. A re\u2010analysis of the data by combining hypertensives and normotensives together shows that there is a significant reduction in cardiovascular events by 20% (P<0.05) (Figure 5) and a non\u2010significant reduction in all\u2010cause mortality (5\u20107%), in spite of the small reduction in salt intake of 2.0\u20102.3 g/d (He 2011). These results add strongly to the evidence that salt reduction has a major impact on reducing strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.

Salt reduction is one of the most cost\u2010effective public health measures to reduce cardiovascular disease Several studies have shown that a reduction in salt intake is one of the most cost\u2010effective interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease in both developed and developing countries. For instance, a recent study in the US showed that even a very modest reduction in salt intake of only 10% which could be easily achieved, as demonstrated in the UK, would prevent hundreds of thousands of strokes and heart attacks over the lifetimes of adults aged 40\u201085 years who are alive today, and could save more than $32 billion in medical expenses in the US alone (Smith\u2010Spangler 2010). A larger decrease in salt intake would result in a larger health improvement and greater cost savings (Bibbins\u2010Domingo 2010). The UK salt reduction campaigns which started in 2003/2004 have been successful and the average salt intake, as measured by 24\u2010hour urinary sodium, has fallen gradually from 9.5 to 8.1 g/d by 2011 (i.e. a 15% reduction, P<0.05 for the downward trend) (FSA 2008). A cost\u2010effective analysis by NICE showed that the UK salt reduction campaigns cost \u00a315 million and a 0.9 g/d reduction in salt intake that was achieved by 2008, led to \u22486000 fewer CVD deaths per year, saving the UK economy \u2248\u00a31.5 billion per annum (NICE 2010). Based on NICE\u2019s estimation, the further reduction of 0.5 g/d from 2008 to 2011, would prevent approximately additional 3000 CVD deaths per year and result in even greater cost savings to the UK economy. Asaria et al estimated the effects and cost of strategies to reduce salt intake and control tobacco use for 23 low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries that account for 80% of chronic disease burden in the developing world. They demonstrated that a 15% reduction in mean population salt intake could avert 8.5 million cardiovascular deaths and a 20% reduction in smoking prevalence could avert 3.1 million cardiovascular deaths over 10 years (Asaria 2007). The modest reduction in salt intake could be achieved by a voluntary reduction in the salt content of processed foods and condiments by manufacturers combined with a sustained mass\u2010media campaign aimed to encourage dietary change within households and communities. The main costs of the strategy to reduce salt consumption would be awareness campaigns through mass\u2010media outlets and regulation of food products by public\u2010health officers, with an average cost estimated to be US$0.09 per person per year. The cost for tobacco control, including both price and non\u2010price measures, was US$0.26 per person per year. These figures clearly suggest that a reduction in salt intake is more, or at the very least just, as cost\u2010effective as tobacco control in terms of reducing cardiovascular disease on its own, the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

Raised blood pressure (BP), cholesterol and smoking, are the major risk factors. Among these, raised BP is the most important cause, accounting for 62% of strokes and 49% of coronary heart disease. Importantly, the risk is throughout the range of BP, starting at systolic 115 mm Hg. There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is the major factor increasing BP and thereby CVD. Furthermore, a high salt diet may have direct harmful effects independent of its effect on BP, for example, increasing the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that salt intake is related to obesity through soft drink consumption, associated with renal stones and osteoporosis and is probably a major cause of stomach cancer. In most developed countries, a reduction in salt intake can be achieved by a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to food by the food industry. In other countries where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces, a public health campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt. Several countries have already reduced salt intake, for example, Japan (1960\u20131970), Finland (1975 onwards) and now the United Kingdom. The challenge is to spread this out to all other countries. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide will result in a major improvement in public health.

Design Long term follow-up assessed 10-15 years after the original trial. Setting 10 clinic sites in 1987-90 (TOHP I) and nine sites in 1990-5 (TOHP II). Central follow-up conducted by post and phone. Participants Adults aged 30-54 years with prehypertension. Intervention Dietary sodium reduction, including comprehensive education and counselling on reducing intake, for 18 months (TOHP I) or 36-48 months (TOHP II). Main outcome measure Cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularisation, or cardiovascular death). Results 744 participants in TOHP I and 2382 in TOHP II were randomised to a sodium reduction intervention or control. Net sodium reductions in the intervention groups were 44 mmol/24 h and 33 mmol/24 h, respectively. Vital status was obtained for all participants and follow-up information on morbidity was obtained from 2415 (77%), with 200 reporting a cardiovascular event. Risk of a cardiovascular event was 25% lower among those in the intervention group (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.99, P=0.04), adjusted for trial, clinic, age, race, and sex, and 30% lower after further adjustment for baseline sodium excretion and weight (0.70, 0.53 to 0.94), with similar results in each trial. In secondary analyses, 67 participants died (0.80, 0.51 to 1.26, P=0.34). Conclusion Sodium reduction, previously shown to lower blood pressure, may also reduce long term risk of cardiovascular events. Introduction Evidence shows that reduced sodium intake lowers blood pressure and can prevent hypertension. Observational data indicate a strong positive association between sodium intake and blood pressure within and between populations.1 2 Randomised trials of sodium reduction in people with and without hypertension have supported these observational findings.3 4 The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH-sodium) study offers strong evidence of short term effects on blood pressure in a dose-response fashion,5 and five large randomised trials that lasted at least one year have confirmed a modest effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure in those with high normal blood pressure (\u201cprehypertension\u201d).6 7 8 9 10 In contrast, data on the effect of dietary sodium intake on subsequent morbidity and mortality are limited and inconclusive. Several ecological studies support a direct association between higher sodium intake or urinary sodium excretion and mortality from stroke.11 12 Prospective studies generally suggest a direct association despite imperfect measures of sodium intake, although results are mixed. Analyses of the national health and nutrition examination follow-up study (NHEFS) found that dietary sodium intake was either inversely13 14 or directly15 associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In Scottish,16 Finnish,17 and Japanese18 studies, a single measure of urinary excretion was directly correlated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke, although this direct relation has been disputed by some.19 In one lifestyle intervention trial reporting cardiovascular outcomes, there was a non-significant trend towards reduced cardiovascular disease in those assigned to a reduced sodium intervention.20 The causal effect of sodium reduction on subsequent disease can best be tested directly in a randomised trial. Interpretation of non-experimental studies, such as those cited above, is complicated because of methodological concerns. Trials of sodium reduction, however, have not been large enough or lasted long enough to provide adequate data on clinical outcomes.20 We followed up participants in two randomised lifestyle intervention trials\u2014the trials of hypertension prevention phase I (TOHP I)8 and phase II (TOHP II)9\u2014for subsequent cardiovascular outcomes. Both found small but significant direct effects of sodium reduction on reducing blood pressure in diverse samples of normal weight and overweight adults with high normal blood pressure. We determined the long term effects, over a period of 10-15 years, of sodium reduction on cardiovascular disease and mortality. Methods TOHP I The first TOHP trial tested the feasibility and efficacy of seven non-pharmacological interventions in reducing blood pressure in people with high normal blood pressure.21 Interventions included weight loss, sodium reduction, stress management, and nutritional supplements (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fish oil). Participants aged 30-54 were eligible if their mean diastolic blood pressure was 80-89 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. Randomisation occurred at 10 clinic sites from September 1987 to October 1988. Of the 2182 total participants in TOHP I, 327 were randomised to a sodium reduction intervention and 417 to a usual care control group. The active intervention, described in detail elsewhere,22 involved dietary and behavioural counselling on how to identify sodium in the diet, self monitor intake, and select or prepare lower sodium foods and condiments suited to personal preferences. Individual and weekly group counselling sessions were provided during the first three months, with additional counselling and support less frequently for the remainder of follow-up. Participants in the control group followed their usual diets and were given general guidelines for healthy eating. The follow-up period for the lifestyle interventions was 18 months. The final data were collected in 1989 to early 1990. In the intervention group, the net decrease in sodium excretion from baseline to 18 months was 44 mmol/24 h, and net changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were \u22121.7/\u22120.8 (P<0.01 and <0.05, respectively).8 TOHP II The second TOHP trial tested the effects of weight loss and sodium reduction on incident hypertension and blood pressure over three to four years.23 The design was a 2\u00d72 factorial, with intervention groups of weight loss alone, sodium reduction alone, a combination of weight loss and sodium reduction, and a usual care group. Participants were aged 30-54 years, weighed 110-165% of desirable weight, and had average blood pressure of 83-89 mm Hg for diastolic and <140 mm Hg for systolic without antihypertensive medication. A total of 2382 participants were randomised into the trial from December 1990 to March 1992 at nine clinic sites. The active sodium reduction intervention was similar to that in TOHP I. Individual and weekly group counselling sessions were offered initially, with less intensive counselling and support thereafter, specific to sodium reduction.24 Mini-modules to reinforce the content were offered in the later years of the intervention. The final data were collected in March 1995. In keeping with the factorial design, effects of the sodium reduction intervention were analysed by grouping data for the two sodium reduction interventions (alone or with weight loss) and for the two non-sodium reduction groups (usual care or weight loss alone). At 36 months, the pooled active sodium groups experienced a net decrease in sodium excretion of 33 mmol/24 h, with no significant blood pressure reduction.9 The sodium reduction alone group experienced a net 40 mmol/24 h reduction in sodium excretion with corresponding blood pressure reductions of 1.2/0.7 mm Hg compared with usual care, which was significant (P=0.02) for systolic blood pressure only.9 The sodium reduction only intervention resulted in lower incidence of hypertension, with a relative risk of 0.82 (P=0.05) compared with usual care. Follow-up study The observational follow-up for cardiovascular disease began in 2000, about 10 years after the end of TOHP I and five years after the end of TOHP II, and ended in 2004-5. We collected data on all events occurring since the end of the trials. The TOHP coordinating centre conducted the follow-up centrally by mail and phone. Questionnaires were posted beginning in January 2000, followed by phone calls as needed. We sought detailed information on cardiovascular and other health outcomes. We sent additional questionnaires to responders at two year intervals through early 2005, with interim annual postcards for collection of address changes and study outcomes. Our prespecified primary outcome was cardiovascular disease, a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or death with a cardiovascular cause. We repeated analyses excluding CABG and PTCA, and to examine consistency of results and eliminate any potential diagnostic bias, we also repeated the analysis for total mortality. On notification of occurrence of a potential non-fatal outcome, we sought consent to obtain medical records. A study physician, blinded to randomisation assignment, reviewed the records to validate the reported outcome using standardised criteria. We also searched the national death index to identify deaths to December 2003 among those who did not respond to the questionnaires. There were 297 non-fatal outcomes reported, including multiple reports per person. We obtained consent to examine medical records for 216 (73%) and obtained records for 196 (91% of those with consent). Of the reported outcomes with records, we confirmed occurrence of cardiovascular disease in 178 reports (91%), including multiples reports per person. We included in these analyses all first reported outcomes, except for those that did not meet our criteria on record review. We collected information on self reported sodium intake on the final follow-up questionnaire sent in 2004-5, which asked participants about their current preferences for salty and low sodium foods (\u201clike a lot,\u201d \u201clike some,\u201d \u201cdislike some,\u201d or \u201cdislike a lot\u201d) and whether they \u201calways,\u201d \u201cusually,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d use low sodium products, read food labels for sodium, or keep track of daily intake of sodium (mg). We examined these data by randomised group to assess long term patterns of sodium use after the trial. Because of potential changes after a diagnosis related to a cardiovascular disease we included in these analyses only those who did not experience a study outcome. Statistical methods Our analysis focuses on the 744 and 2382 participants randomised to a sodium intervention or control in TOHP I and TOHP II, respectively. We compared trial characteristics at baseline with t tests or \u03c72 tests of association and examined response to the follow-up questionnaire with logistic regression. The primary analysis was a time to event analysis of first cardiovascular event after randomisation with Cox's proportional hazards regression model25 among responders to the follow-up. We pooled the two trial periods using stratification in the model, allowing the baseline hazard to differ by trial, with common predictor coefficients. To allow for possible differences in questionnaire response, primary analyses controlled for clinic, age, race, and sex and assignment to a weight loss intervention in TOHP II, with additional adjustment for baseline weight and baseline sodium excretion. We carried out other analyses with data from TOHP I and II separately and estimated and plotted cumulative incidence curves, adjusted for clinic, age, and sex, for each trial separately. In a sensitivity analysis using logistic regression we performed an intention to treat analysis treating non-responders as non-events. Results were similar and are not reported. Because mortality follow-up was virtually complete, we included all randomised participants in analyses of mortality alone in a full intention to treat analysis. We conducted additional analyses within subsets defined by age, sex, race, baseline body mass index, and assignment to a weight loss intervention. We analysed questions on current sodium preferences after the trial as binary outcomes using \u03c72 tests. Analyses were conducted with SAS version 8.2 and SPlus version 6.2. Results A total of 744 participants were randomised to a sodium intervention or control in TOHP I and 2382 in TOHP II (fig 1)\u21d3. Baseline characteristics were evenly distributed, except for age, which was higher in the sodium reduction intervention group in each trial (table 1)\u21d3.26 27 Change in weight was similar, and change in sodium excretion was greater among those randomised to sodium reduction interventions.

We had information on mortality for all participants, including non-responders. Two hundred participants (8% of the responders) experienced study outcomes. Table 2 Response to follow-up and cardiovascular disease and total mortality according to allocation to sodium intervention or control group View popup View inline The crude rate of cardiovascular disease was somewhat lower among those assigned to the sodium reduction intervention (P=0.21 in stratified analysis) than corresponding controls (table 2).\u21d1 After adjustment for baseline characteristics, particularly the imbalance in age, there were significant differences between groups. Figure 2\u21d3 shows adjusted cumulative incidence rates of cardiovascular disease by trial and intervention. After we controlled for clinic site, demographic information, and randomisation to a weight loss intervention (in TOHP II), the estimated reduction in relative risk of cardiovascular disease among those in the sodium reduction versus control interventions was 25% (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.99, P=0.04). Additional adjustment for baseline weight and sodium excretion strengthened the association (0.70, 0.53 to 0.94, P=0.02). Effect estimates were similar, although less significant, after further adjustment for change in weight during the trials (0.74, 0.55 to 1.01, P=0.06). Results were similar when we analysed them separately by trial. Analyses for interactions indicated that effects of the sodium reduction intervention were similar across categories defined by sex (P=0.98), race (white v black P=0.79, white v other P=0.63), age (30-44 v 45-54 years, P=0.43), body mass index (<25 v \u226525, P=0.34), and active weight loss intervention overall (P=0.55) or within TOHP II only (P=0.17) (table 3)\u21d3.When we excluded revascularisation procedures from the composite outcome, 124 participants experienced cardiovascular disease (76 myocardial infarctions, 19 strokes, six both, and 23 cardiovascular deaths with no previous reported myocardial infarction or stroke). The fully adjusted point estimates were similar to those for the primary outcome, but were not significant (0.72, 0.50 to 1.03, P=0.07).

The magnitude of risk reduction in this full intention to treat analysis was consistent with results for the primary outcome (table 2 and fig 3).\u21d1\u21d3After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including weight and sodium excretion, there was a 20% lower mortality among those in the sodium reduction intervention (0.80, 0.51 to 1.26, P=0.34). Results were similar for each trial. Twenty five deaths were due to cardiovascular disease; 10 in the intervention groups and 15 in the comparison groups (0.62, 0.28 to 1.40, P=0.25). Fig 3 Total mortality by sodium intervention group in TOHP I and II, adjusted for age, sex, and clinic Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint The final follow-up questionnaire in 2004-5 about sodium use after the trial was received from 1400 (65%) of the 2164 event-free participants, with a higher response among those in the sodium reduction intervention in TOHP I (77% v 66% in intervention v control, respectively, P=0.01). In the two groups, 48% versus 32% (P<0.001) reported that they disliked salty foods, and 71% versus 64% (P=0.003) reported that they liked low sodium or unsalted foods. Additionally, 47% versus 29% reported that they usually or always used low sodium products (P<0.001); 66% versus 44% read food labels for sodium (P<0.001); and 28% versus 20% at least sometimes kept track of their daily intake of sodium (P<0.001) in the two groups, respectively. Discussion In this long term follow-up of two completed lifestyle intervention trials, people with prehypertension assigned to a sodium reduction intervention experienced a 25-30% lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes in the 10 to 15 years after the trial. This magnitude of risk reduction was evident in each trial, in most subgroup analyses, and in various sensitivity analyses, such as those that excluded coronary revascularisation from the composite outcome, with total mortality as the trial outcome, and with an alternative set of adjustment variables. Although several of these subsidiary analyses did not achieve a conventional level of significance, the magnitude of risk reduction tended to be similar. Strengths and weaknesses Our follow-up study was of sufficient size and duration to assess the effects of sodium reduction on cardiovascular outcomes based on randomised trial data. Despite its relatively small size as a trial of clinical outcomes, it provides some of the strongest objective evidence to date that lowering sodium intake, even among those without hypertension, reduces the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have been observational, relying on suboptimal measurements of dietary sodium intake, which is extremely difficult to measure. Many observational studies had a single assessment of dietary sodium intake, and many relied on dietary recall methods, which tend to be inaccurate and to underestimate actual sodium intake. Such problems with measuring sodium intake may explain the inconsistent and sometimes paradoxical findings.14 15 19 Observational studies measuring sodium excretion have found a more consistent positive association.17 18 Our study has several additional strengths. Firstly, participants were demographically heterogeneous, and all had prehypertension, placing them at increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular outcomes.28 29 Secondly, measurements of dietary sodium intake during the trial phase were based on carefully collected repeated assessments of 24 hour urinary excretion. Observed baseline sodium excretion was in agreement with the average self reported intake of 3600 mg (156.6 mmol/24 h) seen in data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 1999-2000.30 One limitation of the study is the less than complete rate of follow-up. As a long term observational study of completed trials, however, the rates of follow-up (100% for mortality and 77% for morbidity) were relatively high. The response rate was similar by intervention group and thus unlikely to bias the results. In addition, analysis of total mortality, an outcome that is completely objective and virtually complete, showed a lesser but consistent reduction in risk. A further limitation is the lack of direct measurement of blood pressure, weight, and sodium intake during follow-up, though questionnaire data support the presence of long term effects of the intervention. The intervention groups reported significantly better adherence to a reduced sodium eating pattern. Although we cannot rule out social desirability bias in reporting, the findings are supported by evidence that preference for salt can decrease after about three months on a reduced sodium intake diet.31 Persistence of adherence to intervention, albeit attenuated, has been observed at one year follow-up for other dietary modifications even in the absence of continued counselling.32 Maintenance of dietary sodium changes may be relatively better than for some other aspects of dietary change.33 If we assume the attenuation of effect that is often seen in studies of dietary change, these results might underestimate the potential public health benefits of policy changes to improve adoption and long term adherence to lower sodium intakes. Other research Long term clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of sodium reduction on clinical events have not been conducted because of logistic and feasibility considerations. There is, however, some evidence that sodium reduction has long term beneficial effects on blood pressure, even in the absence of continued intervention. In a 15 year follow-up study of infants who were given low sodium formula during their first six months, blood pressure was lower in the intervention than control group in adolescence, despite no differences in urinary sodium excretion at follow-up.34 Similarly, in a seven year follow-up study of participants from the Baltimore TOHP I site,35 a trend for lower blood pressure and reduced hypertension incidence was found in the sodium intervention compared with control group, despite no differences in urinary sodium excretion at follow-up. Possible explanations for these results include a \u201cprogramming\u201d effect in infants, a resetting of blood pressure regulation in adults exposed to treatment to reduce blood pressure, or a direct effect of high sodium intake on cardiac and vascular structure that may be delayed for a period of time with sodium reduction. Besides its effects on blood pressure, an expanding body of evidence suggests that a high sodium intake has detrimental cardiovascular effects independent of blood pressure. High sodium intake increases extracellular sodium concentrations and may adversely affect vascular reactivity and growth and stimulate myocardial fibrosis.36 37 38 Additionally, several cross sectional studies39 40 41 42 and one small clinical study43 have documented a direct relation between sodium intake and left ventricular mass. The latter mechanisms may explain the sizeable reduction in cardiovascular disease, despite the relatively modest effects on blood pressure seen during the TOHP trials. Results of our follow-up study reinforce recommendations to lower dietary sodium intake as a means of preventing cardiovascular disease in the general population.44 To date, policy recommendations have relied to a large extent on a consistent body of evidence that sodium reduction lowers blood pressure, an aetiologically relevant, well accepted, and modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. High blood pressure, however, is not a cardiovascular event, and there has been a call for large scale, long term trials of sodium reduction with clinical outcomes.45 Our study provides unique evidence that sodium reduction might prevent cardiovascular disease and should dispel any residual concern that sodium reduction might be harmful.14 In conclusion, sodium reduction, previously shown to lower blood pressure and prevent hypertension, also seems to prevent cardiovascular disease. The TOHP interventions reduced sodium intake by about 25% to 35%, approaching current recommendations for a 50% decrease in the amount of sodium in food in the United States.46 The observed reduction in cardiovascular risk associated with this sodium decrease was substantial and provides strong support for population-wide reduction in dietary sodium intake to prevent cardiovascular disease. What is already known on this topic Randomised trials in people with and without hypertension show reduction in blood pressure with lower sodium intake Few observational studies and virtually no trial data exist on the effect of sodium intake on subsequent cardiovascular disease What this study adds Reduction in dietary sodium intake also seems to prevent cardiovascular disease Footnotes We thank David Gordon, Jean MacFadyen, and their staff at the TOHP coordinating centre for their efforts in conducting the follow-up study.

Accepted 16 February 1996 Abstract Objectives: To assess further the relation in Intersalt of 24 hour urinary sodium to blood pressure of individuals and populations, and the difference in blood pressure from young adulthood into middle age. Design: Standardised cross sectional study within and across populations. Setting: 52 population samples in 32 countries. Subjects: 10 074 men and women aged 20-59. Main outcome measures: Association of sodium and blood pressure from within population and cross population multiple linear regression analyses with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias. Relation of sample median daily urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age. Results: In within population analyses (n=10 074), individual 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol) was associated with systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher on average by 3/0 to 6/3 mm Hg (with and without body mass in analyses). Associations were larger at ages 40-59. In cross population analyses (n=52), sample median 24 hour sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol was associated with median systolic/diastolic pressure higher on average by 5-7/2-4 mm Hg, and estimated mean difference in systolic/diastolic pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 greater by 10-11/6 mm Hg. Conclusions: The strong, positive association of urinary sodium with systolic pressure of individuals concurs with Intersalt cross population findings and results of other studies. Higher urinary sodium is also associated with substantially greater differences in blood pressure in middle age compared with young adulthood. These results support recommendations for reduction of high salt intake in populations for prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels. Key messages The within population findings were previously underestimated because of incomplete correction for the regression dilution problem Revised estimates of the within population association of sodium to blood pressure in Intersalt are concordant with the cross population findings for 52 samples Estimates of the effect of median sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day over a 30 year period (age 55 minus age 25) were a greater difference of 10-11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure These results lend further support to recommendations for mass reduction of high salt intake for the prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels and high blood pressure in populations Introduction In 1988, the Intersalt study published results showing a highly significant positive relation between 24 hour urinary sodium excretion and systolic blood pressure. This was found in regression analyses testing two sets of hypotheses: firstly, in cross population (ecological) analyses for the 52 population samples and, secondly, at the individual level for the 10 079 men and women aged 20-59 years (median age 40) who participated in this worldwide investigation.1 In one of the cross population analyses, the study found a highly significant positive association between average sodium excretions of the 52 population samples and their slopes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age, as estimated from simple linear regression of blood pressure on age within each sample.1 Subsequent reviews of ecological studies,2 clinical trials of sodium reduction and blood pressure (both randomised3 4 and non-randomised4), and within population observational studies5 6 all confirmed this positive association of sodium and blood pressure, although the size of estimates differed. In particular, Law et al, in deriving quantitative estimates of association, found consistent results from ecological, within population, and trial data, with estimates somewhat larger than those published by Intersalt, especially for analyses at the individual level.2 4 6 The Intersalt investigators had set down several reasons why estimates of association for individuals in Intersalt were likely to be too low.7 8 One problem was incomplete correction for regression dilution bias.9 Larger estimates of association of urinary sodium with blood pressure in Intersalt have recently been published, based on multivariate correction for regression dilution.10 11 Estimates of the sodium-blood pressure relation were larger still when body mass index was removed from the multiple regression analyses.12 This reflects the fact that sodium and body mass index are positively correlated, but whereas body mass index is measured almost without error, sodium intake is estimated imprecisely for individuals.10 12 This paper has two objectives. The first objective is to update the main 1988 Intersalt findings in the light of these new analyses, particularly in regard to comparability of quantitative estimates of the sodium-blood pressure relations from ecological and individual analyses; the second is to report further cross population data on the relation of 24 hour urinary sodium to difference in blood pressure with age. This second objective relates to representations made by the Salt Institute, the trade organisation of salt producers, to the Intersalt study leadership in the United States, objecting to the linear regression methodology used to obtain slope of blood pressure with age and requesting the raw Intersalt data so that it could do its own analyses. While rejecting the proposal to turn over the raw Intersalt data because of the need to preserve the independence of scientific investigation, the integrity of the data, and the confidentiality of information on individuals, the Intersalt steering and editorial committee offered to carry out further analyses of this question, and they supplied results for several additional analyses requested by the Salt Institute. Data presented here are from analyses encompassing and going beyond those requested by the Salt Institute on the shape of the age-blood pressure curve and the relation of 24 hour urinary sodium excretion to the curve. Methods Intersalt followed a standardised protocol with common field methods in all 52 centres and centralised training and certification of researchers. Blood pressure in the sitting position was measured twice with a Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer after the participant had emptied his or her bladder and sat quietly for five minutes. A single timed 24 hour urine collection was obtained for estimation of electrolyte excretion. A random 8% of participants also made a second collection about three weeks later for assessment of the regression dilution problem.1 10 11 13 In the original statistical analyses, multiple linear regression was used to test the cross population and within population hypotheses. In the cross population analyses (n=52), regression of each of five blood pressure variables\u2014population sample median systolic blood pressure, median diastolic blood pressure, linear slope of systolic pressure with age, linear slope of diastolic pressure with age, and prevalence of high blood pressure\u2014was done on population sample median 24 hour sodium excretion. In the within population analyses (n=10 079), regression of systolic and of diastolic pressure of individuals on their 24 hour sodium excretion was first done separately for the people in each of the 52 samples; results were then pooled (with weighting of each coefficient by inverse of its variance) to obtain a coefficient for all 10 079 participants. STATISTICAL ANALYSES Sodium-blood pressure relation\u2014We compared multiple linear regression coefficients for sodium-blood pressure relations from Intersalt's within population and cross population analyses, focusing on within population data for regression of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of individuals on their 24 hour sodium excretion and on cross population data for regression of population sample median systolic and diastolic pressure on sample median 24 hour urinary sodium excretion, according to prior hypotheses (52 samples). For the within population data, the findings are from recent updated analyses of 10 074 people, with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias,10 14 with and without body mass index included in the multiple linear regression analyses.11 12 Quantitative estimates are given for systolic and diastolic pressure with 24 hour sodium greater by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol). These two sets of data\u2014within population and cross population\u2014are directly comparable, since both relate to men and women of average age 40 years. Additionally, data are shown at younger (20-39 years) and older ages (40-59), for the first time with multivariate correction for regression dilution. Sodium and age-blood pressure relation\u2014In a further assessment of the relation of population sample average sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age, Intersalt used four methods to estimate relation of age to blood pressure for each of the 52 samples. The first two assumed a linear relation between blood pressure and age. In addition a simple difference method and also a complex curve fitting (\u201cbest fit\u201d) method were used, in response to requests from the Salt Institute. In linear method A, slopes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age were obtained from univariate linear regressions, for men and women combined, as previously.1 In linear method B, linear regression analyses of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on age were again carried out for each sample, with adjustment for potential confounders: sex (a 0-1 variable), 24 hour urinary potassium excretion, body mass index and alcohol intake entered as two (0-1) variables: 1-299 ml/week and >/=300 ml/week. In the simple difference method, the difference in population sample median systolic (and diastolic) blood pressure at ages 50-59 and 20-29 was computed separately for men and for women, and then the average of these two values was obtained. In the complex curve fitting (\u201cbest fit\u201d) method, polynomial curve fitting was done, up to the fifth order term. The root mean square error (the estimated residual standard deviation of blood pressure, unexplained by the model15 16) was used to determine whether inclusion of higher order terms of age improved the \u201cfit\u201d of regressions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on age. It was recognised at the outset that the scientific rationale and value of such an approach was limited, not least because one or two points might become unduly influential with only 200 or fewer persons per sample. For the linear and curve fitting methods, estimated blood pressure at age 25 and at age 55 was computed for each sample and the difference in blood pressure (age 55 minus age 25) was obtained. Each blood pressure difference, obtained with the four methods, was then entered as the dependent variable in an ecological regression against median or mean 24 hour sodium excretion, adjusted across the population samples for body mass index and alcohol intake. The resultant regression coefficient was then used to estimate the greater difference in blood pressure over a 30 year period (age 25 to age 55) attributable to an average sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day. As use of either median or mean sodium excretion gave similar results, findings for only one (median) are given here. Results UPDATE AND COMPARISON OF INTERSALT WITHIN AND CROSS POPULATION Estimates of the sodium-blood pressure relation for individuals are given in table 1 uncorrected and with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias,10 11 with and without body mass index in the multiple adjustment.12 For men and women at all ages (20-59 years), with correction for regression dilution, estimates for systolic pressure ranged from 3.1 mm Hg to 6.0 mm Hg higher per 100 mmol/day greater sodium excretion (multiple adjustment with and without inclusion of body mass index), and estimates for diastolic pressure ranged from 0.1 to 2.5 mm Hg higher. Estimates of association were larger for older people (40-59 years) than for younger people (20-39 years). For example, on multiple adjustment without body mass index in the model, estimates were systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher by 7.8/3.6 mm Hg per 100 mmol/day greater sodium excretion at older ages and 4.3/1.2 mm Hg at younger ages.

Median systolic pressure was estimated to be higher by 4.5 mm Hg and median diastolic pressure by 2.3 mm Hg for median 24 hour urinary sodium greater by 100 mmol, values within the ranges of the estimates above for individuals. Again, estimated values were higher at older than at younger ages. For example, on multiple adjustment these estimates were systolic/diastolic pressure higher by 7.0/4.0 mm Hg per 100 mmol/day greater sodium excretion at older ages compared with 1.9/0.4 mm Hg at younger ages. Table 2 Across population regression coefficients (SE) for estimates of difference in median systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 100 mmol higher 24 hour urinary sodium excretion for 52 population samples View popup View inline In the 1988 Intersalt report,1 post hoc analyses were also reported for 48 population samples (excluding four samples from remote populations with urinary sodium excretion </=50 mmol/day). These truncated analyses17 of 48 samples were lower in statistical power than those of 52 samples, both because of the smaller number of populations and because much of the variation in sodium excretion (designed at outset to be as wide as possible18) was removed. In addition, these analyses were highly confounded by median body mass index.19 With multiple adjustment, including body mass index, the estimate of association of median systolic pressure to median urinary sodium excretion in the 48 sample analysis was 2.5 (SE 2.6) mm Hg per 100 mmol/day sodium excretion.1 ANALYSES OF SODIUM AND DIFFERENCE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WITH AGE Table 3 gives data on the second objective of this report. As described above, four procedures were used to estimate, for each of the 52 population samples, differences in average systolic and diastolic blood pressure 30 years apart (at age 25 and at age 55). Regression of the 52 blood pressure differences (estimated systolic or diastolic pressure value at age 55 minus estimated value at age 25) was then carried out on the 52 median values for 24 hour sodium excretion. The resultant coefficients\u2014four for systolic pressure (that is, with the four methods) and four for diastolic pressure\u2014yielded estimates of greater differences in population sample systolic and diastolic pressure over 30 years attributable to 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol. As shown in table 3, each of the four methods gave similar highly significant estimates (P<0.001). These were in the order of a 10-11 mm Hg greater difference in systolic pressure over 30 years, from young adulthood into middle age, with sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day, and of a 6 mm Hg higher difference for diastolic pressure. These ecological results were found with cross centre adjustment for body mass index and alcohol use; similar results were obtained with adjustment also for systolic or diastolic blood pressure at age 20-29: greater difference in systolic blood pressure after 30 years of 10-12 mm Hg and in diastolic pressure of 6-7 mm Hg. Table 3 Estimated greater average difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg) over 30 years (age 55 minus age 25) for daily median urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol View popup View inline Analyses for 48 population samples (excluding the four low sodium samples1) also gave significant results, with estimates of blood pressure difference after 30 years greater by 9-12 mm Hg systolic and 4-5 mm Hg diastolic for sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day. With adjustment also for blood pressure at age 20-29, systolic blood pressure difference was estimated to be greater by 9-11 mm Hg and diastolic by 3-4 mm Hg. Discussion MAIN INFERENCES Three main inferences emerge from this revisit and update of the Intersalt data. Firstly, the estimated association of higher dietary sodium with higher systolic and diastolic pressure of individuals is strong and larger than originally reported in 1988.1 Secondly, updated values for this effect in the 10 074 individual participants are quantitatively concordant with those from the ecological analyses on the 52 population samples. Thirdly, higher dietary sodium intake is positively associated with substantially greater differences in systolic and diastolic pressure in middle age than in young adulthood, with every method used to estimate differences in blood pressure with age. The estimate of this ecological relation in the original Intersalt report is robust both qualitatively and quantitatively. STRENGTH AND CONSISTENCY The first two conclusions relate to the first objective of this report\u2014namely, in the light of recent Intersalt findings10 11 12 and results of other studies, to evaluate further the comparative quantitative estimates of the relation of sodium to blood pressure as assessed in within population and cross population analyses. For systolic pressure, these Intersalt estimates are (within population) 3-6 mm Hg and (cross population) 5-7 mm Hg higher on average when daily urinary sodium excretion is greater by 100 mmol; for diastolic pressure they are 0-3 mm Hg and 2-4 mm Hg higher. These estimates\u2014for individuals from within population analyses and for whole population samples from cross population (ecological) analyses\u2014agree with published estimates of the sodium-blood pressure relation based on review of other epidemiological studies.2 5 6 Estimates of association of urinary sodium excretion with blood pressure from individual analyses tend to be low for reasons set out elsewhere.7 8 An important reason is regression dilution, which, if uncorrected, results in estimates biased towards the \u201cno effect\u201d value (that is, regression slope of zero). This is especially so for urinary sodium excretion, for which day to day variance within individuals can be as much as three times larger than variance between individuals.6 10 In simple regression, correction for regression dilution depends directly on the proportion of total variance\u2014for example, in sodium excretion\u2014occurring between individuals. In multiple regression, matters are complicated by the inclusion of correlated variables measured with or without error; in this case, correlated (measurement) errors between variables need to be accounted for. The revised estimates of association given here are therefore based on multivariate procedures to correct for this regression dilution problem. The different measurement errors of correlated variables cause difficulty. Body mass index is measured almost without error, whereas 24 hour urinary sodium excretion is imprecisely estimated for individuals. In multiple regression analyses against a dependent variable (blood pressure) the well measured variable (body mass index) may dominate over the poorly estimated variable (24 hour sodium excretion). Thus a portion of the observed association between body mass index and blood pressure19 could be due to the association of sodium and blood pressure as individuals with higher body mass index will on average have higher urinary sodium excretion. Adjusting the association of 24 hour urinary sodium excretion with blood pressure for body mass index may therefore result in overadjustment. For this reason, we have reported analyses with and without inclusion of body mass index in the multiple regression, to give a range of estimates for the independent effect of sodium on blood pressure. SODIUM EXCRETION AND DIFFERENCE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WITH AGE The conclusions about the consistency and strength of the relation of sodium and blood pressure are reinforced by data reported here from Intersalt analyses on the relation of 24 hour urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age, estimated by four different methods. Although the Intersalt data are cross sectional, data from several longitudinal studies over the past 40 years show that in all but the most remote populations around the world, blood pressure in individuals rises from young adulthood into middle and older ages.20 21 22 23 Results from every analysis reported here were consistent in showing a significant relation of sodium to difference in blood pressure with age. In population samples with median 24 hour urinary sodium higher by 100 mmol, difference in blood pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 was greater by 10-11 mm Hg systolic and 6 mm Hg diastolic. The adequacy and robustness of the original linear model and the results reported based on it are unequivocally established by these results, which include those obtained with the simple difference and \u201cbest fit\u201d methods proposed by the Salt Institute. Thus the Salt Institute's challenge of the Intersalt results on the relation of sodium intake to slope of blood pressure with age is groundless. It is reasonable to infer that habitual high intake of salt may be responsible for a sizeable proportion of the rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age observed in most populations worldwide. A further question in the interpretation of analyses based on cross sectional data, is the extent to which estimated blood pressure differences may reflect acute changes (over weeks) in addition to chronic effects (over months and years). That both are likely is apparent from the results of observational epidemiological studies2 5 6 and of short term (less than four weeks) and longer term trials of sodium reduction and blood pressure3 4\u2014larger effects on blood pressure being found in the trials of longer duration.4 Ecological comparisons of average sodium intake and average blood pressures of populations (and the Intersalt findings on differences in blood pressure with age) can be assumed to reflect chronic effects, although within population studies may reflect a mixture of acute and chronic effects. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PREVENTION To what extent can these findings inform policy on the primary prevention of high blood pressure in populations? Three further strands of evidence are relevant. Firstly, studies in migrant populations have shown that a rise in blood pressure is a rapid accompaniment (within weeks) of change from a traditional rural existence to an urban environment\u2014change that includes an increase in salt intake24\u2014and that such blood pressure changes are sustained over the longer term.25 Secondly, the Dutch trial of low sodium feeds in newborn infants reported that significantly lower blood pressure was attained in the low sodium group by the completion of the trial at six months.26 Thirdly, the recently reported experimental study of the effects of sodium loading and unloading on the blood pressure of chimpanzees showed substantial long term adverse effects of high salt intake; these effects disappeared with correction of high salt intake in the experimental group. The control group showed substantial benefits on blood pressure of a lifetime diet low in sodium.27 28 Together, these studies indicate the potential, with lower salt intake, for more favourable blood pressure patterns in populations and for the primary prevention of high-normal and high blood pressure.29 We also examined the associations of urinary sodium to blood pressure at younger (20-39 years) and older ages (40-59). As shown here and reported previously in the Intersalt study,30 the within population association of sodium and blood pressure was larger at older ages. This is consistent with the findings from the cross population analyses of the 52 population samples reported here and also with those from other observational studies and with the results of trials of sodium reduction and blood pressure.2 4 6 This interaction with age could be due to cumulative exposure to salt over decades or to reduced ability of the kidney to handle a sodium load with advancing age, or to both these factors.30 These findings underscore the need for early primary prevention at younger ages, as well as for appropriate dietary and lifestyle interventions at older ages. A key aim is to stem the rise in blood pressure that occurs from young adulthood to middle and older ages. At present, salt intake among adults in the United Kingdom and United States averages at least 9 g/day, with large numbers of people consuming 12 g/day or more,1 17 31 and intake is high among children. Levels are 10-15 times the basal sodium requirement for growing and adult humans of no more than 500 mg of salt per day (8-10 mmol sodium).17 About 15% of current salt intake comes from so called discretionary addition in cooking and at table and only 10% from the natural salt content of foods. The rest\u2014about 75% of all the salt eaten\u2014comes from salt added in processing and manufacturing of foods.17 31 32 33 Obviously, there is great opportunity for the food industry to contribute to health by reducing the amount of salt added to foods in processing. The successful marketing in the United States of many no salt added, low salt, and salt free products32; the reduction of salt added in bread in Belgium34; and the experience of the mineral salt trial in the Netherlands35 all show this to be feasible. CONCLUSION Data presented here indicate that a sodium intake lower by 100 mmol\u2014for example, 70 instead of 170 mmol/day\u2014could result, in adults (average age 40) in systolic pressure lower by 3-6 mm Hg and in slope in systolic pressure from age 25 to age 55 less by 10 mm Hg. Extensive data from prospective population studies indicate that such improvements in average systolic pressure levels could substantially reduce rates of major cardiovascular diseases and mortality from all causes.4 7 8 9 36 37 This potential underscores the value of current recommendations38 39 encouraging the general population to reduce salt intake.

Discover the report\u2019s key takeaways and the specific actions that cities can take to contribute to the Great Food Transformation. Photo: Linus Sundahl-Djerf What should you know? The food we eat, the ways we produce it, and the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability. Getting it right with food will be an important way for countries to achieve the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Today, agriculture occupies nearly 40% of global land, making agroecosystems the largest terrestrial ecosystems on the planet. Food production is responsible for up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of freshwater use. Land conversion for food production is the single most important driver of biodiversity loss. Foods sourced from animals, especially red meat, have relatively high environmental footprints per serving compared to other food groups. This has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and biodiversity loss. This is particularly the case for animal source foods from grain fed livestock. What is or is not consumed are both major drivers of malnutrition in various forms. Globally, over 820 million people continue to go hungry every day, 150 million children suffer from long-term hunger that impairs their growth and development, and 50 million children are acutely hungry due to insufficient access to food. In parallel, the world is also experiencing a rise in overweight and obesity. Today, over 2 billion adults are overweight and obese, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases including diabetes, cancer and heart diseases are among the leading causes of global deaths. Urban food environments often pose particular challenges to health and sustainability given the concentrated availability of junk foods and related advertising. Food can be a powerful driver of change: The EAT-Lancet Commission outlines a planetary health diet and targets for sustainable food production that, when combined, can prevent 11 million premature adult deaths per year and drive the transition toward a sustainable global food system by 2050. Globally, the planetary health diet favors increasing the consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes alongside small portions of meat and dairy. In parts of the world, this diet involves increasing the access to certain food groups while in other areas, the diet requires a significant reduction in the overconsumption of unhealthier foods. A sustainable global food system by 2050 means sufficiently healthy food for all with no additional land use conversion for food, protection of biodiversity, reduced water use, decreased nitrogen and phosphorus loss to waterways, net zero carbon dioxide emissions, and significantly lower levels of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. What can you do? Produce urban food differently by: Establishing zoning regulations that promote urban agriculture and community gardens as a means to produce food locally, support biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to provide opportunities for citizens to engage with each other through food. Supporting local farmers and producers through providing incentives for sustainable production of healthy foods in peri-urban spaces, facilitating market access, and by shortening supply chains. Change procurement and distribution practices by: Enabling better access to sales outlets and independent vendors who offer healthy and sustainable food options. Supporting contracts and procurement policies that supply healthy diets from sustainable food systems in institutions where public meals are served. Applying regulations to restrict the operations of unhealthy food vendors in public areas, for example near schools or in hospitals. Promoting planetary health diets in school meals and education programs. Adopt responsible marketing principles by: Embracing food labeling policies that reflect the health and sustainability implications of individual products, including suggested serving sizes and their environmental costs. Supporting advertising practices that promote the daily consumption of healthy and sustainable foods while limiting the marketing of foods high in calories, saturated fats, refined sugar, salt and animal-based products. Address food loss and food waste by: Overseeing a sustainable and energy-efficient food distribution system that limits food loss. Striving to reduce food waste and loss among public vendors by at least 50% overall and by facilitating public behavioral change through education and awareness campaigns, including incentives to reduce household food waste. Supporting urban food redistribution schemes that share surplus foods with others. Establishing municipal systems that separate and reuse food waste through composting, bioenergy production or other operations while also avoiding losses to landfill and incineration. Upgrading municipal sewage treatment to minimize nutrient pollution of aquatic systems and to eventually safely recycle nitrogen and phosphorous in cropping systems. Strengthen food system advocacy and governance by: Developing a comprehensive food strategy and corresponding policies involving all relevant municipal departments and representatives from key local stakeholder groups. Setting up a formal committee or multi-stakeholder mechanism to implement the city\u2019s food strategy. Organizing public education campaigns targeting schools and households about the approaches to, and benefits of, healthy and sustainable diets. Establishing taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages such as sugary drinks and consider earmarking the revenue from such taxes to improve access to healthy and sustainable food. Collecting data on food-related challenges in the city and monitoring progress.

EAT Forum 2017 Photo: Linus Sundahl-Djerf What should you know? The food we eat, the ways we produce it, and the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability. Getting it right with food will be an important way for countries to achieve the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. A diet that includes more plant-based foods and fewer animal source foods is healthy, sustainable, and good for both people and planet. It is not a question of all or nothing, but rather small changes for a large and positive impact. Foods sourced from animals, especially red meat, have relatively high environmental footprints per serving compared to other food groups. This has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and biodiversity loss. This is particularly the case for animal source foods from grain fed livestock. What is or is not consumed are both major drivers of malnutrition in various forms. Globally, over 820 million people continue to go hungry every day, 150 million children suffer from long-term hunger that impairs their growth and development, and 50 million children are acutely hungry due to insufficient access to food. In parallel, the world is also experiencing a rise in overweight and obesity. Today, over 2 billion adults are overweight and obese, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases including diabetes, cancer and heart diseases are among the leading causes of global deaths. Good food can be a powerful driver of change: The EAT-Lancet Commission outlines a planetary health diet, which is flexible and recommends intake levels of various food groups that can adapted to local geography, culinary traditions and personal preferences. The planetary health diet recommends consuming a range of foods amounting to 2500 kcal per day that will promote health and well-being by reducing risk of overweight, obesity and noncommunicable diseases. By choosing this diet, one can also drive demand for the right foods and send clear market signals all the way through the food value chain back to the farmers. Globally, the planetary health diet favors increasing the consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes alongside small portions of meat and dairy. In parts of the world, this diet involves increasing the access to certain food groups while in other areas, the diet requires a significant reduction in the overconsumption of unhealthier foods. Shifting from unhealthy diets to the planetary health diet can prevent 11 million premature adult deaths per year and drive the transition toward a sustainable global food system by 2050 that ensures healthy food for all within planetary boundaries. What can you do? Change culture by changing menus. Chefs and other culinary professionals are well-positioned to make healthy and sustainable foods delicious by applying unique insights, skills and creativity to craft next-generation models of innovation in food service and hospitality. This is integral to bring the public along on a journey of discovery and adoption of the planetary health diet. Emphasize the benefits of dietary shifts. Eating healthy foods from sustainable food systems is only partially about decreasing the intake of certain foods. Place the emphasis on eating more of the healthy options rather than simply focusing on decreasing the intake of unhealthy foods. Explore new foods and mix up menus. Focus on the array of new flavors, ingredients and menu options that the planetary health diet opens up by embarking on a lifetime of discovery. Commit to regularly menuing new ingredients to keep planetary health diets innovative and exciting. Lead with messaging around flavor. Use culinary techniques and source the best-tasting ingredients to ensure that healthy and sustainable options are as desirable as, or more so than, the alternatives. Making the healthiest and most sustainable options by far the tastiest and appealing is critical. Work with suppliers and consumers. Whether they are managing a cafeteria at Google or running a school program in Burkina Faso, food service professionals have tremendous leverage with both food suppliers and consumers. Work with both and utilize the positioning of food service professionals as primary pathways to nudge consumers toward planetary health diets. Focus on both quality and quality. Use culinary strategies to promote satiety, value and pleasure from food without fueling overconsumption. Actions from using smaller plates and bowls to avoiding dining hall trays and all-you-can-eat buffets will also help reduce food waste. Waste not, want not. Minimize food waste through careful planning and portioning and be proactive by using the entire product at every chance. Converting unusually shaped or sized produce into dishes where shape and size do not matter can also be helpful. Let plants take center stage. The planetary health diet recommends a consumption level of no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry and 196 grams of fish per person per week where possible. Food service professionals can help reduce meat consumption through portion sizes, for example by blending meat with vegetables and plant proteins in bowls, burgers, curries and stews or by using meat as a condiment or garnish (in servings of less than 20 grams) while allowing fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes to take starring roles. Embrace cultural food influences. Look to a variety of traditional, plant-forward food cultures across the globe for inspiration around both flavor strategies and to craft tasty dishes on restricted budgets through cultural exchanges. Bring biodiversity to the table. Bold conservation targets require collaboration between farmers and farming communities to maintain habitats on or around farms and to enable the safe passage of wildlife. Source ingredients from farmers and suppliers who contribute to efforts for biodiversity. Share the farmer\u2019s story. Convey to diners the important contributions of farmers to conservation and carbon capturing efforts in protecting environmental sustainability through menus and marketing materials. This will, in turn, help create demand for healthy and sustainably produced foods, which translates into a \u201cwin-win\u201d dynamic for food service professionals and farmers alike.

EAT-Lancet Commission Brief for Farmers The EAT-Lancet Commission presents a global planetary health diet that is healthy for both people and planet. Discover the report\u2019s key takeaways and the specific actions that farmers can take to contribute to the Great Food Transformation. What should you know? The food we eat, the ways we produce it, and the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability. Getting it right with food will be an important way for countries to achieve the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Farmers as producers are important stewards of human and planetary health through food production. By addressing crop choice and modes of production, agriculture can become the primary driver of both good dietary health and environmental conservation. Today, agriculture occupies nearly 40% of global land, making agroecosystems the largest terrestrial ecosystems on the planet. Food production is responsible for up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of freshwater use. Land conversion for food production is the single most important driver of biodiversity loss. Foods sourced from animals, especially red meat, have relatively high environmental footprints per serving compared to other food groups. This has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and biodiversity loss. This is particularly the case for animal source foods from grain fed livestock. While global food production has successfully kept pace with population growth in sheer volume, what is or is not consumed are both major drivers of malnutrition in various forms. Globally, over 820 million people continue to go hungry every day, 150 million children suffer from long-term hunger that impairs their growth and development, and 50 million children are acutely hungry due to insufficient access to food. In parallel, the world is also experiencing a rise in overweight and obesity. Today, over 2 billion adults are overweight and obese, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases including diabetes, cancer and heart diseases are among the leading causes of global deaths. Food can be a powerful driver of change: A sustainable global food system by 2050 means sufficiently healthy food for all with no additional land use conversion for food, protection of biodiversity, reduced water use, decreased nitrogen and phosphorus loss to waterways, net zero carbon dioxide emissions, and significantly lower levels of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. While farmers work locally, their collective impact can shift the whole balance of food production practices and the wider global food system. Farmers are central to driving actions to ensure sufficient, healthy and sustainably produced food for all. This will require a reorientation of agricultural priorities; moving from an emphasis on producing high yields to meet calorific requirements toward producing a diversity of healthy foods in sufficient quantities and of acceptable quality without any further expansions into intact natural ecosystems. This implies increasing the production of fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts by 9% annually and 50\u2013150% by 2050. What can you do? Adapt broad key principles. There is no silver bullet to environmental sustainability, but certain key principles are integral to defining the final outcome. Mix and match crops, techniques, practices and technologies to produce more on less land, limit nutrient loss to water, store carbon in the soil, and provide room for biodiversity to flourish. Focus on applying specific practices. Focus on practices that improve soil carbon concentration, reduce nutrient leakage from the fields, and enhance the efficiency of crop water use. These efforts will support farms in shifting away from being sources of environmental degradation. Decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and above ground must increase significantly and practices such as conservation tillage or riparian buffers can support efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, feed additives and feed reformulation also show promise in contributing toward reducing emissions. Spare half of the Earth from agriculture. Clearing natural lands for food production has enormous impacts on climate and the biodiversity of ecosystems. Halt agricultural expansion by prioritizing maximizing food production on existing productive lands and by focusing on closing yield gaps. Share the other half with nature. Conserve 10 hectares for every 100 hectares of cultivated land by applying conservation practices strategically, for example in order to protect waters or to support beneficial organisms such as pollinators in accessing fields. Plant healthy and sustainable crops. Ensuring that the diets of 10 billion people are both healthy and sustainable will require an increase of the production of fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts by 9% annually and 50\u2013150% by 2050. Pick the right crop for the right spot. In coming decades, the probability risk of hot and dry years will double globally and even triple among certain countries such as India and China. By picking the right crop for the right spot, farmers can select varieties better adapted to changing climates and produce a greater diversity of foods. Reduce and reuse the nutrients. Adopt precision farming techniques that allow for more accurate timing in the application of nutrients and avoid excess application to the soil. Alongside this, take steps to recycle nutrients from cropping systems via cover cropping or conservation tillage and by integrating livestock on the farm where possible. Waste not, want not. Nearly 30% of all food is lost or wasted and up to 50% of fruit and vegetables, with the latter having a particularly important role for human health. Reduce food loss on the farm by practicing good pest and nutrient management. Support farmers\u2019 conservation and public health efforts. Push for greater recognition of farmers\u2019 contributions to conservation and public health through subsidy programs that support rural economies and keep food prices low.

Credit: UNFCCC The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its overarching goal is to hold \u201cthe increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and pursue efforts \u201cto limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\u201d However, in recent years, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of this century. That\u2019s because the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that crossing the 1.5\u00b0C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change impacts, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. To limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations together to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. How does the Paris Agreement work? Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action -- or, ratcheting up -- carried out by countries. Since 2020, countries have been submitting their national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Each successive NDC is meant to reflect an increasingly higher degree of ambition compared to the previous version. Recognizing that accelerated action is required to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the COP27 cover decision requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2023, taking into account different national circumstances. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) In their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in their NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Long-Term Strategies To better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS). LT-LEDS provide the long-term horizon to the NDCs. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory. Nevertheless, they place the NDCs into the context of countries\u2019 long-term planning and development priorities, providing a vision and direction for future development. How are countries supporting one another? The Paris Agreement provides a framework for financial, technical and capacity building support to those countries who need it. Finance The Paris Agreement reaffirms that developed countries should take the lead in providing financial assistance to countries that are less endowed and more vulnerable, while for the first time also encouraging voluntary contributions by other Parties. Climate finance is needed for mitigation, because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions. Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate. Technology The Paris Agreement speaks of the vision of fully realizing technology development and transfer for both improving resilience to climate change and reducing GHG emissions. It establishes a technology framework to provide overarching guidance to the well-functioning Technology Mechanism. The mechanism is accelerating technology development and transfer through its policy and implementation arms. Capacity-Building Not all developing countries have sufficient capacities to deal with many of the challenges brought by climate change. As a result, the Paris Agreement places great emphasis on climate-related capacity-building for developing countries and requests all developed countries to enhance support for capacity-building actions in developing countries. How are we tracking progress? With the Paris Agreement, countries established an enhanced transparency framework (ETF). Under ETF, starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken and progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and support provided or received. It also provides for international procedures for the review of the submitted reports. The information gathered through the ETF will feed into the Global stocktake which will assess the collective progress towards the long-term climate goals. This will lead to recommendations for countries to set more ambitious plans in the next round. What have we achieved so far? Although climate change action needs to be massively increased to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the years since its entry into force have already sparked low-carbon solutions and new markets. More and more countries, regions, cities and companies are establishing carbon neutrality targets. Zero-carbon solutions are becoming competitive across economic sectors representing 25% of emissions. This trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors and has created many new business opportunities for early movers. By 2030, zero-carbon solutions could be competitive in sectors representing over 70% of global emissions.

The food we eat, the ways we produce it, and the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability. Getting it right with food will be an important way for countries to achieve the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. A diet that includes more plant-based foods and fewer animal source foods is healthy, sustainable, and good for both people and planet. It is not a question of all or nothing, but rather small changes for a large and positive impact. Foods sourced from animals, especially red meat, have relatively high environmental footprints per serving compared to other food groups. This has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and biodiversity loss. This is particularly the case for animal source foods from grain fed livestock.

In parallel, the world is also experiencing a rise in overweight and obesity. Today, over 2 billion adults are overweight and obese, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases including diabetes, cancer and heart diseases are among the leading causes of global deaths. Good food can be a powerful driver of change: The EAT-Lancet Commission outlines a planetary health diet, which is flexible and recommends intake levels of various food groups that can be adapted to local geography, culinary traditions and personal preferences. Globally, the planetary health diet favors increasing the consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes alongside small portions of meat and dairy. In parts of the world, this diet involves increasing the access to certain food groups while in other areas, the diet requires a significant reduction in the overconsumption of unhealthier foods. The planetary health diet recommends consuming a range of foods amounting to 2500 kcal per day that will promote health and well-being by reducing risk of overweight, obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Shifting from unhealthy diets to the planetary health diet can prevent 11 million premature adult deaths per year and drive the transition toward a sustainable global food system by 2050 that ensures healthy food for all within planetary boundaries. What can you do? Conduct dietary assessments by: Assessing individual diets as a standard clinical evaluation to address specific nutritional needs according to age, sex, comorbidities and physical activity levels, and with an added sensitivity toward the needs of vulnerable groups. Monitoring changes in individual diet quality over time continuously alongside their nutritional requirements. Provide professional counsel by: Giving individuals and vulnerable groups dietary guidance and by encouraging breastfeeding and providing information on nutritional requirements for maternal and child healthcare. Promoting the planetary health diet while also giving special considerations to vulnerable groups such as expecting mothers, children and adolescents, and individuals suffering from chronic diseases. Support education and training by: Actively partaking in education campaigns in schools and other public services to promote the planetary health diet. Including nutrition and food systems in the medical curricula as main determinants of health along with several training packages to equip health professionals with the knowledge and skills to carry out diet assessments and to provide guidance and counsel on the planetary health diet. Change food procurement practices by: Focusing on sustainably grown food to provide healthy foods and beverages from sustainable food systems to a high standard. Ensuring that food procurement and provision activities also minimize food waste and food loss in healthcare facilities. Drive advocacy efforts by: Promoting this agenda in advocacy surrounding the medical profession and in medical communities including medical associations, unions and colleges. Setting up guidelines based on the planetary health diet that are applicable to local communities and ensuring the implementation of such guidelines. Encouraging and supporting increased collaboration between healthcare professionals such as physicians and dieticians and between actors across different sectors including food, agriculture, environment and health. The Planetary Health Diet Proteins should primarily be sourced from plants where possible, fish or alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids several times per week, and with optional modest consumption of poultry and eggs alongside low intakes of red meat, if any, especially processed meat. At least five servings of fruits and vegetables (500 grams) should be consumed per day excluding potatoes: 200 (100\u2013300) grams of fruits and 300 (200\u2013600) grams of vegetables per day. At least 50 (0\u201375) grams of nuts and 75 (0\u2013100) grams of legumes per day including dry beans, lentils and peas. Aim to limit to no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry and 196 grams of fish per week. Fats should mostly come from unsaturated plant sources with low intakes of saturated fats and no partly hydrogenated oils: 40 (20\u201380) grams of unsaturated oils per day and no more than 11.8 grams of saturated oils per day. Carbohydrates should primarily be sourced from whole grains with low intake of refined grains and less than 5% of energy from sugar. Recommend consuming 232 grams of whole grains per day including rice, wheat and corn and 50 (0\u2013100) grams of tubers or starchy vegetables per day including potatoes and cassava. Moderate levels of dairy consumption is an option: 250 (0\u2013500) grams of dairy per day.

What can you do to eat healthy and sustainable? Choose health, sustainability and deliciousness.Sourcing, buying, cooking and eating healthier and more sustainably produced food is better for our bodies and for the planet. Prepare to increase, diversify and reduce.There is no silver bullet but solving the problem starts with changing what we eat and waste. We should eat more fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and whole grains, and it is also important to eat a variety to ensure that we get all the nutrients we need while also supporting biodiversity in the food system. Many in wealthier countries should also eat less red meat and dairy. Dive into the breadth of options. There is something for everyone across price ranges, cultures, age groups and individual preferences. With more than 30,000 known edible plants, we have a lifetime\u2019s worth of interesting options to taste and explore. Embrace plants as a source of protein. Many plants are both healthy and sustainable sources of dietary protein. Aim to consume at least 125 grams of dry beans, lentils, peas and other nuts or legumes per day. Go easy on meat consumption. While meat is an important source of key nutrients including protein, iron and vitamin B12, excess meat consumption can harm our health and the planet. Aim to consume no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry and 196 grams of fish per week. Approach food in moderation. Consuming too much food can lead to weight gain and other health problems and it is also a challenge for the environment. Taking the time to share meals with family and friends and choosing single serving portions are two simple ways to avoid eating more than we need. Support regenerative farming practices. As livestock are central to sustainable farming, sourcing meat from farmers that practice regenerative agriculture can support the fight against climate change. This type of farming contributes to carbon storage in the soil, keeps water away from pollutants, and provides room for local biodiversity to flourish. Vote with every plate. As markets follow demand, purchase foods that are suitable for our recipes but also good for our health and the planet. Consider making choices that provide additional benefits for human health and the environment, for example by supporting environmentally sustainable and socially responsible farming. Plan the week ahead. Healthy and sustainable eating can be tasty, flexible and dynamic. Plan menus for the coming week to ensure a diversity of delicious dishes and shop according to plan. This will also save time and money and help reduce waste. Bring biodiversity to the table. Bold conservation targets require collaboration between farmers and farming communities to maintain habitats on or around farms and to preserve ecosystems. Purchase foods from farmers and retailers who support biodiversity. Cook more at home. Cooking and preparing food at home provides great opportunities for shared family time. It also allows for recipes to be passed along from generation to generation including their unique stories and tastes. Waste not, want not. Packing leftovers into lunch boxes, using them in new creative recipes or keeping them for future consumption is good for the planet and for your budget. With less food waste, less food needs to be produced to feed the world and the planet can be spared. Similar stories Talks & Videos Can healthy food save the planet?
