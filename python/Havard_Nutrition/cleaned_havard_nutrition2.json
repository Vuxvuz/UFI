They are brimming with antioxidants, flavonoids, and other biologically active substances that may be good for health.\n\n**\n**Coffee**\n\nThe takeaway on coffee: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia.\n\n* Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake.\n* Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight.\n\nBecause of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\n\n**\n**Tea**\n\nThe takeaway on tea: Tea is the simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. Herbal teas are not made from the Camellia plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas.\n\nAnimal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\n\n* However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (130-140° F).\n* Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea.\n\nSo pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Drinks to Consume in Moderation", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation/", "content": "**\n\n**Drinks to Consume in Moderation**\n\n*   **Artificially Sweetened Drinks**\n    *   Research suggests that artificially sweetened drinks may contribute to weight gain.\n    *   Drinking “diet” drinks has the possibility of leading to weight gain due to conditioning you to crave other sweet drinks and foods.\n    *   The health effects of artificially sweetened diet drinks remain largely unknown.\n\n*   **100% Fruit Juice**\n    *   Fruit juice is high in calories from concentrated fruit sugars, so stick to no more than a small glass (four to six ounces) a day.\n    *   Enjoy a whole piece of fruit which is much lower in sugars than its juice equivalent and contains the added benefit of fiber.\n\n*   **Milk**\n    *   There’s no need to drink more than a glass or two of low fat or skim milk a day.\n    *   Less milk is fine if you get your calcium from other sources.\n    *   Milk is a key source of calcium and vitamin D, protein, and other essential micronutrients for children.\n\n*   **Alcohol**\n    *   Moderate drinking can be healthy—but not for everyone.\n    *   You must weigh the benefits and risks; that’s why it’s not included on the Healthy Eating Plate.\n    *   Non-drinkers shouldn’t feel that they need to start drinking.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Sugary Drinks", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/sugary-drinks/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nSugary Drinks\n\n**Overview**\nSugary drinks (also categorized as sugar-sweetened beverages or “soft” drinks) refer to any beverage with added sugar or other sweeteners.

(41,46,52-54,61)\n\n**Reducing Our Preference for Sugary Drinks**\n\nResearch shows that sugary drinks are one of the major determinants of obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence indicates that high consumption of sugary drinks increases the risk for heart disease, the number one killer of men and women in the U.S. Reducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels—from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government.\n\n**Steps to Address Sugary Drinks**\n\nBeverage manufacturers: Create beverages that have much less sugar. A good target: Beverages that have no more than 1 gram of sugar per ounce, and are free of non-caloric sweeteners (such as sucralose, aspartame, or stevia). This is about 70 percent less sugar than a typical soft drink.\n\nIndividuals: Make healthy drinking your personal priority. Start by choosing beverages with few or no calories. Water is best. You can also:\n\n* Ask food companies to make sugar-reduced beverages\n* Ask schools and workplaces to offer filtered water or functioning water fountains\n* Ask your local stores, schools, and workplaces to carry 8-ounce or 12-ounce containers of sugary drinks\n\nFood shoppers for the family: Don’t stock sugary drinks at home. Nationwide data show that children and teens drink most of their sugary calories at home, so parents can help kids cut back by not stocking soda, fruit punch, or other sugary drinks in the house.\n\nSchools and workplaces: Offer students and workers several healthy beverage choices. Healthy choices for school and workplaces include water and reduced-sugar beverages, as well as single-serving or 12-ounce containers.\n\nGovernment: Require better labeling on sugary drinks, and scrap sugar subsidies. The FDA should consider requiring companies to list the number of calories per bottle or can—not per serving—on the front of beverage containers.\n\n**Bans on Sugary Drinks**\n\nNew York City In June of 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a ban on drinks sweetened with sugar that contain more than 25 calories per 8 fluid ounces. The ban would impact “super-sized” sodas larger than 16 ounces.\n\nBoston In a move to trim Boston’s rising obesity rates, Mayor Thomas Menino banned the sale and advertising of sugary drinks from city-owned buildings and city-sponsored events. The executive order, signed in 2011, calls for city departments to phase out regular sodas, sports drinks, and other high-sugar beverages.\n\nCleveland Clinic banned high sugar drinks from its vending machines and cafeterias in August 2010. San Francisco, Los Angeles County, and other cities have also curtailed sugary drink sales on municipal property.\n\n**References**\n\n41. Vartanian LR, Schwartz MB, Brownell KD.

A committee appointed by the Institute of Medicine recommended that the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate the amount of salt in commercially prepared food.\n\nThe IOM is not recommending a ban on salt—it is, after all, an essential part of the human diet – nor immediate changes. What the IOM report calls for is a gradual reduction in salt that would make the changes imperceptible to consumers’ palates.

Industry cutbacks in salt will help lower everyone’s sodium intake, but consumers also need to do their part by choosing healthful foods.\n\n**International Initiatives**\n\nFinland and the United Kingdom have led successful sodium reduction efforts. In Finland, a government-led program of education, salt-labeling legislation, and pressure on the food industry has led to a 30 percent reduction in salt intake, from 12,000 milligrams a day to around 9,000 milligrams today.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a partnership between a scientific action group called Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH) and the U.K. Department of Health has led to a 20 to 30 percent reduction in the salt content of processed foods bought in supermarkets.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Carbohydrates", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/", "content": "**\n\n**Carbohydrates: Quality Matters**\n\nWhat’s most important is the type of carbohydrate you choose to eat because some sources are healthier than others.

For example, healthy, whole grains such as whole wheat bread, rye, barley and quinoa are better choices than highly refined white bread or French fries.\n\nMany people are confused about carbohydrates, but keep in mind that it’s more important to eat carbohydrates from healthy foods than to follow a strict diet limiting or counting the number of grams of carbohydrates consumed.\n\n**What are Carbohydrates?**\n\nCarbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods—bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches.\n\nFoods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity.\n\n**The Healthiest Sources of Carbohydrates**\n\nThe healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans—promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients. Unhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.\n\n**Adding Healthy Carbohydrates to Your Diet**\n\n1.  Start the day with whole grains. Try a hot cereal, like steel cut or old fashioned oats (not instant oatmeal), or a cold cereal that lists a whole grain first on the ingredient list and is low in sugar.\n2.  Use whole grain breads for lunch or snacks. Confused about how to find a whole-grain bread? Look for bread that lists as the first ingredient whole wheat, whole rye, or some other whole grain —and even better, one that is made with only whole grains, such as 100 percent whole wheat bread.\n3.  Also look beyond the bread aisle. Whole wheat bread is often made with finely ground flour, and bread products are often high in sodium. Instead of bread, try a whole grain in salad form such as brown rice or quinoa.\n4.  Choose whole fruit instead of juice. An orange has two times as much fiber and half as much sugar as a 12-ounce glass of orange juice.\n5.  Pass on potatoes, and instead bring on the beans. Rather than fill up on potatoes – which have been found to promote weight gain – choose beans for an excellent source of slowly digested carbohydrates.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that prompts cells to absorb blood sugar for energy or storage. As cells absorb blood sugar, levels in the bloodstream begin to fall. When this happens, the pancreas start making glucagon, a hormone that signals the liver to start releasing stored sugar.\n\nCarbohydrate metabolism is important in the development of type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body can’t make enough insulin or can’t properly use the insulin it makes.\n\n**Glycemic Index**\n\nIn the past, carbohydrates were commonly classified as being either “simple” or “complex,” and described as follows:\n\nSimple carbohydrates: These carbohydrates are composed of sugars (such as fructose and glucose) which have simple chemical structures composed of only one sugar (monosaccharides) or two sugars (disaccharides). Simple carbohydrates are easily and quickly utilized for energy by the body because of their simple chemical structure, often leading to a faster rise in blood sugar and insulin secretion from the pancreas – which can have negative health effects.\n\nComplex carbohydrates: These carbohydrates have more complex chemical structures, with three or more sugars linked together (known as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides). Many complex carbohydrate foods contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, and they take longer to digest – which means they have less of an immediate impact on blood sugar, causing it to rise more slowly.\n\nBut other so called complex carbohydrate foods such as white bread and white potatoes contain mostly starch but little fiber or other beneficial nutrients. Dividing carbohydrates into simple and complex, however, does not account for the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar and chronic diseases.\n\nTo explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the glycemic index was developed and is considered a better way of categorizing carbohydrates, especially starchy foods.\n\n**Glycemic Load**\n\nOne thing that a food’s glycemic index does not tell us is how much digestible carbohydrate – the total amount of carbohydrates excluding fiber – it delivers. That’s why researchers developed a related way to classify foods that takes into account both the amount of carbohydrate in the food in relation to its impact on blood sugar levels.\n\nThis measure is called the glycemic load. A food’s glycemic load is determined by multiplying its glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate the food contains. In general, a glycemic load of 20 or more is high, 11 to 19 is medium, and 10 or under is low.\n\n**Choosing Low-Glycemic Foods**\n\nFor good health, choose foods that have a low or medium glycemic load, and limit foods that have a high glycemic load. Here are some examples:\n\n*   **Low Glycemic Load (10 or under)**\n    *   Bran cereals\n    *   Apple\n    *   Orange\n    *   Kidney beans\n    *   Black beans\n    *   Lentils\n    *   Wheat tortilla\n    *   Skim milk\n    *   Cashews\n    *   Peanuts\n    *   Carrots\n\n*   **Medium Glycemic Load (11-19)**\n    *   Pearled barley: 1 cup cooked\n    *   Brown rice: 3/4 cup cooked\n    *   Oatmeal: 1 cup cooked\n    *   Bulgur: 3/4 cup cooked\n    *   Rice cakes: 3 cakes\n    *   Whole grain breads: 1 slice\n    *   Whole-grain pasta: 1 1/4 cup cooked\n\n*   **High Glycemic Load (20+)**\n    *   Baked potato\n    *   French fries\n    *   Refined breakfast cereal: 1 oz\n    *   Sugar-sweetened beverages: 12 oz\n    *   Candy bars: 1 2-oz bar or 3 mini bars\n    *   Couscous: 1 cup cooked\n    *   White basmati rice: 1 cup cooked\n    *   White-flour pasta: 1 1/4 cup cooked", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Sustainability", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sustainability/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nSustainability\n\n**Overview**\nSustainability is a multifaceted issue in which the food production system and our diets play a crucial role.

Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested.\n\n* Children and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day.\n* Great sources are whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts.\n\n**Types of Fiber**\n\nFiber comes in two varieties, both beneficial to health:\n\n* Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, chia seeds, nuts, beans, lentils, apples, and blueberries.\n* Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include whole wheat products (especially wheat bran), quinoa, brown rice, legumes, leafy greens like kale, almonds, walnuts, seeds, and fruits with edible skins like pears and apples.\n\n**Further Defining Fiber**\n\nUnder the umbrella terms of insoluble and soluble fibers, you may see fiber described in other ways. It can be viscous with a gel-like quality, or fermentable because it acts as food for gut bacteria that break down and ferment it.\n\n* Fibers that are not broken down by bacteria, called nonfermentable, travel intact to the colon and can add bulk and weight to stool so it is easier to pass.\n* These properties offer health benefits such as slowing down digestion, delaying blood sugar rises after meals, promoting healthy colonies of bacteria, or having a laxative effect.\n\n**Naturally Occurring Plant Fibers**\n\nSome types of fiber fall into both categories:\n\n* Cellulose, hemicellulose – Insoluble fiber found in cereal grains and the cell walls of many fruits and vegetables. It absorbs water and adds bulk to stool, which can have a laxative effect.\n* Lignins – Insoluble fiber found in wheat and corn bran, nuts, flaxseeds, vegetables, and unripe bananas that triggers mucus secretion in the colon and adds bulk to stools. Has laxative effect.\n* Beta-glucans – Soluble highly fermentable fiber found in oats and barley that is metabolized and fermented in the small intestine. Acts as a prebiotic. Can add bulk to stool but does not have a laxative effect. May help to normalize blood glucose and cholesterol levels.\n\n**Manufactured Functional Fibers**\n\nSome types of fiber fall into both categories:\n\n* Psyllium – Soluble viscous nonfermentable fiber extracted from psyllium seeds that holds onto water and softens and bulks stools. Has laxative effect and is an ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives and high-fiber cereals.\n* Polydextrose and polyols – Soluble fiber made of glucose and sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. It can increase stool bulk and have a mild laxative effect.\n\n**Fiber and Disease**\n\nFiber appears to lower the risk of developing various conditions:\n\n* Heart disease\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Breast cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Constipation\n* Diverticular disease", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Added Sugar", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/", "content": "**Added Sugar**\n\nThe body doesn’t need to get any carbohydrate from added sugar. That’s why the Healthy Eating Pyramid says sugary drinks and sweets should be used sparingly, if at all, and the Healthy Eating Plate does not include foods with added sugars.\n\n* 4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoon\n* Keep this tip in mind when reading nutrition labels to better visualize just how much added sugar the product contains. For example, one 12-ounce can of cola contains 39 grams–almost 10 teaspoons of sugar!\n\nThe average American adult, teenager, and child consumes about 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, or about 270 calories.\n\nWhile we sometimes add sugar or sweeteners like honey to food or beverages, most added sugar comes from processed and prepared foods. The leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks like ice cream, pastries, and cookies.\n\nLess obvious yet significant contributors are breakfast cereals and yogurt.\n\n* The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 advise that all Americans 2 years and older limit added sugars in the diet to less than 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie day diet, that translates into 200 calories or 50 grams of sugar daily (about 12 teaspoons of sugar).\n* Toddlers and infants younger than 2 years should not be given solids or beverages with any added sugars.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that Americans drastically cut back on added sugar to help slow the obesity and heart disease epidemics. The AHA suggests a stricter added-sugar limit of no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) for most adult women and no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar) for most men.\n\n* For children ages 2-18, the AHA recommends a lower daily limit of added sugars to less than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams per day.\n* Sugary beverages should be limited to no more than 8 ounces a week.\n\n**Spotting Sugar on a Food Label**\n\nThe updated Nutrition Facts label now lists both “Total Sugars” and underneath “Added Sugars.” The percent Daily Value (DV) for added sugars is based on the recommended limit from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans of less than 50 grams a day (about 12 teaspoons) for an average 2,000 calorie diet.\n\n* A lower amount for a lower-calorie diet, and higher for a higher-calorie diet.\n* The DV can be an easy way to compare food products for added sugars: 5% DV or less of added sugars per serving is considered low\n* 20% DV or more of added sugars per serving is considered high\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nAdded sugars go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories. Food makers can also use sweeteners that aren’t technically sugar—a term which is applied only to table sugar, or sucrose—but these other sweeteners are in fact forms of added sugar.\n\n* Some other names for sugar that you may see on food labels:\n\t+ Agave nectar\n\t+ Dextrose\n\t+ Maltose\n\t+ Brown sugar\n\t+ Evaporated cane juice\n\t+ Malt syrup\n\t+ Cane crystals\n\t+ Fructose\n\t+ Maple syrup\n\t+ Cane sugar\n\t+ Fruit juice concentrates\n\t+ Molasses\n\t+ Coconut sugar\n\t+ Glucose\n\t+ Raw sugar\n\t+ Corn sweetener\n\t+ High-fructose corn syrup\n\t+ Sucrose\n\t+ Corn syrup\n\t+ Honey\n\t+ Syrup\n\t+ Crystalline fructose\n\t+ Invert sugar\n\n**Sugary Drinks**\n\nSugary drinks are a prime source of extra calories that can contribute to weight gain and provide no nutritional benefits. Studies indicate that liquid carbohydrates such as sugar-sweetened beverages are less filling than solid food, causing people to continue to feel hungry after drinking them despite their high calories.\n\n* The average 20-ounce bottle of sugar-sweetened soda, lemonade, or iced tea contains about 65 grams of added sugar, often from high-fructose corn syrup.\n* That’s the equivalent of 16 teaspoons of table sugar. If you were to drink just one 12-ounce can of a sugar-sweetened soft drink every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 15 pounds over three years.\n\n**Cereals and Other Foods**\n\nChoosing minimally processed breakfast foods—such as whole grain toast with nut butter, or a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned oatmeal—that don’t have lengthy ingredient lists is a great way to avoid added sugars. Unfortunately, many common breakfast foods such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, cereal bars, instant oatmeal with added flavoring, and pastries can contain high amounts of added sugars.\n\n* Some ingredient lists mask the amount of sugar in a product.\n* To avoid having “sugar” as the first ingredient, food manufacturers may use multiple forms of sugar—each with a different name—and list each one individually on the nutrient label. But don’t be fooled; your body metabolizes all added sugars the same way as it doesn’t distinguish between “brown sugar,” “molasses,” “honey,” and other caloric sweeteners.\n\n**Reducing Added Sugar Intake**\n\n* Choose plain yogurt with no added sugar and stir in fresh or frozen fruit or unsweetened applesauce and a dash of cinnamon.\n* Choose cereals with 5% of the Daily Value or less of added sugars and add sliced ripe banana or berries.\n* Choose water, seltzer, herbal tea, coffee and other beverages with no added sugar. Add a slice of orange, lemon, lime, or cucumber for a subtle flavor boost.\n\nWhen a sweets craving hits, try one of these first:\n\n* 1/4 cup of unsweetened dried fruit\n* 1 cup of ripe fresh fruit\n* or a 1-ounce square of 75% dark chocolate\n\nWhen baking, reduce the amount of added sugar by 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Or reduce the sugar by substituting half the amount with unsweetened applesauce or mashed ripe banana; for example, instead of 1 cup of sugar, use ½ cup sugar and ½ cup mashed fruit.\n\nIf you choose to enjoy a favorite treat high in sugar, practice eating a smaller portion than usual. Enjoy it fully by chewing slowly and savoring it. Your taste buds can adjust to sweetness levels!\n\nAs you consistently reduce your total sugar intake, you may notice your sweets cravings lessen or that certain foods now taste too sweet.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Body Fat", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/measuring-fat/", "content": "**\n\n**Types of Body Fat**\n\nFat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. Some are necessary for good health.\n\n*   Brown fat – Infants carry the most brown fat, which keeps them warm.\n*   White fat – These large round cells are the most abundant type and are designed for fat storage, accumulating in the belly, thighs, and hips.\n*   Beige fat – This type of white fat can be converted to perform similar traits as brown fat, such as being able to generate heat with exposure to cold temperatures or during exercise.\n*   Pink fat – This type of white fat is converted to pink during pregnancy and lactation, producing and secreting breast milk.\n*   Essential fat – This type may be made up of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally.\n\n**Location**\n\nSubcutaneous – You can pinch this layer of fat that sits directly underneath the skin’s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It’s the body’s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs.\n\nVisceral – An excess of this type of white fat is sometimes referred to as “belly fat” or “central obesity,” as it accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart.\n\n**How to Get Rid of Belly Fat**\n\nLosing weight can help reduce dangerous visceral fat. A long-term commitment to following exercise guidelines along with eating balanced portion-controlled meals can help to reduce belly fat. Avoiding sugary beverages that are strongly associated with excessive weight gain in children and adults is also effective.\n\n**Measuring Body Fat**\n\nObesity, or body fatness, is calculated with various methods that range in accuracy and have limitations. Combining two or more methods may better predict if someone has increased health risks related to weight.\n\n*   **Body Mass Index (BMI)**\n    *   BMI only measures excess weight, calculating a ratio of one’s weight to height.\n    *   It can’t measure location of fat, muscle mass, or bone mass—all of which contribute to weight.\n    *   One’s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI.\n\n**Interpreting the BMI Number**\n\nThe World Health Organization defines a “normal” weight as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, “overweight or pre-obesity” as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, and “obesity” as a BMI of 30 or higher.\n\n**Waist Circumference**\n\nSome researchers consider waist circumference to be a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance.\n\n*   An increasing waist size can be an important “warning sign” that prompts a closer look at potentially unhealthy lifestyle habits.\n*   The Nurses’ Health Study looked at the relationship between waist size and death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause in middle-aged women. Women who reported the highest waist sizes—35 inches or larger—had nearly double the risk of dying from heart disease, compared with women who reported the lowest waist sizes (<28 inches).\n\n**Waist-to-Hip Ratio**\n\nThe waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is used to measure abdominal obesity.\n\n*   It’s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement.\n*   The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity. For example, Asians appear to show higher metabolic risk when carrying higher body fat at a lower BMI; therefore the cut-off value for a healthy WHR in Asian women is 0.80 or less, compared with 0.85 or less in Caucasian women.\n\n**Waist-to-Height Ratio**\n\nThe waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a simple, inexpensive screening tool that measures visceral abdominal fat.\n\n*   It has been supported by research to predict cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, and early death, even when BMI falls within a healthy range.\n*   When the waist circumference is less than half one’s height, it is considered lower risk. To determine WHtR, divide waist circumference in inches by height in inches.\n\n**Additional Measures of Body Fat**\n\nAlthough less commonly used, here are some other methods for measuring body fat:\n\n*   Skinfold Thickness\n*   Bioelectric Impedance (BIA)\n*   Underwater Weighing (Densitometry or Hydrostatic Weighing)\n*   Air-Displacement Plethysmography\n*   Dilution Method (Hydrometry)\n*   Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)\n*   Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n\n**Is it Healthier to Carry Excess Weight than Being Too Thin?**\n\nIt’s certainly possible to be dangerously thin. Individuals with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia—and those with wasting diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and heart failure—can lose so much weight that they don’t have enough energy or basic building blocks to keep themselves alive.\n\nSome studies suggest that the connection between body mass index and premature death follows a U-shaped curve. This means that weighing too much—or too little—isn’t as healthy as weighing somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe problem is that most of these studies included smokers and individuals with early, but undetected, chronic and fatal diseases. Cigarette smokers as a group weigh less than nonsmokers, in part because smoking deadens the appetite. Potentially deadly chronic diseases such as cancer, emphysema, kidney failure, and heart failure can cause weight loss even before they cause symptoms and have been diagnosed.\n\nSo low weights don’t necessarily cause early death. Instead, low weight is often the result of illnesses or habits that may be fatal.\n\nMany epidemiologic studies confirm that increasing weight is associated with increasing disease risk.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Healthy Weight", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/", "content": "**What Is a Healthy Weight?**\n\nA healthy weight is associated with a low risk of weight-related diseases and health issues.

Reasons include losses from mold, pests, or inadequate climate control; losses from cooking; and intentional food waste. [1]\n\nThis waste is categorized differently based on where it occurs: Food “loss” occurs before the food reaches the consumer as a result of issues in the production, storage, processing, and distribution phases. Food “waste” refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases.\n\nWasted food has far-reaching effects, both nationally and globally. In the U.S., up to 40% of all food produced goes uneaten [2], and about 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills [3]. It is the largest component of municipal solid waste at 21%. [1] In 2014, more than 38 million tons of food waste was generated, with only 5% diverted from landfills and incinerators for composting. [3] Decomposing food waste produces methane, a strong greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Worldwide, one-third of food produced is thrown away uneaten, causing an increased burden on the environment. [4]\n\nIt is estimated that reducing food waste by 15% could feed more than 25 million Americans every year. [5] Benefits of Less Food Waste\n\n*   Cost savings on labor through more efficient handling, preparation, and storage of food that will be used.\n*   Cost savings when purchasing only as much food as needed, and avoiding additional costs of disposal.\n*   Reduced methane emissions from landfills and a lower carbon footprint.\n*   Better management of energy and resources, preventing pollution involved in the growing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling of food.\n*   Community benefits by providing donated, untouched, and safe food that would otherwise be thrown out. [6]\n\nProposed Solutions to Food Waste\n\nGlobally, reducing wasted food has been cited as a key initiative in achieving a sustainable food future. Sustainable Development Goal 12 addresses responsible consumption and production, which includes two indicators to measure (in order to ultimately reduce) global food loss and food waste. [7] In the U.S, on June 4, 2013, the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, calling on entities across the food chain, including farms, agricultural processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, universities, schools, and local governments.\n\nThe goals are to:\n\n*   Reduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.\n*   Recover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger relief organizations like food banks and pantries.\n*   Recycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy, and natural fertilizers.\n\nOn September 16, 2015, both agencies also announced for the first time a national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 to improve overall food security and conserve natural resources. The National Resources Defense Council issued a summary paper providing guidelines on how to reduce waste throughout the food production chain.\n\nThe following are some focal points:\n\n*   State and local governments can incorporate food waste prevention and education campaigns, and implement municipal composting programs.\n*   Governments can provide tax credits to farmers who donate excess produce to local food banks. Proposed bills are currently in place in California, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado.\n*   Businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services can evaluate the extent of their food waste and adopt best practices.\n*   Examples include supermarkets selling damaged or nearly expired produce at discounted prices, or offering “half-off” promotions instead of “buy-one-get-one-free” promotions.\n*   Restaurants can offer smaller portions and donate excess ingredients and prepared uneaten food to charities.\n*   Schools may experiment with concepts that allow children to create their own meals to prevent less discarded food, such as with salad bars or build-your-own burritos.\n*   Farms can evaluate food losses during processing, distribution, and storage and adopt best practices.\n*   Farmers markets can sell “ugly” produce, which are discarded, misshapen fruits and vegetables that do not meet the usual standards for appearance.\n*   Farms can sell fresh but unmarketable produce (due to appearance) to food banks at a reduced rate.\n*   Consumers can learn when food is no longer safe and edible, how to cook and store food properly, and how to compost.

Shifting towards a “planetary health diet” can nurture both people and planet.\n\n**Recommendations**\nTo implement this dietary pattern over the course of a week, here are four key approaches to cutting back red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful:\n\n*   Scramble eggs into a stir-fry serving for multiple people\n*   Save daily amounts for one day during the week (e.g. eating one whole hamburger patty)\n*   Aim to consume no more than 98 grams of red meat, 203 grams of poultry, and 196 grams of fish per week\n*   Replace red meat with plant-based protein foods\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\nA planetary health plate consists of:\n\n*   Half filled with fruits and vegetables (starchy vegetables, like potatoes, are limited)\n*   The other half consisting of primarily whole grains and plant-based protein foods, with unsaturated oils and modest amounts of animal-based protein foods", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Healthy Dietary Styles", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/healthy-dietary-styles/", "content": "**Healthy Dietary Styles**\n\nWhile current research comparing diets of differing macronutrient ratios may not point to one “perfect” diet, there is compelling research about certain dietary styles, including the Mediterranean diet, that offers strong guidance.

Check out our tips for how to reach a winning weight.\n\n**Low-Fat Fails**\n\nWhile low-fat was once the diet du jour, subsequent research has shown that low-fat diets are ineffective, and moreover, that eating healthy fats is beneficial for health. In the United States, obesity has become increasingly common even as the percentage of fat in the American diet has declined from 45 percent in the 1960s to about 33 percent in the late 1990s. So, cutting fat is not shrinking waistlines.\n\n**Low-Carbohydrate and Mediterranean Diets Can Be Effective**\n\nWhile many “diets” are fads meant to be followed for short periods of time, research shows that some approaches, including some low-carbohydrate diets and Mediterranean diets can be good models upon which to base your own dietary strategy as long as they incorporate healthy, high-quality foods. One study comparing a low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and Mediterranean diet followed over 300 people for a 2-year period and found that diets composed of different foods can lead to different weight loss outcomes.\n\n**What Exactly is a “Mediterranean” Diet?**\n\nThere isn’t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes into account the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern.\n\n**Conclusion: The Best Diet**\n\nThe best diet incorporates high-quality foods in appropriate portions; there isn’t one “perfect” diet for everyone.

So how to differentiate what “works” from an overhyped fad? It’s important to remember that even if a particular diet may be successful for one person, it may not be effective for another due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle.\n\n**What Works**\n\nWhile research shows that calories matter, focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss. Diets are also more likely to be successful when they are easier to follow, so tailoring a strategy to suit your own lifestyle is key.\n\n**Popular Diets**\n\nAn anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body.

Research strongly supports its benefits across a range of physical and mental health conditions for people of all ages.\n\n \n\n**Types of Exercise**\n\nAll types of exercises offer health benefits. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further. But it is important to remember that some exercise is better than none, and that most everyone can participate in some form of exercise safely.\n\n*   Aerobic Cardiovascular physical activity: These are activities that are intense enough and performed long enough to maintain or improve one’s heart and lung fitness.\n    *   Examples: walking, jogging, dancing, bicycling, basketball, soccer, swimming\n*   Muscle-strengthening activity: This may be referred to as resistance training. These activities maintain or increase muscle strength, endurance, and power.\n    *   Examples: weight machines, free weights, resistance elastic bands, Pilates, daily activities of living (lifting children, carrying groceries or laundry, climbing stairs)\n*   Flexibility training: This may be referred to as stretching. It lengthens or flexes a skeletal muscle to the point of tension, and holds for several seconds to increase elasticity and range of motion around a joint.\n    *   Improving flexibility can enhance the overall physical performance of other types of exercise.\n    *   Examples: dynamic stretches performed with movement (yoga, tai chi), static stretches without movement (holding a pose for several seconds or longer), passive stretching (using an external force like a strap or wall to hold an elongated pose), and active stretching (holding a pose without an external force)\n*   Balance training: These activities are intended to throw off one’s balance to improve body control and stability.\n    *   They can help to prevent falls and other injuries.\n    *   Examples: standing on one foot, walking heel-to-toe in a perfectly straight line, standing on a balance or wobble board\n\n \n\n**Measures of Exercise Intensity**\n\nAlthough just moving more and sitting less offers health benefits, how much energy you use while exercising can increase those health benefits further. This is referred to as energy intensity.\n\n*   Borg Scale: The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion measures your exercise intensity by rating how you feel.\n    *   It is based on observations like higher heart rate, heavier and faster breathing, increased sweating, and muscles feeling tired.\n    *   It does not use actual measurements of these occurrences but a personal self-check.\n    *   The scale uses numbers from 6 to 20. The lowest rating is “no feeling of exertion,” at number 6, and the highest rating is “very, very hard,” at number 20.\n*   Target heart rate: Calculating your heart rate and target heart rate can be used to measure exercise intensity.\n    *   First determine your maximum heart rate: subtract your age from 220 (example: the maximum heart rate for a 40-year-old person would be 220 – 40 = 180 beats per minute).\n    *   The target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise is between 65-75% of your maximum heart rate (or 77-93% of maximum heart rate for vigorous exercise).\n\n \n\n**Physical Activity Through the Life Course**\n\nIn the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services provides specific guidelines for physical activity for different life stages and conditions:\n\n*   Children ages 3 through 5: Try to be physically active throughout the day. Adult caregivers should encourage children this age to engage in active playing for at least 3 hours daily.\n*   Children and adolescents ages 6 through 17: At least 1 hour daily of moderate-to-vigorous activity with both aerobic and strength movements.\n*   Adults: Move more frequently throughout the day and sit less. Engage in at least 150 to 300 minutes weekly (spaced throughout the week) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and at least 2 days weekly of muscle-strengthening exercises.\n*   Older adults: Follow similar activity guidelines as those for adults but also include a focus on balance training.\n\n \n\n**Wearable Trackers for Physical Activity**\n\nIf you are health-conscious, chances are you like seeing data that reveals information on how you are doing. Pedometers, heart rate monitors, and sleep trackers can all analyze what goes on inside our bodies.\n\n*   Most of these devices are combined with a smartphone or computer app that provide tracking tools to better manage personal health.\n*   Trackers can motivate people to change behavior, whether this means getting up and moving more, going to bed earlier, or advancing an exercise routine to challenge the heart.\n\n \n\n**Exercise Safety**\n\nSafety should be a major priority when exercising. Any physical activity carries the risk of injury, whether you are just starting an exercise regimen or are a seasoned fitness buff.\n\n*   Common workout injuries include:\n    *   Strained or pulled muscles\n    *   Ankle sprain\n    *   Knee strain\n    *   Inflamed tendons or ligaments\n    *   Rotator cuff (shoulder) injury\n    *   Overuse injuries caused by repetitive movements using mainly one part of the body\n\n \n\n**How to Get Started Safely**\n\nIf you have a chronic health condition or are pregnant, let your doctor know of your desire to start exercising. If you are sedentary, start with activities that are lower impact and require a light-to-moderate effort.\n\n*   Progress gradually—it’s especially important to “start low and go slow.”\n*   Protect yourself: Choose the right equipment, find a safe place to work out, pay attention to the weather, stay hydrated with water, choose healthy “fuel,” be wary of supplement claims, listen to your body.\n\n \n\n**10 Tips to Keep Moving**\n\n1.  Plan exercise into your day.\n2.  Intention is an important first step. Set aside a specific time in your schedule to exercise and write it in your planner.\n3.  Accountability helps. If your motivation is lagging, connect with a friend or family member with a similar goal to move more.\n4.  Try counting steps. Step-counters or pedometers are an easy, inexpensive way to remind yourself to move.\n5.  Working up to 10,000 steps per day can be a good general goal.\n6.  If that seems too intimidating, measure your steps on an average day and increase by 1000 steps every two weeks.\n7.  Keep it brisk. When you walk, make it brisk, since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace.\n8.  What is brisk enough? Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late.\n9.  Turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone. Chances are that if you turn off these devices for an hour or two, you will automatically move more and curb your “sit time.”\n10. Fill the time by doing household chores, running errands, playing with the kids, or taking a stroll around your neighborhood.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Active Communities", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/staying-active/active-communities/", "content": "**\n\n**Active Communities**\n\nPeople living in neighborhoods with parks, playgrounds, sidewalks, or bike paths are more likely to be active. Those who live in areas without recreation facilities or sprawling suburbs designed for driving tend to be less active.

Both acute and chronic stressors cause the “fight-or-flight” response.\n\nA very small region at the base of the brain, called the hypothalamus, sets off the reaction and communicates with the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This system regulates involuntary responses like blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and digestion. The ANS signals nerves and the hormone corticotropin to alert the adrenal glands, located on the top of each kidney, to release a hormone called adrenaline into the blood.\n\nAdrenaline quickens the heart rate and increases blood pressure so more blood circulates to the muscles and heart to support a boost of energy. More oxygen in the blood is available to the heart, lungs, and brain to accommodate faster breathing and heightened alertness. If stress continues, the adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, which stimulates the release of glucose into the blood and increases the brain’s use of glucose for energy.\n\nIt also turns off certain systems in the body to allow the body to focus on the stress response. These systems include digestion, reproduction, and growth. These hormones do not return to normal levels until the stress passes. If the stress does not pass, the nervous system continues to trigger physical reactions that can eventually lead to inflammation and damage to cells.\n\nWith acute stress, the event is brief and hormone levels will gradually return to normal. Acute episodic and chronic stress repeatedly trigger the fight-or-flight response causing a persistent elevation of hormones, leading to a risk of health problems:\n\n* Digestive issues (heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation)\n* Weight gain\n* Elevated blood pressure\n* Chest pain, heart disease\n* Immune system problems\n* Skin conditions\n* Muscular pain (headaches, back pain, neck pain)\n* Sleep disruption, insomnia\n* Infertility\n* Anxiety, depression\n\nChronic stress can affect the body’s use of calories and nutrients in various ways. It raises the body’s metabolic needs and increases the use and excretion of many nutrients. If one does not eat a nutritious diet, a deficiency may occur.\n\nStress also creates a chain reaction of behaviors that can negatively affect eating habits, leading to other health problems down the road. Stress places a greater demand on the body for oxygen, energy, and nutrients. Yet people who experience chronic stress may crave comforting foods such as highly processed snacks or sweets, which are high in fat and calories but low in nutrients.\n\nPeople feeling stress may lack the time or motivation to prepare nutritious, balanced meals, or may skip or forget to eat meals. Stress can disrupt sleep by causing lighter sleep or more frequent awakenings, which leads to fatigue during the day. In order to cope with daytime fatigue, people may use stimulants to increase energy such as with caffeine or high-calorie snack foods.\n\nThe reverse may also be true that poor-quality sleep is itself a stressor. Studies have found that sleep restriction causes a significant increase in cortisol levels. During acute stress, the hormone adrenaline suppresses the appetite. But with chronic stress, elevated levels of cortisol may cause cravings, particularly for foods high in sugar, fat, and calories, which may then lead to weight gain.\n\nCortisol favors the accumulation of fat in the belly area, also called central adiposity, which is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain breast cancers. It also lowers levels of the hormone leptin (that promotes satiety) while increasing the hormone ghrelin (that increases appetite).\n\n**Tips to Help Control Stress**\n\n* Healthy diet: A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and the repair of damaged cells.\n* Mindful eating: When we “stress-eat,” we eat quickly without noticing what or how much we’re eating, which can lead to weight gain. Mindful eating practices counteract stress by encouraging deep breaths, making thoughtful food choices, focusing attention on the meal, and chewing food slowly and thoroughly.\n* Regular exercise: Physical activity will help to lower blood pressure and stress hormone levels.\n* Meditation or deep breathing techniques: Fast, shallow breathing and erratic thoughts occur in response to stress. Therefore, take slow deep breaths to reduce muscular tension, lower the heart rate, and calm the mind.\n* Mental health counseling or other social support: Feeling alone can add to stress. It can help to talk through feelings and concerns with a trusted individual.\n* Practicing work-life balance: Use vacation and personal time, or just set aside an hour a day. A periodic escape from the pressures of work can do wonders to reduce stress, increase productivity, and decrease the risk of physical and mental illnesses that are associated with workplace burnout.\n* Good sleep hygiene: Stress can cause a heightened sense of alertness, which delays the onset of sleep as well as cause interrupted sleep throughout the night. This can prevent one from entering the deeper sleep stages in which the body repairs and grows tissue and supports a healthy immune system.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Sleep", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sleep/", "content": "**Sleep**\n\n \n\n**What Happens When We Sleep?**\n\nOur internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime.\n\n \n\n**Phases of Sleep**\n\nThere are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles.\n\n \n\n**Hormones that Regulate Sleep Cycles**\n\nThere are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness. GABA is a neurotransmitter that decreases nerve cell activity, playing a major role in allowing the body to sleep.\n\n \n\n**Immediate Effects of Sleep Deprivation**\n\nAbout one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems.\n\n \n\n**Sleep Deficiency and Disease Risk**\n\nIf you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.\n\n \n\n**Medical Conditions that Interfere with Sleep**\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA)—Symptoms of OSA include snoring or gasping for air that causes interruptions in sleep and prevention of good-quality sleep. Sleep apnea also causes oxygen levels to drop during sleep, which can pose a stress on the heart, brain and other organs.\n\n \n\n**How Much Sleep Do We Need?**\n\nSleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps.\n\n \n\n**What about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep?**\n\nHerbal supplements Two popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness.\n\n \n\n**Sleep Hygiene Tips**\n\nSet a sleep schedule and stick to it. Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same times, even on weekends. This helps to regulate the body’s sleep cycles and circadian rhythms. Try to exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training or HIIT) one hour before bedtime.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Healthy Longevity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-longevity/", "content": "**\n\n**Healthy Longevity**\n\nFive Key Lifestyle Factors\n\nResearchers from Harvard University looked at factors that might increase the chances of a longer life. Using data collected from men and women from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were followed for up to 34 years, researchers identified five low-risk lifestyle factors:\n\n*   Healthy diet\n*   Regular exercise (at least 30 minutes daily of moderate to vigorous activity)\n*   Healthy weight (as defined by a body mass index of 18.5-24.9)\n*   No smoking\n*   Moderate alcohol intake (up to 1 drink daily for women, and up to 2 daily for men)\n\nCompared with those who did not incorporate any of these lifestyle factors, those with all five factors lived up to 14 years longer.\n\n**Five Factors for a Longer and Healthier Lifespan**\n\n*   Healthy diet – Eating patterns such as those from the DASH, MIND, and Mediterranean diets can lower the risk of chronic conditions that accompany older ages.\n*   Regular exercise – Regular physical activity lowers the risk of several chronic conditions that increase with age including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and cognitive decline.\n*   Healthy weight – Determining one’s healthy weight range is unique for each person. Factors to consider include reviewing current health conditions, family history, weight history, and genetically inherited body type.\n*   Not smoking – Smoking is a strong risk factor for cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, and earlier death as it promotes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (a condition that can damage cells and tissues).\n*   Moderate alcohol – Research finds that moderate drinking, defined as 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and early death from cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Additional Factors for Healthy Longevity**\n\nBeyond the five core lifestyle habits mentioned above, a growing body of research is identifying additional factors that may be key to increasing our healthspans:\n\n*   Having life purpose meaning. Research shows that having a sense of meaning or purpose in daily life is associated with better sleep, healthier weight, higher physical activity levels, and lower inflammation in some people.\n*   Social connections. Studies of adults 50 years and older show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with a higher risk of disease, disability, and mortality.\n*   Brain stimulation. Stressing the brain or doing activities that entail strenuous mental effort, such as learning a new skill, language, or exercise format during leisure time may reduce the risk of cognitive decline.\n*   Improving sleep quality. Research is still inconclusive, but some reports suggest that insomnia is associated with higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline.\n*   Intermittent fasting. Animal research shows that caloric restriction over a lifetime, such as with intermittent fasting, increases lifespan.\n\n**How Sensory Changes with Aging Affect How We Eat**\n\nWe know that taste is key when enjoying a meal, but what about the smell, texture, appearance, colorfulness, mouthfeel, and even the sound of food (how it crunches in the mouth or sizzles when cooking)? These are the human senses that contribute to the eating experience and influence our food choices.\n\n**Spotlight on Longevity in Japan**\n\nJapanese women and men currently live five to six years longer than Americans, so their practices are of great interest. In Japanese families, elders are highly revered and households are intergenerational. Japanese elders are generally healthier than Western elders, but is this the chicken or the egg? Does better health from good lifestyle habits allow them to stay physically active and involved in society so they remain a valuable asset and reap psychosocial benefits, or is it the culture that reveres elders so they have better mental health, less loneliness, and better healthcare so that they stay healthier longer?", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Disease Prevention", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/", "content": "**Disease Prevention**\n\n \n\n**The Importance of Preventing Chronic Diseases**\n\nChronic diseases —including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer— account for some of the most common health problems in the United States. Yet many of these chronic diseases are preventable, as they’re linked to poor diet and lifestyle choices including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity.\n\n \n\n**Preventing Chronic Diseases**\n\nThe CDC reports some sobering statistics about Americans: Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability. 70% of annual deaths are due to chronic diseases.

With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it’s far too easy to overeat.\n\n*   Try the tips below to avoid overeating:\n    *   Eat breakfast\n    *   Choose small portions and eat slowly\n    *   Limiting distractions like turning off screens from phones and computers can also help us to increase our focus and enjoyment on food\n    *   Eat at home\n    *   Eat mindfully\n\n**GLP-1 RA weight loss medications**\n\nThe billion-dollar popularity of these once-weekly injectable medications is fueled by their dramatic weight loss results, with more pharmaceutical industries rushing to produce them amidst high demand causing shortages.\n\n*   Prescribed initially for treatment of type 2 diabetes, weight loss was a commonly observed side effect, which prompted their use for weight management.\n*   After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness.\n*   Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1.\n*   This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss.\n\n**Stay active**\n\nRegular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions.\n\n*   In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit “sit time” or being sedentary.\n*   See Staying Active for further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.\n\n**Limit screen time**\n\nWatching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.\n\n**Get enough sleep**\n\nChronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight.\n\n*   Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.\n*   See Sleep for more guidance.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nToday’s world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.\n\n*   Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain.\n*   Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.\n*   See Stress and Health for more information and tips.**", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Heart Disease", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/cardiovascular-disease/", "content": "**\n\n**Heart Disease**\n\n \n\nThere are several conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, and brain.

Secondary prevention involves taking medications like aspirin and or a cholesterol-lowering statin, quitting smoking and losing weight if needed, exercising more, and following a healthy diet after someone has a heart attack or stroke.\n\n**Primordial Prevention**\n\nThe word “primordial” means existing from the beginning. Primordial prevention involves working to prevent inflammation, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction from taking hold, and thus prevent risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, excess weight, and ultimately cardiovascular events.\n\n**Steps for the Primordial Prevention of Heart Disease**\n\n1. Not smoking\n\t* One of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form.\n\t* Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life.\n2. Maintaining a healthy weight\n\t* Excess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well as a host of other health problems.\n\t* A healthy BMI is under 25 kg m2. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg m2, and obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 kg m2\n3. Exercising\n\t* Exercise and physical activity are excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions.\n\t* Getting regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your health.\n4. Following a healthy diet\n\t* The best diet for preventing heart disease is one that is full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, poultry, and vegetable oils; includes alcohol in moderation, if at all; and goes easy on red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates, foods and beverages with added sugar, sodium, and foods with trans fat.\n5. Improving sleep health\n\t* Research has shown that sleep is an essential component of cardiovascular health.\n\n**Other factors to consider**\n\nAlong with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health.", "category": "general"},{"title": "Obesity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nObesity\n\n**Overview**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as having “excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health.” There are various methods to calculate body fat, as each range in accuracy and can have limitations.

The most common types in the U.S. are prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, which are largely influenced by carrying excess body fat, a poor diet, and lack of exercise.\n\n**What is Diabetes?**\n\nOur cells depend on a single simple sugar, glucose, for most of their energy needs. The body has intricate mechanisms in place to make sure glucose levels in the blood don’t go too low or soar too high. When you eat, most digestible carbohydrates are converted into glucose and quickly absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n**Types of Diabetes**\n\n*   Type 1 diabetes mellitus\n*   Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)\n*   Gestational diabetes mellitus\n*   Prediabetes\n*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes (and Prediabetes) Can Be Prevented**\n\nType 2 diabetes, once called adult-onset diabetes, is striking an ever-growing number of adults. Even more alarming, it is now showing up in teenagers and children. With the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups.\n\n**Preventing Type 2 Diabetes**\n\nData from the Nurses’ Health Study suggest that 90% of type 2 diabetes in women can be attributed to five such factors: excess weight, lack of exercise, a less-than-healthy diet, smoking, and abstaining from alcohol. Among 85,000 married female nurses, 3,300 developed type 2 diabetes over a 16-year period.\n\n**Is Diabetes Reversible?**\n\nWhen someone reports that they have “reversed” their diabetes, this actually means that they were able to stop using diabetes medication after making healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, following a healthful diet, and exercising. If prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes is detected early in an individual who immediately initiates healthy lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse or at least stop the progression of the disease.\n\n**Steps to Preventing Type 2 Diabetes**\n\n*   Control your weight\n*   Follow a healthy diet\n*   Stay active\n*   Don’t smoke", "category": "general"},{"title": "Simple Steps to Preventing Diabetes", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/", "content": "**\n\n**Simple Steps to Preventing Diabetes**\n\nKeeping weight in check, being active, and eating a healthy diet can help prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Overview**\nIf type 2 diabetes were an infectious disease, passed from one person to another, public health officials would say we’re in the midst of an epidemic. This difficult disease is striking an ever-growing number of adults, and with the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups (learn more about diabetes, including the other types and risk factors).\n\nThe good news is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by making lifestyle changes. These same changes can also lower the chances of developing heart disease and some cancers.\n\n**What if I already have diabetes?**\nGuidelines for preventing or lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes are also appropriate if you currently have a diabetes diagnosis. Achieving a healthy weight, eating a balanced carbohydrate-controlled diet, and getting regular exercise all help to improve blood glucose control. If you are taking insulin medication, you may need more or less carbohydrate at a meal or snack to ensure a healthy blood glucose range.\n\n**Simple Steps to Lowering Your Risk**\n\n* Control your weight\nExcess weight is the single most important cause of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven-fold. Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone with a healthy weight.\n* Get moving—and turn off the television\nInactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. Working your muscles more often and making them work harder improves their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. This puts less stress on your insulin-making cells.\n\n**Tune Up Your Diet**\n\n* Choose whole grains and whole grain products over refined grains and other highly processed carbohydrates.\n* Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water, coffee, or tea instead.\n* Choose healthy fats.\n* Limit red meat and avoid processed meat; choose nuts, beans, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead.\n\n**Don’t smoke**\nAdd type 2 diabetes to the long list of health problems linked with smoking. Smokers are roughly 50% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers, and heavy smokers have an even higher risk.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Precision Nutrition", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/precision-nutrition/", "content": "**Precision Nutrition**\n\nThe concept of precision nutrition would discourage following a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or “cure” their diabetes. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\n\nPrecision nutrition focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases.\n\n**Applying Precision Nutrition to Disease Management**\n\nThere are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: a gluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU).\n\n**Applying Precision Nutrition to Specific Foods**\n\nPrecision nutrition examines how a person’s DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup? Coffee beans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations**\n\nThe field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges—a lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual’s DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease.\n\n**Related Precision Nutrition and Type 2 Diabetes Management: Is It Ready for Prime Time**\n\nPrecision nutrition would see if there is an association between a person’s metabolic “signature” created by dietary patterns and their risk of developing T2DM.

It's a key indicator of health, and preventable oral diseases like tooth decay are common worldwide.\n\n**What Is a Healthy Mouth?**\n---------------------------\n\nThe mouth starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth has moist, odor-free, and pain-free tissues. The gingiva may vary in color but should be firm, not red or swollen, and not bleed when brushed or flossed.\n\n**Oral Health and Nutrition: What You Eat and Drink Affects Your Teeth**\n\nA balanced diet with adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth. Food choices and eating habits are crucial in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus contribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel.\n\n*   Eating foods high in calcium, such as cheese, milk, plain yogurt, and leafy greens, may help tooth health.\n*   Protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.\n*   Fruits and vegetables are good choices since they're high in water and fiber, balancing sugars and helping to clean teeth.\n\n**How Snacking Can Affect Your Dental Health**\n\nPlaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth. Unless removed daily, plaque builds up and can lead to tooth decay. Excess intake of added sugars leads not only to tooth decay but also to other health problems like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n**Oral Health and General Health**\n\nThere's a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and their management.\n\n*   Certain medications like antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can cause dry mouth.\n*   Stress may contribute to teeth grinding (or bruxism), clenching, cold sores, and canker sores.\n*   Medical conditions like osteoporosis require informing your dentist about all medications you're taking.\n\n**Positive Oral Health Can Enhance Mental and Overall Health**\n\nA healthy, pain-free mouth can lead to a better state of mind. Regular dental exams and professional cleaning support positive oral health and overall well-being.\n\n**Oral Health Tips**\n\n*   Drink fluoridated water and brush with fluoride toothpaste.\n*   Practice good oral hygiene by brushing teeth thoroughly twice a day and flossing daily between the teeth.\n*   Visit your dentist at least once a year, even if you have no natural teeth or have dentures.\n*   Limit alcoholic drinks and avoid tobacco products.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Nutrition and Immunity", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition-and-immunity/", "content": "**\n\n**Nutrition and Immunity**\n\nDuring the flu season or times of illness, people often seek special foods or vitamin supplements that are believed to boost immunity. Vitamin C and foods like citrus fruits, chicken soup, and tea with honey are popular examples. Yet the design of our immune system is complex and influenced by an ideal balance of many factors, not just diet, and especially not by any one specific food or nutrient.\n\n**What Is Our Immune System?**\n\nOn a daily basis, we are constantly exposed to potentially harmful microbes of all sorts. Our immune system, a network of intricate stages and pathways in the body, protects us against these harmful microbes as well as certain diseases. It recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites and takes immediate action.\n\n**Factors that Depress Our Immune System**\n\nOlder age: As we age, our internal organs may become less efficient; immune-related organs like the thymus or bone marrow produce less immune cells needed to fight off infections.\n\nEnvironmental toxins (smoke and other particles contributing to air pollution, excessive alcohol): These substances can impair or suppress the normal activity of immune cells.\n\nExcess weight: Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Fat tissue produces adipocytokines that can promote inflammatory processes.\n\nPoor diet: Malnutrition or a diet lacking in one or more nutrients can impair the production and activity of immune cells and antibodies.\n\nChronic diseases: Autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders attack and potentially disable immune cells.\n\nChronic mental stress: Stress releases hormones like cortisol that suppresses inflammation (inflammation is initially needed to activate immune cells) and the action of white blood cells.\n\nLack of sleep and rest: Sleep is a time of restoration for the body, during which a type of cytokine is released that fights infection; too little sleep lowers the amount of these cytokines and other immune cells.\n\n**Does an Immune-Boosting Diet Exist?**\n\nEating enough nutrients as part of a varied diet is required for the health and function of all cells, including immune cells. Certain dietary patterns may better prepare the body for microbial attacks and excess inflammation, but it is unlikely that individual foods offer special protection.\n\nExamples of nutrients that have been identified as critical for the growth and function of immune cells include vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, iron, and protein (including the amino acid glutamine).\n\n**The Microbiome**\n\nThe microbiome is an internal metropolis of trillions of microorganisms or microbes that live in our bodies, mostly in the intestines. It is an area of intense and active research, as scientists are finding that the microbiome plays a key role in immune function.\n\nA high-fiber plant-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes appear to support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microbes.\n\n**Chicken Soup**\n\nA warm bowl of chicken soup is a popular go-to when we’re feeling under the weather. Is there scientific evidence that it aids in healing? The short answer is no; there aren’t any clinical trials that show that chicken soup speeds healing any more than other foods.\n\nBut when breaking down its ingredients, it does appear a worthwhile remedy to try. First of all, chicken soup is light and easy on the stomach when our appetite isn’t great. Second, it provides fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration, which can easily occur with a fever.\n\n**Vitamin or Herbal Supplements**\n\nA deficiency of single nutrients can alter the body’s immune response. Animal studies have found that deficiencies in zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E can alter immune responses.\n\nThese nutrients help the immune system in several ways: working as an antioxidant to protect healthy cells, supporting growth and activity of immune cells, and producing antibodies.\n\n**8 Steps to Help Support a Healthy Immune System**\n\n*   Eat a balanced diet with whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of water.\n*   Don’t smoke (or stop smoking if you do).\n*   Drink alcohol in moderation.\n*   Perform moderate regular exercise.\n*   Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly.\n*   Try to keep a sleep schedule, waking up and going to bed around the same time each day.\n*   Aim to manage stress.\n*   Wash hands throughout the day: when coming in from outdoors, before and after preparing and eating food, after using the toilet, after coughing or blowing your nose.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Healthy Food Environment", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-food-environment/", "content": "**Healthy Food Environment**\n\nA food environment is the intersection between an individual and the wider food system.

But for many people, low-fat diets don’t work. In fact, dozens of studies have found that low-fat diets are no better for health than moderate-or high-fat diets—and for many people, they may be worse.\n\n**Are “fat free” foods healthy?**\n\nAmy Myrdal Miller: Some foods in their natural state contain little or no fat—for example, most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dried beans. And of course these are healthy choices. But processed foods billed as “low fat” and “fat free” are often higher in salt, sugar, or starch than their full-fat counterparts, to make up for the flavor and texture that’s lost when food manufacturers slash fat.\n\n**Will eating fat make me get fat?**\n\nWillett: No, it’s a myth that eating specifically high-fat foods makes you fat. Eating or drinking more calories than you need from any source, whether it’s fat, carbohydrate, protein, or alcohol can lead to weight gain.\n\n**Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet?**\n\nWillett: It’s possible to lose weight on any diet. But carefully-conducted clinical trials find that following a low-fat diet doesn’t make it any easier to lose weight or keep it off.\n\n**Are all kinds of fat equally healthy?**\n\nWillett: Some types of fats are healthier than others. Unsaturated fat is the healthiest type of fat. Plant oils, such as olive, canola, corn, peanut and other nut oils; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pistachios; avocados; and fish, especially oily fish such as salmon and canned tuna, are excellent sources of unsaturated fat.\n\n**How can I cut back on trans fats?**\n\nWillett: Many food manufacturers are already removing trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthy fats. Similarly, many restaurants are removing trans fat from their menu items, so this is a big help.\n\n**Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy?**\n\nWillett: Coconut oil and palm oil are higher in saturated fat than other plant oils. They are less harmful than partially hydrogenated oil, which is high in trans fats. But they are less beneficial for the heart than plant oils that are rich in unsaturated fats — olive, canola, sunflower, and other oils.\n\n**Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods?**\n\nWillett: It’s okay to eat fried foods, as long they are prepared with frying oil that doesn’t have any trans fats. It’s also important to look at the types of foods being fried.\n\n**Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat?**\n\nWillett: No. When you cook or read nutrition labels, don’t fixate on fat percentages. As long as you use healthy fats, and your keep your portion sizes modest, it doesn’t matter if your dish or meal has 30 percent, 40 percent, or more of its calories from fat.\n\n**What’s better than a low-fat diet?**\n\nWillett: Try following a healthy fat, healthy carb diet, using two nutrition tools from Harvard School of Public Health as your guide: The Healthy Eating Plate and the Healthy Eating Pyramid.\n\n**Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats?**\n\nMyrdal Miller: Here’s a few ideas for how to use healthy fats in your kitchen:\n\n*   Cook with healthy oils. Olive, canola, soy, peanut, sunflower, corn, and other oils from plants are the best choices, since they are high in healthy unsaturated fat.\n*   Bake with healthy oils. You can replace the butter in many baked goods with vegetable oils.\n*   Serve healthy fats at the table. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil or nut oils on vegetables, instead of butter.\n*   Pare calories by pairing healthy fats with low-calorie foods. Use oils and nuts to add flavor to lower-calorie, high-fiber foods, such as vegetables, beans, and whole grains.\n\n**How can I convince my family to eat healthy fats?**\n\nMyrdal Miller: Introduce your family to the range of healthy foods and flavors from around the world that rely on healthy fat to deliver their great flavor.

You must weigh the risks and benefits.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThroughout the 10,000 or so years that humans have been drinking fermented beverages, they’ve also been arguing about their merits and demerits. The debate still simmers today, with a lively back-and-forth over whether alcohol is good for you or bad for you. It’s safe to say that alcohol is both a tonic and a poison. The difference lies mostly in the dose.\n\n### What’s Moderate Alcohol Intake?\n\nWhat’s a Drink?\n\nLoose use of the terms “moderate” and “a drink” has fueled some of the ongoing debate about alcohol’s impact on health. In some studies, the term “moderate drinking” refers to less than 1 drink per day, while in others it means 3-4 drinks per day.\n\n### The Downside of Alcohol\n\nHeavy drinking can take a toll on the body. It can cause inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis) and lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), a potentially fatal disease. It can increase blood pressure and damage heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). Heavy alcohol use has also been linked with several cancers: The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research indicate that there is convincing evidence linking alcohol to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast, liver, colon, and rectum.\n\n### Possible Health Benefits of Alcohol\n\nWhat are some of the possible health benefits associated with moderate alcohol consumption?\n\n*   Cardiovascular Disease: More than 100 prospective studies show an inverse association between light to moderate drinking and risk of heart attack, ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, peripheral vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, and death from all cardiovascular causes.\n*   Gallstones: In the Nurses’ Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and other studies, gallstones were less likely to occur in moderate drinkers than in non-drinkers.\n*   Type 2 Diabetes: The emphasis here, as elsewhere, is on moderate drinking. In a meta-analysis of 15 original prospective cohort studies that followed 369,862 participants for an average of 12 years, a 30% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes was found with moderate drinking (0.5-4 drinks a day), but no protective effect was found in those drinking either less or more than that amount.\n\n### Genes Play a Role\n\nTwin, family, and adoption studies have firmly established that genetics plays an important role in determining an individual’s preferences for alcohol and his or her likelihood for developing alcoholism. Alcoholism doesn’t follow the simple rules of inheritance set out by Gregor Mendel. Instead, it is influenced by several genes that interact with each other and with environmental factors.\n\n### Shifting Benefits and Risks\n\nThe benefits and risks of moderate drinking change over a lifetime. In general, risks exceed benefits until middle age, when cardiovascular disease begins to account for an increasingly large share of the burden of disease and death.\n\n### The Bottom Line: Balancing Risks and Benefits\n\nGiven the complexity of alcohol’s effects on the body and the complexity of the people who drink it, blanket recommendations about alcohol are out of the question. Because each of us has unique personal and family histories, alcohol offers each person a different spectrum of benefits and risks.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "Healthy Eating Plate vs. USDA’s MyPlate", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-eating-plate-vs-usda-myplate/", "content": "**\n\n**Healthy Eating Plate vs. USDA’s MyPlate**\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate, created by experts at Harvard T.H.

However, potatoes don’t count as a vegetable on Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate because they are high in the type of carbohydrate that the body digests rapidly, causing blood sugar and insulin to surge and then dip (in scientific terms, they have a high glycemic load). For example, a cup of potatoes has a similar effect on blood sugar as a can of cola or a handful of jelly beans.\n\n**What to Eat Instead**\n\nWhole grains are an excellent choice, especially minimally processed grains such as brown rice and quinoa. Beans can also stand in as a “starchy” side dish; they are high in fiber and protein, and cause less of a spike in blood sugar than processed grains. If you’re looking for that mashed-potato texture, try this recipe that uses cauliflower instead.\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\n\nPotatoes do contain important nutrients—vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin B6, to name a few. But the potato is not the only source of these nutrients, nor is it the best: Broccoli, for example, has nearly nine times as much vitamin C as a potato. White beans have about double the potassium.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Service, U.E.R., U.S. Potato Statistics.Table 53: U.S. per capita utilization of potatoes. 2007.\n2.

What it means will depend on who you ask.\n\n**Overview**\nThe terms clean eating and clean diets are not federally regulated in the U.S., so interpretation by consumers and the marketing of “clean” products by the food industry can vary widely. Generally, clean eating is assumed to refer to foods that are as close to their natural state as possible, maybe organic, and most likely with minimal use of any chemical additives and preservatives.\n\n**Recommendations**\nA clean diet may include whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting highly processed snacks and other packaged foods with added sugar and salt. It may also be associated with terms like plant-based, grass-fed, sugar-free, or gluten-free.\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\nIn a survey of more than 1,200 participants ages 14-24 years found that 55% were familiar with the term clean eating from social media, other online sources, or their peers. A survey by the International Food Information Council (IFIC) helps to further define consumer beliefs about clean eating.\n\n**Title**\nA Darker Side to Clean Eating\n\n**Overview**\nClean eating can take on a different meaning when it introduces unrealistic expectations. In a survey of teenagers and young adults, though 71% defined clean eating as a healthy positive approach, a small percentage felt it was unhealthy due to its restrictive nature.\n\n**Recommendations**\nBecause of its strong association with health, clean eating was viewed favorably according to another survey of college students even though it produced emotional distress (experiencing negative emotions if not able to follow the diet) and functional impairment (having a rigid eating schedule, ignoring natural hunger cues to eat more or less than is scheduled, interference with school work).\n\n**Title**\nOrthorexia Nervosa\n\n**Recommendations**\nSuggested criteria in defining ON include: Obsessional or pathological preoccupation with healthy nutrition Emotional consequences (e.g., distress, anxiety) of non-adherence to self-imposed nutritional rules Psychosocial impairments in relevant areas of life as well as malnutrition and weight loss.\n\n**Title**\nThe Instagram effect\n\n**Recommendations**\nResearch has shown potential negative effects of frequent users of this platform, including anxiety, depression, and negative body image due to social comparison when viewing the often picture-perfect images. One study surveyed a group of young men and women with a mean age of 25 years, using a validated questionnaire to screen for orthorexia nervosa.\n\n**Title**\nBottom Line\n\n**Overview**\nClean eating can be a concept that promotes health and wellness by encouraging the selection of minimally processed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy proteins, and healthy fats. However, it is an unregulated term, so the interpretation of what defines clean eating can vary widely, both among individuals and within the food industry that markets “clean” food products.\n\n**Recommendations**\nClean eating taken to an extreme has been associated with an increased risk of disordered eating patterns, such as orthorexia nervosa.

In this series, we take a look at some popular diets—and review the research behind them.\n\nWhat Is It?\nIntermittent fasting is a diet regimen that cycles between brief periods of fasting, with either no food or significant calorie reduction, and periods of unrestricted eating. It is promoted to change body composition through loss of fat mass and weight, and to improve markers of health that are associated with disease such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\n**How It Works**\nThe most common methods are:\n\n*   Alternate-day fasting—Alternating between days of no food restriction with days that consist of one meal that provides about 25% of daily calorie needs.\n*   Whole-day fasting—1-2 days per week of complete fasting or up to 25% of daily calorie needs, with no food restriction on the other days.\n*   Time-restricted feeding—Following a meal plan each day with a designated time frame for fasting.\n\n**The Research So Far**\nPhysiologically, calorie restriction has been shown in animals to increase lifespan and improve tolerance to various metabolic stresses in the body. Although the evidence for caloric restriction in animal studies is strong, there is less convincing evidence in human studies.\n\nProponents of the diet believe that the stress of intermittent fasting causes an immune response that repairs cells and produces positive metabolic changes (reduction in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, fat mass, blood glucose).\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\nThis type of dietary pattern would be difficult for someone who eats every few hours (e.g., snacks between meals, grazes). It would also not be appropriate for those with conditions that require food at regular intervals due to metabolic changes caused by their medications, such as with diabetes.\n\nIndividuals with the following conditions should abstain from intermittent fasting:\n\n*   Diabetes\n*   Eating disorders that involve unhealthy self-restriction (anorexia or bulimia nervosa)\n*   Use of medications that require food intake\n*   Active growth stage, such as in adolescents\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding\n\n**Bottom Line**\nAlthough certain benefits of caloric restriction have been demonstrated in animal studies, similar benefits of intermittent fasting in humans have not been observed.

When these needs are recognized, they may determine one of your food choices. Because the method is based on an individual’s needs at one moment in time, it does not focus on specific foods, a calorie level to reach, or even eating at certain times.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nIE is the antithesis of restrained eating that demands rigid control. Many commercial diets follow a restrained eating model, with meal plans that include specific foods and measured portions. In contrast, IE focuses on body cues such as hunger and fullness, which may be physical hunger and fullness from an empty or filled stomach, or cues caused by emotional or external triggers.\n\n**Signs of Physical Hunger**\n\n* Fatigue\n* Lightheadedness\n* Irritability\n* Headache\n* Stomach is grumbling\n* Hunger gradually intensifies\n* No specific cravings; any type of food will satisfy\n\n**Signs of Emotional Hunger**\n\n* Stomach is quiet\n* Desire for food occurs suddenly (e.g., because of an emotion such as anger or stress, or from external cues such as viewing a television commercial or other food advertising)\n* Cravings are for a specific food or flavor, whether salty, sweet, crunchy, creamy, etc.\n* Guilt is associated with eating\n\n**Intuitive Eating Strategies**\n\n* Acknowledge hunger. Recognize physical hunger cues and respond to them.\n* Recognize and respond to fullness. As you identify true hunger, you will also learn to identify a comfortable degree of fullness after eating, and respond by stopping eating.\n* Don’t fear negative feelings. Accept that negative emotions like stress, anger, and boredom will come and go. Learn to cope with these feelings without using food: talk to a friend, go for a walk, take a shower, pray, or meditate.\n* Honor and respect your body regardless of size and ability.\n\n**How Intuitive Eating Differs from Mindful Eating**\n\nIntuitive eating often integrates concepts of mindful eating but also considers eating specifically in response to hunger and satiety cues, nurturing a positive body image, addressing non-physiological reasons for hunger, and physical activity.

In the 19th century, it was commonly used to help control diabetes. In 1920, it was introduced as an effective treatment for epilepsy in children in whom medication was ineffective.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nThe premise of the ketogenic diet is that if you deprive the body of glucose—the main source of energy for all cells in the body—alternative fuel called ketones is produced from stored fat. The brain demands a steady supply of glucose, but during fasting or when very little carbohydrate is eaten, the body begins to use fat as its primary fuel.\n\n**The Diet**\n\nThere is not one “standard” ketogenic diet with a specific ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat). The diet typically reduces total carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day and can be as low as 20 grams a day. Generally, popular ketogenic resources suggest an average of 70-80% fat from total daily calories, 5-10% carbohydrate, and 10-20% protein.\n\n*   Foods generally permitted on the diet:\n    *   High-fat foods like fatty cuts of meat, processed meats, lard, and butter\n    *   Sources of unsaturated fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, plant oils, and oily fish\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\n\nFollowing a very high-fat diet may be challenging to maintain.

Mindfulness is an intentional focus on one’s thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the present moment. Mindfulness targets becoming more aware of, rather than reacting to, one’s situation and choices.\n\nEating mindfully means that you are using all of your physical and emotional senses to experience and enjoy the food choices you make. This helps to increase gratitude for food, which can improve the overall eating experience. Mindful eating encourages one to make choices that will be satisfying and nourishing to the body. However, it discourages “judging” one’s eating behaviors as there are different types of eating experiences.\n\nAs we become more aware of our eating habits, we may take steps towards behavior changes that will benefit ourselves and our environment.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nMindful eating focuses on your eating experiences, body-related sensations, and thoughts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment. Attention is paid to the foods being chosen, internal and external physical cues, and your responses to those cues.\n\nThe goal is to promote a more enjoyable meal experience and understanding of the eating environment. Fung and colleagues described a mindful eating model that is guided by four aspects: what to eat, why we eat what we eat, how much to eat, and how to eat.\n\n**Seven Practices of Mindful Eating**\n\n*   Honor the food. Acknowledge where the food was grown and who prepared the meal.\n*   Eat without distractions to help deepen the eating experience.\n*   Engage all senses. Notice the sounds, colors, smells, tastes, and textures of the food and how you feel when eating.\n*   Pause periodically to engage these senses.\n*   Serve in modest portions. This can help avoid overeating and food waste.\n*   Use a dinner plate no larger than 9 inches across and fill it only once.\n*   Savor small bites, and chew thoroughly.\n\nThese practices can help slow down the meal and fully experience the food’s flavors. Eat slowly to avoid overeating. If you eat slowly, you are more likely to recognize when you are feeling satisfied, or when you are about 80% full, and can stop eating.\n\n**The Research So Far**\n\nThe opposite of mindful eating, sometimes referred to as mindless or distracted eating, is associated with anxiety, overeating, and weight gain. Examples of mindless eating are eating while driving, while working, or viewing a television or other screen (phone, tablet).\n\nInterest in mindful eating has grown as a strategy to eat with less distractions and to improve eating behaviors. Intervention studies have shown that mindfulness approaches can be an effective tool in the treatment of unfavorable behaviors such as emotional eating and binge eating that can lead to weight gain and obesity.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls**\n\nMindful eating is not intended to replace traditional treatments for severe clinical conditions such as eating disorders. Neurochemical imbalances are a risk factor for developing eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, and although mindfulness may be an effective component of a treatment plan, it should not be used as a sole treatment.\n\nMay not be effective as a weight loss strategy on its own, but rather a complement to a weight loss program. Mindful eating embraces making food choices that promote well-being and increasing enjoyment of the eating experience.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMindful eating is an approach to eating that can complement any eating pattern. Research has shown that mindful eating can lead to greater psychological wellbeing, increased pleasure when eating, and body satisfaction. Combining behavioral strategies such as mindfulness training with nutrition knowledge can lead to healthful food choices that reduce the risk of chronic diseases, promote more enjoyable meal experiences, and support a healthy body image.\n\nMore research is needed to examine whether mindful eating is an effective strategy for weight management.\n\n**Mindful Eating in Context of COVID-19**\n\nAs COVID-19 lockdowns began, reports of food stockpiling by consumers (with trends toward shelf-stable, energy-dense comfort foods) fueled concern that adults may increase their overall food intake during extended isolation, thus leading to weight gain. Along with the potential for increased emotional eating due to the numerous stressors brought on by the pandemic, researchers noted that home confinement provides an altered exposure to food cues, which may enhance impulsive eating behaviors.\n\nThe simultaneous loss of social eating opportunities was also flagged for its potential to reduce mindful eating practices, which could negatively influence food choice and promote overeating. All said, the full impacts at a population-level remain to be seen amidst varying degrees of lockdown mandates and compliance with social-distancing measures worldwide.\n\nIn the meantime, individuals may consider incorporating any number of mindful eating strategies in their daily lives alongside other important measures to help stay healthy during COVID-19.", "category": "mental"},{"title": "Kale", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/kale/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nKale\n\n \n\n**Overview**\nWho knew a vegetable could be so cool?

In nature, glucosinolates act as a first-line defense for plants, protecting them from environmental and biological stresses (insects, fungi, drought conditions). These same substances are being researched for their proposed ability in humans to affect chronic conditions including certain types of cancer and heart disease.\n\n \n\n**Preparation**\nPrepare Available throughout much of the year, Kale is even tolerant to frost and cold weather. Low temperatures can actually cause kale and other cruciferous vegetables to convert starch molecules into sugar, resulting in a sweeter, less bitter flavor. Despite their tough and fibrous texture, kale stems are edible if cooked.\n\n \n\n**Nutrition Facts**\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults eat a variety of vegetables as part of a healthy meal plan, and specifically at least 1½ cups of dark-green vegetables (including cruciferous) per week. [6]\n\n \n\n**Recommendations**\nPeople who are placed on blood thinners or anticoagulant medication to prevent blood clots are sometimes concerned about eating kale and other green leafy vegetables that are rich in vitamin K. Vitamin K has a unique action that assists in clotting blood, and can interfere with the effects of some blood thinners.\n\n \n\n**Preparation**\nSautéed Kale: This is one of the simplest, quickest methods to enjoy kale. Add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to a saucepan on medium-high heat. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until softened. Add ½ cup water or broth and 1 – 1½ pounds kale (washed, stems and leaves coarsely chopped). Cover the pan and allow to cook for 5 minutes until kale is softened and at desired texture.\n\n \n\n**Nutrition Facts**\nKale has hearty leaves that withstand all types of cooking: boiling, braising, steaming, microwaving, and stir-frying.

But certain types of “seaweed” (the common name for countless species of marine plants and algae) have been consumed globally for centuries and are a staple of East Asian and Pacific cuisines.\n\n \n\n**Nutritional Value**\n\nSeaweed is low in calories due to its high content of fiber and water, but potentially rich in minerals absorbed from seawater. It also contains an amino acid called glutamic acid, which is converted into glutamate that imparts a rich umami flavor when added to recipes. However, it is important to note the wide variation in nutrient content depending on the species of seaweed, and the location and time of harvest.\n\n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Fiber, soluble and insoluble\n* Polysaccharides\n* Polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (DHA and EPA)\n* Iodine (Laminaria and other brown seaweed)\n* Potassium\n* Iron (Sargassum brown seaweed)\n* Magnesium (Laminaria japonica brown seaweed)\n* Sugar alcohol (mannitol, sorbitol)\n* Phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids)\n\n \n\n**Preparation**\n\nSeaweed does not need to be cooked before eating.

You may have also heard that eating a lot of red meat—especially processed meats—may be linked to certain cancers. Now, new research suggests a possible connection between high-heat meat cooking and type 2 diabetes.\n\n**The Study**\n\nBased on data from three large cohorts followed for 12 to 16 years—including more than 289,000 men and women from the Nurses’ Health Studies and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study—researchers found that participants who most frequently ate meats and chicken cooked at high temperatures were 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those who ate the least.\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\nParticipants who ate red meat and chicken that were cooked to a well-done or charred level showed a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those who ate meat and chicken that were lightly browned. There was no association found between broiling fish and type 2 diabetes risk, although the authors noted that there were fewer data available overall on cooking methods for fish intake, so the smaller number of people may have made it difficult to see an association.\n\n**Possible Mechanisms**\n\nAccording to the authors, the exact mechanisms contributing to the increased risk are not known, but they cite the potential role of harmful chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and nitrosamines (from nitrates and nitrites added to meats as a preservative) formed during high-heat cooking. These chemicals may spur an inflammatory response, interfere with the normal production of insulin, or promote insulin resistance in which the body cannot use insulin properly to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThose who have or are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes who eat meat, chicken, and fish regularly may choose cooking methods that use lower temperatures, or brief periods of high heat, such as with slow cookers, baking, sous-vide, boiling, steaming, stewing, and stir-frying, while avoiding high-heat and open-flame methods like grilling, barbecuing, broiling, and roasting.", "category": "general"},{"title": "Substituting healthy plant proteins for red meat lowers risk for heart disease", "url": "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/substituting-healthy-plant-proteins-for-red-meat-lowers-risk-for-heart-disease/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nMeta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials of Red Meat Consumption in Comparison With Various Comparison Diets on Cardiovascular Risk Factors\n\n**Overview**\nPrevious findings from randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of red meat on cardiovascular disease risk factors have been inconsistent.

What is Gluten?\n\nGluten is a protein naturally found in some grains including wheat, barley, and rye. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a “stretchy” quality—think of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough.\n\n**What’s Not Great About Gluten**\n\nIt can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one’s immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation.\n\n**The Good News**\n\nRemoving gluten from the diet may reverse the damage. A gluten-free diet is the primary medical treatment for celiac disease. However, understanding and following a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging, possibly requiring the guidance of a registered dietitian to learn which foods contain gluten and to ensure that adequate nutrients are obtained from gluten-free alternatives.\n\n**Other Conditions That May Require Reduction or Elimination of Gluten**\n\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity, also referred to as gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) or gluten intolerance—An intolerance to gluten with similar symptoms as seen with celiac disease, but without the accompanying elevated levels of antibodies and intestinal damage. Wheat allergy—An allergy to one or more of the proteins found in wheat, diagnosed with positive immunoglobulin E blood tests and a food challenge.\n\n**Does Gluten Cause Brain Fog?**\n\nSome evidence shows that people who eat gluten but have a severe intolerance to it, such as with celiac disease, have a slightly higher risk of developing cognitive impairment. Reports of “brain fog” are not uncommon in people just prior to a diagnosis of celiac disease or in those who have been diagnosed but mistakenly ate foods containing gluten.\n\n**What Is a “Gluten-Free Diet”?**\n\nThis is essentially a diet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients including B vitamins, magnesium, and iron, it’s important to make up for these missing nutrients.", "category": "nutrition"},{"title": "A healthy summer cookout", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2017/06/29/healthy-summer-picnic/", "content": "**\n\n**A Healthy Summer Cookout**\n\nAs summer brings warm days and later evenings, many of us head outdoors for good fun and food.

However, data from Tyedmers et al. (2005) and Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (2015) suggest that for production-related emissions and on a global mean basis, capture (wild) fisheries and aquaculture emissions are of a similar order of magnitude.\n\n**Overview**\nWhile capture (wild) fisheries do not cause land-use change or land-use change emissions, if unsustainably managed they can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we felt comfortable overall listing “fish” on the scorecard as relatively on par with other lower-impact animal-based proteins on (eggs, poultry, pork).\n\n**Recommendations**\nPlant-based proteins can be cheaper than animal-based ones. For example, based on average US retail prices in 2013, the price per gram of protein ranged from 0.9 cents for dried lentils, 1.1 cents for wheat flour, 1.2 cents for dried black beans, and 1.2 cents for dried white rice, to 2.7 cents for eggs, 2.9 cents for milk, 3.1 cents for fresh whole chicken, and 4.4 cents for ground beef (Authors’ calculations based on retail price data given in USDA ERS 2015a, USDA ERS 2015b, BLS 2015; and nutrient content data given in USDA 2015).\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\nBecause retail prices can vary between markets and over time, we presented them as general ranges ($, $$, $$$) so as not to give of a false impression of precision.

Use liquid vegetable oils for cooking and baking. Olive, canola, and other plant-based oils are rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats. Try dressing up a salad or roasted vegetables with an olive oil-based vinaigrette. 2. Avoid trans fat. Read labels to find foods without trans fats. You should also scan the ingredient list to make sure it does not contain partially hydrogenated oils. In restaurants that don’t have nutrition information readily available, avoid fried foods, biscuits, and other baked goods. Or, you may have the good fortune to be eating in a city like New York, Boston, or San Francisco, where trans fats have been banned (do keep in mind, just being trans free does not mean these are all healthy foods). 3. Eat at least one good source of omega-3 fats each day. Fatty fish (such as salmon and tuna), walnuts, and canola oil all provide omega-3 fatty acids, essential fats that our bodies cannot make. 4. Cut back on red meat and dairy foods. Try replacing red meat with beans, nuts, poultry, and fish whenever possible, and try reducing portion sizes of dairy products.

Cut the neck off of the squash and set aside. Cut the base in half through the root and scoop out the seeds. Put 1-2 sage sprigs in each half, lightly rub in olive oil, put on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and roast until very tender, 45-60 minutes. Cool the squash down, discard the sage, and scoop out the flesh and set aside.\n\nPeel the next of the squash and cut into 1 2” pieces. Cut the root off of the leek(s) and remove the dark green leaves, keeping only the very light-green and white parts. Take off the outer layer. Cut the leek(s) in half vertically, then into half-moon slices about 1 2” wide. Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don’t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain.\n\nCut the onion, shallot, and carrot into a 1 2” dice. Smash the garlic cloves and roughly chop. Wrap the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a bundle of cheesecloth and tie with a string. If you don’t have cheesecloth, omit the peppercorns, and tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaves in a string bundle.\n\nAdd 2-3 Tablespoons of olive oil to a dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, shallot, carrot, garlic, and sweat for 5-8 minutes until translucent. Add the diced squash and cook for 4-5 minutes more. Add the honey maple syrup and cook for 2-3 minutes more.\n\nAdd the stock and herb bundle, turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat until the water is barely at a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes until the squash pieces are tender. Add the roasted squash to the soup pot and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove the herb bundle.\n\nAdd about 3-4 Tablespoons of olive oil, and blend the soup in batches (or with a stick blender) until smooth. Season with kosher salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n**\nFor balsamic reduction\nPut the balsamic vinegar in a small pot over very low heat. Keep the vinegar on the heat until it has reduced to a semi-thick sauce. Make sure the vinegar never comes to a boil – it can burn very easily. This will take several hours. Once it starts to thicken, keep an eye on it and swirl it around semi-regularly. It will continue to thicken off of the heat, so pull it off when it is just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\n\n**\nFor the pumpkin seeds\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour the seeds into a single layer on a baking sheet, and roast for 3-6 minutes until toasted. Be careful not to burn.

The filling of chickpeas and vegetables gives the pie a nice “bite,” making this recipe a top contender for any holiday gathering.\n\n**Ingredients**\n* 1 2 lb. chickpeas, dried\n* 2 bay leaves (or, substitute 2 14.5oz cans of low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed)\n* 1 lb. turnips\n* 1 10-oz. container cremini or button mushrooms\n* 2-3 medium carrots\n* 1 large or 2 medium leeks\n* 2 large stalks of celery\n* 2 medium cloves garlic\n* 3-4 sprigs sage\n* 2 sprigs rosemary\n* 4-6 sprigs thyme\n* 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper\n* 2 teaspoons tomato paste\n* 1 4 cup whole wheat flour\n* 2-4 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock\n* 5 lbs. sweet potatoes\n* 4 egg yolks\n* 4 Tablespoons olive oil\n* kosher salt, to taste\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n\n**Preparation**\nFor the chickpeas (omit these steps if using canned chickpeas)\nSoak chickpeas overnight in enough lightly salted water to cover them by 4”. If you don’t have the time, put the chickpeas in a pot, cover with lightly salted water (also about 4”), bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let them sit for about 2 hours. Once the chickpeas have soaked, combine the chickpeas, soaking liquid, and the bay leaves in a soup pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a little over an hour, or until the chickpeas are tender but still retain a bit of texture. Strain the chickpeas and set them aside.\n\nFor the carrots, turnips, and mushrooms\nWash everything, and cut into evenly-sized 1 2” pieces. Heat an oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine vegetables, and divide into batches so the baking sheet isn’t overcrowded. Toss each batch in olive oil, and place on baking sheet. Roast each batch in the oven until browned and cooked through – this can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Set the roasted veggies aside when finished.\n\nTo complete the filling\nCut the root off of the leek(s) and remove the dark green leaves, keeping only the very light-green and white parts. Take off the outer layer. Cut the leek(s) into a small dice (about 1 4” pieces). Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don’t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain. Cut the celery into a small dice, and mince the garlic. Mince the herbs. Heat 2 Tablespoons olive oil in a 2 quart pot over medium-low heat, and add the leeks, celery, and garlic. Sweat the veggies for 5-8 minutes until translucent – keep the heat low so they don’t color. Add the herbs, black pepper, and tomato paste, and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly so the tomato paste doesn’t stick and burn. Add 4 Tablespoons olive oil to the pot, and then the whole wheat flour. Stir the flour and continue to cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly add the vegetable stock while stirring, starting with about 2 cups. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a simmer, then add more stock if necessary to bring the sauce to a thick stew-like consistency. Remove from the heat. Mix together the chickpeas, mushrooms, turnips, carrots, and filling ‘base’. You may not need all of the filling base – add a little at a time until you get to the desired consistency. It should be rich and fairly thick – not soupy. If needed, season to taste with kosher salt.\n\nHeat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Wrap each yam sweet potato in aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven until completely soft, 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Scoop out all of the flesh from the sweet potatoes yams and put in a mixing bowl with the olive oil and black pepper. Mash with a big fork or potato masher. Whip the egg yolks with a little kosher salt until smooth, and add to the bowl. Mix until everything is combined.\n\nTo assemble and serve\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread the filling in the bottom of a 9×11” casserole dish. Spread the mashed sweet potatoes yams evenly on top. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned.\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\n* Nutrition information per serving (1 8 of recipe): \n\t+ Calories: 488\n\t+ Protein: 15 g\n\t+ Carbohydrate: 87 g\n\t+ Fiber: 11 g\n\t+ Sugar: 17 g (includes 0 g added sugar)\n\t+ Sodium: 226 mg\n\t+ Potassium: 1279 mg\n\t+ Fat: 11 g (2 g sat, 6 g mono, 3 g poly, 0 g trans)\n\t+ Cholesterol: 92 mg", "category": "recipes"},{"title": "Arugula, watermelon, feta, and mint salad with balsamic vinaigrette", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/arugula-watermelon-feta-and-mint-salad-with-balsamic-vinaigrette/", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nArugula, watermelon, feta, and mint salad with balsamic vinaigrette\n\n**Ingredients**\n* 3 ounces fresh arugula leaves\n* 4 cups watermelon, cut into 1-inch pieces\n* 1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, finely chopped\n* 3 1/2 ounces feta cheese\n* Balsamic vinaigrette (see Preparation)\n\n**\n\n**Preparation**\nFor balsamic vinaigrette:\n* Combine 1 tablespoon of aged balsamic vinegar, 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and ½ teaspoon of mayonnaise in a small bowl.\n* Whisk mixture vigorously to form stable emulsion.\n\nTo start salad:\n* Cut watermelon into 1-inch pieces and drain for 15 minutes.\n* Tear arugula into bite-sized pieces and place in large salad bowl.\n* Add chopped mint to arugula and mix thoroughly.\n* Add drained watermelon to bowl.\n* Crumble feta cheese on top of mixture.\n* Season with salt and pepper.\n* Toss lightly with desired amount of balsamic vinaigrette.\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\n(No nutrition facts available)", "category": "recipes"},{"title": "Citrus Salad with Ginger Lime Dressing", "url": "https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/recipes/%7Cilink%7Crecipes/citrus-salad", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nCitrus Salad with Ginger Lime Dressing\n\n**Ingredients**\n* Juice from 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)\n* 2 tablespoons canola oil\n* 1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger root, peeled before grating\n* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* Zest from 1 lime (about 1 teaspoon very finely grated peel)\n* 1/8 teaspoon salt\n\n**Preparation**\nCombine all ingredients for the dressing in a small mixing bowl and whisk well.

About 99% of the body’s calcium is stored in bones, and the remaining 1% is found in blood, muscle, and other tissues.\n\n**Recommended Amounts**\n\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium for women 19-50 years of age is 1,000 mg daily; for women 51+, 1,200 mg. For pregnant and lactating women, the RDA is 1,000 mg. For men 19-70 years of age, the RDA is 1,000 mg; for men 71+ years, 1,200 mg.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nCalcium is widely available in many foods, not just milk and other dairy foods.

Bones will release calcium into the blood if the diet does not provide enough, and no symptoms usually occur. A more serious deficiency of calcium, called hypocalcemia, results from diseases such as kidney failure, surgeries of the digestive tract like gastric bypass, or medications like diuretics that interfere with absorption.\n*   Muscle cramps or weakness\n*   Numbness or tingling in fingers\n*   Abnormal heart rate\n*   Poor appetite\n\nA gradual, progressive calcium deficiency can occur in people who do not get enough dietary calcium in the long-term or who lose the ability to absorb calcium. The first early stage of bone loss is called osteopenia and, if untreated, osteoporosis follows.\n\n**Guidelines if you are taking calcium supplements for osteoporosis**\n\nToxicity Too much calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia. The Upper Limit (UL) for calcium is 2,500 mg daily from food and supplements.

Globally, over 820 million people continue to go hungry every day, 150 million children suffer from long-term hunger that impairs their growth and development, and 50 million children are acutely hungry due to insufficient access to food.\n\n \n\n**The benefits of a planetary health diet**\n\nGood food can be a powerful driver of change: The EAT-Lancet Commission outlines a planetary health diet, which is flexible and recommends intake levels of various food groups that can adapted to local geography, culinary traditions and personal preferences. The planetary health diet recommends consuming a range of foods amounting to 2500 kcal per day that will promote health and well-being by reducing risk of overweight, obesity and noncommunicable diseases.\n\n \n\n**What can you do?**\n\nChange culture by changing menus. Chefs and other culinary professionals are well-positioned to make healthy and sustainable foods delicious by applying unique insights, skills and creativity to craft next-generation models of innovation in food service and hospitality.\n\n \n\n**Emphasize the benefits of dietary shifts**\n\nEating healthy foods from sustainable food systems is only partially about decreasing the intake of certain foods. Place the emphasis on eating more of the healthy options rather than simply focusing on decreasing the intake of unhealthy foods.\n\n \n\n**Explore new foods and mix up menus**\n\nFocus on the array of new flavors, ingredients and menu options that the planetary health diet opens up by embarking on a lifetime of discovery. Commit to regularly menuing new ingredients to keep planetary health diets innovative and exciting.\n\n \n\n**Lead with messaging around flavor**\n\nUse culinary techniques and source the best-tasting ingredients to ensure that healthy and sustainable options are as desirable as, or more so than, the alternatives. Making the healthiest and most sustainable options by far the tastiest and appealing is critical.\n\n \n\n**Work with suppliers and consumers**\n\nWhether they are managing a cafeteria at Google or running a school program in Burkina Faso, food service professionals have tremendous leverage with both food suppliers and consumers. Work with both and utilize the positioning of food service professionals as primary pathways to nudge consumers toward planetary health diets.\n\n \n\n**Focus on quality and reduce waste**\n\nUse culinary strategies to promote satiety, value and pleasure from food without fueling overconsumption. Actions from using smaller plates and bowls to avoiding dining hall trays and all-you-can-eat buffets will also help reduce food waste. Waste not, want not.\n\n \n\n**Let plants take center stage**\n\nThe planetary health diet recommends a consumption level of no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry and 196 grams of fish per person per week where possible. Food service professionals can help reduce meat consumption through portion sizes, for example by blending meat with vegetables and plant proteins in bowls, burgers, curries and stews or by using meat as a condiment or garnish (in servings of less than 20 grams) while allowing fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes to take starring roles.\n\n \n\n**Embrace cultural food influences**\n\nLook to a variety of traditional, plant-forward food cultures across the globe for inspiration around both flavor strategies and to craft tasty dishes on restricted budgets through cultural exchanges.\n\n \n\n**Bring biodiversity to the table**\n\nBold conservation targets require collaboration between farmers and farming communities to maintain habitats on or around farms and to enable the safe passage of wildlife.

"https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement", "content": "**\n\n**Title**\nIt entered into force on 4 November 2016.\n\n**Overview**\nIts overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.”\n\n*   In recent years, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century.\n*   The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that crossing the 1.5°C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change impacts, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.\n\n**How it works**\nImplementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science.\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action -- or, ratcheting up -- carried out by countries.\n\n*   Since 2020, countries have been submitting their national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).\n*   Each successive NDC is meant to reflect an increasingly higher degree of ambition compared to the previous version.\n*   Recognizing that accelerated action is required to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the COP27 cover decision requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2023, taking into account different national circumstances.\n\n**Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nCountries also communicate in their NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\n**Long-Term Strategies**\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS).\nLT-LEDS provide the long-term horizon to the NDCs.\nUnlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\nNevertheless, they place the NDCs into the context of countries’ long-term planning and development priorities, providing a vision and direction for future development.\n\n**Supporting one another**\nThe Paris Agreement provides a framework for financial, technical and capacity building support to those countries who need it.\n\n*   Finance\n    *   The Paris Agreement reaffirms that developed countries should take the lead in providing financial assistance to countries that are less endowed and more vulnerable, while for the first time also encouraging voluntary contributions by other Parties.\n    *   Climate finance is needed for mitigation, because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions.\n    *   Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate.\n\n*   Technology\n    *   The Paris Agreement speaks of the vision of fully realizing technology development and transfer for both improving resilience to climate change and reducing GHG emissions.\n    *   It establishes a technology framework to provide overarching guidance to the well-functioning Technology Mechanism.\n    *   The mechanism is accelerating technology development and transfer through its policy and implementation arms.\n\n*   Capacity-Building\n    *   Not all developing countries have sufficient capacities to deal with many of the challenges brought by climate change.\n    *   As a result, the Paris Agreement places great emphasis on climate-related capacity-building for developing countries and requests all developed countries to enhance support for capacity-building actions in developing countries.\n\n**Tracking progress**\nWith the Paris Agreement, countries established an enhanced transparency framework (ETF).\nUnder ETF, starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken and progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and support provided or received.\nIt also provides for international procedures for the review of the submitted reports.\nThe information gathered through the ETF will feed into the Global stocktake which will assess the collective progress towards the long-term climate goals.\nThis will lead to recommendations for countries to set more ambitious plans in the next round.\n\n**Achievements**\nAlthough climate change action needs to be massively increased to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the years since its entry into force have already sparked low-carbon solutions and new markets.\nMore and more countries, regions, cities and companies are establishing carbon neutrality targets.\nThis trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors and has created many new business opportunities for early movers.**", "category": "general"},{"title": "EAT-Lancet

Globally, the planetary health diet favors increasing the consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes alongside small portions of meat and dairy.\n\nIn parts of the world, this diet involves increasing the access to certain food groups while in other areas, the diet requires a significant reduction in the overconsumption of unhealthier foods. The planetary health diet recommends consuming a range of foods amounting to 2500 kcal per day that will promote health and well-being by reducing risk of overweight, obesity and noncommunicable diseases.\n\nShifting from unhealthy diets to the planetary health diet can prevent 11 million premature adult deaths per year and drive the transition toward a sustainable global food system by 2050 that ensures healthy food for all within planetary boundaries.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n* Conduct dietary assessments by:\n\t+ Assessing individual diets as a standard clinical evaluation to address specific nutritional needs according to age, sex, comorbidities and physical activity levels, and with an added sensitivity toward the needs of vulnerable groups.\n\t+ Monitoring changes in individual diet quality over time continuously alongside their nutritional requirements.\n\n* Provide professional counsel by:\n\t+ Giving individuals and vulnerable groups dietary guidance and by encouraging breastfeeding and providing information on nutritional requirements for maternal and child healthcare.\n\t+ Promoting the planetary health diet while also giving special considerations to vulnerable groups such as expecting mothers, children and adolescents, and individuals suffering from chronic diseases.\n\n* Support education and training by:\n\t+ Actively partaking in education campaigns in schools and other public services to promote the planetary health diet.\n\t+ Including nutrition and food systems in the medical curricula as main determinants of health along with several training packages to equip health professionals with the knowledge and skills to carry out diet assessments and to provide guidance and counsel on the planetary health diet.\n\n* Change food procurement practices by:\n\t+ Focusing on sustainably grown food to provide healthy foods and beverages from sustainable food systems to a high standard.\n\t+ Ensuring that food procurement and provision activities also minimize food waste and food loss in healthcare facilities.\n\n* Drive advocacy efforts by:\n\t+ Promoting this agenda in advocacy surrounding the medical profession and in medical communities including medical associations, unions and colleges.\n\t+ Setting up guidelines based on the planetary health diet that are applicable to local communities and ensuring the implementation of such guidelines.\n\t+ Encouraging and supporting increased collaboration between healthcare professionals such as physicians and dieticians and between actors across different sectors including food, agriculture, environment and health.\n\n**The Planetary Health Diet Proteins**\nProteins should primarily be sourced from plants where possible, fish or alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids several times per week, and with optional modest consumption of poultry and eggs alongside low intakes of red meat, if any, especially processed meat.\n\n* At least five servings of fruits and vegetables (500 grams) should be consumed per day excluding potatoes:\n\t+ 200 (100–300) grams of fruits\n\t+ 300 (200–600) grams of vegetables\n\n* At least 50 (0–75) grams of nuts and 75 (0–100) grams of legumes per day including dry beans, lentils and peas.\n\n* Aim to limit to no more than:\n\t+ 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb)\n\t+ 203 grams of poultry\n\t+ 196 grams of fish per week.**", "category": "general"},{"title": "EAT-Lancet Commission Brief for Everyone", "url": "https://eatforum.org/lancet-commission/everyone/", "content": "**What should you know about healthy and sustainable food?**\n\nThe food we eat, the ways we produce it, and the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability.\n\nGetting it right with food will be an important way for countries to achieve the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nA diet that includes more plant-based foods and fewer animal source foods is healthy, sustainable, and good for both people and planet.\n\nIt is not a question of all or nothing, but rather small changes for a large and positive impact.", "category": "general"}]
