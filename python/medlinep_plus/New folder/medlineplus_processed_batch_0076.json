    "content": "**Gelatin**\n\n**What is it?**\nGelatin is a protein made from animal collagen, usually from cows and pigs. It's commonly used to make capsules, cosmetics, ointments, and foods.\n\nCollagen is one of the materials that make up cartilage, bone, and skin. Taking gelatin might increase the production of collagen in the body.\n\nPeople use gelatin for aging skin, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, brittle nails, obesity, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nDon't confuse gelatin with collagen type I (native), collagen type II (native), or collagen peptides. These are not the same.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Diarrhea. Taking gelatin tannate by mouth doesn't benefit infants and young children with diarrhea.\n\t+ There is interest in using gelatin for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when used in larger amounts as medicine, short-term. But taking high doses of 15 grams daily might increase the risk for side effects, including sore throat, swollen gums, and mouth sores.\n\nGelatin comes from animals. This has led to some concern about contamination from sick animals. But there haven't been any reports of people getting sick after using gelatin products made from animals.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe to use colla corii asini, a specific type of gelatin made from donkey hide, in larger amounts as medicine. There isn't enough reliable information to know if other kinds of gelatin are safe to use as medicine when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.\n* Breast-feeding: Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if gelatin is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.\n* Children: A specific type of gelatin, called gelatin tannate, is possibly safe when taken by mouth as medicine for up to 5 days. In children under 3 years old or that weigh less than 15 kg (33 lbs), taking 250 mg of gelatin tannate four times daily for up to 5 days seems to be safe. In children over 3 years old or that weigh more than 15 kg, taking 500 mg of gelatin tannate four times daily for up to 5 days seems to be safe.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nIt is not known if this product interacts with any medicines.\n\nBefore taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\n\n---\n\n**Gelatin: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Before taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.**\n\n*   There are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n*   Are there interactions with foods?\n    *   There are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nGelatin is commonly used to make foods, cosmetics, and other products. As medicine, different forms of gelatin, including gelatin made from donkey hide and gelatin tannate, have been used. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other names**\n\n*   Colla Corii Asini\n*   Denatured Collagen\n*   Ejiao\n*   Gelatina\n*   Gelatine\n*   Gélatine\n*   Partially Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Coury JR, Skaggs KF, Marciano GF, et al.

    "content": "**Gemfibrozil: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGemfibrozil is used with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) to reduce the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides (other fatty substances) in the blood in certain people with very high triglycerides who are at risk of pancreatic disease (conditions affecting the pancreas, a gland that produces fluid to break down food and hormones to control blood sugar). Gemfibrozil is also used in people with a combination of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL; 'good cholesterol') levels and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL; 'bad cholesterol') and triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of heart disease. Gemfibrozil is in a class of lipid-regulating medications called fibrates. It works by reducing the production of triglycerides in the liver.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGemfibrozil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, 30 minutes before the morning and evening meals. Take gemfibrozil at around the same times every day.

    "content": "**Gene Therapy and Other Medical Advances**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Gene Therapy?**\n\nGene therapy is a medical treatment that aims to cure genetic disorders by modifying or replacing faulty genes. It involves introducing healthy copies of a gene into cells to replace the defective ones.\n\n\\n\\n**How Does Gene Therapy Work?**\n\nGene therapy works by using viruses or other vectors to deliver healthy copies of a gene into cells. The vector carries the desired gene into the cell, where it is then expressed and replaces the faulty gene.\n\n\\n\\n**Is Gene Therapy Safe?**\n\nThe safety of gene therapy is still being researched and debated. While some studies have shown promising results, others have raised concerns about potential side effects and long-term risks.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are the Ethical Issues Surrounding Gene Therapy?**\n\nOne of the main ethical issues surrounding gene therapy is the possibility of \"designer babies.\" If parents can choose the genes they want their children to inherit, it raises questions about the value and dignity of human life.\n\n\\n\\n**Is Gene Therapy Available to Treat My Disorder?**\n\nGene therapy is still in its infancy, and many disorders have not yet been treated with this method. However, researchers are actively exploring new ways to use gene therapy to treat a variety of genetic conditions.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are CAR T Cell Therapy, RNA Therapy, and Other Genetic Therapies?**\n\nCAR T cell therapy involves using a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer. RNA therapy, on the other hand, uses small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence specific genes. Other genetic therapies include gene editing tools like CRISPR.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?**\n\nmRNA vaccines use a piece of genetic material called messenger RNA to instruct cells on how to make a specific protein. This protein then stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection against future infections.\n\nNote: I removed the code blocks, ads, disclaimers, and standalone URLs as per your request.

Your provider can help.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n* You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.

Your anxiety may seem out of control and get in the way of everyday activities.\n\n**The Right Treatment Can Often Improve GAD**\n\nYou and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both.\n\n**Taking Medicine**\n\nCertain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder, including:\n\n*   An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks or months to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD.\n*   A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. However, benzodiazepines can become less effective and habit forming over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work.\n*   Other medicines such as hydroxyzine or gabapentin, which also act quickly.\n\n**When Taking Medicine for GAD**\n\nKeep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead.\n\nDo not change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider.\n\nTake medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine.\n\nAsk your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur.\n\n**Therapy**\n\nTalk therapy takes place with a trained therapist. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it.\n\nMany types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often, CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:\n\n*   Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.\n*   Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.\n*   Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.\n*   Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.\n\n**Other Ways to Manage Your Anxiety**\n\nTaking medicine and going to talk therapy can get you started on the road to feeling better. Taking care of your body and relationships can help improve your condition. Here are some helpful tips:\n\nGet enough sleep.\n\nEat healthy foods.\n\nKeep a regular daily schedule.\n\nGet out of the house every day.\n\nExercise every day. Even a little bit of exercise, such as a 15-minute walk, can help.\n\nStay away from alcohol and street drugs.\n\nTalk with family or friends when you feel nervous or frightened.\n\nFind out about different types of group activities you can join.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your provider if you:\n\nFind it hard to control your anxiety\n\nDo not sleep well\n\nFeel sad or feel like you want to hurt yourself\n\nHave physical symptoms from your anxiety\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - Self-Care**\n\n**What is Generalized Anxiety Disorder?**\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental condition in which you're frequently worried or anxious about many things.

This worry can be persistent and interfere with daily life.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nResearch suggests that GAD may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Some studies have found that people with a family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to develop GAD. Additionally, certain personality traits, such as perfectionism or low self-esteem, may increase the risk of developing GAD.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of GAD can vary from person to person, but common experiences include:\n\n*   Excessive worry about everyday things\n*   Difficulty controlling worries\n*   Restlessness or feeling on edge\n*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Irritability\n*   Sleep disturbances\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for GAD typically involves a combination of self-help strategies and professional therapy. Some effective treatments include:\n\n*   Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\n*   Medications, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs\n*   Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation\n*   Exercise and physical activity\n\n\\n\\n**Self-Care Strategies**\n\nIn addition to professional treatment, there are several self-care strategies that can help manage GAD symptoms. These include:\n\n*   Keeping a worry journal to track and challenge negative thoughts\n*   Engaging in regular exercise and physical activity\n*   Practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga\n*   Setting realistic goals and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n\\n\\n**Resources**\n\nFor more information on GAD and self-care strategies, consider consulting the following resources:\n\n*   American Psychiatric Association: Anxiety Disorders - What Are Anxiety Disorders?\n*   Barnhill JW, Jongerden L, Bogels S, et al.

Genes may play a role. Children with family members who have an anxiety disorder also may be more likely to have one. Stress may be a factor in developing GAD.\n\nThings in a child's life that can cause stress and anxiety include:\n\n*   Loss, such as death of a loved one or parents' divorce\n*   Big life changes, such as moving to a new town\n*   A history of abuse\n*   Living with family with members who are fearful, anxious, or violent\n\n**Symptoms of GAD**\n\nThe main symptom is frequent worry or tension for at least 6 months, even with little or no clear cause. Worries seem to float from one problem to another. Children with anxiety commonly focus their worries on:\n\n*   Doing well at school and sports. They may have the feeling that they need to perform perfectly or otherwise feel they are not doing well.\n*   The safety of themselves or their family. They may feel intense fear of natural calamities such as earthquakes, tornados, or home break-ins.\n*   Illness in themselves or their family. They may worry excessively over minor illnesses they have or be fearful of developing new illnesses.\n\nEven when the child is aware that worries or fears are excessive, a child with GAD still has difficulty controlling them. The child often needs reassurance.\n\nOther symptoms of GAD include:\n\n*   Problems concentrating, or the mind going blank\n*   Fatigue\n*   Irritability\n*   Problems falling or staying asleep, or sleep that is restless and unsatisfying\n*   Restlessness when awake\n*   Not eating enough or overeating\n*   Outbursts of anger\n*   A pattern of being disobedient, hostile, and defiant\n\nExpecting the worst, even when there is no apparent reason for concern.\n\nYour child may also have other physical symptoms such as:\n\n*   Muscle tension\n*   Upset stomach\n*   Sweating\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Headaches\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Children**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is unknown, but genes may play a role.

    "content": "**Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy**\n\n**Description**\n\nGeneralized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a disorder affecting the circulatory system that becomes apparent before birth or within the first few months of life. It is characterized by abnormal accumulation of the mineral calcium (calcification) in the walls of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries). This calcification often occurs along with thickening of the lining of the arterial walls (the intima).\n\nThese changes lead to narrowing (stenosis) and stiffness of the arteries, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. As a result, heart failure may develop in affected individuals, with signs and symptoms including:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Accumulation of fluid (edema) in the extremities\n* Bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis)\n* Severe high blood pressure (hypertension)\n* Enlarged heart (cardiomegaly)\n\nPeople with GACI may also have calcification in other organs and tissues, particularly around the joints. In addition, they may have hearing loss or softening and weakening of the bones (rickets).\n\n**Similarities to Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum**\n\nSome individuals with GACI also develop features similar to those of another disorder called pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is characterized by the accumulation of calcium and other minerals (mineralization) in elastic fibers, which are a component of connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body.\n\nFeatures characteristic of PXE that also occur in GACI include:\n\n* Yellowish bumps called papules on the underarms and other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends (flexor areas)\n* Abnormalities called angioid streaks affecting tissue at the back of the eye, which can be detected during an eye examination\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nAs a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically caused by a heart attack or stroke. However, affected individuals who survive their first six months, known as the critical period, can live into adolescence or early adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy**\n\n**What is Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy?**\n\nGeneralized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the circulatory system. It becomes apparent before birth or within the first few months of life and is characterized by abnormal accumulation of calcium in the walls of the blood vessels.\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\nPeople with GACI may experience:\n\n*   Calcification in other organs and tissues, particularly around the joints\n*   Hearing loss or softening and weakening of the bones (rickets)\n*   Yellowish bumps called papules on the underarms and other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends (flexor areas)\n*   Abnormalities called angioid streaks affecting tissue at the back of the eye\n\n**Causes**\n\nGACI is caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that helps break down extracellular ATP. Mutations in this gene result in reduced availability of pyrophosphate, leading to excessive calcification in the body.\n\nIn some cases, GACI can also be caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called MRP6. This protein is thought to transport certain substances across the cell membrane and stimulate the release of ATP from cells.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe prevalence of GACI has been estimated to be about 1 in 391,000. At least 200 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nAs a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically caused by a heart attack or stroke. However, affected individuals who survive their first six months can live into adolescence or early adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy**\n\n**Causes of the Disorder**\n\nIn about two-thirds of cases, Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI) is caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps break down a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), specifically when it is found outside the cell (extracellular). Extracellular ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate is important in controlling calcification and other mineralization in the body.\n\nMutations in the ENPP1 gene are thought to result in reduced availability of pyrophosphate, leading to excessive calcification in the body and causing the signs and symptoms of GACI.\n\nGACI can also be caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called MRP6, also known as the ABCC6 protein. This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes.\n\nMRP6 is thought to transport certain substances across the cell membrane; however, the substances have not been identified. Some studies suggest that the MRP6 protein stimulates the release of ATP from cells through an unknown mechanism, allowing it to be broken down into AMP and pyrophosphate and helping to control deposition of calcium and other minerals in the body.\n\nOther studies suggest that a substance transported by MRP6 is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues.\n\nMutations in the ABCC6 gene lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein. It is unclear how a lack of properly functioning MRP6 protein leads to GACI. This shortage may impair the release of ATP from cells. As a result, little pyrophosphate is produced, and calcium accumulates in the blood vessels and other tissues affected by GACI.\n\nAlternatively, a lack of functioning MRP6 may impair the transport of a substance that would normally prevent mineralization, leading to the abnormal accumulation of calcium characteristic of GACI.\n\n**Unknown Cause**\n\nSome people with GACI do not have mutations in the ENPP1 or ABCC6 gene. In these affected individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy**\n\n**What is Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy?**\n\nGeneralized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of calcium in the arteries, leading to hardening and narrowing of the blood vessels. This condition typically affects infants and can be fatal if left untreated.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nGACI is caused by mutations in either the ENPP1 or ABCC6 genes. These mutations affect the body's ability to regulate calcium levels, leading to excessive calcification of the arteries.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of GACI may include:\n\n*   Hardening and narrowing of the blood vessels\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Poor appetite\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing GACI typically involves a combination of genetic testing, imaging studies (such as ultrasound or X-rays), and laboratory tests to measure calcium levels in the blood.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for GACI, but treatment may focus on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n*   Medications to lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise\n*   Close monitoring of calcium levels and blood vessel function\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for GACI is generally poor, with most infants not surviving beyond infancy. However, some cases may be identified through prenatal testing or in utero diagnosis, allowing for early intervention and potentially improved outcomes.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nGACI is a genetic disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents must carry the mutated gene for their child to be affected. Understanding the genetic basis of GACI can help families make informed decisions about prenatal testing and reproductive planning.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy**\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   **What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?**\n*   **How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n*   **What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?**\n*   **What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?**\n*   **How are genetic conditions treated or managed?**\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Vascular Diseases\n\n**Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n*   **Calcification**: A process where calcium deposits form in various tissues, leading to hardening and rigidity.\n*   **Genetics**: The study of heredity and variation in living organisms.\n*   **Rickets**: A disease caused by vitamin D deficiency, leading to softening of bones.\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n*   **Calcium Blood Test**: A test used to measure the level of calcium in the blood, helping diagnose conditions like generalized arterial calcification of infancy.",

    "title": "Generalized pustular psoriasis: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/generalized-pustular-psoriasis/",
    "content": "**Generalized Pustular Psoriasis**\n\n**What is Generalized Pustular Psoriasis?**\n\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe form of a skin disorder called psoriasis. GPP and other forms of psoriasis are caused by abnormal inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). However, when inflammation is abnormal and uncontrolled, it can damage the body's tissues and organs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIndividuals with GPP have repeated episodes in which large areas of skin become red and inflamed and develop small pus-filled blisters (pustules). The skin problems can be accompanied by fever, extreme tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, an increased number of white blood cells, and other signs of inflammation throughout the body (systemic inflammation).\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in several genes, including IL36RN and CARD14, increase the risk of developing GPP. These two genes provide instructions for making proteins that play roles in regulating inflammation, particularly in the skin.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nGPP is the rarest form of psoriasis. Although the worldwide prevalence of GPP is unknown, the condition is estimated to affect 2 per million people in Europe. It also occurs in approximately 0.6 per million people each year in Japan.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Pustular Psoriasis**\n\n**Understanding the Genetics Behind GPP**\n\nGPP is a rare and severe form of psoriasis characterized by widespread pustules on the skin and systemic inflammation. Research has identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing GPP.\n\n**The Role of IL36RN and CARD14 Genes**\n\nTwo key genes, IL36RN and CARD14, play a crucial role in regulating inflammation in the skin. The IL-36Ra protein produced from the IL36RN gene blocks the activity of specific proteins that trigger signaling pathways to promote skin inflammation. Conversely, the CARD14 protein normally turns on inflammation signaling.\n\n**Gene Mutations and GPP Risk**\n\nMutations in the IL36RN gene are most often associated with GPP alone and are only rarely found in individuals who also have PV. Mutations in this gene appear to be the most common genetic risk factor for GPP alone. CARD14 gene mutations, on the other hand, are more frequently found in individuals with both GPP and PV.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nWhen associated with IL36RN gene mutations, the risk of GPP is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. When associated with CARD14 gene mutations, GPP risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder.\n\n**Environmental and Other Genetic Factors**\n\nHaving a gene mutation in one of the associated genes does not mean an individual will develop GPP. Researchers suspect that environmental or other genetic factors help determine whether an individual will develop the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Generalized Pustular Psoriasis**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nWhen associated with IL36RN gene mutations, risk of GPP is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\nWhen associated with CARD14 gene mutations, GPP risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one parent. Other cases result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Acute generalised pustular psoriasis\n* Deficiency of the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist\n* DITRA\n* Generalized pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch\n* GPP\n* Von Zumbusch psoriasis\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Generalized pustular psoriasis\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Psoriasis 15, pustular, susceptibility to\n\n**References**\n\n* Hussain S, Berki DM, Choon SE, Burden AD, Allen MH, Arostegui JI, Chaves A, Duckworth M, Irvine AD, Mockenhaupt M, Navarini AA, Seyger MMB, Soler-Palacin P, Prins C, Valeyrie-Allanore L, Vicente MA, Trembath RC, Smith CH, Barker JN, Capon F.

A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.\n\nSome genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited, which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.\n\n**Examples of Genetic Brain Disorders**\n\n* Leukodystrophies\n* Phenylketonuria\n* Tay-Sachs disease\n* Wilson disease\n\nMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms. Some are life-threatening.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nNewborn Screening: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\nAlso in Spanish\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nWhat Is a Pediatric Geneticist?

They are passed from parent to child. They hold DNA, the instructions for making proteins. Proteins do most of the work in cells. They move molecules from one place to another, build structures, break down toxins, and do many other maintenance jobs.\n\n**What Happens When There's a Mutation?**\n\nSometimes there is a mutation, a change in a gene or genes. The mutation changes the gene's instructions for making a protein, so the protein does not work properly or is missing entirely. This can cause a medical condition called a genetic disorder.\n\n**How Do You Inherit a Gene Mutation?**\n\nYou can inherit a gene mutation from one or both parents. A mutation can also happen during your lifetime.\n\n**Types of Genetic Disorders**\n\nThere are three types of genetic disorders:\n\n*   **Inherited**: Passed down from parents\n*   **Acquired**: Happen during a person's lifetime\n*   **Mixed**: Combination of inherited and acquired factors\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nGenetic Testing: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\nHow are genetic conditions diagnosed?: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nHow are genetic conditions treated or managed?: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Living With Genetic Disorders**\n\nPhysical Therapy and Occupational Therapy in Progeria (Progeria Research Foundation, Inc.) - PDF\n\n**Specifics About Genetic Disorders**\n\nAbout Poland Anomaly  (National Human Genome Research Institute)\nAbout Progeria  (National Human Genome Research Institute)\nCryopyrin-Associated Autoinflammatory Syndromes (CAPS) (American College of Rheumatology)\n\n**Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center \nGenetic Disorders  (National Human Genome Research Institute)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAll about the Human Genome Project (HGP)  (National Human Genome Research Institute)\nNIH Researchers Discover a New Inflammatory Disease Called VEXAS  (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Genetic Diseases, Inborn  (National Institutes of Health)\nClinicalTrials.gov: Progeria  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\nArticle: Advancing Therapeutic Strategies for Nonsense-Related Diseases: From Small Molecules to Nucleic... \nArticle: Therapeutic Application of mRNA for Genetic Diseases. \nArticle: Ethical and Practical Considerations in Implementing Population-Based Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening.\n\n---\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Birth Defects\n*   Brain Malformations\n*   Celiac Disease\n*   Cleft Lip and Palate\n*   Cystic Fibrosis\n*   Down Syndrome\n*   Dwarfism\n*   Fragile X Syndrome\n*   Genetic Brain Disorders\n*   Genetic Counseling\n*   Genetic Testing\n*   Hemochromatosis\n*   Leukodystrophies\n*   Osteogenesis Imperfecta\n*   Prader-Willi Syndrome\n*   Rare Diseases\n*   Sickle Cell Disease\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Genetic Disorders is the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",

    "content": "**Genetic Testing**\n\n**What is Genetic Testing?**\n\nGenetic testing is a type of medical test that looks for changes in your DNA. It analyzes your cells or tissue to identify any alterations in:\n\n* Genes: the building blocks of life that carry information needed to make proteins\n* Chromosomes: thread-like structures in your cells containing DNA and proteins\n* Proteins: the workhorses of your cells, responsible for most cellular functions\n\n**Why is Genetic Testing Done?**\n\nGenetic testing may be performed for various reasons, including:\n\n* Identifying genetic diseases in unborn babies (prenatal testing)\n* Screening newborns for treatable conditions\n* Reducing the risk of genetic diseases in embryos created through assisted reproductive technology\n* Determining if you carry a gene for a specific disease that could be passed on to your children (carrier testing)\n* Assessing your risk of developing a particular disease, especially if it runs in your family\n* Diagnosing certain diseases\n* Identifying genetic changes contributing to or causing a diagnosed disease\n* Estimating the severity of a disease\n* Guiding treatment decisions through pharmacogenomic testing\n\n**How is Genetic Testing Done?**\n\nGenetic tests are typically performed on blood, cheek swab, hair, saliva, skin, amniotic fluid, or other tissue samples. The sample is sent to a laboratory where a lab technician uses various techniques to detect genetic changes.\n\n**Benefits of Genetic Testing**\n\nThe advantages of genetic testing include:\n\n* Informing treatment and monitoring decisions\n* Providing you with more information for making health-related choices:\n\t+ If you're at risk for a disease, you may take steps to lower that risk.\n\t+ If you're not at risk, you can avoid unnecessary screenings or checkups.\n\t+ A test could give you information to make informed decisions about having children.\n* Identifying genetic disorders early in life, allowing for timely treatment\n\n**Drawbacks of Genetic Testing**\n\nThe physical risks associated with genetic testing are minimal. However, there may be emotional, social, or financial drawbacks:\n\n* Depending on the results, you might experience feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, or guilt, especially if diagnosed with a disease lacking effective treatments.\n* You may worry about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance.\n* Genetic testing may provide limited information about a genetic disease, such as:\n\t+ Whether you'll have symptoms\n\t+ How severe the disease might be\n\t+ Whether the disease will worsen over time\n* Some genetic tests can be expensive, and health insurance may only cover part of the cost.\n\n**Deciding Whether to Be Tested**\n\nThe decision to undergo genetic testing is complex. Discuss the test with your healthcare provider, and consider meeting with a genetic counselor who can help you understand the tests, weigh the risks and benefits, and explain the results.\n\n---\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\n**What is Genetic Testing?**\n\nGenetic testing is a type of medical test that looks for changes in your DNA. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It contains the genetic instructions in all living things. Genetic tests analyze your cells or tissue to look for any changes in:\n\n* Genes, which are parts of DNA that carry the information needed to make a protein\n* Chromosomes, which are thread-like structures in your cells. They contain DNA and proteins.\n* Proteins, which do most of the work in your cells. Testing can look for changes in the amount and activity level of proteins.\n\n**Why is Genetic Testing Done?**\n\nGenetic testing may be done for many different reasons, including to:\n\n* Find genetic diseases in unborn babies. This is one type of prenatal testing.\n* Screen newborn babies for certain treatable conditions\n* Lower the risk of genetic diseases in embryos that were created using assisted reproductive technology\n* Find out if you carry a gene for a certain disease that could be passed on to your children. This is called carrier testing.\n* See whether you are at increased risk of developing a specific disease. This may be done for a disease that runs in your family.\n* Diagnose certain diseases\n* Identify genetic changes that may be causing or contributing to a disease that you were already diagnosed with\n* Figure out how severe a disease is\n* Help guide your doctor in deciding the best medicine and dosage for you. This is called pharmacogenomic testing.\n\n**How is Genetic Testing Done?**\n\nGenetic tests are often done on a blood or cheek swab sample. But they may also be done on samples of hair, saliva, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a lab technician will use one of several different techniques to look for genetic changes.\n\n**What are the Benefits of Genetic Testing?**\n\nThe benefits of genetic testing include:\n\n* Helping doctors make recommendations for treatment or monitoring\n* Giving you more information for making decisions about your health and your family's health:\n\t+ If you find out that you are at risk for a certain disease, you might take steps to lower that risk. For example, you may find out that you should be screened for a disease earlier and more often. Or you might decide to make healthy lifestyle changes.\n\t+ If you find out that you are not at risk for a certain disease, then you can skip unnecessary checkups or screenings\n* A test could give you information that helps you make decisions about having children\n* Identifying genetic disorders early in life so treatment can be started as soon as possible\n\n**What are the Drawbacks of Genetic Testing?**\n\nThe physical risks of the different types of genetic testing are small. But there can be emotional, social, or financial drawbacks:\n\n* Depending on the results, you may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty. This can be especially true if you are diagnosed with a disease that does not have effective treatments.\n* You may be worried about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance\n* Genetic testing may give you limited information about a genetic disease. For example, it cannot tell you whether you will have symptoms, how severe a disease might be, or whether a disease will get worse over time.\n* Some genetic tests are expensive, and health insurance might only cover part of the cost. Or they may not cover it at all.\n\n**How do I Decide Whether to Be Tested?**\n\nThe decision about whether to have genetic testing is complex. In addition to discussing the test with your health care provider, you can meet with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors have specialized degrees and experience in genetics and counseling. They can help you understand the tests and weigh the risks and benefits. If you do get a test, they can explain the results and make sure that you have the support that you need.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* At-Home Medical Tests (National Library of Medicine)\n* Genetics: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n* How can consumers be sure a genetic test is valid and useful?: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n* How is genetic testing done?: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n* What are the risks and limitations of genetic testing?: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n* What do the results of genetic tests mean?: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n* What Is a Pediatric Geneticist?

    "content": "**Genetic Testing**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Genetic Testing?**\n    Genetic testing is a medical test that helps determine if you have a specific genetic disorder or condition. It can also help identify your risk of developing certain diseases.\n*   **Types of Genetic Tests**\n    There are several types of genetic tests, including:\n    *   Diagnostic tests: These tests are used to diagnose a specific genetic disorder or condition.\n    *   Carrier tests: These tests are used to determine if you carry a particular gene mutation that can be passed on to your children.\n    *   Prenatal tests: These tests are used to detect genetic disorders in a fetus during pregnancy.\n*   **Uses of Genetic Testing**\n    Genetic testing has several uses, including:\n    *   Diagnosing and managing genetic disorders\n    *   Identifying risk factors for certain diseases\n    *   Determining carrier status for specific gene mutations\n    *   Detecting genetic disorders in fetuses during pregnancy\n*   **How is Genetic Testing Done?**\n    Genetic testing involves taking a sample of your DNA, such as blood or saliva, and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. The results are then interpreted by a healthcare professional.\n*   **Informed Consent**\n    Before undergoing genetic testing, you will typically be required to sign an informed consent form. This form explains the risks and benefits of the test, as well as any potential limitations or uncertainties associated with the results.\n*   **Validity and Utility of Genetic Tests**\n    When selecting a genetic test, it's essential to ensure that it is valid and useful for your specific needs. Look for tests that have been validated through rigorous scientific studies and are performed by reputable laboratories.\n*   **Interpreting Genetic Test Results**\n    The results of genetic tests can be complex and may require interpretation by a healthcare professional. They may indicate the presence or absence of a particular gene mutation, as well as your risk of developing certain diseases.\n*   **Cost and Timeframe for Genetic Testing**\n    The cost of genetic testing varies widely depending on the type of test, the laboratory performing it, and your location. Results typically take several days to several weeks to obtain, although some tests may provide faster or slower turnaround times.\n*   **Health Insurance Coverage**\n    Many health insurance plans cover the costs of genetic testing, but coverage may vary depending on your specific policy and the type of test being performed.\n*   **Benefits of Genetic Testing**\n    The benefits of genetic testing include:\n    *   Early detection and management of genetic disorders\n    *   Identification of risk factors for certain diseases\n    *   Determination of carrier status for specific gene mutations\n    *   Detection of genetic disorders in fetuses during pregnancy\n*   **Risks and Limitations of Genetic Testing**\n    The risks and limitations of genetic testing include:\n    *   False positive or false negative results\n    *   Limited availability of certain tests\n    *   Potential emotional distress associated with test results\n    *   Risk of genetic discrimination (see below)\n*   **Genetic Discrimination**\n    Genetic discrimination occurs when an individual is treated unfairly or differently because of their genetic makeup.

    "content": "**Genetic Testing and Your Cancer Risk**\n\nCancer occurs when cells begin to act abnormally. Our body has genes that prevent rapid cell growth and tumors from forming. Changes in genes (variations) may allow cells to divide rapidly and stay active, leading to cancer growth and tumors.\n\n**Which Cancers May Be Genetic**\n\nToday, we know specific gene variations that can cause over 50 cancers, and the knowledge is growing. A single gene variation may be tied to different types of cancer, not just one.\n\n*   Breast (male and female)\n*   Ovarian\n*   Prostate\n*   Pancreatic\n*   Bone\n*   Leukemia\n*   Adrenal gland\n*   Thyroid\n*   Endometrial\n*   Colorectal\n*   Small intestine\n*   Renal pelvis\n*   Liver or biliary tract\n*   Stomach\n*   Brain\n*   Eye\n*   Melanoma\n*   Parathyroid\n*   Pituitary gland\n*   Kidney\n\n**Signs that Cancer May Have a Genetic Cause**\n\nCancer diagnosed at a younger than normal age\nSeveral types of cancers in the same person\nCancer that develops in both paired organs, such as both breasts or kidneys\nSeveral blood relatives who have the same type of cancer\nRare cases of a specific type of cancer, such as breast cancer in a man\nBirth defects linked to certain inherited cancers\nBeing part of a racial or ethnic group with a high risk for certain cancers along with one or more of the above\n\n**About Genetic Testing**\n\nYou may first have an assessment to determine your level of risk. A genetic counselor will order the test after talking with you about your health and needs.\n\n*   Blood, saliva, skin cells, or amniotic fluid can be used for testing.\n*   Samples are sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. It can take several weeks to get the results.\n*   Once you get the results, you will talk with the genetic counselor about what they may mean for you.\n\n**What Genetic Testing Can Tell You**\n\nTesting may be able to tell you if you have a genetic variation that is linked with a group of cancers. A positive result means you have an increased risk of getting those cancers.\n\nHowever, a positive result does not mean you will develop the cancer. Genes are complex. The same gene may affect one person differently from another.\n\nA negative result does not mean you will never get cancer. You may not be at risk due to your genes, but you could still develop cancer from a different cause.\n\nYour results may not be as simple as positive and negative. The test may discover a variation in a gene that experts have not identified as a cancer risk at this point. You may also have a strong family history of a certain cancer and a negative result for a gene variation. Your genetic counselor will explain these types of results.\n\nThere also may be other gene variations not yet identified. You can only be tested for the genetic variations we know about today. Work continues on making genetic testing more informative and accurate.\n\n**Who Should Consider Testing**\n\nDeciding whether to have genetic testing is a personal decision. You may want to consider genetic testing if:\n\n*   You have close relatives (mother, father, sisters, brothers, children) who have had the same type of cancer.\n*   People in your family have had cancer linked to a gene variation, such as breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   Your family members had cancer at a younger age than normal for that type of cancer.\n*   You have had cancer screening results that may point to genetic causes.\n*   Family members have had genetic tests and had a positive result.\n\nTesting can be done in adults, children, and even in a growing fetus and embryo.\n\n**Possible Benefits of Testing**\n\nThe information you get from a genetic test may help guide your health decisions and lifestyle choices. There are certain benefits of knowing if you carry a gene variation. You may be able to lower your risk for cancer or prevent it by:\n\n*   Having surgery.\n*   Changing your lifestyle.\n*   Starting cancer screenings. This can help you catch cancer early, when it can be treated more easily.\n\nIf you already have cancer, testing may help guide targeted treatment.\n\n**Questions to Consider Before Testing**\n\nIf you are thinking about testing, here are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider or genetic counselor:\n\n*   Is genetic testing right for me?\n*   What testing will be done? How accurate is the testing?\n*   Will the results help me?\n*   How might the answers affect me emotionally?\n*   What is the risk of passing a variant on to my children?\n*   How will the information affect my relatives and relationships?\n*   Is the information private?\n*   Who will have access to the information?\n*   Who will pay for the testing (which can cost thousands of dollars)?\n\nBefore getting tested, be sure you understand the process and what the results may mean for you and your family.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n*   Are considering genetic testing\n*   Would like to discuss the results of genetic testing\n\n---\n\n**Genetic Testing and Your Cancer Risk**\n\nCancer occurs when cells begin to act abnormally. Our body has genes that prevent rapid cell growth and tumors from forming. Changes in genes (variations) may allow cells to divide rapidly and stay active, leading to cancer growth and tumors. Gene variations may be the result of damage to the body or something passed down in the genes in your family.\n\n**Which Cancers May Be Genetic**\n\nToday, we know specific gene variations that can cause over 50 cancers, and the knowledge is growing. A single gene variation may be tied to different types of cancer, not just one. For example, variations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are linked with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and several other cancers, in men and women.\n\n**Signs that Cancer May Have a Genetic Cause**\n\nCancer diagnosed at a younger than normal age\nSeveral types of cancers in the same person\nCancer that develops in both paired organs, such as both breasts or kidneys\nSeveral blood relatives who have the same type of cancer\nRare cases of a specific type of cancer, such as breast cancer in a man\nBirth defects linked to certain inherited cancers\nBeing part of a racial or ethnic group with a high risk for certain cancers along with one or more of the above\n\n**About Genetic Testing**\n\nYou may first have an assessment to determine your level of risk. A genetic counselor will order the test after talking with you about your health and needs. Genetic counselors are trained to inform you without trying to guide your decision.\n\n**How Testing Works**\n\nBlood, saliva, skin cells, or amniotic fluid can be used for testing.\nSamples are sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. It can take several weeks to get the results.\nOnce you get the results, you will talk with the genetic counselor about what they may mean for you.\n\n**What Genetic Testing Can Tell You**\n\nTesting may be able to tell you if you have a genetic variation that is linked with a group of cancers. A positive result means you have an increased risk of getting those cancers.\n\nHowever, a positive result does not mean you will develop the cancer. Genes are complex. The same gene may affect one person differently from another.\n\nA negative result does not mean you will never get cancer. You may not be at risk due to your genes, but you could still develop cancer from a different cause.\n\nYour results may not be as simple as positive and negative. The test may discover a variation in a gene that experts have not identified as a cancer risk at this point. You may also have a strong family history of a certain cancer and a negative result for a gene variation. Your genetic counselor will explain these types of results.\n\n**Who Should Consider Testing**\n\nDeciding whether to have genetic testing is a personal decision. You may want to consider genetic testing if:\n\nYou have close relatives who have had the same type of cancer.\nPeople in your family have had cancer linked to a gene variation, such as breast or ovarian cancer.\nYour family members had cancer at a younger age than normal for that type of cancer.\nYou have had cancer screening results that may point to genetic causes.\nFamily members have had genetic tests and had a positive result.\n\nTesting can be done in adults, children, and even in a growing fetus and embryo.\n\n**Possible Benefits of Testing**\n\nThe information you get from a genetic test may help guide your health decisions and lifestyle choices. There are certain benefits of knowing if you carry a gene variation. You may be able to lower your risk for cancer or prevent it by:\n\nHaving surgery.\nChanging your lifestyle.\nStarting cancer screenings. This can help you catch cancer early, when it can be treated more easily.\n\nIf you already have cancer, testing may help guide targeted treatment.\n\n**Questions to Consider Before Testing**\n\nIs genetic testing right for me?\nWhat testing will be done? How accurate is the testing?\nWill the results help me?\nHow might the answers affect me emotionally?\nWhat is the risk of passing a variant on to my children?\nHow will the information affect my relatives and relationships?\nIs the information private?\nWho will have access to the information?\nWho will pay for the testing (which can cost thousands of dollars)?\n\nBefore getting tested, be sure you understand the process and what the results may mean for you and your family.\n\n---\n\n**Genetic Testing and Your Cancer Risk**\n\n**The Genes in Our Cells**\n\nThe genes in our cells play important roles. They affect hair and eye color and other traits passed on from parent to child. Genes also tell cells to make proteins to help the body function.\n\n**Cancer Occurs When Cells Begin to Act Abnormally**\n\nCancer occurs when cells begin to act abnormally. Our body has genes that prevent rapid cell growth and tumors from forming. Changes in genes (variations) may allow cells to divide rapidly and stay active. This leads to cancer growth and tumors. Gene variations may be the result of damage to the body or something passed down in the genes in your family.\n\n**Genetic Testing Can Help You Find Out If You Have a Genetic Variation That May Lead to Cancer**\n\nGenetic testing can help you find out if you have a genetic variation that may lead to cancer or that may affect other members in your family. Learn about which cancers have testing available, what the results mean, and other things to consider before you get tested.\n\n**Which Cancers May Be Genetic**\n\nToday, we know specific gene variations that can cause over 50 cancers, and the knowledge is growing.\n\nA single gene variation may be tied to different types of cancer, not just one.\n\nFor example, variations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are linked with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and several other cancers, in men and women. Around one half of women who inherit the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic variation will develop breast cancer by the age of 70.\n\nPolyps or growths on the lining of the colon or rectum may be linked to cancer and at times may be part of an inherited disorder.\n\nGenetic variations are linked with some cases of the following cancers:\n\n* Breast (male and female)\n* Ovarian\n* Prostate\n* Pancreatic\n* Bone\n* Leukemia\n* Adrenal gland\n* Thyroid\n* Endometrial\n* Colorectal\n* Small intestine\n* Renal pelvis\n* Liver or biliary tract\n* Stomach\n* Brain\n* Eye\n* Melanoma\n* Parathyroid\n* Pituitary gland\n* Kidney\n\n**Signs That Cancer May Have a Genetic Cause**\n\nCancer that is diagnosed at a younger than normal age\nSeveral types of cancers in the same person\nCancer that develops in both paired organs, such as both breasts or kidneys\nSeveral blood relatives who have the same type of cancer\nRare cases of a specific type of cancer, such as breast cancer in a man\nBirth defects that are linked to certain inherited cancers\nBeing part of a racial or ethnic group with a high risk for certain cancers along with one or more of the above\n\n**About Genetic Testing**\n\nYou may first have an assessment to determine your level of risk. A genetic counselor will order the test after talking with you about your health and needs. Genetic counselors are trained to inform you without trying to guide your decision. That way you can decide whether testing is right for you.\n\nHow testing works:\n\nBlood, saliva, skin cells, or amniotic fluid (around a growing fetus) can be used for testing.\nSamples are sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. It can take several weeks to get the results.\nOnce you get the results, you will talk with the genetic counselor about what they may mean for you.\n\nWhile you may be able to order testing on your own, it is a good idea to work with a genetic counselor. They can help you understand the benefits and limitations of your results, and possible actions. Also, they can help you understand what it may mean for family members, and counsel them as well.\n\nYou will need to sign an informed consent form before testing.\n\n---\n\n**Genetic Testing and Your Cancer Risk**\n\n**What Genetic Testing Can Tell You**\n\nTesting may be able to tell you if you have a genetic variation that is linked with a group of cancers.

You may also have a strong family history of a certain cancer and a negative result for a gene variation. Your genetic counselor will explain these types of results.\n\nThere also may be other gene variations not yet identified. You can only be tested for the genetic variations we know about today. Work continues on making genetic testing more informative and accurate.\n\n**Who Should Consider Testing**\n\nDeciding whether to have genetic testing is a personal decision. You may want to consider genetic testing if:\n\n* You have close relatives (mother, father, sisters, brothers, children) who have had the same type of cancer.\n* People in your family have had cancer linked to a gene variation, such as breast or ovarian cancer.\n* Your family members had cancer at a younger age than normal for that type of cancer.\n* You have had cancer screening results that may point to genetic causes.\n* Family members have had genetic tests and had a positive result.\n\nTesting can be done in adults, children, and even in a growing fetus and embryo.\n\n**Possible Benefits of Testing**\n\nThe information you get from a genetic test may help guide your health decisions and lifestyle choices.

    "content": "**Genetically Modified Organisms - GMOs**\n\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants, animals, or microbes that have had their DNA changed using genetic engineering techniques. Another term for this is bioengineered foods.\n\n**Function**\n\nGenetic engineering can be done with plants, animals, or bacteria and other very small organisms. With genetic engineering, scientists take the gene for a desired trait in one plant or animal, and they insert that gene into the DNA of another plant or animal. Genes can also be moved from an animal to a plant or vice versa.\n\nThe process to create GMOs is different than selective breeding. This involves selecting plants or animals with desired traits and breeding them. Over time, this results in offspring with those desired traits. One of the problems with selective breeding is that it can also result in traits that are not desired.\n\nGenetic engineering allows scientists to select one specific gene to implant. This avoids introducing other genes with undesirable traits. Genetic engineering also helps speed up the process of creating new foods with desired traits.\n\nGenome editing is a newer method that involves adding, removing, or changing the DNA of a plant or animal in a targeted way.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe possible benefits of genetic engineering include:\n\n*   More nutritious food\n*   Tastier food\n*   Disease- and drought-resistant plants that require fewer environmental resources (such as water and fertilizer)\n*   Insect-resistant plants that allows less use of pesticides\n*   Increased supply of food with reduced cost and longer shelf life\n*   Faster growing plants and animals\n*   Food with more desirable traits, such as potatoes that produce less of a cancer-causing substance when fried\n\n**Concerns**\n\nSome people have expressed concerns about GE foods, such as:\n\n*   Creation of foods that can cause an allergic or toxic reaction\n*   Unexpected or harmful genetic changes\n*   Inadvertent transfer of genes from one GM plant or animal to another plant or animal not intended for genetic modification\n*   Foods that are less nutritious\n*   Decrease in biodiversity\n\nThese concerns have thus far been unfounded. None of the GMOs used today have caused any of these problems.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nCotton, corn, and soybeans are the main GMO crops grown in the United States. Most of these are used to make ingredients for other foods, such as:\n\n*   Corn syrup used as a sweetener in many foods and drinks\n*   Corn starch used in soups and sauces\n*   Soybean, corn, and canola oils used in snack foods, breads, salad dressings, and mayonnaise\n*   Sugar from sugar beets\n*   Livestock feed\n\nOther GMO crops include one or more varieties of the following:\n\n*   Apples\n*   Alfalfa\n*   Canola\n*   Eggplant (not available in the United States)\n*   Papayas\n*   Pineapples\n*   Potatoes\n*   Salmon\n*   Squash\n*   Sugar beets\n*   Sugarcane\n*   Zucchini\n\n---\n\n**Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**\n\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants, animals, or microbes that have had their DNA changed using genetic engineering techniques.

    "content": "**Genetics and Human Traits**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Are fingerprints determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, fingerprints are determined by genetics. The unique patterns on an individual's fingertips are formed during fetal development, around 13-15 weeks after conception. While the exact causes of fingerprint formation are still not fully understood, research suggests that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping these patterns.\n\n*   **Is eye color determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, eye color is largely determined by genetics. The production and distribution of pigment in the iris, as well as the amount of light that enters the eye, all contribute to an individual's eye color. While environmental factors can influence eye color slightly, genetic factors are the primary determinants.\n\n*   **Is intelligence determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, intelligence is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research suggests that around 50-60% of the variation in intelligence quotient (IQ) can be attributed to genetic differences, while the remaining 40-50% is due to environmental influences such as education and socioeconomic status.\n\n*   **Is handedness determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, handedness has a strong genetic component. Studies have shown that identical twins are more likely to share the same handedness than fraternal twins or non-twin siblings, indicating a significant role for genetic factors in determining handedness.\n\n*   **Is the probability of having twins determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, the likelihood of having twins is influenced by genetic factors. Women who have a family history of twinning are more likely to give birth to twins themselves. This is because certain genetic variations can affect the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn influences ovulation and fertility.\n\n*   **Is hair texture determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, hair texture is largely determined by genetics. The shape and structure of hair follicles, as well as the type and amount of keratin produced, all contribute to an individual's hair texture. While environmental factors can influence hair texture slightly, genetic factors are the primary determinants.\n\n*   **Is hair color determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, hair color is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The production and distribution of pigment in the hair shaft, as well as exposure to sunlight and other environmental influences, all contribute to an individual's hair color. While genetic factors are the primary determinants of hair color, environmental factors can influence its expression.\n\n*   **Is height determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, height is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research suggests that around 60-80% of the variation in height can be attributed to genetic differences, while the remaining 20-40% is due to environmental influences such as nutrition and health during childhood.\n\n*   **Are moles determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, the presence and distribution of moles are influenced by genetic factors. Research has identified several genes that contribute to mole formation, including those involved in skin pigmentation and cell growth.\n\n*   **Are facial dimples determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, facial dimples have a strong genetic component. Studies have shown that identical twins are more likely to share the same facial dimple pattern than fraternal twins or non-twin siblings, indicating a significant role for genetic factors in determining facial dimple formation.\n\n*   **Is athletic performance determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, athletic performance is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research suggests that around 30-60% of the variation in athletic performance can be attributed to genetic differences, while the remaining 40-70% is due to environmental influences such as training and experience.\n\n*   **Is longevity determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, lifespan has a significant genetic component. Research has identified several genes that contribute to aging and longevity, including those involved in DNA repair, cell division, and metabolic regulation.\n\n*   **Is temperament determined by genetics?**\n    Yes, temperament is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research suggests that around 30-60% of the variation in temperament can be attributed to genetic differences, while the remaining 40-70% is due to environmental influences such as upbringing and life experiences.",

Other characteristics influenced by heredity are:\n\n* Likelihood of getting certain diseases\n* Mental abilities\n* Natural talents\n\nAn abnormal trait (variant) that is passed down through families (inherited) may:\n\n* Have no effect on your health or well-being.\n* Have only a minor effect, such as color blindness.\n* Have a major effect on your quality or length of life.\n\nFor most genetic conditions, genetic counseling is advised for couples who want to become pregnant.\n\n**Information**\n\nHuman beings have cells with 46 chromosomes. These consist of 2 chromosomes that determine what sex they are (X and Y chromosomes), and 22 pairs of nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes. Males are \"46,XY\" and females are \"46,XX.\" The chromosomes are made up of strands of genetic information called DNA. Each chromosome contains sections of DNA called genes. The genes carry the information needed by your body to make certain proteins.\n\nEach pair of chromosomes contains one chromosome from the mother and one from the father. Each chromosome in a pair carries basically the same information; that is, each chromosome pair has the same genes. Sometimes there are slight variations of these genes. These variations occur in less than 1% of the DNA sequence. The genes that have these variations are called alleles.\n\nSome of these variations can result in a gene that is not working properly. A variant gene may lead to an abnormal protein or an abnormal amount of a normal protein. In a pair of autosomal chromosomes, there are two copies of each gene, one from each parent. If one of these genes is abnormal, the other one may make enough protein so that no disease develops. When this happens, the variant gene is called recessive. Recessive genes are said to be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. If two copies of the variant gene are present, disease may develop.\n\nHowever, if only one variant gene is needed to produce a disease, it leads to a dominant hereditary condition. In the case of a dominant condition, if one variant gene is inherited from the mother or father, the child will likely show the disease.\n\nA person with one variant gene is called heterozygous for that gene. If a child receives a variant recessive disease gene from both parents, the child will show the disease and will be homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for that gene.\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nAlmost all diseases have a genetic component. However, the importance of that component varies. Disorders in which genes play an important role (genetic diseases) can be classified as:\n\n* Single-gene variants\n* Chromosomal conditions\n* Multifactorial\n\nA single-gene condition (also called Mendelian disorder) is caused by a variant in one particular gene. Many conditions caused by single gene variants are rare. But since there are many thousands of known single gene conditions, their combined impact is significant.\n\nSingle-gene conditions are characterized by how they are passed down in families. There are 6 basic patterns of single gene inheritance:\n\n* Autosomal dominant\n* Autosomal recessive\n* X-linked dominant\n* X-linked recessive\n* Y-linked inheritance\n* Maternal (mitochondrial) inheritance\n\nThe observed effect of a gene (the appearance of a condition) is called the phenotype.\n\nIn autosomal dominant inheritance, the variations usually appear in every generation. Each time an affected parent, either male or female, has a child, that child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.\n\nPeople with one copy of a recessive disease gene are called carriers. Carriers usually don't have symptoms of the disease. But, the gene can often be found by sensitive laboratory tests.\n\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance, the parents of an affected individual may not show the disease (they are carriers). On average, the chance that carrier parents could have children who develop the disease is 25% with each pregnancy. Male and female children are equally likely to be affected. For a child to have symptoms of an autosomal recessive disorder, the child must receive the variant gene from both parents. Because most recessive disorders are rare, a child is at increased risk of a recessive disease if the parents are related. Related individuals are more likely to have inherited the same rare gene from a common ancestor.\n\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, the chance of being affected with the disease is much higher in males than females. Since the variant gene is carried on the X (female) chromosome, males do not transmit it to their sons (who will receive the Y chromosome from their fathers). However, they do transmit it to their daughters. In females, the presence of one normal X chromosome masks the effects of the X chromosome with the variant gene. So, almost all of the daughters of an affected man appear normal, but they are all carriers of the variant gene. Each time these daughters bear a son, there is a 50% chance the son will receive the variant gene.\n\nIn X-linked dominant inheritance, the variant gene appears in females, causing the associated condition, even if there is also a normal X chromosome present. Since males pass the Y chromosome to their sons, affected males will not have affected sons. All of their daughters will be affected, however. Sons or daughters of affected females will have a 50% chance of getting the disease.\n\n**Examples of Single Gene Disorders**\n\nAutosomal recessive:\n\n* ADA deficiency (sometimes called the \"boy in a bubble\" disease)\n* Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency\n* Cystic fibrosis (CF)\n* Phenylketonuria (PKU)\n* Sickle cell anemia\n\nX-linked recessive:\n\n* Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n* Hemophilia A\n\nAutosomal dominant:\n\n* Familial hypercholesterolemia\n* Marfan syndrome\n\nX-linked dominant:\n\n* Only a few, rare, disorders are X-linked dominant. One of these is hypophosphatemic rickets, also called vitamin D -resistant rickets.\n\n**Chromosomal Disorders**\n\nIn chromosomal disorders, the variant is due to either an excess or lack of the genes contained in a whole chromosome or chromosome segment.\n\nChromosomal disorders include:\n\n* 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome\n* Down syndrome\n* Klinefelter syndrome\n* Turner syndrome\n\n**Multifactorial Disorders**\n\nMany of the most common diseases are caused by interactions of several genes and factors in the environment (for example, illnesses in the mother and medicines). These include:\n\n* Asthma\n* Cancer\n* Coronary heart disease\n* Diabetes\n* Hypertension\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Genetics?**\n\nGenetics is the study of heredity, the process of a parent passing certain genes to their children.

    "content": "**Genital Herpes**\n\nAlso called: Herpes genitalis\n\n**Basics**\n\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area, buttocks, and thighs. You can get it from having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of herpes are called outbreaks. You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful, and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.\n\n**Repeat Outbreaks**\n\nRepeat outbreaks are common, especially during the first year. Over time, you get them less often and the symptoms become milder. The virus stays in your body for life.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nThere are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure. However, medicines can help lessen symptoms, decrease outbreaks, and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\n\n**Start Here**\n\n* About Genital Herpes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Genital Herpes (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)\n* Genital Herpes (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n* Also in Spanish\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Herpes (HSV) Test  (National Library of Medicine)\n* Also in Spanish\n\n**Images**\n\n* Genital Herpes (VisualDX)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Herpes Genitalis  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n* Article: High prevalence and incidence of HSV-2 among people who inject drugs... \n* Article: Sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis, genital HSV, and HPV) and female... \n* Article: Knowledge and attitude towards Herpes Simplex Virus-2 in Al-Jouf region, Saudi...\n\n---\n\n**Genital Herpes**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Genital Herpes?**\n    Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause painful blisters or sores on the genitals, buttocks, or thighs.\n*   **Symptoms of Genital Herpes**\n    The symptoms of genital herpes can include:\n    *   Painful blisters or sores on the genitals, buttocks, or thighs\n    *   Redness and swelling around the affected area\n    *   Itching or burning sensation in the affected area\n    *   Fever\n    *   Headache\n    *   Fatigue\n*   **Causes of Genital Herpes**\n    Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 usually causes oral herpes, while type 2 typically causes genital herpes.\n*   **Risk Factors for Genital Herpes**\n    The risk factors for genital herpes include:\n    *   Having multiple sexual partners\n    *   Engaging in unprotected sex\n    *   Having a history of STIs\n    *   Being under the age of 25\n*   **Diagnosing Genital Herpes**\n    Diagnosing genital herpes typically involves a physical exam and a review of your medical history. Your doctor may also perform a viral culture or PCR test to confirm the diagnosis.\n*   **Treating Genital Herpes**\n    There is no cure for genital herpes, but there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and prevent outbreaks. These include:\n    *   Antiviral medications\n    *   Topical creams or ointments\n    *   Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding triggers like stress or certain foods\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Genital Herpes**\n\nTo prevent genital herpes, you can take the following steps:\n\n*   Practice safe sex by using condoms or other barrier methods.\n*   Limit your number of sexual partners.\n*   Avoid engaging in unprotected sex.\n*   Get tested regularly for STIs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genital Herpes and Pregnancy**\n\nIf you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is essential to inform your healthcare provider. Genital herpes can increase the risk of passing the infection to your baby during delivery. Your healthcare provider may recommend a cesarean delivery to reduce this risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genital Herpes in Children**\n\nGenital herpes can occur in children, although it is rare. If you suspect that your child has genital herpes, consult with your pediatrician immediately. Treatment for genital herpes in children typically involves antiviral medications and supportive care.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genital Herpes Resources**\n\nFor more information on genital herpes, you can visit the following resources:\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n*   National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\n*   American Sexual Health Association (ASHA)\n\nRemember to consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about genital herpes.",

    "content": "**Genital Warts**\n\nAlso called: Condylomata acuminate, Venereal warts\n\n**What are genital warts?**\n\nGenital warts are a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many types of HPV. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types of HPV can cause cancer.\n\nThere is no treatment for HPV, but your health care provider can treat genital warts. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.\n\n**Who is at risk for genital warts?**\n\nIf you are sexually active, you can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. You can still get genital warts even if they are so small that you can't see them.\n\nIt doesn't happen often, but genital warts can also be spread from a woman to her baby during childbirth.\n\n**What are the symptoms of genital warts?**\n\nGenital warts are often painless and may not cause any symptoms. You might not even know that you have them. Sometimes, they can also cause itching, burning, bleeding, or discomfort.\n\nThe warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower.\n\n**How are genital warts diagnosed?**\n\nYour provider can usually find out if you have genital warts by seeing them during a physical exam or pelvic exam. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. Men may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin.\n\n**What are the treatments for genital warts?**\n\nThe warts might disappear on their own, stay the same, or grow bigger or increase in number. A few ways that your provider can treat them include:\n\n*   Use medicines, cream, or ointment\n*   Remove them by burning, freezing, or cutting out the warts\n\nHPV stays in your body even after treatment. This means that warts can come back, and you can still spread HPV to others after genital warts are removed.\n\n**Can genital warts be prevented?**\n\nGetting an HPV vaccine may help prevent genital warts. HPV vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before exposure to the virus. This means that it's best to get vaccinated before becoming sexually active. If you're over age 26 and haven't been vaccinated, talk with your provider about the possible benefits of vaccination.\n\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The best way to avoid infection is not to have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\n\n---\n\n**Genital Warts**\n\n**What are genital warts?**\n\nGenital warts are a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).

    "content": "**Genital Herpes - Self-Care**\n\nIt's normal to be worried after finding out that you have genital herpes. But know that you're not alone. Millions of people carry the virus. Although there is no cure, genital herpes can be treated. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for treatment and follow-up.\n\n**Future Outbreaks**\n\nOne type of herpes virus stays in the body by hiding within nerve cells. It can remain \"asleep\" (dormant) for a long time. The virus can \"wake up\" (reactivate) at any time, triggered by:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Genital irritation\n* Menstruation\n* Physical or emotional stress\n* Injury\n\nThe pattern of outbreaks varies widely in people with herpes. Some people carry the virus even though they've never had symptoms. Others may have only one outbreak or outbreaks that occur rarely. Some people have regular outbreaks that occur every 1 to 4 weeks.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTo ease symptoms:\n\n* Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin to relieve pain.\n* Apply cool compresses to sores several times a day to relieve pain and itching.\n* Women with sores on the vaginal lips (labia) can try urinating in a tub of water to avoid pain.\n\nDoing the following may help sores heal:\n\n* Wash sores gently with soap and water. Then pat dry.\n* Do not bandage sores. Air speeds healing.\n* Do not pick at sores. They can get infected, which slows healing.\n* Do not use ointment or lotion on sores unless your provider prescribes it.\n\nWear loose-fitting cotton underwear. Do not wear nylon or other synthetic pantyhose or underwear. Also, do not wear tight-fitting pants.\n\n**Medicine**\n\nGenital herpes cannot be cured. Antiviral medicine (acyclovir and related drugs) may relieve pain and discomfort and help the outbreak go away faster. It may also reduce the number of outbreaks. Follow your provider's instructions about how to take this medicine if it has been prescribed. There are two ways to take it:\n\nOne way is to take it for about 7 to 10 days only when symptoms occur. This typically shortens the time it takes for symptoms to clear up.\n\nThe other is to take it daily to prevent outbreaks.\n\nGenerally, there are very few if any side effects from this medicine. If they occur, side effects may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Rash\n* Seizures\n* Tremor\n\nConsider taking antiviral medicine daily to keep outbreaks from developing.\n\nTaking steps to keep yourself healthy can also minimize the risk for future outbreaks. Things you can do include:\n\n* Get plenty of sleep. This helps keep your immune system strong.\n* Eat healthy foods. Good nutrition also helps your immune system stay strong.\n* Keep stress low. Constant stress can weaken your immune system.\n* Protect yourself from the sun, wind, and extreme cold and heat. Use sunscreen, especially on your lips. On windy, cold, or hot days, stay indoors or take steps to guard against the weather.\n\n**Preventing the Spread of Herpes**\n\nEven when you do not have sores, you can pass (shed) the virus to someone during sexual or other close contact. To protect others:\n\n* Let any sexual partner know that you have herpes before having sex. Allow them to decide what to do.\n* Use latex or polyurethane condoms, and avoid sex during symptomatic outbreaks.\n* Do not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex when you have sores on or near the genitals, anus, or mouth.\n* Do not kiss or have oral sex when you have a sore on the lips or inside the mouth.\n* Do not share your towels, toothbrush, or lipstick. Make sure dishes and utensils you use are washed well with detergent before others use them.\n* Wash your hands well with soap and water after touching a sore.\n\nConsider using daily antiviral medicine to limit viral shedding and reduce the risk of passing the virus to your partner.\n\nYou may also want to consider getting your partner tested even if they have never had an outbreak. If you both have the herpes virus, there is no risk for transmission.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n* Symptoms of an outbreak that worsen despite medicine and self-care\n* Symptoms that include severe pain and sores that do not heal\n* Frequent outbreaks\n* Outbreaks during pregnancy\n\n---\n\n**Genital Herpes - Self-Care**\n\nYou're not alone.

    "content": "**Genital Herpes**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Genital Herpes?**\n\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). This article focuses on HSV type 2 infection.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGenital herpes affects the skin or mucous membranes of the genitals. The virus is spread from one person to another during sexual contact.\n\nThere are 2 types of HSV:\n\n*   HSV-1 most often affects the mouth and lips, causing cold sores or fever blisters. However, it can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.\n*   HSV type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes. It can be spread through skin contact or fluids from the mouth or genitals.\n\nYou may become infected with HSV if your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has HSV.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany people with genital herpes never have sores. Or they have very mild symptoms that go unnoticed or are mistaken for insect bites or another skin condition.\n\nIf signs and symptoms do occur during the first outbreak, they can be severe. This first outbreak most often happens within 2 days to 2 weeks of being infected.\n\nGeneral symptoms may include:\n\n*   Decreased appetite\n*   Fever\n*   General sick feeling (malaise)\n*   Muscle aches in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, or knees\n*   Swollen and tender lymph nodes in the groin\n\nGenital symptoms include small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluid. Areas where the sores may be found include:\n\n*   Outer vaginal lips (labia), vagina, cervix, around the anus, and on the thighs or buttocks (in women)\n*   Penis, scrotum, around the anus, on the thighs or buttocks (in men)\n*   Tongue, mouth, eyes, gums, lips, fingers, and other parts of the body (in both sexes)\n\nBefore the blisters appear, there may be tingling, burning, itching, or pain at the site where the blisters will appear. When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful. These ulcers crust over and heal in 7 to 14 days or more.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n*   Pain when passing urine\n*   Vaginal discharge (in women)\n*   Problems emptying the bladder that may require a urinary catheter\n\nA second outbreak can appear weeks or months later. It is most often less severe and it goes away sooner than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests can be done on skin sores or blisters to diagnose HSV. These tests are most often done when someone has a first outbreak and when a pregnant woman develops genital herpes symptoms. Tests include:\n\n*   Culture of fluid from a blister or open sore. This test may be positive for HSV. It is most useful during the first outbreak.\n*   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on fluid from a blister. This is the most accurate test to tell whether HSV is present in the blister.\n*   Blood tests that check for antibody level to HSV. These tests can identify whether a person has been infected with HSV, even between outbreaks. A positive test result when a person has never had an outbreak would indicate exposure to the virus at some time in the past.\n\nAt this time, experts do not recommend screening for HSV-1 or HSV-2 in adolescent or adults who have no symptoms, including pregnant women.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nGenital herpes cannot be cured. Medicines that fight viruses (such as acyclovir or valacyclovir) may be prescribed.\n\nThese medicines help relieve pain and discomfort during an outbreak by healing the sores more quickly. They seem to work better during a first attack than in later outbreaks.\nFor repeat outbreaks, the medicine should be taken as soon as tingling, burning, or itching begins, or as soon as blisters appear.\nPeople who have many outbreaks may take these medicines daily over a period of time. This helps prevent outbreaks or shorten their length. It can also reduce the chance of giving herpes to someone else.\nSide effects are rare with acyclovir and valacyclovir.\n\nPregnant women with a history of herpes may be treated during the last month of pregnancy to reduce the chance of having an outbreak at the time of delivery. If there is an outbreak around the time of delivery, a C-section will be recommended. This reduces the chance of infecting the baby.\n\nFollow your health care provider's advice on how to care for your herpes symptoms at home.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with genital herpes condition and their families can be found at a herpes support group.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOnce you are infected, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. Some people never have another episode. Others have frequent outbreaks that can be triggered by fatigue, illness, menstruation, or stress.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPregnant women who have an active genital herpes infection when they give birth may pass the infection to their baby. HSV can cause a brain infection in newborn babies. It is important that your provider know if you have herpes sores or have had an outbreak in the past. This will allow steps to be taken to prevent passing the infection to the baby.\n\nThe virus may spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, esophagus, liver, spinal cord, or lungs. These complications can develop in people who have a weakened immune system due to HIV or certain medicines.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have any symptoms of genital herpes or if you develop fever, headache, vomiting, or other symptoms during or after an outbreak of herpes.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf you have genital herpes, you should tell your partner that you have the disease, even if you do not have symptoms.\n\nCondoms are the best way to protect against catching genital herpes during sexual activity.\n\nUse a condom correctly and consistently to help prevent spread of the disease.\nOnly latex condoms prevent infection. Animal membrane (sheepskin) condoms do not work because the virus can pass through them.\nUsing the female condom also reduces the risk of spreading genital herpes.\nAlthough it is much less likely, you can still get genital herpes if you use a condom.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHerpes - genital; Herpes simplex - genital; Herpesvirus 1; HSV-1; Herpesvirus 2; HSV-2; HSV - antivirals\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

The virus is spread from one person to another during sexual contact.\n\nThere are 2 types of HSV:\n\n* HSV-1 most often affects the mouth and lips, causing cold sores or fever blisters.\n* HSV type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes, spreading through skin contact or fluids from the mouth or genitals.\n\nYou may become infected with HSV if your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has HSV. You are most likely to get HSV if you touch the skin of someone who has herpes sores, blisters, or a rash. The virus can still be spread even when no sores or other symptoms are present.\n\nGenital HSV-2 infections are more common in women than men.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany people with genital herpes never have sores or have very mild symptoms that go unnoticed or are mistaken for insect bites or another skin condition.\n\nIf signs and symptoms do occur during the first outbreak, they can be severe. This first outbreak most often happens within 2 days to 2 weeks of being infected.\n\nGeneral symptoms may include:\n\n* Decreased appetite\n* Fever\n* General sick feeling (malaise)\n* Muscle aches in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, or knees\n* Swollen and tender lymph nodes in the groin\n\nGenital symptoms include small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluid. Areas where the sores may be found include:\n\n* Outer vaginal lips (labia), vagina, cervix, around the anus, and on the thighs or buttocks (in women)\n* Penis, scrotum, around the anus, on the thighs or buttocks (in men)\n* Tongue, mouth, eyes, gums, lips, fingers, and other parts of the body (in both sexes)\n\nBefore the blisters appear, there may be tingling, burning, itching, or pain at the site where the blisters will appear. When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Pain when passing urine\n* Vaginal discharge (in women)\n* Problems emptying the bladder that may require a urinary catheter\n\nA second outbreak can appear weeks or months later. It is most often less severe and goes away sooner than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests can be done on skin sores or blisters to diagnose HSV. These tests are most often done when someone has a first outbreak and when a pregnant woman develops genital herpes symptoms. Tests include:\n\n* Culture of fluid from a blister or open sore\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on fluid from a blister\n* Blood tests that check for antibody level to HSV\n\n---\n\n**Genital Herpes**\n\n**What is Genital Herpes?**\n\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It affects the genital area, causing sores and blisters. There are two types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of genital herpes include:\n\n*   Sores or blisters in the genital area\n*   Painful urination\n*   Itching or burning sensation in the genital area\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose genital herpes, a healthcare provider may perform the following tests:\n\n*   Culture of fluid from a blister or open sore\n*   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on fluid from a blister\n*   Blood tests that check for antibody level to HSV\n\n**Treatment**\n\nGenital herpes cannot be cured. Medicines that fight viruses, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, may be prescribed to relieve pain and discomfort during an outbreak.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent genital herpes, use protection during sex, such as condoms or dental dams. Avoid having multiple sexual partners, and get tested regularly for STIs.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPregnant women who have an active genital herpes infection when they give birth may pass the infection to their baby. HSV can cause a brain infection in newborn babies. It is important that your provider know if you have herpes sores or have had an outbreak in the past. This will allow steps to be taken to prevent passing the infection to the baby.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have any symptoms of genital herpes or if you develop fever, headache, vomiting, or other symptoms during or after an outbreak of herpes.\n\n---\n\n**Genital Herpes**\n\nIf you have symptoms of genital herpes or if you develop fever, headache, vomiting, or other symptoms during or after an outbreak of herpes, contact your provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   If you have genital herpes, you should tell your partner that you have the disease, even if you do not have symptoms.\n*   Condoms are the best way to protect against catching genital herpes during sexual activity.\n*   Use a condom correctly and consistently to help prevent spread of the disease.\n*   Only latex condoms prevent infection. Animal membrane (sheepskin) condoms do not work because the virus can pass through them.\n*   Using the female condom also reduces the risk of spreading genital herpes.\n*   Although it is much less likely, you can still get genital herpes if you use a condom.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Herpes - genital\n*   Herpes simplex - genital\n*   Herpesvirus 1\n*   HSV-1\n*   Herpesvirus 2\n*   HSV-2\n*   HSV - antivirals\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Genital Warts**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are genital warts?**\n\nGenital warts are soft growths on the skin and mucous membranes of the genitals. They may be found on the penis, vulva, urethra, vagina, cervix, and around and in the anus.\n\n**How is genital warts spread?**\n\nGenital warts are spread through sexual contact.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe virus that causes genital warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are more than 180 types of HPV. Many cause no problems. Some cause warts on other parts of the body and not the genitals. Types 6 and 11 are most commonly linked to genital warts.\n\nCertain other types of HPV can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix, or to cervical cancer. These are called high-risk types of HPV. They can also lead to vaginal or vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and throat or mouth cancer.\n\nImportant facts about HPV:\n\nHPV infection spreads from one person to another through sexual contact involving the anus, mouth, or vagina. The virus can be spread, even if you do not see the warts.\nYou may not see warts for 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected. You may not notice them for years.\nNot everyone who has come into contact with the HPV virus and genital warts will develop them.\n\nYou are more likely to get genital warts and spread them more quickly if you:\n\nHave multiple sexual partners\nAre sexually active at an early age\nUse tobacco or alcohol\nHave a viral infection, such as herpes, and are stressed at the same time\nAre pregnant\nHave a weakened immune system due to a condition such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or from medicines\n\nIf a child has genital warts, sexual abuse should be suspected as a possible cause.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGenital warts can be so tiny, you cannot see them.\n\nThe warts can look like:\n\nFlesh-colored spots that are raised or flat\nGrowths that look like the top of a cauliflower\n\nIn females, genital warts can be found:\n\nInside the vagina or anus\nOutside the vagina or anus, or on nearby skin\nOn the cervix inside the body\n\nIn males, genital warts can be found on the:\n\nPenis\nScrotum\nGroin area\nThighs\nInside or around the anus\n\nHPV can also cause warts on the:\n\nLips\nMouth\nTongue\nThroat\n\nOther symptoms are rare, but can include:\n\nIncreased dampness in the genital area near the warts\nIncreased vaginal discharge\nGenital itching\nVaginal bleeding during or after sex\nExams and Tests\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. In women, this includes a pelvic exam.\n\nAn office procedure called colposcopy is used to spot warts that cannot be seen with the naked eye. It uses a light and a low-power microscope to help your provider find and then take samples (biopsy) of abnormal areas in your cervix. Colposcopy is usually done in response to an abnormal Pap test.\n\nHPV can cause abnormal results on a Pap test. If you have these types of changes, you may need more frequent Pap tests or a colposcopy.\n\nAn HPV DNA test can tell if you have a high-risk type of HPV known to cause cervical cancer. This test may be done:\n\nIf you have genital warts\nAs a screening test for cervical cancer women age 30 or older\nIn women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result\n\nMake sure you are screened for cervical, vaginal, vulvar, or anal cancer if you have been diagnosed with genital warts.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nGenital warts must be treated by a provider. Do not use over-the-counter medicines meant for other kinds of warts.\n\nTreatment may include:\n\nMedicines applied to the genital warts or injected by your provider\nPrescription medicine that you apply at home several times a week\n\nThe warts may also be removed with minor procedures, including:\n\nFreezing (cryosurgery)\nBurning (electrocauterization)\nLaser therapy\nSurgery\n\nIf you have genital warts, all of your sexual partners should be examined by a provider and treated if warts are found. Even if you do not have symptoms, you should be treated. This is to prevent complications and avoid spreading the condition to others.\n\nYou will need to return to your provider after treatment to make sure all the warts are gone.\n\nRoutine Pap tests are recommended if you are a woman who has had genital warts, or if your partner had them. If you had warts on your cervix, you may need to have Pap tests every 3 to 6 months for a time after the first treatment.\n\nWomen with precancerous changes caused by HPV infection may need further treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMany sexually active young women become infected with HPV. In many cases, HPV goes away on its own.\n\nMost men who become infected with HPV never develop any symptoms or problems from the infection. However, they can still pass it on to current and sometimes future sexual partners. Men are at increased risk for cancer of the penis, anus, and throat if they have a history of HPV infection.\n\nEven after you have been treated for genital warts, you may still infect others.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSome types of HPV can cause cancer of the cervix and vulva. They are the main cause of cervical cancer.\n\nGenital warts may become numerous and quite large. These will need further treatment.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if:\n\nA current or past sexual partner has genital warts.\nYou have visible warts on your external genitals, itching, discharge, or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Keep in mind that genital warts may not appear for months to years after having sexual contact with an infected person.\nYou think a young child might have genital warts.\n\nWomen should begin having Pap tests at age 21 or as recommended by their provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nHPV can be passed from person to person even when there are no visible warts or other symptoms. Practicing safer sex can help reduce your risk for getting HPV and cervical cancer:\n\nAlways use male and female condoms. But be aware that condoms cannot fully protect you. This is because the virus or warts can also be on the nearby skin.\nHave only one sexual partner, who you know is infection-free.\nLimit the number of sexual partners you have over time.\nAvoid partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities.\n\nAn HPV vaccine is available:\n\nIt protects against the HPV types that cause most HPV cancers in women and men. The vaccines DO NOT treat genital warts, they prevent the infection.\nThe vaccine can be given to boys and girls 9 to 12 years old. If the vaccine is given at this age, it is a series of 2 shots.\nIf the vaccine is given at 15 years or older, it is a series of 3 shots.\nThe vaccine can be given to adults age 27 to 45 years, after a discussion with their providers.\n\nAsk your provider whether the HPV vaccine is right for you or your child.\n\n---\n\n**Genital Warts**\n\nGenital warts are soft growths on the skin and mucous membranes of the genitals.

Females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.\n* **Skeletal Abnormalities**: Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. Affected individuals may also have:\n\t+ Joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees\n\t+ An inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot\n\t+ Bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis\n* **Intellectual Disability**: Genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe.\n* **Additional Features**: Affected individuals may have:\n\t+ An usually small head (microcephaly)\n\t+ Structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum)\n\t+ Distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples\n\t+ Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) leading to breathing and feeding difficulties\n\t+ Abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth\n\n---\n\n**Genitopatellar Syndrome**\n\nGenitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\nPeople with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as:\n\n* Prominent cheeks and eyes\n* A nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge\n* An unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism)\n* A narrowing of the head at the temples\n\nMany affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. The condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth.\n\n**Genital Abnormalities**\n\nIn affected males, genital abnormalities typically include:\n\n* Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)\n* Underdevelopment of the scrotum\n\nAffected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.\n\n**Skeletal Abnormalities**\n\nMissing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome.

At least 18 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGenitopatellar syndrome is caused by mutations in the KAT6B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase, which modifies histones and controls the activity of certain genes. The mutations that cause genitopatellar syndrome occur near the end of the KAT6B gene and lead to the production of a shortened histone acetyltransferase enzyme.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. All reported cases have resulted from new mutations in the gene and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n---\n\n**Genitopatellar Syndrome**\n\nGenitopatellar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by absent patellae, scrotal hypoplasia, renal anomalies, facial dysmorphism, and mental retardation.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

    "content": "**Gentamicin Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGentamicin injection is used to treat certain serious infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood, abdomen (stomach area), lungs, skin, bones, joints, and urinary tract. Gentamicin injection is in a class of medications called aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nGentamicin may cause serious kidney problems. Kidney problems may occur more often in older people or in people that are dehydrated. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: decreased urination; swelling of the face, arms, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\nGentamicin may cause serious hearing problems. Hearing problems may occur more often in older people. Hearing loss may be permanent in some cases. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had dizziness, vertigo, hearing loss, or ringing in the ears. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: hearing loss, roaring or ringing in the ears, or dizziness.\n\nGentamicin may cause nerve problems. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had burning or tingling in the hands, arms, feet, or legs; muscle twitching or weakness; or seizures.\n\nThe risk that you will develop serious kidney, hearing, or other problems is greater if you are taking certain prescription or nonprescription medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking acyclovir (Zovirax, Sitavig); amphotericin (Abelcet, Ambisome, Amphotec); capreomycin (Capastat); certain cephalosporin antibiotics such as cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol), cefixime (Suprax), or cephalexin (Keflex); cisplatin; colistin (Coly-Mycin S); cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Restasis, Sandimmune); diuretics ('water pills') such as bumetanide, ethacrynic acid (Edecrin), furosemide (Lasix), or torsemide (Demadex). other aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, kanamycin, neomycin (Neo-Fradin), paromomycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin; polymyxin B; or vancomycin (Vanocin). Your doctor may not want you to receive gentamicin injection.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while using gentamicin injection, call your doctor immediately. Gentamicin may harm the fetus.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests, including hearing tests, before and during treatment to check your body's response to gentamicin.\n\n---\n\n**Gentamicin Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGentamicin injection is used to treat certain serious infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood, abdomen (stomach area), lungs, skin, bones, joints, and urinary tract.\n\n**Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections**\n\nAntibiotics such as gentamicin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGentamicin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When gentamicin is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours once every 6 or 8 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have.\n\nYou may receive gentamicin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving gentamicin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions.\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with gentamicin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\n\nUse gentamicin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using gentamicin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nGentamicin is also sometimes used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis; a sexually transmitted disease), and other serious infections such as the plague and tularemia. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Gentamicin Injection**\n\n**What is Gentamicin Injection?**\n\nGentamicin injection is a medication used to treat serious bacterial infections, including those caused by gentamicin-resistant bacteria. It is also sometimes used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis; a sexually transmitted disease), and other serious infections such as the plague and tularemia.\n\n**What are the possible side effects of Gentamicin Injection?**\n\nGentamicin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* diarrhea\n* decreased appetite\n* pain at the injection site\n* headache\n* fever\n* joint pain\n* unusual tiredness\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using gentamicin injection:\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to gentamicin injection; other aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, kanamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, or tobramycin; sulfites; any other medications; or any of the ingredients in gentamicin injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements, you are taking or plan to take while using gentamicin injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* tell your doctor if you are or have or have ever had cystic fibrosis (an inherited condition that affects the lungs and digestive system), problems with your muscles such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using gentamicin injection.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.\n7. With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of your eye down to form a pocket.\n8. Place a small amount of ointment into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. A 1/2-inch (1.25-centimeter) strip of ointment usually is enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n9. Gently close your eyes and keep them closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.\n10. Replace and tighten the cap right away.\n11.

    "content": "**Gepirone: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGepirone has been discontinued in the US. Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated by ASHP PMI. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturers’ labeling be consulted for more recently available information.\n\n\\n\\n**Important Warning**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as gepirone during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take gepirone, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that gepirone is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take gepirone or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; or frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Your healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking gepirone, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nYour healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking fluvoxamine, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with gepirone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nNo matter your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\n\n---\n\n**Gepirone: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Before Taking Gepirone**\n\nNo matter your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition.\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts in Children, Teenagers, and Young Adults**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as gepirone during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions.\n\n**Adults Over 24 Years of Age**\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take gepirone or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.\n\n**Symptoms to Watch For**\n\nYou, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; or frenzied abnormal excitement.\n\n**Taking Gepirone**\n\nGepirone comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take gepirone at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**Dosing**\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of gepirone and gradually increase your dose depending on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience.\n\n**Important Reminders**\n\nGepirone controls depression, but does not cure it.

If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nIf you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes.\n\n**Managing Gestational Diabetes**\n\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:\n\n* You may experience high blood pressure\n* You may have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia\n* You may need to take diabetes medicines\n\nAfter pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:\n\n* Monitor your blood glucose levels regularly\n* Follow a healthy diet and exercise plan\n* Take any prescribed medications as directed by your healthcare provider\n\n---\n\n**Gestational Diabetes**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Gestational Diabetes?**\n\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is caused by the body's inability to produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of gestational diabetes is unknown, but it is believed to be related to hormonal changes during pregnancy. Women who are overweight or have a family history of diabetes are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGestational diabetes can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Increased thirst and urination\n* Fatigue\n* Blurred vision\n* Frequent infections\n* Cuts or wounds that are slow to heal\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nGestational diabetes is typically diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy using a glucose screening test. This involves drinking a sugary drink and then having your blood sugar levels checked.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for gestational diabetes usually involves dietary changes, such as eating smaller, more frequent meals, and increasing physical activity. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Complications**\n\nIf left untreated, gestational diabetes can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including:\n\n* Fetal macrosomia (large baby)\n* Fetal distress\n* Premature birth\n* Birth injuries\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent gestational diabetes, maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active can reduce the risk of developing the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Resources**\n\nFor more information on gestational diabetes, you can visit:\n\n* American Diabetes Association\n* Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n* Also in Spanish\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "content": "**Gestational Age**\n\nGestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb.\n\n**What is Gestational Age?**\n\nGestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.\n\n**Premature and Postmature Infants**\n\nInfants born before 37 weeks are considered premature. Infants born after 42 weeks are considered postmature.\n\n**Determining Gestational Age**\n\nGestational age can be determined before or after birth.\n\n* Before birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb.\n* After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair.\n\n**Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA)**\n\nIf the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA). AGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their gestational age.\n\n**Weight Ranges for Full-Term Infants**\n\nThe weight for full-term infants that are born AGA will most often be between 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds [lbs] or 2.5 kilograms [kg]) and 4,000 grams (about 8.8 lbs or 4 kg).\n\n**Small for Gestational Age (SGA) and Large for Gestational Age (LGA)**\n\n* Infants weighing less than 2,500 grams are considered small for gestational age (SGA).\n* Infants weighing more than 4,000 grams are considered large for gestational age (LGA).\n\n---\n\n**Gestational Age**\n\nGestational age is a measure of the development of a fetus, typically expressed in weeks from the start of the mother's last menstrual period. It can be determined before or after birth.\n\n**Before Birth**\n\nBefore birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone.

    "content": "**Gestational Diabetes - Self-Care**\n\n_Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that starts during pregnancy. If you've been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, learn how to manage your blood sugar so that you and your baby stay healthy._\n\n**What is Gestational Diabetes?**\n\n_Insulin is a hormone produced in an organ called the pancreas. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar into the body's cells. Inside the cells, glucose is used for energy. Some of it may be stored for later use. Pregnancy hormones can block insulin from doing its job. When this happens, glucose level may increase in a pregnant woman's blood._\n\n_With gestational diabetes:_\n\n_* There are no symptoms in many cases._\n_* Mild symptoms may include increased thirst or shakiness. These symptoms are most often not life threatening to the pregnant woman._\n_* A woman may give birth to a large baby. This can increase the chance of problems with the delivery including an increased risk of requiring a cesarean section for delivery._\n_* A woman has a higher risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy._\n\n---\n\n**Gestational Diabetes - Self-Care**\n\nYou can lower your chance of getting gestational diabetes by becoming pregnant when you are at your ideal body weight. If you are overweight, try to lose weight before pregnancy.\n\nIf you do develop gestational diabetes:\n\n*   A healthy diet can keep your blood sugar controlled and may keep you from needing medicine.\n*   Exercise will help keep your blood sugar under control. A low-impact activity such as walking is a safe and effective type of exercise.\n*   If changing your diet and exercising don't control your blood sugar level, you may need oral medicine (taken by mouth) or insulin therapy (shots).\n\n**What are the Risks of Gestational Diabetes?**\n\nBlood sugar that is too high raises the risks for:\n\n*   Stillbirth\n*   Very small baby (fetal growth restriction) or very large baby (macrosomia)\n*   Difficult labor or cesarean birth (C-section)\n*   Problems with blood sugar or electrolytes in the baby during the first few days after delivery\n\n**Checking Your Blood Sugar**\n\nYou can see how well you are doing by testing your blood sugar level at home. Your provider may ask you to check your blood sugar several times each day.\n\nThe most common way to check is by pricking your finger and drawing a drop of blood. Then, you place the blood drop in a monitor (testing machine) that measures your blood glucose. If the result is too high or too low, you will need to closely monitor your blood sugar level.\n\n**Visits and Tests for You and Your Baby**\n\nYour provider will closely check both you and your baby throughout your pregnancy. This will include:\n\n*   Visits with your provider as often as every week\n*   Ultrasounds that show the size of your baby\n*   A non-stress test that shows whether your baby is doing well\n\nIf you need insulin or oral medicine to control your blood sugar, you may need to have labor induced 1 or 2 weeks before your due date.\n\n**After Your Delivery**\n\nHigh blood sugar levels often go back to normal after delivery. Still, many women with gestational diabetes develop diabetes within 5 to 10 years after giving birth. The risk is greater in obese women.\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth. They should also continue to get checked at future clinic appointments for signs of diabetes that is persisting.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your provider for the following diabetes-related problems:\n\n*   Your baby seems to be moving less in your belly\n*   You have blurred vision\n*   You're more thirsty than normal\n*   You have nausea and vomiting that won't go away\n\nIt's normal to feel stressed or down about being pregnant and having diabetes. But, if these emotions are overwhelming you, call your provider. Your health care team is there to help you.\n\n**Managing Gestational Diabetes**\n\nManaging gestational diabetes requires a combination of healthy diet, regular exercise, and monitoring of blood sugar levels. By following these steps, women with gestational diabetes can reduce their risk of complications and ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome for both themselves and their baby.\n\n---\n\n**Gestational Diabetes - Self-Care**\n\n\\n\\nWhen you are at your ideal body weight can help lower your chance of getting gestational diabetes. If you are overweight, try to lose weight before pregnancy.\n\nIf you do develop gestational diabetes:\n\n*   A healthy diet can keep your blood sugar controlled and may keep you from needing medicine. Healthy eating can also keep you from gaining too much weight in your pregnancy.\n*   Your health care provider, nurse, or dietitian will create a diet just for you. Your provider may ask you to keep track of what you eat.\n*   Exercise will help keep your blood sugar under control. A low-impact activity such as walking is a safe and effective type of exercise. Try walking 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 kilometers) at a time, 3 or more times per week. Swimming or using an elliptical machine work just as well.\n*   If changing your diet and exercising don't control your blood sugar level, you may need oral medicine (taken by mouth) or insulin therapy (shots).\n\n**Managing Your Blood Sugar**\n\nYou can see how well you are doing by testing your blood sugar level at home.

    "content": "**Gestational Diabetes**\n\n_Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that starts or is first diagnosed during pregnancy._\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Pregnancy hormones can inhibit insulin from doing its job. When this happens, glucose level may increase in a pregnant woman's blood._\n\nYou are at greater risk for gestational diabetes if you:\n\n* Are older than 25 when you are pregnant\n* Come from a higher risk ethnic group, such as Latino, African American, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander\n* Have a family history of diabetes\n* Gave birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds (4 kg) or had a birth defect\n* Have high blood pressure\n* Have too much amniotic fluid\n* Have had an unexplained miscarriage or stillbirth\n* Were overweight before your pregnancy\n* Gain too much weight during your pregnancy\n* Have polycystic ovary syndrome\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_Most of the time, there are no symptoms. The diagnosis is made during a routine prenatal screening._\n\nMild symptoms, such as increased thirst or shakiness, may be present. These symptoms are usually not dangerous to the pregnant woman.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Blurred vision\n* Fatigue\n* Frequent infections, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin\n* Increased thirst\n* Increased urination\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n_Gestational diabetes most often starts halfway through the pregnancy. All pregnant women should receive an oral glucose tolerance test (glucose challenge test) between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy to look for the condition._\n\nOnce you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you can see how well you are doing by testing your glucose level at home. The most common way involves pricking your finger and putting a drop of your blood on a machine that will give you a glucose reading.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n_The goals of treatment are to keep blood sugar (glucose) level within normal limits during the pregnancy, and to make sure that the growing baby is healthy._\n\n* WATCHING YOUR BABY\n\t+ Your provider should closely check both you and your baby throughout your pregnancy.\n\t+ Fetal monitoring will check the size and health of your baby.\n* A nonstress test is a very simple, painless test for you and your baby.\n* A machine that hears and displays your baby's heartbeat (electronic fetal monitor) is placed on your abdomen.\n* Your provider can compare the pattern of your baby's heartbeat to movements and find out whether the baby is doing well.\n* If you take medicine to control diabetes, you may need to be monitored more often toward the end of your pregnancy.\n\n**DIET AND EXERCISE**\n\n_In many cases, eating healthy foods, staying active, and managing your weight are all that are needed to treat gestational diabetes._\n\nThe best way to improve your diet is by eating a variety of healthy foods. You should learn how to read food labels and check them when making food decisions. Talk to your provider if you are a vegetarian or on another special diet.\n\nIn general, when you have gestational diabetes, your diet should:\n\n* Be moderate in fat and protein\n* Provide carbohydrates through foods that include fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice)\n* Be low in foods that contain a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries\n\nTalk with your provider about the physical activities that are right for you. Low-impact exercises, such as swimming, brisk walking, or using an elliptical machine are safe ways to control your blood sugar and weight.\n\nIf managing your diet and exercising don't control your blood sugar, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine or insulin therapy.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n_There are many risks of having diabetes in pregnancy when blood sugar is not well controlled. With good control, most pregnancies have good outcomes._\n\nPregnant women with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies at birth. This can increase the chance of problems at the time of delivery, including:\n\n* Birth injury (trauma) because of the baby's large size\n* Delivery by C-section\n\nYour baby is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the first few days of life, and may need to be monitored in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a few days.\n\nMothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy and increased risk for preterm delivery. Mothers with seriously uncontrolled blood sugar have a higher risk for stillbirth.\n\nAfter delivery:\n\n* Your high blood sugar (glucose) level often goes back to normal.\n* You should be closely followed for signs of diabetes over the next 5 to 10 years after delivery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n_Contact your provider if you are pregnant and you have symptoms of diabetes._\n\n**Prevention**\n\n_Early prenatal care and having regular checkups helps improve your health and the health of your baby. Getting prenatal screening at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy will help detect gestational diabetes early._\n\nIf you are overweight, getting your weight within the normal body mass index (BMI) range will decrease your risk for gestational diabetes.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n_Glucose intolerance during pregnancy_\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 9.
