    "content": "**Bimekizumab-bkzx Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBimekizumab-bkzx injection is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in certain adults. It is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin) in adults. Bimekizumab-bkzx injection is also used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas, causing pain and joint damage) in adults. It is also used to treat active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain and signs of swelling, but without changes seen on x-ray) in adults.\n\n\\n\\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBimekizumab-bkzx comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe and as a prefilled autoinjector to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). To treat plaque psoriasis, it is usually injected once every 4 weeks for the first 5 doses and then once every 8 weeks after that. To treat psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, it is usually injected once every 4 weeks.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nAlways look at bimekizumab-bkzx solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear or slightly yellow. The liquid should not contain visible particles. Do not use a syringe or autoinjector if it is cracked or broken, if it is expired or frozen, or if the liquid is cloudy or contains small particles.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBimekizumab-bkzx may help to control your symptoms, but will not cure your condition. Continue to use bimekizumab-bkzx even if you feel well. Do not stop using bimekizumab-bkzx without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are injecting bimekizumab-bkzx injection yourself, follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bimekizumab-bkzx injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nUse each syringe or autoinjector only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or autoinjector. Dispose of used syringes and autoinjector in a puncture-resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Bimekizumab-bkzx Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Important:** Use bimekizumab-bkzx injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Administering the Medication**\n\nYou may receive your first dose of bimekizumab-bkzx injection in your doctor's office. If you are an adult, your doctor may allow you or a caregiver to perform the bimekizumab-bkzx injections at home after you have been trained. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject and prepare it.\n\n**Preparing the Medication**\n\nUse each syringe or autoinjector only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or autoinjector. Dispose of used syringes and autoinjector in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\nRemove the prefilled syringe or autoinjector from the refrigerator. Place it on a flat surface without removing the needle cap and allow it warm to room temperature for 30-45 minutes before you are ready to inject the medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, leaving it in sunlight, or through any other method.\n\n**Inspecting the Medication**\n\nDo not shake a syringe or autoinjector that contains bimekizumab-bkzx. Always look at bimekizumab-bkzx solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear or slightly yellow. The liquid should not contain visible particles. Do not use a syringe or autoinjector if it is cracked or broken, if it is expired or frozen, or if the liquid is cloudy or contains small particles.\n\n**Injecting the Medication**\n\nYou can inject bimekizumab-bkzx injection anywhere on the front of your thighs (upper leg) or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. If you have a caregiver to inject the medication, the back of the upper arm may also be used. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Do not inject bimekizumab-bkzx into an area affected by psoriasis. If your doctor has told you to inject two syringes of bimekizumab-bkzx for each dose, choose a different spot for each injection.\n\n**Patient Information**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use) when you begin treatment with bimekizumab-bkzx injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website to obtain the Medication Guide, or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide and the Instructions for Use.\n\n**Important:** Bimekizumab-bkzx may help to control your symptoms, but will not cure your condition. Continue to use bimekizumab-bkzx even if you feel well. Do not stop using bimekizumab-bkzx without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Bimekizumab-bkzx Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using bimekizumab-bkzx, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bimekizumab-bkzx, medications, or any of the ingredients in bimekizumab-bkzx injection. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking bimekizumab-bkzx. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or attempt or thoughts of harming yourself, liver problems, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; a group of conditions that cause swelling of the lining of the intestines) such as Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) or ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum).\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using bimekizumab-bkzx, call your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if you have recently received a vaccine.

It is important that adults receive all age-appropriate vaccines before beginning treatment with infliximab.\n\nYou should know that bimekizumab-bkzx injection has caused suicidal thoughts and behaviors (thoughts or attempts to harm yourself). Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression or anxiety, thoughts of suicide, dying or hurting yourself, changes in behavior or mood, acting on dangerous impulses, or attempt to commit suicide.\n\nYou should know that bimekizumab-bkzx injection may decrease your ability to fight infection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi and increase the risk that you will get a serious or life-threatening infection. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you have or think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as herpes or cold sores), and chronic infections that do not go away. If you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment with bimekizumab-bkzx injection, call your doctor immediately: fever, sweats, or chills, muscle aches, shortness of breath, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea, stomach pain, frequent, urgent, or painful urination, or other signs of infection. Your doctor will probably delay your treatment with bimekizumab-bkzx injection if you have an infection.\n\nYou should know that using bimekizumab-bkzx injection increases the risk that you will develop tuberculosis (TB; a serious lung infection), especially if you are already infected with tuberculosis but do not have any symptoms of the disease. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB, if you have lived in a country where TB is common, or if you have been around someone who has TB. Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using bimekizumab-bkzx injection.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n(Repeated section for emphasis)\n\n---\n\n**Bimekizumab-bkzx Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n*   **TB Infection Screening**\n    *   Before starting treatment, your doctor will perform a skin test to check for inactive TB infection.\n    *   If necessary, you'll receive medication to treat the infection.\n\n**Symptoms of TB**\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms or develop them during treatment, call your doctor immediately:\n\n*   Cough\n*   Coughing up blood or mucus\n*   Weakness or tiredness\n*   Weight loss\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Chills\n*   Fever\n*   Night sweats\n\n**Dietary Instructions**\n\nUnless your doctor advises otherwise, continue with your normal diet.\n\n**Missing a Dose**\n\nInject the missed dose as soon as you remember it and resume your regular dosing schedule.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nBimekizumab-bkzx injection may cause side effects.

    "content": "**Biodefense and Bioterrorism**\n\nA bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease, spread, or resist medical treatment.\n\nBiological agents spread through the air, water, or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax, botulism, Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague, or smallpox could be used as biological agents.\n\nBiodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism.

They measure your heart rate, blood pressure, or other bodily function. A monitor displays the results. A tone or other sound may be used to let you know when you have reached a goal or certain state.\n\nYour health care provider will describe a situation and guide you through relaxation techniques. The monitor lets you see how your heart rate and blood pressure change in response to being stressed or remaining relaxed.\n\n**What Can Biofeedback Help With?**\n\nBiofeedback teaches you how to control and change these bodily functions. By doing so, you feel more relaxed or more able to cause specific muscle relaxation processes. This may help treat conditions such as:\n\n* Anxiety and insomnia\n* Constipation\n* Tension and migraine headaches\n* Urinary incontinence\n* Pain disorders such as headache or fibromyalgia\n* Alcoholism and other substance use disorders\n\n---\n\n**Biofeedback**\n\nk teaches you how to control and change these bodily functions.

    "content": "**Biotin**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBiotin (vitamin B7) is a vitamin found in foods like eggs, milk, and bananas. Biotin deficiency can cause thinning of the hair and a rash on the face.\n\nBiotin is an important part of enzymes in the body that break down substances like fats, carbohydrates, and others. There isn't a good test for detecting low biotin levels, so it's usually identified by its symptoms, which include thinning hair and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BIOTIN are as follows:\n\n* Likely effective for:\n\t+ Biotin deficiency. Taking biotin by mouth or by a shot can treat and prevent low blood levels of biotin.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Multiple sclerosis (MS). Taking high-dose biotin by mouth does not reduce disability in people with MS.\n\t+ Rough, scaly skin on the scalp and face (seborrheic dermatitis). Taking biotin does not seem to help improve rash in infants.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Biotin is likely safe for most people when taken in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months. But it is more commonly used in lower doses of 2.5 mg daily.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Biotin is likely safe for most people when applied in cosmetic products that contain up to 0.6% biotin.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Biotin is likely safe when used in recommended amounts during pregnancy and breast-feeding.\n* Children: Biotin is likely safe when taken by mouth. It's been used safely in doses of 5-25 mcg daily.\n* An inherited condition in which the body cannot process biotin (biotinidase deficiency): People with this condition might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement.\n* Kidney dialysis: People receiving kidney dialysis might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement.\n* Smoking: People who smoke might have low biotin levels and may need a biotin supplement.\n\nLaboratory tests: Taking biotin supplements might interfere with the results of many different blood lab tests. Biotin can cause falsely high or falsely low test results. This might lead to missed or incorrect diagnoses. Tell your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements, especially if you are having lab tests done. You may need to stop taking biotin before your blood test.\n\n---\n\n**Biotin: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nBefore taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   None listed\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid\nTaking alpha-lipoic acid and biotin together can reduce the absorption of both alpha-lipoic acid and biotin into the body.\n\nVitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)\nTaking biotin and vitamin B5 together can reduce the absorption of both biotin and vitamin B5 into the body.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   Alpha-lipoic acid: Taking alpha-lipoic acid and biotin together can reduce the absorption of both alpha-lipoic acid and biotin into the body.\n*   Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid): Taking biotin and vitamin B5 together can reduce the absorption of both biotin and vitamin B5 into the body.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nEating 2 or more uncooked egg whites daily for several months can cause biotin deficiency. Raw egg whites bind to biotin in the stomach and prevent the body from absorbing it.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\n*   Uncooked egg whites: Eating 2 or more uncooked egg whites daily for several months can cause biotin deficiency. Raw egg whites bind to biotin in the stomach and prevent the body from absorbing it.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nSmall amounts of biotin are found in foods such as eggs, milk, and bananas. It's recommended that adults consume 30 mcg daily. The same amount should be consumed during pregnancy. When breast-feeding, 35 mcg should be consumed daily. Recommended amounts for children depend on age. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n*   Adults: 30 mcg daily\n*   Pregnancy: 30 mcg daily\n*   Breast-feeding: 35 mcg daily\n*   Children: Recommended amounts depend on age\n\n**Other names**\n\nBiotina, Biotine, Biotine-D, Coenzyme R, D-Biotin, Vitamin B7, Vitamin H, Vitamine B7, Vitamine H, W Factor, Cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno[3,4-d]-imidazole-4-valeric Acid.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n*   Biotina\n*   Biotine\n*   Biotine-D\n*   Coenzyme R\n*   D-Biotin\n*   Vitamin B7\n*   Vitamin H\n*   Vitamine B7\n*   Vitamine H\n*   W Factor\n*   Cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno[3,4-d]-imidazole-4-valeric Acid\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\nValentim FO, Miola AC, Miot HA, Schmitt JV.

    "content": "**Biotinidase Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nBiotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to recycle the vitamin biotin. If this condition is not recognized and treated, its signs and symptoms typically appear within the first few months of life, although it can also become apparent later in childhood.\n\nProfound biotinidase deficiency, the more severe form of the condition, can cause seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, hearing and vision loss, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), skin rashes, hair loss (alopecia), and a fungal infection called candidiasis. Affected children also have delayed development. Lifelong treatment can prevent these complications from occurring or improve them if they have already developed.\n\nPartial biotinidase deficiency is a milder form of this condition. Without treatment, affected children may experience hypotonia, skin rashes, and hair loss, but these problems may appear only during illness, infection, or other times of stress.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nProfound or partial biotinidase deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the BTD gene cause biotinidase deficiency. The BTD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called biotinidase. This enzyme recycles biotin, a B vitamin found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. Biotinidase removes biotin that is bound to proteins in food, leaving the vitamin in its free (unbound) state. Free biotin is needed by enzymes called biotin-dependent carboxylases to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.\n\nBecause several of these enzymes are impaired in biotinidase deficiency, the condition is considered a form of multiple carboxylase deficiency. Mutations in the BTD gene reduce or eliminate the activity of biotinidase. Profound biotinidase deficiency results when the activity of biotinidase is reduced to less than 10 percent of normal. Partial biotinidase deficiency occurs when biotinidase activity is reduced to between 10 percent and 30 percent of normal.\n\nWithout enough of this enzyme, biotin cannot be recycled. The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases, leading to a buildup of potentially toxic compounds in the body. If the condition is not treated promptly, this buildup damages various cells and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms described above.\n\n---\n\n**Biotinidase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Biotinidase Deficiency?**\n\nBiotinidase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BTD gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called biotinidase.

This is called a manic episode.\n* Other times you may feel \"down,\" sad, indifferent, or hopeless. This is called a depressive episode.\n* You may have both manic and depressive symptoms together. This is called a mixed episode.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong illness that can cause intense mood swings, changes in behavior, energy levels, and activity levels. There are three main types of bipolar disorder: Bipolar I disorder, Bipolar II disorder, and Cyclothymic disorder. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors likely play a role in the disorder.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose bipolar disorder, your health care provider may use many tools:\n\n* A physical exam\n* A medical history, which will include asking about your symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and family history\n* Medical tests to rule out other conditions\n* A mental health evaluation. Your provider may do the evaluation or may refer you to a mental health specialist to get one.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nTreatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. The main treatments for bipolar disorder include medicines, psychotherapy, or both:\n\n* Medicines can help control the symptoms of bipolar disorder.\n* Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors.\n* Other treatment options include:\n\t+ Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms.\n\t+ Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression.\n\t+ Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n\t+ Healthy lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise, having a consistent sleep schedule, and keeping a mood journal.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong illness.

Periods of feeling sad and depressed may alternate with periods of intense excitement and activity or being cross or irritable.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nBipolar disorder affects men and women equally. It most often starts between ages 15 and 25. The exact cause is not known, but it occurs more often in relatives of people with bipolar disorder.\n\nThe following may trigger a manic episode:\n\n*   Childbirth\n*   Medicines, such as antidepressants or steroids\n*   Periods of not being able to sleep (insomnia)\n*   Recreational drug use\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe manic phase may last from days to months. It may include these symptoms:\n\n*   Easily distracted\n*   Excess involvement in activities\n*   Little need for sleep\n*   Poor judgment\n*   Poor temper control\n*   Lack of self-control and reckless behavior, such as drinking or using illegal drugs in excess, having increased and risky sex, gambling, and spending or giving away a lot of money\n*   Very irritable mood, racing thoughts, talking a lot, and false beliefs about self or abilities\n*   Rapid speech\n*   Concerns about things that are not true (delusions)\n\nThe depressive episode may include these symptoms:\n\n*   Daily low mood or sadness\n*   Problems concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\n*   Eating problems such as loss of appetite and weight loss or overeating and weight gain\n*   Fatigue or lack of energy\n*   Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or guilt\n*   Loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed\n*   Loss of self-esteem\n*   Thoughts of death or suicide\n*   Trouble getting to sleep or sleeping too much\n*   Pulling away from friends or activities that were once enjoyed\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose bipolar disorder, your health care provider may do some or all of the following:\n\n*   Ask whether other family members have bipolar disorder\n*   Ask about your recent mood swings and for how long you have had them\n*   Perform a thorough exam and order lab tests to look for other illnesses that may be causing symptoms that resemble bipolar disorder\n*   Talk to family members about your symptoms and overall health\n*   Ask about any health problems you have and any medicines you take\n*   Watch your behavior and mood\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to:\n\nMake the episodes less frequent and severe\nHelp you function well and enjoy your life at home and at work\nPrevent self-injury and suicide\n\nMedicines are a key part of treating bipolar disorder. Most often, the first medicines used are called mood stabilizers. They help you avoid mood swings and extreme changes in activity and energy levels.\n\nWith medicines, you may begin to feel better. However, for some people, symptoms of mania may feel good. Some people have side effects from the medicines. As a result, you may be tempted to stop taking your medicines or change the way you are taking them. But stopping your medicines or taking them in the wrong way can cause symptoms to come back or become much worse. Do not stop taking or change the dosages of your medicines. Talk with your provider if you have questions about your medicines.\n\nAsk family members or friends to help you take medicines the right way. This means taking the right dose at the right time. They can also help make sure that episodes of mania and depression are treated as soon as possible.\n\nIf mood stabilizers do not help, your provider may suggest other medicines, such as antipsychotics or antidepressants.\n\nYou will need regular visits with your provider (often a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner) to talk about your medicines and their possible side effects. Blood tests are often needed, too.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nPeriods of depression or mania return in most people, even with treatment. People may also have issues with alcohol or illegal drug use. They may also have problems with relationships, school, work, and finances.\n\nSuicide is a very real risk during both mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder who think or talk about suicide need emergency attention right away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek help right away if you:\n\nHave symptoms of mania\nFeel the urge to hurt yourself or others\nFeel hopeless, scared, or overwhelmed\nSee or hear things that are not there\nFeel you cannot leave the house\nAre not able to care for yourself\n\nContact your treating provider if:\n\nSymptoms are getting worse.\nYou have side effects from medicines.\nYou are not taking medicine the right way.\n\nIf you are thinking about hurting yourself or others, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n---\n\n**Bipolar Disorder**\n\n_Bipolar disorder is a mental condition in which a person has wide or extreme swings in their mood._\n\n_Causes_\n\n_Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally. It most often starts between ages 15 and 25. The exact cause is not known, but it occurs more often in relatives of people with bipolar disorder._\n\n_In most people with bipolar disorder, there is no clear cause for the periods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (mania) or depression and low activity or energy (depression).

It may include these symptoms:\n\n*   Easily distracted\n*   Excess involvement in activities\n*   Little need for sleep\n*   Poor judgment\n*   Poor temper control\n*   Lack of self-control and reckless behavior, such as drinking or using illegal drugs in excess, having increased and risky sex, gambling, and spending or giving away a lot of money\n*   Very irritable mood, racing thoughts, talking a lot, and false beliefs about self or abilities\n*   Rapid speech\n*   Concerns about things that are not true (delusions)\n\nThe depressive episode may include these symptoms:\n\n*   Daily low mood or sadness\n*   Problems concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\n*   Eating problems such as loss of appetite and weight loss or overeating and weight gain\n*   Fatigue or lack of energy\n*   Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or guilt\n*   Loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed\n*   Loss of self-esteem\n*   Thoughts of death or suicide\n*   Trouble getting to sleep or sleeping too much\n*   Pulling away from friends or activities that were once enjoyed\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder are at high risk for suicide.

The pattern is not the same in all people with bipolar disorder:\n\n*   Depression and mania symptoms may occur together. This is called a mixed state.\n*   Symptoms may also occur right after each other. This is called rapid cycling.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose bipolar disorder, your health care provider may do some or all of the following:\n\n*   Ask whether other family members have bipolar disorder\n*   Ask about your recent mood swings and for how long you have had them\n*   Perform a thorough exam and order lab tests to look for other illnesses that may be causing symptoms that resemble bipolar disorder\n*   Talk to family members about your symptoms and overall health\n*   Ask about any health problems you have and any medicines you take\n*   Watch your behavior and mood\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to:\n\n*   Make the episodes less frequent and severe\n*   Help you function well and enjoy your life at home and at work\n*   Prevent self-injury and suicide\n\nMedicines are a key part of treating bipolar disorder.

Some types can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n**Types of Birth Control**\n\nThere are several different types of birth control, and they work in different ways:\n\n* **Barrier Methods**\n\t+ Male condom: A thin sheath that covers the penis to collect sperm and prevent it from entering the woman's body. Condoms that are made of latex and polyurethane can help prevent STIs.\n\t+ Female condom: A thin, flexible plastic pouch. Part of the condom is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to prevent sperm from entering the uterus.\n\t+ Contraceptive sponge: A small sponge that you put into the vagina to cover the cervix (the opening of the uterus). The sponge also contains a spermicide to kill sperm.\n\t+ Spermicide: A substance that can kill sperm cells. It comes in a foam, jelly, cream, suppository, or film. You put it into the vagina near the uterus. Spermicide can be used alone or with a diaphragm or cervical cap.\n\t+ Diaphragm and cervical cap: Cups that are placed inside the vagina to cover the cervix. They may be used with spermicide. They come in different sizes, so it's important to see your health care provider to figure out which size works best for you.\n* **Hormonal Methods**\n\t+ Oral contraceptives (\"the pill\"): Pills that a woman takes every day. They may contain only progestin or both progestin and estrogen.\n\t+ Contraceptive patch: A patch that a woman puts on her skin each week. The patch releases hormones into the bloodstream.\n\t+ Vaginal ring: A thin, flexible ring. The woman inserts the ring into the vagina, where it continually releases hormones for three weeks. She takes it out for the fourth week. After that week, she puts in a new ring.\n\t+ Injectable birth control: An injection of a hormone that a woman gets once every three months. This is done in your provider's office.\n* **Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)**\n\t+ Intrauterine device (IUD): A small, T-shaped device that a provider inserts into the uterus. This is done in the provider's office. IUDs can last from 3 to 10 years. There are two types: hormonal IUDs and copper IUDs.\n* **Sterilization**\n\t+ Tubal ligation: A surgery that prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is permanent.\n\t+ Vasectomy: A surgery that prevents a man from getting someone pregnant. It is permanent.\n\n**Other Forms of Pregnancy Prevention**\n\nThere are some types of pregnancy prevention that do not involve medicines, devices, or surgery:\n\n* **Fertility Awareness-Based Methods**: They are also called natural rhythm methods. They involve tracking the woman's fertility cycle and avoiding sex or using barrier methods on the days when she is most likely to get pregnant. This method may have higher pregnancy rates than other types.\n* **Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)**: A form of natural birth control for breastfeeding mothers. It relies on the new mother feeding her baby only breastmilk for up to six months and having no periods or spotting during that time.\n* **Withdrawal**: During intercourse, the penis is pulled out of the vagina before ejaculation. The goal is to keep sperm from entering the vagina . But the sperm can leak out before the penis is pulled out, so this method has higher pregnancy rates than other types.\n\n**Emergency Contraception**\n\nEmergency contraception is not a regular method of birth control. But it can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or if a condom breaks. There are two types:\n\n* **Copper IUD**: A small, T-shaped device that a provider inserts into the within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.\n* **Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs)**: Hormonal pills which the woman takes as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse.\n\n**What Else Should I Know About Birth Control?**\n\nWhen deciding which birth control type is right for you, there are many different factors to consider:\n\n* Do you want to have children someday? How soon?\n* Do you have any health conditions?\n* How often do you have sex?\n* How many sex partners do you have?\n* Do you also need protection from HIV and other STIs?\n* How well does the birth control method work?\n* Are there any side effects?\n* Will you be able to use it correctly every time?\n* How much does it cost?\n\nYour provider can answer your questions about birth control to help you select the best type for you.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control | Contraception | Contraceptives**\n\n**What is Birth Control?**\n\nBirth control, also known as contraception, is the use of medicines, devices, or surgery to prevent pregnancy.

    "content": "**Birth Defects**\n\nA birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body. Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.\n\n**What are birth defects?**\n\nA birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.\n\n**What causes birth defects?**\n\nFor some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include:\n\n* Genetics: One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly.\n* Chromosomal problems: In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing.\n* Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances.\n* Infections during pregnancy.\n* Lack of certain nutrients.\n\n**Who is at risk of having a baby with birth defects?**\n\nCertain factors may increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as:\n\n* Smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancy\n* Having certain medical conditions before and during pregnancy\n* Taking certain medicines\n* Having someone in your family with a birth defect\n* Being an older mother, typically over the age of 34 years\n\n**How are birth defects diagnosed?**\n\nHealth care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing. That's why it important to get regular prenatal care.\n\nOther birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.\n\n**What are the treatments for birth defects?**\n\nChildren with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.\n\nOften, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.\n\n**Can birth defects be prevented?**\n\nNot all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby:\n\n* Start prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancy\n* Get 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant.\n* Don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugs\n* Talk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as well as dietary or herbal supplements.\n* Learn how to prevent infections during pregnancy\n* If you have any medical conditions, try to get them under control before you get pregnant\n\n---\n\n**Birth Defects**\n\nA birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body.

    "content": "**Birth Weight**\n\n**What is Birth Weight?**\n\nBirth weight is the first weight of your baby, taken just after being born. A low birth weight means that the baby is less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. A high birth weight means that the baby is more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces.\n\n**Causes of Low Birth Weight**\n\nA baby with a low birth weight can be born too small, too early (premature), or both. This can happen for many different reasons, including:\n\n* Health problems in the pregnant parent\n* Taking certain medicines during pregnancy\n* Substance use during pregnancy\n* Infections during pregnancy\n* Being pregnant with multiple babies\n* Problems with the placenta, the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby\n* Having small parents\n* Genetic conditions in the baby\n* Birth defects\n\n**Problems Caused by Low Birth Weight**\n\nBabies with low birth weight may be more at risk of certain health problems, including:\n\n* Immediate problems:\n\t+ Breathing problems\n\t+ Infections\n\t+ Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)\n\t+ Jaundice\n\t+ Trouble keeping warm\n* Longer-term problems:\n\t+ Delayed motor and social development\n\t+ Learning disabilities\n\t+ Certain health conditions as an adult, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity\n\n**Causes of High Birth Weight**\n\nCauses of high birth weight can include:\n\n* Having big parents\n* Diabetes in the pregnant parent\n* Certain genetic conditions\n* Too much weight gain during pregnancy\n\n**Problems Caused by High Birth Weight**\n\nHigh birth weight can be a concern because it can make delivery of the baby difficult and raise the risk of birth injuries. The baby is at higher risk of problems with:\n\n* Blood sugar\n* Breathing problems\n* Jaundice\n\n**Preventing Birth Weight Problems**\n\nYou may be able to prevent some birth weight problems by:\n\n* Getting regular checkups during pregnancy\n* Getting the right amount of nutrition and calories during pregnancy\n* Controlling your blood sugar if you have diabetes\n* Avoiding substance use during pregnancy\n\n---\n\n**Birth Weight**\n\nA baby's birth weight is a crucial indicator of their overall health and development. In this article, we will explore the causes and consequences of low and high birth weights, as well as ways to prevent some birth weight problems.\n\n**Causes of Low Birth Weight**\n\nLow birth weight can occur when a baby is born too small or too early (premature). This can happen for many different reasons, including:\n\n* Babies with low birth weight may be more at risk of certain health problems. They include immediate problems, such as:\n\t+ Blood sugar\n\t+ Breathing problems\n\t+ Jaundice\n* There is also a higher risk of longer-term problems, including:\n\t+ Developmental delays\n\t+ Learning disabilities\n\t+ Behavioral problems\n\n**Causes of High Birth Weight**\n\nHigh birth weight can be caused by several factors, including:\n\n* Multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets)\n* Maternal diabetes\n* Maternal obesity\n* Fetal macrosomia (a condition where the baby is significantly larger than usual)\n\n**Preventing Some Birth Weight Problems**\n\nWhile some birth weight problems cannot be prevented, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n* Get regular checkups during pregnancy\n* Get the right amount of nutrition and calories during pregnancy\n* Control your blood sugar if you have diabetes\n* Avoid substance use during pregnancy\n\n**Understanding Birth Weight**\n\nBirth weight is the first weight of your baby, taken just after being born. A low birth weight means that the baby is less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. A high birth weight means that the baby is more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Fetal Growth Restriction (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) (Nemours Foundation)\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Fetal Macrosomia (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n* Large-for-Gestational-Age (LGA) Newborns (Merck & Co., Inc.)\n* Low Birthweight (March of Dimes Foundation)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n* FastStats: Birthweight and Gestation (National Center for Health Statistics)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Infant, Low Birth Weight  (National Institutes of Health)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Infant, Small for Gestational Age  (National Institutes of Health)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Large for Gestational Age  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n* Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n* KidsHealth (Nemours Foundation)\n* March of Dimes Foundation\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n* Large for gestational age (LGA) (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Neonatal weight gain and nutrition (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Small for gestational age (SGA) (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n**Topic Image**\n\nMEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA",

    "content": "**Birth Control - Slow Release Methods**\n\nCertain birth control methods contain man-made forms of hormones, specifically estrogen and progestin. These hormones are naturally produced in a woman's ovaries and play a crucial role in preventing pregnancy.\n\n**How Hormones Prevent Pregnancy**\n\nBoth estrogen and progestin prevent a woman's ovaries from releasing an egg during the menstrual cycle, known as ovulation. They achieve this by altering the levels of natural hormones produced by the body. Additionally, progestin helps prevent sperm from entering the uterus by thickening the mucous around a woman's cervix.\n\n**Birth Control Methods**\n\nThere are several slow-release birth control methods available, including:\n\n*   **Progestin Implants**: A small rod implanted under the skin, typically on the inside of the arm. It releases a small amount of progestin daily into the bloodstream.\n*   **Progestin Injections**: Hormone shots that contain progestin and are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks. They work for up to 90 days and may have side effects like changes in menstrual cycles, breast tenderness, weight gain, headaches, or depression.\n*   **Skin Patch**: A patch applied to the shoulder, buttocks, or another area of the body. It releases estrogen and progestin into the bloodstream, but with a higher risk of blood clots and other complications.\n*   **Vaginal Ring**: A flexible device inserted into the vagina, releasing progestin and estrogen. Side effects may include nausea, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge or vaginitis, breakthrough bleeding, and spotting.\n*   **Hormone-Releasing IUDs**: Intrauterine devices that release a low dose of hormone into the uterus daily for 3 to 8 years. They increase the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method, reduce or stop menstrual flow, and may help protect against endometrial cancer.\n\n**Choosing the Right Method**\n\nWith so many options available, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best slow-release birth control method for individual needs and preferences.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control - Slow Release Methods**\n\n**What is Birth Control?**\n\nCertain birth control methods contain man-made forms of hormones, specifically estrogen and progestin. These hormones prevent a woman's ovaries from releasing an egg during the menstrual cycle, also known as ovulation.\n\n**How Do Hormones Work in Birth Control?**\n\nBoth estrogen and progestin change the levels of natural hormones in the body to prevent pregnancy. Progestin also helps prevent sperm from entering the uterus by making the mucous around a woman's cervix thick and sticky.\n\n**Birth Control Methods - Slow Release**\n\nThere are several slow release birth control methods that contain the same hormones as birth control pills, but they are released slowly over time.\n\n*   **Progesterone Implants**: A small rod implanted under the skin that releases progestin daily into the bloodstream.\n*   **Progesterone Injections**: Hormone shots given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks that work for up to 90 days.\n*   **Skin Patch**: A patch placed on the shoulder, buttocks, or another area of the body that slowly releases estrogen and progestin into the bloodstream.\n*   **Vaginal Ring**: A flexible device inserted into the vagina that releases progestin and estrogen.\n*   **Hormone-Releasing IUDs**: A small plastic T-shaped device inserted into the uterus that releases a low dose of hormone daily for 3 to 8 years.\n\n**Benefits and Risks**\n\nThese slow release methods have several benefits, including:\n\n*   Higher effectiveness compared to birth control pills\n*   Fewer menstrual cycles or lighter bleeding\n*   Reduced risk of certain cancers\n\nHowever, they also come with some risks, such as:\n\n*   Increased risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs\n*   Rare risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke\n*   Breast tenderness, weight gain, headaches, or depression\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSlow release birth control methods offer a convenient and effective way to prevent pregnancy. While they have some risks associated with them, the benefits often outweigh the drawbacks. It's essential to discuss your options with your healthcare provider to determine which method is best for you.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control - Slow Release Methods**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Progesterone Implants**\n\nA small rod implanted under the skin, releasing a small amount of progestin daily into the bloodstream. It takes about a minute to insert and can stay in place for 3 years. Removal usually takes only a few minutes.\n\n*   Side effects may include bruising around the site for a week or more.\n*   You should be protected from getting pregnant within 1 week.\n*   You can use these implants while breastfeeding.\n*   Progesterone implants work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use these implants are likely to get pregnant.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Progesterone Injections**\n\nInjections or shots that contain the hormone progestin also work to prevent pregnancy. A single shot works for up to 90 days. These injections are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks.\n\n*   Side effects may include changes in menstrual cycles, extra bleeding or spotting, breast tenderness, weight gain, headaches, or depression.\n*   Progesterone injections work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use progestin injections are likely to get pregnant.\n*   Sometimes the effects of these hormone shots last longer than 90 days.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Skin Patch**\n\nThe skin patch is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or another area of your body. A new patch is applied once a week for 3 weeks. Then you go 1 week without a patch.\n\n*   Estrogen levels are higher with the patch than with birth control pills or the vaginal ring.\n*   There may be an increased risk for blood clots in the legs or lungs with this method.\n*   The patch slowly releases both estrogen and progestin into your blood.\n*   The patch works better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use the patch are likely to get pregnant.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Vaginal Ring**\n\nThe vaginal ring is a flexible device. This ring is about 2 inches (5 cm) wide and is placed into the vagina. It releases the hormones progestin and estrogen.\n\n*   Side effects may include nausea, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge or vaginitis, breakthrough bleeding and spotting.\n*   The vaginal ring contains estrogen. As a result, there is a rare risk for high blood pressure, blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. Smoking increases these risks even more.\n*   The vaginal ring slowly releases both estrogen and progestin into your blood.\n*   The vaginal ring works better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use the vaginal ring are likely to get pregnant.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hormone-Releasing IUDs**\n\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a small plastic T-shaped device used for birth control. It is inserted into the uterus. IUDs prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.\n\n*   A newer type of IUD releases a low dose of a hormone into the uterus each day for a period of 3 to 8 years.\n*   This increases the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method.\n*   It also has the added benefits of reducing or stopping menstrual flow.\n*   It may help protect against cancer (endometrial cancer) in women who are at risk of developing the disease.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control - Slow Release Methods**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Vaginal Ring**\n\nThe vaginal ring is a flexible device placed into the vagina for 3 weeks. At the end of the third week, you will take the ring out for 1 week. DO NOT remove the ring until the end of the 3 weeks.\n\nSide effects with the vaginal ring may include:\n\n*   Nausea and breast tenderness, which are less severe than with birth control pills or patches.\n*   Vaginal discharge or vaginitis.\n*   Breakthrough bleeding and spotting (may occur more often than with birth control pills).\n\nThe vaginal ring contains estrogen. As a result, there is a rare risk for high blood pressure, blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. Smoking increases these risks even more.\n\n**Hormone-Releasing IUDs**\n\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a small plastic T-shaped device used for birth control. It is inserted into the uterus. IUDs prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.\n\nA newer type of IUD releases a low dose of a hormone into the uterus each day for a period of 3 to 8 years. This increases the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method. It also has the added benefits of reducing or stopping menstrual flow. It may help protect against cancer (endometrial cancer) in women who are at risk of developing the disease. There are several different IUDs of this type. Some are specially shaped for women who have never been pregnant.\n\nYou have choices for what type of IUD to have. Talk with your provider about which type may be best for you.\n\n**Progesterone Implants**\n\nA progestin implant is a small rod that is implanted under the skin, most often on the inside of the arm. The rod releases a small amount of the progestin daily into the bloodstream.\n\nIt takes about a minute to insert the rod. The procedure is done using a local anesthetic in a health care provider's office. The rod can stay in place for 3 years. However, it can be removed at any time. Removal usually takes only a few minutes.\n\nAfter the implant has been inserted:\n\n*   Progestin implants work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use these implants are likely to get pregnant.\n*   Your regular menstrual cycles should return within 3 to 4 weeks after these implants are removed.\n\n**Progesterone Injections**\n\nInjections or shots that contain the hormone progestin also work to prevent pregnancy. A single shot works for up to 90 days. These injections are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks.\n\nSide effects that may occur include:\n\n*   Progestin injections work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use progestin injections are likely to get pregnant.\n*   Sometimes the effects of these hormone shots last longer than 90 days. If you are planning to become pregnant in the near future, you might want to consider a different birth control method.\n\n**Skin Patch**\n\nThe skin patch is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or another area of your body. A new patch is applied once a week for 3 weeks. Then you go 1 week without a patch.\n\nEstrogen levels are higher with the patch than with birth control pills or the vaginal ring. Because of this, there may be an increased risk for blood clots in the legs or lungs with this method. The FDA has issued a warning about the patch and the higher risk for a blood clot traveling to a lung.\n\nThe patch slowly releases both estrogen and progestin into your blood. Your provider can prescribe this method for you.\n\nThe patch works better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use the patch are likely to get pregnant.\n\n**Vaginal Ring**\n\nThe vaginal ring is a flexible device placed into the vagina for 3 weeks. At the end of the third week, you will take the ring out for 1 week. DO NOT remove the ring until the end of the 3 weeks.\n\nSide effects with the vaginal ring may include:\n\n*   Nausea and breast tenderness, which are less severe than with birth control pills or patches.\n*   Vaginal discharge or vaginitis.\n*   Breakthrough bleeding and spotting (may occur more often than with birth control pills).\n\nThe vaginal ring contains estrogen. As a result, there is a rare risk for high blood pressure, blood clots, heart attack, and stroke.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, LARC methods are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. In fact, a study published in MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep found that self-administration of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a high continuation rate.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Combined Hormonal Birth Control**\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also provides information on combined hormonal birth control methods, including the pill, patch, and ring. These methods use a combination of estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy. According to Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, hormonal contraception is a popular method of birth control due to its high efficacy and low risk of serious side effects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**FAQs**\n\n*   What are the benefits of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)?\n    *   Highly effective in preventing pregnancy\n    *   Associated with a high continuation rate\n*   What are the different types of combined hormonal birth control methods?\n    *   Pill, patch, and ring\n*   How does hormonal contraception work?\n    *   Uses a combination of estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Curtis KM, Nguyen A, Reeves JA, Clark EA, Folger SG, Whiteman MK.

    "content": "**Birth Control and Family Planning**\n\nYour choice of a birth control method depends on a number of factors, including your health, how often you have sexual intercourse, and whether or not you want children.\n\n**Information to Consider When Selecting a Birth Control Method**\n\n*   How well does the method prevent pregnancy?\n*   What are your feelings about getting pregnant? Would an unplanned pregnancy create hardship or distress to a woman or her partner? Or would a pregnancy be welcomed if it occurred earlier than planned?\n*   How much does a method of birth control cost? Does your insurance plan pay for it?\n*   What are the health risks? Talk about these risks with your health care provider before believing what you hear from others.\n*   Is your partner willing to accept and use a given method of birth control?\n*   Do you want a method that you only need to use when you have sex? Or do you want something that is in place and always working?\n*   Is preventing infections spread by sexual contact important? Many methods do not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are the best choice for preventing STIs. They work best when combined with spermicides.\n*   Availability: Can the method be used without a prescription, a provider visit, or, in the case of minors, parental consent?\n\n**Barrier Methods of Birth Control**\n\n### **Condoms**\n\nA condom is a thin latex or polyurethane sheath. The male condom is placed around the erect penis. The female condom is placed inside the vagina before intercourse.\n\n*   Condoms can be bought in most drug and grocery stores. Some family planning clinics offer free condoms. You do not need a prescription to get condoms.\n*   A condom must be worn at all times during intercourse to prevent pregnancy.\n\n### **Diaphragm and Cervical Cap**\n\nA diaphragm is a flexible rubber cup that is filled with spermicidal cream or jelly. It is placed into the vagina over the cervix before intercourse, to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus.\n\n*   Diaphragms must be prescribed by a woman's provider. The provider will determine the correct type and size of diaphragm for the woman.\n*   About 5 to 20 pregnancies occur over 1 year in 100 women using this method, depending on proper use.\n*   Risks include irritation and allergic reactions to the diaphragm or spermicide, and increased frequency of urinary tract infection and vaginal yeast infection. In rare cases, toxic shock syndrome may develop in women who leave the diaphragm in too long. A cervical cap may cause an abnormal Pap test.\n\n### **Vaginal Sponge**\n\nVaginal contraceptive sponges are soft, and contain a chemical that kills or \"disables\" sperm. The sponge is moistened and inserted into the vagina, to cover over the cervix before intercourse.\n\n*   The vaginal sponge can be bought at your pharmacy without a prescription.\n\n**Hormonal Methods of Birth Control**\n\nSome birth control methods use hormones. They will have either both an estrogen and a progestin, or a progestin alone. You need a prescription for most hormonal birth control methods.\n\nBoth hormones prevent a woman's ovary from releasing an egg during her cycle. They do this by affecting the levels of other hormones the body makes. Progestins help prevent sperm from making their way to the egg by making mucus around a woman's cervix thick and sticky.\n\nTypes of hormonal birth control methods include:\n\n*   Birth control pills: These may contain both estrogen and progestin, or only progestin.\n*   Implants: These are small rods implanted beneath the skin. They release a continuous dose of hormone to prevent ovulation.\n*   Progestin injections, such as Depo-Provera, that are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks once every 3 months.\n*   The skin patch, such as Ortho Evra, is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or other place on the body. It releases a continuous dose of hormones.\n*   The vaginal ring, such as NuvaRing, is a flexible ring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide. It is placed into the vagina. It releases the hormones progestin and estrogen.\n*   Emergency (or \"morning after\") contraception: This medicine can be bought without a prescription at your drugstore.\n\n**IUD (Intrauterine Device)**\n\nThe IUD is a small plastic or copper device placed inside the woman's uterus by her provider. Some IUDs release small amounts of progestin. IUDs may be left in place for 3 to 10 years, depending on the device used.\n\n*   IUDs can be placed at almost any time.\n*   IUDs are safe and work well. Fewer than 1 out of 100 women per year will get pregnant using an IUD.\n*   IUDs that release progestin may be for treating heavy menstrual bleeding and reducing cramps. They may also cause periods to stop completely.\n\n**Permanent Methods of Birth Control**\n\nThese methods are best for men, women, and couples who feel certain they do not want to have children in the future. They include vasectomy and tubal ligation. These procedures can sometimes be reversed if a pregnancy is desired at a later time. However, the success rate for reversal is not high.\n\n**Birth Control Methods That Do Not Work Very Well**\n\nWithdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation can still result in pregnancy. Some semen often escapes before full withdrawal. It can be enough to cause a pregnancy.\n\nDouching shortly after sex is not likely to work. The sperm can make their way past the cervix within 90 seconds. Douching is never recommended because it can cause infections in the uterus and tubes.\n\nBreastfeeding: Despite the myths, women who are breastfeeding can become pregnant.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website.

However, the success rate for reversal is not high.\n\n**Birth Control Methods That Do Not Work Very Well**\n\n* **Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation**: This method does not work very well because some semen often escapes before full withdrawal.\n* **Douching shortly after sex**: Douching is never recommended because it can cause infections in the uterus and tubes.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control and Family Planning**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Choosing the Right Birth Control Method**\n\nYour choice of a birth control method depends on several factors, including your health, how often you have sexual intercourse, and whether or not you want children.\n\n**Questions to Consider When Selecting a Birth Control Method**\n\n*   How well does the method prevent pregnancy?\n*   What are your feelings about getting pregnant?\n*   How much does a method of birth control cost?\n*   What are the health risks?\n*   Is your partner willing to accept and use a given method of birth control?\n*   Do you want a method that you only need to use when you have sex, or do you want something that is in place and always working?\n*   Is preventing infections spread by sexual contact important?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Barrier Methods of Birth Control**\n\n### Condoms\n\nA condom is a thin latex or polyurethane sheath. The male condom is placed around the erect penis. The female condom is placed inside the vagina before intercourse.\n\nCondoms can be bought in most drug and grocery stores. Some family planning clinics offer free condoms. You do not need a prescription to get condoms.\n\n### Diaphragm and Cervical Cap\n\nA diaphragm is a flexible rubber cup that is filled with spermicidal cream or jelly. It is placed into the vagina over the cervix before intercourse, to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus.\n\nDiaphragms must be prescribed by a woman's provider. The provider will determine the correct type and size of diaphragm for the woman.\n\n### Vaginal Sponge\n\nVaginal contraceptive sponges are soft, and contain a chemical that kills or \"disables\" sperm. The sponge is moistened and inserted into the vagina, to cover over the cervix before intercourse.\n\nThe vaginal sponge can be bought at your pharmacy without a prescription.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hormonal Methods of Birth Control**\n\nSome birth control methods use hormones. They will have either both an estrogen and a progestin, or a progestin alone. You need a prescription for most hormonal birth control methods.\n\nBoth hormones prevent a woman's ovary from releasing an egg during her cycle. They do this by affecting the levels of other hormones the body makes.\n\nProgestins help prevent sperm from making their way to the egg by making mucus around a woman's cervix thick and sticky.\n\nTypes of hormonal birth control methods include:\n\n*   Birth control pills: These may contain both estrogen and progestin, or only progestin.\n*   Implants: These are small rods implanted beneath the skin. They release a continuous dose of hormone to prevent ovulation.\n*   Progestin injections, such as Depo-Provera, that are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks once every 3 months.\n*   The skin patch, such as Ortho Evra, is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or other place on the body. It releases a continuous dose of hormones.\n*   The vaginal ring, such as NuvaRing, is a flexible ring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide. It is placed into the vagina. It releases the hormones progestin and estrogen.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**IUD (Intrauterine Device)**\n\nThe IUD is a small plastic or copper device placed inside the woman's uterus by her provider. Some IUDs release small amounts of progestin. IUDs may be left in place for 3 to 10 years, depending on the device used.\n\nIUDs can be placed at almost any time. IUDs are safe and work well. Fewer than 1 out of 100 women per year will get pregnant using an IUD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Permanent Methods of Birth Control**\n\nThese methods are best for men, women, and couples who feel certain they do not want to have children in the future. They include vasectomy and tubal ligation. These procedures can sometimes be reversed if a pregnancy is desired at a later time. However, the success rate for reversal is not high.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Birth Control Methods That Do Not Work Very Well**\n\nWithdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation can still result in pregnancy. Some semen often escapes before full withdrawal. It can be enough to cause a pregnancy.\n\nDouching shortly after sex is not likely to work. The sperm can make their way past the cervix within 90 seconds. Douching is never recommended because it can cause infections in the uterus and tubes.\n\nBreastfeeding: Despite the myths, women who are breastfeeding can become pregnant.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control and Family Planning**\n\n**Barrier Methods of Birth Control**\n\n*   **Condoms**: Can be bought in most drug and grocery stores. Some family planning clinics offer free condoms.\n*   **Diaphragm and Cervical Cap**: A diaphragm is a flexible rubber cup that is filled with spermicidal cream or jelly. It should be left in place for 6 to 8 hours after intercourse. Diaphragms must be prescribed by a woman's provider. About 5 to 20 pregnancies occur over 1 year in 100 women using this method, depending on proper use.\n*   **Vaginal Sponge**: Vaginal contraceptive sponges are soft, and contain a chemical that kills or \"disables\" sperm. The sponge is moistened and inserted into the vagina, to cover over the cervix before intercourse.\n\n**Hormonal Methods of Birth Control**\n\nSome birth control methods use hormones.

    "content": "**Birth Control Pills - Combination**\n\nOral contraceptives use hormones to prevent pregnancy. Combination pills contain both progestin and estrogen.\n\n**What Are Combination Birth Control Pills?**\n\nBirth control pills help keep you from getting pregnant. When taken daily or as prescribed, they are one of the most effective methods of contraception. For most women they are extremely safe. They also have a number of other benefits. Some of these include:\n\n* Improve painful, heavy, or irregular periods\n* Treat acne\n* Reduce the chance of developing ovarian cancer\n\n**Combination Birth Control Pills**\n\nCombination birth control pills contain both estrogen and progestin. Some combination birth control pills allow you to have fewer periods each year. These are called continuous or extended-cycle pills. Ask your health care provider about dosing options to decrease the frequency of your menstrual cycles.\n\n**Types of Combination Birth Control Pills**\n\nBirth control pills come in packages. You take pills from a 21-pack once a day for 3 weeks, then you do not take pills for 1 week. It may be easier to remember to take 1 pill every day, so other pills come in a 28-pack of pills, with some having active pills (containing hormones) and some with no hormones.\n\nThere are 5 types of combination birth control pills. Your provider will help you choose the right one for you. The 5 types are:\n\n* One phase pills: These have the same amount of estrogen and progestin in all the active pills.\n* Two phase pills: The level of hormones in these pills changes once during each menstrual cycle.\n* Three phase pills: Every 7 days the dose of hormones changes.\n* Four phase pills: The dose of hormones in these pills changes 4 times each cycle.\n* Continuous or extended cycle pills: These keep the level of hormones up so you have few or no periods.\n\n**How Do I Start Taking Combination Pills?**\n\nYou may:\n\n* Take your first pill on the first day of your period.\n* Take your first pill on the Sunday after your period starts. If you do this, you need to use another birth control method (condom, diaphragm, or sponge) for the next 7 days. This is called backup birth control.\n* Take your first pill any day in your cycle, but you will need to use another birth control method for the first month.\n\nFor continuous or extended cycle pills: Take 1 pill every day, at the same time each day.\n\n**How Do I Take Them?**\n\nTake 1 pill every day, at the same time of day. Birth control pills only work if you take them every day. If you miss a day, use a backup method.\n\n**What if I Miss a Day?**\n\nIf you miss 1 or more pills, use a backup method of birth control and contact your provider right away. What to do depends on:\n\n* What type of pill you are taking\n* Where you are in your cycle\n* How many pills you missed\n\nYour provider will help you get back on schedule.\n\n**What to Expect When I Stop**\n\nYou may decide to stop taking birth control pills because you want to get pregnant or change to another birth control method. Here are some things to expect when you stop taking the pill:\n\n* You might become pregnant right away.\n* You may have mild spotting of blood before you get your first period.\n* You should get your period 4 to 6 weeks after taking your last pill. If you do not get your period in 8 weeks, call your provider.\n* Your period may be heavier or lighter than usual.\n* Your acne may return.\n* For the first month, you may have headaches or mood swings.\n\n**When to Use a Backup Method**\n\nUse a backup method of birth control, such as condom, diaphragm, or sponge if:\n\n* You miss 1 or more pills.\n* You are not starting your first pill on the first day of your period.\n* You are sick, throwing up, or have loose stools (diarrhea). Even if you take your pill, your body may not absorb it. Use a backup method of birth control for the rest of that cycle.\n* You are taking another medicine that may keep the pill from working. Tell your provider or pharmacist if you take any other medicines, such as antibiotics, seizure medicine, medicine to treat HIV, or St. John's wort. Find out if what you take will interfere with how well the pill works.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of the following symptoms after starting to take the birth control pills:\n\n* You have swelling in your leg\n* You have leg pain\n* Your leg feels warm to the touch or has changes in skin color\n* You have fever or chills\n* You are short of breath and it is hard to breathe\n* You have chest pain\n* You cough up blood\n* You have a headache that gets worse, especially a migraine with aura\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control Pills - Combination**\n\n**What Are Combination Birth Control Pills?**\n\nBirth control pills help keep you from getting pregnant.

    "content": "**Birth Control Pills**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are birth control pills?**\n\nBirth control pills (BCPs) contain man-made forms of 2 hormones called estrogen and progestin. These hormones are made naturally in a woman's ovaries. BCPs can contain both of these hormones, or have progestin only.\n\n**How do birth control pills work?**\n\nBoth hormones prevent a woman's ovary from releasing an egg during her menstrual cycle (called ovulation). They do this by changing the levels of the natural hormones the body makes.\n\nProgestins also make the mucus around a woman's cervix thick and sticky. This helps prevent sperm from entering the uterus.\n\n**Information**\n\nBCPs are also called oral contraceptives or just \"the pill.\" A health care provider must prescribe most types of BCPs but one was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter use.\n\nThe most common type of BCP combines the hormones estrogen and progestin. There are many different forms of this type of pill.\nThe \"mini-pill\" is a type of BCP that contains only progestin, no estrogen. These pills are an option for women who do not like the side effects of estrogen or who cannot take estrogen for medical reasons.\nThey can also be used after delivery in women who are breastfeeding.\n\n**Using Birth Control Pills**\n\nAll women who take BCPs need a check-up at least once a year. Women should also have their blood pressure checked 3 months after they begin to take the pill.\n\nBCPs only work well if the woman remembers to take her pill daily without missing a day. Only 2 or 3 women out of 100 who take BCPs correctly for a year will get pregnant.\n\n**Side Effects and Risks**\n\nBCPs may cause many side effects. These include:\n\n*   Changes in menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, extra bleeding\n*   Nausea, mood changes, worsening of migraines (mostly due to estrogens)\n*   Breast tenderness and weight gain\n\nRare but dangerous risks from taking BCPs include:\n\n*   Blood clots\n*   Heart attack\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Stroke\n\nBCPs without estrogen are much less likely to cause these problems. The risk is higher for women who smoke or have a history of high blood pressure, clotting disorders, or unhealthy cholesterol levels. However, the risks of developing these complications are much lower with either type of pill than with pregnancy.\n\n**Returning to Regular Menstrual Cycles**\n\nRegular menstrual cycles will return within 3 to 6 months after a woman stops using most hormonal birth control methods.\n\n---\n\n**Birth Control Pills**\n\nBCPs are also called oral contraceptives or just \"the pill.\" A health care provider must prescribe most types of BCPs but one was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter use.\n\n* The most common type of BCP combines the hormones estrogen and progestin.

They typically contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone, which work together to prevent ovulation and thicken the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How do birth control pills work?**\n\nBirth control pills work by suppressing the release of an egg from the ovaries, thereby preventing fertilization. They also cause changes in the uterine lining, making it less likely for a fertilized egg to implant. Additionally, they can thicken the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of birth control pills?**\n\nThe benefits of birth control pills include:\n\n*   **Effective contraception**: Birth control pills are highly effective in preventing pregnancy when used correctly.\n*   **Regulation of menstrual cycles**: They can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce symptoms associated with PMS.\n*   **Treatment of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Hormonal birth control can help alleviate symptoms of endometriosis and PCOS.\n*   **Reduced risk of certain cancers**: Some studies suggest that hormonal birth control may lower the risk of ovarian, uterine, and colorectal cancers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the risks and side effects of birth control pills?**\n\nWhile generally safe, birth control pills can have some risks and side effects, including:\n\n*   **Blood clots**: Hormonal birth control can increase the risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs.\n*   **Stroke**: Although rare, hormonal birth control may also increase the risk of stroke.\n*   **Breast tenderness**: Some women may experience breast tenderness as a side effect of hormonal birth control.\n*   **Mood changes**: Hormonal fluctuations can lead to mood swings, depression, or anxiety in some women.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who should not take birth control pills?**\n\nBirth control pills are not suitable for everyone, particularly:\n\n*   **Women with a history of blood clots or stroke**: Those with a history of these conditions should avoid hormonal birth control.\n*   **Smokers over 35**: Smokers over 35 who use hormonal birth control may be at increased risk of blood clots and stroke.\n*   **Pregnant women**: Birth control pills are not recommended for pregnant women, as they can increase the risk of miscarriage and other complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I get birth control pills?**\n\nBirth control pills are available by prescription only. To obtain them, you'll need to consult with a healthcare provider who will assess your medical history, age, and lifestyle to determine the best course of treatment for you.",

It also is used to empty the bowels before surgery and certain medical procedures.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\nRectal bisacodyl comes as a suppository and enema to use rectally. It is usually used at the time that a bowel movement is desired. The suppositories usually cause a bowel movement within 15 to 60 minutes and the enema within 5 to 20 minutes.\n\n**If using a bisacodyl suppository, follow these steps:**\n\n1. If the suppository is soft, hold it under cool water or place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to harden it before removing the wrapper.\n2. Remove the wrapper.\n3. If you were told to use half of the suppository, cut it lengthwise with a clean, sharp knife or blade.\n4. Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest.\n5. Using your finger, insert the suppository, pointed end first, into your rectum until it passes the muscular sphincter of the rectum, about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults.\n6. Hold it in place for as long as possible.\n7. Wash your hands thoroughly.\n\n**If using a bisacodyl enema, follow these steps:**\n\n1. Shake the enema bottle well.\n2.

    "content": "**Bitter Melon**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\nBitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a vine originally from India and other Asian countries. It has been traditionally used to treat diabetes.\n\nBitter melon contains a chemical that acts like insulin to help reduce blood sugar levels.\n\nPeople commonly use bitter melon for diabetes, osteoarthritis, athletic performance, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nBitter melon is sometimes called bitter gourd. Don't confuse this with Ivy gourd, which is a different plant.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using bitter melon for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Bitter melon is possibly safe when used for up to 4 months. Bitter melon might cause upset stomach in some people. There isn't enough reliable information to know if bitter melon is safe to use long-term.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if bitter melon is safe. It might cause a rash.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\nPregnancy: Bitter melon is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Certain chemicals in bitter melon might harm the pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if bitter melon is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency: Bitter melon seeds might cause severe anemia in people who have G6PD deficiency. Until more is known, avoid bitter melon seeds if you have G6PD deficiency.\n\nSurgery: Bitter melon might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery.

    "content": "**Black Seed**\n\n**What is it?**\nBlack seed (Nigella sativa) is a flowering plant native to Asia and the Mediterranean. Its seed has been used to make medicine for thousands of years.\n\nBlack seed might have effects in the body that help boost the immune system, fight cancer, prevent pregnancy, reduce swelling, and lessen allergic reactions by acting as an antihistamine.\n\nPeople commonly use black seed for asthma, hay fever, diabetes, high blood pressure, eczema, weight loss, menstrual cramps, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using black seed for COVID-19.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Acne: Applying a gel containing black seed extract to the skin might help to improve acne.\n\t+ Hay fever: Taking black seed oil by mouth daily might improve allergy symptoms in people with hay fever.\n\t+ Asthma: Taking black seed by mouth along with asthma medicines can improve coughing, wheezing, and lung function in some people with asthma. But it seems to work only in people with very low lung function before treatment.\n\t+ A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD): Taking black seed oil by mouth helps to improve lung function in people with COPD who are also using prescribed inhalers.\n\t+ Diabetes: Taking black seed powder or black seed oil by mouth daily seems to improve blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.\n\t+ A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori): Taking black seed powder along with standard therapies might help to get rid of this infection.\n\t+ High blood pressure: Taking black seed powder or black seed oil by mouth might reduce blood pressure by a small amount in healthy adults. But it's not clear if it helps people with high blood pressure.\n\t+ High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia): Taking black seed supplements by mouth can slightly lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\") cholesterol in people with or without hyperlipidemia.\n\t+ Breast pain (mastalgia): Applying a gel containing black seed oil to the breasts during the menstrual cycle seems to reduce pain.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* When taken by mouth: Black seed is commonly consumed in foods. Black seed oil and black seed powder are possibly safe when taken in larger amounts for up to 3 months. There isn't enough reliable information to know if larger amounts are safe when used for more than 3 months. Black seed can cause allergic rashes in some people. It can also cause stomach upset, vomiting, or constipation.\n* When applied to the skin: Black seed oil or gel is possibly safe when used short-term. It can cause allergic rashes in some people.\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n\n* Pregnancy: Black seed is commonly consumed in foods. But taking amounts greater than those found in foods while pregnant is likely unsafe. Black seed can slow down or stop the uterus from contracting.\n* Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if black seed is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: Black seed oil is possibly safe for children when taken by mouth short-term and in recommended amounts by weight.\n* Bleeding disorders: Black seed might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Black seed might make bleeding disorders worse.\n\n---\n\n**Black Seed: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Surgery:** Black seed might slow blood clotting, reduce blood sugar, and increase sleepiness in some people.

Black seed might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n        *   Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)\n            *   Black seed might lower blood sugar levels. Taking black seed along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n        *   Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)\n            *   Black seed might lower blood pressure.

    "content": "**Black Tea**\n\n**What is it?**\nBlack tea is made from the fermented leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, which also produces green and oolong teas.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nAccording to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, black tea has been rated as follows:\n\n* **Likely effective for:**\n\t+ Mental alertness\n\t+ Low blood pressure (helps increase blood pressure in older people)\n\t+ Heart attack (people who drink black tea seem to have a lower risk)\n\t+ Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) - regular consumption improves bone health by a small amount\n\t+ Ovarian cancer - regular drinkers of tea, including black tea or green tea, have a lower risk\n\t+ Parkinson disease - people who drink caffeinated beverages, including black tea, seem to have a lower risk\n* **Possibly effective for:**\n\t+ Headache (black tea is used as a remedy)\n\t+ High blood pressure (although there's limited evidence)\n* **Possibly ineffective for:**\n\t+ Bladder cancer\n\t+ Breast cancer\n\t+ Colon cancer\n\t+ Rectal cancer\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ Endometrial cancer\n\t+ Esophageal cancer\n\t+ Stomach cancer\n\t+ Lung cancer\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* **When taken by mouth:** Drinking black tea in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people.\n* **Possible side effects:**\n\t+ Headache and irregular heartbeat from excessive caffeine consumption\n\t+ Death or severe side effects from very high doses (>10g of caffeine)\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nBlack tea is commonly consumed as a beverage, often with milk and sugar. It's also used in traditional medicine for various purposes, although the effectiveness of these uses is not well-supported by scientific evidence.\n\n**Other names:**\n\nNone mentioned\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\n---\n\n**Black Tea: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Special Precautions & Warnings**\n\n* **Pregnancy**: Drinking moderate amounts of black tea during pregnancy is possibly safe. Do not drink more than 3 cups of black tea daily.\n* **Breast-feeding**: Drinking moderate amounts of black tea while breast-feeding is possibly safe. But drinking more than 3 cups of black tea daily is possibly unsafe.\n* **Children**: Black tea is possibly safe in children when consumed in amounts found in food and beverages.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n* **Anxiety Disorders**: The caffeine in black tea might make anxiety worse.\n* **Bleeding Disorders**: There is some concern that the caffeine in black tea might slow blood clotting. Use caffeine cautiously if you have a bleeding disorder.\n* **Heart Problems**: Black tea contains caffeine. Large amounts of caffeine can cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. If you have a heart condition, use caffeine in moderation.\n* **Diabetes**: The caffeine in black tea might affect blood sugar. Use black tea with caution if you have diabetes.\n* **Diarrhea**: Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen diarrhea.\n* **Seizures**: Black tea contains caffeine. High doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't take high doses of caffeine.\n* **Glaucoma**: Drinking caffeinated black tea increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. If you have glaucoma, use caffeine with caution.\n* **Hormone-Sensitive Conditions**: Black tea might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use black tea.\n* **High Blood Pressure**: The caffeine in black tea might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this doesn't seem to occur in people who drink black tea or other caffeinated products regularly.\n* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS.\n\n**Is it Safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Black tea is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking black tea in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Drinking more than 4 cups of black tea daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. Drinking very high amounts of black tea containing more than 10 grams of caffeine is likely unsafe. Doses of black tea this high might cause death or other severe side effects.\n\n---\n\n**Black Tea: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Part 3/8**\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Major:** Do not take this combination.\n    *   Ephedrine\n        + Black tea contains caffeine, a stimulant drug that can cause too much stimulation and serious side effects when taken with ephedrine.\n\n**Moderate: Be cautious with this combination.**\n\n*   Adenosine (Adenocard)\n    + The caffeine in black tea might block the effects of adenosine, which is used to do a test called a cardiac stress test.\n*   Antibiotics (Quinolone antibiotics)\n    + Some antibiotics might decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing the risk of side effects like jitteriness, headache, and increased heart rate when taken with black tea.\n*   Birth control pills (Contraceptive drugs)\n    + Birth control pills can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing the risk for side effects from caffeine.\n*   Carbamazepine (Tegretol)\n    + The caffeine in black tea can decrease the effects of carbamazepine, a medication used to treat seizures.\n*   Cimetidine (Tagamet)\n    + Cimetidine can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing the risk of side effects like jitteriness, headache, and fast heartbeat when taken with black tea.\n*   Clozapine (Clozaril)\n    + The caffeine in black tea seems to decrease how quickly the body breaks down clozapine, a medication used to treat schizophrenia.\n*   Dipyridamole (Persantine)\n    + The caffeine in black tea might block the effects of dipyridamole, which is often used by doctors to do a test on the heart called a cardiac stress test.\n*   Disulfiram (Antabuse)\n    + Disulfiram can decrease how quickly the body gets rid of caffeine, increasing the risk of side effects like jitteriness, hyperactivity, and irritability when taken with black tea.\n*   Estrogens\n    + Estrogens can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing the risk for side effects from caffeine.\n*   Ethosuximide (Zarontin)\n    + The caffeine in black tea can decrease the effects of ethosuximide, a medication used to treat seizures.\n*   Felbamate (Felbatol)\n    + The caffeine in black tea might decrease the effects of felbamate, a medication used to treat seizures.\n*   Flutamide (Eulexin)\n    + The caffeine in black tea might decrease how quickly the body gets rid of flutamide, increasing the risk of side effects.\n*   Fluvoxamine (Luvox)\n    + Fluvoxamine can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing the risk of side effects from caffeine.\n*   Lithium\n    + The caffeine in black tea can increase how quickly the body gets rid of lithium, a medication used to treat bipolar disorder.\n*   Medications for asthma (Beta-adrenergic agonists)\n    + Some medications for asthma can also stimulate the heart, increasing the risk of heart problems when taken with caffeine.\n*   Medications for depression (MAOIs)\n    + There is some concern that caffeine can interact with certain medications called MAOIs, increasing the risk for serious side effects like fast heartbeat and very high blood pressure.\n\n**Other Interactions**\n\n*   **Medications moved by pumps in cells:** Black tea might change how these pumps work and change how much medication stays in the body.\n*   **Medications that decrease break down of other medications by the liver:** Some drugs can decrease how quickly the liver changes and breaks down black tea, changing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Medications that slow blood clotting:** Taking black tea along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**Black Tea Interactions**\n\n**Major Concerns**\n\n* Do not take this combination.\n\t+ Ephedrine: Black tea contains caffeine, which can cause too much stimulation and serious side effects when combined with ephedrine.\n\n**Moderate Concerns**\n\n* Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Adenosine (Adenocard): The caffeine in black tea might block the effects of adenosine, used for cardiac stress tests.

Examples of supplements that contain genistein include cumin, dyer's broom, kudzu, red clover, and soy.\n\n**Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting**\n\nBlack tea might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n\n**Iron**\n\nBlack tea might reduce the absorption of iron supplements. For most people, this effect will not be enough to make a difference in their health. But people who don't have enough iron should drink black tea between meals rather than with meals to avoid this interaction.\n\n**Kudzu**\n\nDrinking black tea and taking kudzu might increase the risk of side effects for caffeine, including jitteriness, headache, and an increased heartbeat.\n\n**Magnesium**\n\nDrinking large amounts of black tea can increase the amount of magnesium that is flushed out in the urine. This might lower magnesium levels in the body.\n\n**Melatonin**\n\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Taking caffeine and melatonin together can increase melatonin levels. Caffeine can also increase natural melatonin levels in healthy individuals.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nBlack tea appears to reduce absorption of iron from foods. Drinking black tea in between meals rather than with meals should reduce this concern.\n\nAdding milk to black tea appears to reduce some of the heart health benefits of drinking tea. Milk might bind with the antioxidants in tea and keep them from being absorbed. But it's not clear if this is a real concern.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nBlack tea is commonly consumed by adults as a beverage, typically in amounts of 1-4 cups daily.

    "content": "**Black or Tarry Stools**\n\nBlack or tarry stools with a foul smell are a sign of a problem in the upper digestive tract. It most often indicates that there is bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or first part of the small intestine.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nEating black licorice, blueberries, blood sausage or taking iron pills, activated charcoal, or medicines that contain bismuth (such as Pepto-Bismol), can also cause black stools. Beets and foods with red coloring can sometimes make stools appear reddish. In all these cases, your health care provider can test the stool with a chemical to check for the presence of blood.\n\nBleeding in the esophagus or stomach (such as with peptic ulcer disease) can also cause you to vomit blood.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe color of the blood in the stools can indicate the source of bleeding.\n\nBlack or tarry stools may be due to bleeding in the upper part of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine. In this case, blood is darker because it gets digested on its way through the GI tract.\nRed or fresh blood in the stools (rectal bleeding), most often is a sign of bleeding from the lower GI tract (colon, rectum, or anus).\n\nPeptic ulcers are the most common cause of acute upper GI bleeding. Black and tarry stools may also occur due to:\n\n* Abnormal blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum\n* A tear in the esophagus from violent vomiting (Mallory-Weiss tear)\n* Blood supply being cut off to part of the intestines\n* Inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis)\n* Trauma or foreign body\n* Widened, overgrown veins (called varices) in the esophagus and stomach, commonly caused by liver cirrhosis\n* Cancer of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or ampulla of Vater\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider right away if:\n\n* You notice blood or changes in the color of your stool\n* You vomit blood\n* You feel dizzy or lightheaded\n\nIn children, a small amount of blood in the stool is most often not serious. The most common cause is constipation. You should still tell your child's provider if you notice this problem.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and perform a physical exam. The exam will focus on your abdomen.\n\nYou may be asked the following questions:\n\n* Are you taking blood thinners, or anti-platelet medicines, such as aspirin, warfarin, Eliquis, Pradaxa, Xarelto, or clopidogrel, or similar medicines?\n* Have you had any trauma or swallowed a foreign object accidentally?\n* Have you eaten black licorice, iron, Pepto-Bismol, or blueberries?\n* Have you had more than one episode of blood in your stool? Is every stool this way?\n* Have you lost any weight recently?\n* Is there blood on the toilet paper only?\n* What color is the stool?\n* When did the problem develop?\n* What other symptoms are present (abdominal pain, vomiting blood, bloating, excessive gas, diarrhea, or fever)?\n\n---\n\n**Black or Tarry Stools**\n\nBlack or tarry stools with a foul smell are a sign of a problem in the upper digestive tract.

    "content": "**Black Widow Spider**\n\nThe black widow spider has a shiny black body with a red hourglass-shape on its belly area. The venomous bite of a black widow spider is toxic.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nThe venom of the black widow spider contains toxic chemicals, including the neurotoxin alpha latrotoxin, that make people sick.\n\n**Where Found**\n\nBlack widow spiders are found throughout the United States, mostly in the South and West. They are usually found in barns, sheds, stone walls, fences, woodpiles, porch furniture, and other outdoor structures. They are usually, but not always, found near ground level, or within a few feet of the ground.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe first symptom of a black widow bite is usually pain similar to a pinprick. This is felt when the bite is made. Some people may not feel it. Minor swelling, redness, and a target-shaped sore may appear.\n\nAfter 15 minutes to 1 hour, a dull muscle pain spreads from the bite area to the whole body.\n\nIf the bite is on the upper body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your chest.\nIf the bite is on your lower body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your abdomen.\n\nThe following symptoms can also occur:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Headache\n* High blood pressure\n* Increased saliva\n* Increased sweating\n* Light sensitivity\n* Muscle weakness\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Numbness and tingling around the bite site, then sometimes spreading out from the bite\n* Restlessness\n* Seizures (usually seen just before death in children who are bitten)\n* Very painful muscle cramps or spasms\n* Facial swelling in the hours after the bite\n\nPregnant women may have contractions and go into labor.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nBlack widow spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away. Call the Poison Control Center for guidance.\n\nFollow these steps until medical help is given:\n\n* Clean the area with soap and water.\n* Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\n* Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.\n* Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nIf possible, bring the spider to the emergency room. Put it in a secure container.\n\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:\n\n* Antivenin, a medicine to reverse the effects of the venom, if available\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Chest x-rays, abdominal x-rays, or both\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\nIn general, children, pregnant women, and older people may need to be given Latrodectus antivenin to reverse the effect of the venom. However, it can sometimes cause serious allergic reactions and must be used carefully.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSevere symptoms usually start to improve within 2 to 3 days, but milder symptoms may last for several weeks. Death in a healthy person is very rare. Young children, people who are very ill, and older people may not survive a bite.\n\n---\n\n**Black Widow Spider**\n\nThe black widow spider (Latrodectus genus) has a shiny black body with a red hourglass-shape on its belly area.

They are most plentiful in temperate and subtropical climates, especially during the summer months, and are common throughout the southern United States.\n\n**Where Found**\n\n* Black widow spiders are found throughout the United States, mostly in the South and West.\n* They are usually found in barns, sheds, stone walls, fences, woodpiles, porch furniture, and other outdoor structures.\n* They are usually, but not always, found near ground level, or within a few feet of the ground.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* The first symptom of a black widow bite is usually pain similar to a pinprick. This is felt when the bite is made. Some people may not feel it. Minor swelling, redness, and a target-shaped sore may appear.\n* After 15 minutes to 1 hour, a dull muscle pain spreads from the bite area to the whole body.\n* If the bite is on the upper body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your chest.\n* If the bite is on your lower body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your abdomen.\n\n**Possible Symptoms**\n\n* Anxiety\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Headache\n* High blood pressure\n* Increased saliva\n* Increased sweating\n* Light sensitivity\n* Muscle weakness\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Numbness and tingling around the bite site, then sometimes spreading out from the bite\n* Restlessness\n* Seizures (usually seen just before death in children who are bitten)\n* Very painful muscle cramps or spasms\n* Facial swelling in the hours after the bite\n\n**Pregnant Women**\n\n* May have contractions and go into labor.\n\n**Home Care**\n\n* Black widow spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away.\n* Call the Poison Control Center for guidance.\n* Follow these steps until medical help is given:\n\t+ Clean the area with soap and water.\n\t+ Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\n\t+ Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.\n\t+ Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\n* Have this information ready:\n\t+ Person's age, weight, and condition\n\t+ Time the bite occurred\n\t+ Area on the body where the bite occurred\n\t+ Type of spider, if possible\n\n---\n\n**Black Widow Spider: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/5)**\n\n**National Poison Help Hotline**\n\nIf you've been bitten by a black widow spider, don't hesitate to call the national toll-free Poison Help hotline at 1-800-222-1222 from anywhere in the United States. This hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and provides free and confidential advice on poisoning or poison prevention.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nIf possible, bring the spider to the emergency room and put it in a secure container. The healthcare provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. You may receive:\n\n*   Antivenin, a medicine to reverse the effects of the venom (if available)\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen, a tube through the mouth into the throat, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Chest x-rays, abdominal x-rays, or both\n*   ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n*   Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)\n*   Medicines to treat symptoms\n\nIn general, children, pregnant women, and older people may need to be given Latrodectus antivenin to reverse the effect of the venom. However, it can sometimes cause serious allergic reactions and must be used carefully.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSevere symptoms usually start to improve within 2 to 3 days, but milder symptoms may last for several weeks. Death in a healthy person is very rare. Young children, people who are very ill, and older people may not survive a bite.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Boyer LV, Binford GJ, Degan JA. Spider bites.

The tissue is tested under a microscope.\n\n**How is a bladder biopsy performed?**\n\nA bladder biopsy can be done as part of a cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that is done to see the inside of the bladder using a thin lighted tube called a cystoscope. A small piece of tissue or the entire abnormal area is removed. The tissue is sent to the lab to be tested if:\n\n* Abnormalities of the bladder are found during this exam\n* A tumor is seen\n\n**How do I prepare for a bladder biopsy?**\n\nYou must sign an informed consent form before you have a bladder biopsy. In most cases, you are asked to urinate just before the procedure. You may also be asked to take an antibiotic before the procedure.\n\nFor infants and children, the preparation you can provide for this test depends on your child's age, previous experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:\n\n* Infant test or procedure preparation (birth to 1 year)\n* Toddler test or procedure preparation (1 to 3 years)\n* Preschooler test or procedure preparation (3 to 6 years)\n* School age test or procedure preparation (6 to 12 years)\n* Adolescent test or procedure preparation (12 to 18 years)\n\n**What will I feel during a bladder biopsy?**\n\nYou may have a slight discomfort as the cystoscope is passed through your urethra into your bladder.

There may be a burning sensation when the blood vessels are sealed to stop bleeding (cauterized).\n\nAfter the cystoscope is removed, your urethra may be sore. You may feel a burning sensation during urination for a day or two. There may be blood in the urine.

There may be a rupture of the bladder wall with the cystoscope or during biopsy.\n\nThere is also a risk that the biopsy will fail to detect a serious condition.\n\n**What should I do after a bladder biopsy?**\n\nYou will likely have a small amount of blood in your urine shortly after this procedure. If the bleeding continues after you urinate, contact your health care provider.\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n* You have pain, chills, or a fever\n* You are producing less urine than usual (oliguria)\n* You cannot urinate despite a strong urge to do so\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Biopsy**\n\nA bladder biopsy is a procedure in which small pieces of tissue are removed from the bladder.

The tissue sample is then sent to a laboratory for examination.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nThe presence of cancer cells in the biopsy sample indicates bladder cancer. The type of cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample.

    "content": "**Bladder Cancer**\n\n**What is Bladder Cancer?**\n\nBladder cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the bladder, which is the body part that holds and releases urine.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of bladder cancer is not known, but several things may make you more likely to develop it:\n\n*   Cigarette smoking: Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.\n*   Personal or family history of bladder cancer: Having someone in the family with bladder cancer increases your risk of developing it.\n*   Chemical exposure: Bladder cancer can be caused by coming into contact with cancer-causing chemicals (often at work).\n*   Chemotherapy: The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk for bladder cancer.\n*   Radiation treatment: Radiation therapy to the pelvis region for treatment of cancers of the prostate, testes, cervix, or uterus increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.\n*   Bladder infection: A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of bladder cancer can include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Blood in the urine\n*   Bone pain or tenderness if the cancer spreads to the bone\n*   Fatigue\n*   Painful urination\n*   Urinary frequency and urgency\n*   Urine leakage (incontinence)\n*   Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical examination, including a rectal and pelvic exam.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Abdominal and pelvic CT scan\n*   Abdominal MRI scan\n*   Cystoscopy (examining the inside of the bladder with a camera), with biopsy\n*   Intravenous pyelogram - IVP\n*   Urinalysis\n*   Urine cytology\n*   PET scan\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the stage of the cancer, the severity of your symptoms, and your overall health.\n\nStage 0 and I treatments:\n\n*   Surgery to remove the tumor without removing the rest of the bladder\n*   Chemotherapy or immunotherapy placed directly into the bladder\n*   Immunotherapy given intravenously with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) if the cancer continues to return after the above measures\n\nStage II and III treatments:\n\n*   Surgery to remove the entire bladder (radical cystectomy) and nearby lymph nodes\n*   Surgery to remove only part of the bladder, followed by radiation and chemotherapy\n*   Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery or after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer from coming back\n*   A combination of chemotherapy and radiation (in people who choose not to have surgery or who cannot have surgery)\n\nMost people with stage IV tumors cannot be cured and surgery is not appropriate. In these people, chemotherapy, the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (Padcev), targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are often considered.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBladder cancers may spread into the nearby organs. They may also travel through the pelvic lymph nodes and spread to the liver, lungs, and bones. Additional complications of bladder cancer include:\n\n*   Spread of cancer to other parts of the body\n*   Incontinence or urine leakage\n*   Painful urination\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Weight loss\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nBladder cancer often starts from the cells lining the bladder. These cells are called transitional cells.\n\nThese tumors are classified by the way they grow:\n\n*   **Papillary tumors**: look like warts and are attached to a stalk.\n*   **Carcinoma in situ tumors**: are flat. They are much less common. But they are more invasive and have a worse outcome.\n\nThe exact cause of bladder cancer is not known. But several things that may make you more likely to develop it include:\n\n*   Cigarette smoking -- Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers may be caused by cigarette smoke.\n*   Personal or family history of bladder cancer -- Having someone in the family with bladder cancer increases your risk of developing it.\n*   Chemical exposure -- Bladder cancer can be caused by coming into contact with cancer-causing chemicals (often at work). These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk.\n*   Chemotherapy -- The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk for bladder cancer.\n*   Radiation treatment -- Radiation therapy to the pelvis region for treatment of cancers of the prostate, testes, cervix, or uterus increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.\n*   Bladder infection -- A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.\n\nResearch has not shown clear evidence that using artificial sweeteners leads to bladder cancer in humans.\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Cancer**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Bladder cancer often starts from the cells lining the bladder.

It is essential to see your health care provider to check for all other possible causes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical examination, including a rectal and pelvic exam.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Abdominal and pelvic CT scan\n* Abdominal MRI scan\n* Cystoscopy (examining the inside of the bladder with a camera), with biopsy\n* Intravenous pyelogram - IVP\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine cytology\n* PET scan\n\nIf tests confirm you have bladder cancer, additional tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up and gives you some idea of what to expect in the future.\n\nThe TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) staging system is used to stage bladder cancer:\n\n* Ta -- The cancer is in the lining of the bladder only and has not spread.\n* T1 -- The cancer goes through the bladder lining, but does not reach the bladder muscle.\n* T2 -- The cancer spreads to the bladder muscle.\n* T3 -- The cancer spreads past the bladder into the fatty tissue surrounding it.\n* T4 -- The cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the prostate gland, uterus, vagina, rectum, abdominal wall, or pelvic wall.\n\nTumors are also grouped based on how they appear under a microscope. This is called grading the tumor. A high-grade tumor is fast growing and more likely to spread. Bladder cancer can spread into nearby areas, including:\n\n* Lymph nodes in the pelvis\n* Bones\n* Liver\n* Lungs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the stage of the cancer, the severity of your symptoms, and your overall health.\n\nStage 0 and I treatments:\n\n* Surgery to remove the tumor without removing the rest of the bladder\n* Chemotherapy or immunotherapy placed directly into the bladder\n* Immunotherapy given intravenously with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) if the cancer continues to return after the above measures\n\nStage II and III treatments:\n\n* Surgery to remove the entire bladder (radical cystectomy) and nearby lymph nodes\n* Surgery to remove only part of the bladder, followed by radiation and chemotherapy\n* Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery or after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer from coming back\n* A combination of chemotherapy and radiation (in people who choose not to have surgery or who cannot have surgery)\n\nMost people with stage IV tumors cannot be cured and surgery is not appropriate. In these people, chemotherapy, the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (Padcev), targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are often considered.\n\n**Chemotherapy**\n\nChemotherapy may be given to people with stage II and III disease either before or after surgery to help prevent the tumor from returning.\n\nFor early disease (stages 0 and I), chemotherapy is usually given directly into the bladder.\n\n**Immunotherapy**\n\nBladder cancers are often treated with immunotherapy. In this treatment, a medicine triggers your immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy for early stage bladder cancer is often performed using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (commonly known as BCG). If the cancer returns after the use of BCG, newer agents may be used.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nSurgery for bladder cancer includes:\n\n* Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) -- Cancerous bladder tissue is removed through the urethra.\n* Partial or complete removal of the bladder -- Many people with stage II or III bladder cancer may need to have their bladder removed (radical cystectomy). Sometimes, only part of the bladder is removed. Chemotherapy may be given before or after this surgery.\n\nSurgery may also be done to help your body drain urine after the bladder is removed. This may include:\n\n* Ileal conduit -- A small urine reservoir is surgically created from a short piece of your small intestine.\n* Continent urinary reservoir -- A pouch to collect urine is created inside your body using a piece of your intestine.\n* Orthotopic neobladder -- This surgery is becoming more common in people who have had their bladder removed.\n\n---\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the stage of the cancer, the severity of your symptoms, and your overall health.\n\n**Stage 0 and I treatments:**\n\n* Surgery to remove the tumor without removing the rest of the bladder\n* Chemotherapy or immunotherapy placed directly into the bladder\n* Immunotherapy given intravenously with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) if the cancer continues to return after the above measures\n\n**Stage II and III treatments:**\n\n* Surgery to remove the entire bladder (radical cystectomy) and nearby lymph nodes\n* Surgery to remove only part of the bladder, followed by radiation and chemotherapy\n* Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery or after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer from coming back\n* A combination of chemotherapy and radiation (in people who choose not to have surgery or who cannot have surgery)\n\n**Most people with stage IV tumors cannot be cured and surgery is not appropriate.

Immunotherapy for early stage bladder cancer is often performed using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (commonly known as BCG). If the cancer returns after the use of BCG, newer agents may be used.\n\nAs with all treatments, side effects are possible. Ask your provider what side effects you might expect, and what to do if they occur.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Surgery**\n\nSurgery for bladder cancer includes:\n\n* Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) -- Cancerous bladder tissue is removed through the urethra.\n* Partial or complete removal of the bladder -- Many people with stage II or III bladder cancer may need to have their bladder removed (radical cystectomy). Sometimes, only part of the bladder is removed. Chemotherapy may be given before or after this surgery.\n\nSurgery may also be done to help your body drain urine after the bladder is removed. This may include:\n\n* Ileal conduit -- A small urine reservoir is surgically created from a short piece of your small intestine. The ureters that drain urine from the kidneys are attached to one end of this piece. The other end is brought out through an opening in the skin (a stoma). The stoma allows the person to drain the collected urine out of the reservoir.\n* Continent urinary reservoir -- A pouch to collect urine is created inside your body using a piece of your intestine. You will need to insert a tube into an opening in your skin (stoma) into this pouch to drain the urine.\n* Orthotopic neobladder -- This surgery is becoming more common in people who have had their bladder removed. A part of your bowel is folded over to make a pouch that collects urine. It is attached to the place in the body where the urine normally empties from the bladder. This procedure allows you to maintain some normal urinary control.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter treatment for bladder cancer, you will be closely monitored by a provider. This may include:\n\n* CT scans to check for the spread or return of cancer\n* Monitoring symptoms that might suggest the disease is getting worse, such as fatigue, weight loss, increased pain, decreased bowel and bladder function, and weakness\n* Complete blood count (CBC) to monitor for anemia\n* Bladder exams every 3 to 6 months after treatment\n* Urinalysis, if you did not have your bladder removed\n\nHow well a person with bladder cancer does depends on the initial stage and response to treatment of the bladder cancer.\n\nThe outlook for stage 0 or I cancers is fairly good. Although the risk for the cancer returning is high, most bladder cancers that return can be surgically removed and cured.\n\nThe cure rates for people with stage III tumors are less than 50%. People with stage IV bladder cancer are rarely cured.\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Cancer**\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   Anemia\n*   Swelling of the ureters (hydronephrosis)\n*   Urethral stricture\n*   Urinary incontinence\n*   Erectile dysfunction in men\n*   Sexual dysfunction in women\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have blood in your urine or other symptoms of bladder cancer, including:\n\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Painful urination\n*   Urgent need to urinate\n\nContact your provider if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo reduce the risk of bladder cancer:\n\n*   Quit smoking\n*   Avoid exposure to chemicals linked to bladder cancer",

    "content": "**Bladder Exstrophy Repair**\n\n\\n\\n**Description**\n\nBladder exstrophy repair involves two surgeries. The first surgery is to repair the bladder. The second one is to attach the pelvic bones to each other.\n\nThe first surgery separates the exposed bladder from the abdomen wall. The bladder is then closed. The bladder neck and urethra are repaired. A flexible, hollow tube called a catheter is placed to drain urine from the bladder. This is placed through the abdominal wall. A second catheter is left in the urethra to promote healing.\n\nThe second surgery, pelvic bone surgery, may be done along with the bladder repair. It may also be delayed for weeks or months.\n\nA third surgery may be needed if there is a bowel defect or any problems with the first two repairs.\n\n\\n\\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe surgery is recommended for children who are born with bladder exstrophy. This defect occurs more often in boys and is often linked to other birth defects.\n\nSurgery is necessary to:\n\n*   Allow the child to develop normal urinary control\n*   Avoid future problems with sexual function\n*   Improve the child's physical appearance (genitals will look more normal)\n*   Prevent infection that could harm the kidneys\n\nSometimes, the bladder is too small at birth. In this case, the surgery will be delayed until the bladder has grown. These newborns are sent home on antibiotics. The bladder, which is outside the abdomen, must be kept moist.\n\nIt can take months for the bladder to grow to the right size. The infant will be followed closely by a medical team. The team decides when the surgery should take place.\n\n\\n\\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots\n*   Infection\n\nRisks with this procedure may include:\n\n*   Chronic urinary tract infections\n*   Sexual/erectile dysfunction\n*   Kidney problems\n*   Need for future surgeries\n*   Poor urinary control (incontinence)\n\n\\n\\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nMost bladder exstrophy repairs are done when your child is only a few days old, before leaving the hospital. In this case, the hospital staff will prepare your child for the surgery.\n\n\\n\\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter pelvic bone surgery, your child will need to be in a lower body cast or sling for 4 to 6 weeks. This helps the bones heal.\n\nAfter the bladder surgery, your child will have a tube that drains the bladder through the abdominal wall (suprapubic catheter). This will be in place for 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nYour child will also need pain management, wound care, and antibiotics. The provider will teach you about these things before you leave the hospital.\n\nDue to the high risk for infection, your child will need to have a urinalysis and urine culture at every well-child visit. At the first signs of an illness, these tests may be repeated. Some children take antibiotics on a regular basis to prevent infection.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nUrinary control most often happens after the neck of the bladder is repaired. This surgery is not always successful. The child may need to repeat the surgery later on.\n\nEven with repeat surgery, a few children will not have control of their urine. They may need catheterization.\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Exstrophy Repair**\n\n**Description**\n\nBladder exstrophy repair involves two surgeries to correct a birth defect of the bladder.\n\n**The First Surgery**\n\nThe first surgery separates the exposed bladder from the abdominal wall, closes the bladder, and repairs the bladder neck and urethra. A catheter is placed through the abdominal wall to drain urine from the bladder, and another catheter is left in the urethra to promote healing.\n\n**The Second Surgery**\n\nThe second surgery, pelvic bone surgery, may be done along with the bladder repair or delayed for weeks or months. This surgery attaches the pelvic bones to each other.\n\n**A Third Surgery May Be Needed**\n\nIf there is a bowel defect or any problems with the first two repairs, a third surgery may be necessary.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe surgery is recommended for children born with bladder exstrophy, which occurs more often in boys and is often linked to other birth defects. The procedure aims to:\n\n* Allow the child to develop normal urinary control\n* Avoid future problems with sexual function\n* Improve the child's physical appearance (genitals will look more normal)\n* Prevent infection that could harm the kidneys\n\n**Preparation for Surgery**\n\nIf the surgery is not done when the child is a newborn, they may need the following tests at the time of surgery:\n\n* Urine test (urine culture and urinalysis) to check the child's urine for infection and to test kidney function\n* Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney tests)\n* Record of urine output\n* X-ray of pelvis\n* Ultrasound of the kidneys\n\nThe child should stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines ten days before the surgery. The surgeon will tell you when to arrive on the day of the surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter pelvic bone surgery, the child will need to be in a lower body cast or sling for 4 to 6 weeks. After the bladder surgery, the child will have a tube that drains the bladder through the abdominal wall (suprapubic catheter) for 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nThe child will also need pain management, wound care, and antibiotics.

In this case, surgery will be delayed until the bladder has grown.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is necessary to repair the bladder and restore normal function.\n\n**Risks of Anesthesia and Surgery**\n\nThe risks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots\n*   Infection\n\nAdditionally, there are specific risks associated with this procedure, including:\n\n*   Chronic urinary tract infections\n*   Sexual/erectile dysfunction\n*   Kidney problems\n*   Need for future surgeries\n*   Poor urinary control (incontinence)\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nMost bladder exstrophy repairs are done when your child is only a few days old, before leaving the hospital.

Also let them know about the medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription that your child takes.\n\nTen days before the surgery, your child may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines. These medicines make it hard for the blood to clot. Ask the surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n*   Your child will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery.\n*   Give the medicines your child's surgeon told you to give with a small sip of water.\n*   Your child's surgeon will tell you when to arrive.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter pelvic bone surgery, your child will need to be in a lower body cast or sling for 4 to 6 weeks.
