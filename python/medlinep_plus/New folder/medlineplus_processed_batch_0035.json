It can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n*   **Heart attack**: A blockage in one of the coronary arteries can cause damage to the heart muscle, leading to cardiogenic shock.\n*   **Cardiac arrest**: When the heart stops beating, it cannot pump blood effectively, leading to cardiogenic shock.\n*   **Severe heart failure**: In some cases, the heart may become so weakened that it cannot pump enough blood, even with treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of cardiogenic shock can include:\n\n*   **Shortness of breath**: The body's tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, leading to shortness of breath.\n*   **Chest pain**: The heart is under strain, causing pain in the chest.\n*   **Confusion**: The brain is not receiving enough oxygen, leading to confusion and disorientation.\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A doctor will perform a physical exam to look for signs of cardiogenic shock, such as low blood pressure and weak pulse.\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: An ECG can show abnormal heart rhythms or damage to the heart muscle.\n*   **Blood tests**: Blood tests can help determine the cause of cardiogenic shock.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for cardiogenic shock typically involves:\n\n*   **Oxygen therapy**: Providing oxygen to help improve blood flow and reduce tissue damage.\n*   **Fluid resuscitation**: Administering fluids to help restore blood volume and improve cardiac output.\n*   **Inotropic agents**: Using medications to increase the heart's pumping efficiency.\n*   **Cardiac arrest treatment**: If the heart has stopped beating, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be necessary.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for cardiogenic shock is generally poor, with a high mortality rate. However, prompt and effective treatment can improve outcomes. It's essential to seek medical attention immediately if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of cardiogenic shock.",

It often contributes to the heart's inability to pump or function well.\n\nMany people with cardiomyopathy have heart failure.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many types of cardiomyopathy, with different causes. Some of the more common ones are:\n\n* **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: A condition in which the heart becomes weak and the chambers get large. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood out to the body. It can be caused by many medical problems.\n* **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: A condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for blood to leave the heart. This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families.\n* **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: Caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well.\n* **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy**: A group of disorders in which the heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause.\n* **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy**: Occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen possible, the cause of cardiomyopathy is treated. Medicines and lifestyle changes are often needed to treat the symptoms of heart failure, angina, and abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nProcedures or surgeries may also be used, including:\n\n* A defibrillator that sends an electrical pulse to stop life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms\n* A pacemaker that treats a slow heart rate or helps the heart beat in a more coordinated fashion\n* Coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery or angioplasty that may improve blood flow to the damaged or weakened heart muscle\n* Heart transplant that may be tried when all other treatments have failed\n\nPartially and fully implantable mechanical heart pumps have been developed. These may be used for very severe cases. However, not all people need this advanced treatment.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on many different things, including:\n\n* Cause and type of cardiomyopathy\n* The severity of the heart problem\n* How long the problem has been present\n* How well the condition responds to treatment\n\nHeart failure is most often a long-term (chronic) illness.

It can be done using an electric shock or with medicines.\n\n**Information**\n\nCardioversion can be done using an electric shock or with medicines. The goal of cardioversion is to restore a normal heartbeat and prevent complications such as cardiac arrest.\n\n**Electrical Cardioversion**\n\nElectrical cardioversion is done with a device that gives off an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal. The device is called a defibrillator.\n\n*   **External Defibrillator**: An external defibrillator is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) that cause collapse and cardiac arrest.\n*   **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)**: An ICD is a device that is placed inside your body.

The device is called a defibrillator.\n\nThe shock can be delivered from a device outside the body called an external defibrillator. These are found in emergency rooms, ambulances, or some public places such as airports.\n\nElectrode patches are placed on the chest and back. The patches are connected to the defibrillator. Or, paddles attached to the devices are placed directly onto the chest.\n\nThe defibrillator is activated and an electric shock is delivered to your heart. This shock briefly stops all electrical activity of the heart. Then it allows the normal heart rhythm to return. Sometimes more than one shock, or a shock with higher energy is needed.\n\nAn external defibrillator is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) that cause collapse and cardiac arrest. Examples are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. These same devices may also be used to treat less dangerous abnormal rhythms, problems such as atrial fibrillation.\n\nSome people may need to start blood thinners beforehand to prevent small blood clots. You will be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. After the procedure, you may be given medicines to prevent blood clots or to help prevent the arrhythmia from coming back.\n\nAn implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is placed inside your body. It is most often used in people who are at risk for sudden death because their heart function is so poor, or they have had dangerous heart rhythms before.\n\nThe ICD is implanted underneath the skin of your upper chest or abdomen. Wires are attached that go into or near the heart. If the device detects a dangerous heartbeat, it sends an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal.\n\n**Cardioversion Using Medicines**\n\nCardioversion can be done using medicines that are taken by mouth or given through an intravenous line (IV). It can take from several minutes to days for this treatment to work. This treatment is often done while in a hospital where your heart rhythm will be monitored.\n\nCardioversion using medicines can be done outside the hospital. This treatment is most often used for people with atrial fibrillation that comes and goes. However, you will need to be closely followed-up by a cardiologist.\n\nYou may be given blood thinning medicines to prevent blood clots from forming and leaving the heart (which can cause a stroke).\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications of cardioversion are uncommon, but may include:\n\n* Allergic reactions from medicines used\n* Blood clots that can cause a stroke or other organ damage\n* Bruising, burning, or pain where the electrodes were used\n* Worsening of the arrhythmia\n\nPeople who perform external cardioversion may be shocked if the procedure is not done correctly. This can cause heart rhythm problems, pain, and even death.\n\n---\n\n**Cardioversion**\n\nCardioversion is a medical procedure that uses an electric shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. The shock briefly stops all electrical activity of the heart, allowing the normal rhythm to return.\n\n**Electrical Cardioversion**\n\nElectrical cardioversion is done with a device that gives off an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal.

It is often performed using electrical shocks or cardioverter-defibrillators.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does Cardioversion Work?**\n\nDuring a cardioversion procedure, the doctor will use electrical shocks or a cardioverter-defibrillator to restore a normal heart rhythm. The goal of the procedure is to eliminate the abnormal heart rhythm and prevent further complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Needs Cardioversion?**\n\nCardioversion may be necessary for individuals who experience frequent or severe arrhythmias that can lead to cardiac arrest or other serious health problems. It is typically performed on patients with conditions such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or other life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparation and Procedure**\n\nBefore undergoing cardioversion, the patient will typically undergo a series of tests to determine the cause of their abnormal heart rhythm. The procedure itself usually takes place in a hospital setting and may involve the use of sedation or anesthesia to ensure comfort during the treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recovery and Follow-Up**\n\nAfter the procedure, patients are usually monitored for several hours to ensure that their heart rhythm has returned to normal. They may also be prescribed medications to prevent future arrhythmias or to manage any underlying conditions that led to the abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Arrhythmia\n*   Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator",

The person who needs help may be a child, an adult, or an older adult. They may need help because of an injury, chronic illness, or disability.\n\nSome caregivers are informal caregivers. They are usually family members or friends. Other caregivers are paid professionals. Caregivers may give care at home or in a hospital or other health care setting. Sometimes they are caregiving from a distance. The types of tasks that caregivers do may include:\n\n* Helping with daily tasks like bathing, eating, or taking medicine\n* Arranging activities and medical care\n* Making health and financial decisions\n\n**How does caregiving affect the caregiver?**\n\nCaregiving can be rewarding. It may help to strengthen connections to a loved one. You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But caregiving may also be stressful and sometimes even overwhelming. Caregiving may involve meeting complex demands without any training or help. You may also be working and have children or others to care for. To meet all of the demands, you might be putting your own needs and feelings aside. But that's not good for your long-term health. But you need to make sure that you are also taking care of yourself.\n\n**What is caregiver stress?**\n\nMany caregivers are affected by caregiver stress. This is the stress that comes from the emotional and physical strain of caregiving. The signs include:\n\n* Feeling overwhelmed\n* Feeling alone, isolated, or deserted by others\n* Sleeping too much or too little\n* Gaining or losing a lot of weight\n* Feeling tired most of the time\n* Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy\n* Becoming easily irritated or angered\n* Feeling worried or sad often\n* Having headaches or body aches often\n* Turning to unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drinking too much alcohol\n\n**How can caregiver stress affect my health?**\n\nLong-term caregiver stress may put you at risk for many different health problems. Some of these problems can be serious. They include:\n\n* Depression and anxiety\n* A weak immune system\n* Excess weight and obesity\n* Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or arthritis. Depression and obesity can raise the risk of these diseases even more.\n* Problems with short-term memory or paying attention\n\n**What can I do to prevent or relieve caregiver stress?**\n\nTaking steps to prevent or relieve caregiver stress may help prevent health problems. Remember that if you feel better, you can take better care of your loved one. It will also be easier to focus on the rewards of caregiving. Some ways to help yourself include:\n\n* Learning better ways to help your loved one\n* Finding caregiving resources in your community to help you\n* Asking for and accepting help\n* Joining a support group for caregivers\n* Being organized to make caregiving more manageable\n* Staying in touch with family and friends\n* Taking care of your own health\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n7 Ways Caregivers Can Ease Stress (Nemours Foundation)\nTaking Care of You: Self-Care for Family Caregivers (Family Caregiver Alliance)\nTaking Care of Yourself: Tips for Caregivers  (National Institute on Aging)\n\n**Living With**\n\nCoping with Caregiving: Take Care of Yourself While Caring for Others  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nCaregiver Depression (Alzheimer's Association)\nFast Facts: Memory Loss Among Caregivers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n**Specifics**\n\nCaregiver Stress (Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health)\nSupport for Caregivers of Cancer Patients  (National Cancer Institute)\n\n---\n\n**Caregiver Health**\n\nAs a caregiver, it's essential to remember that taking care of yourself is crucial for your long-term health.

    "content": "**Caregiving - Medication Management**\n\nIt's essential for caregivers to know what each medicine is for and about possible side effects. You'll also need to work with all healthcare providers to keep track of the medicines your loved one takes.\n\nIf your loved one has vision or hearing loss, or loss of hand function, you'll also be their ears, eyes, and hands, ensuring they take the right dose of the right pill at the right time.\n\n**MAKE A CARE PLAN WITH PROVIDERS**\n\nAttending provider appointments with your loved one can help you stay on top of which medicines are prescribed and why they're needed.\n\nDiscuss the plan of care with each provider regularly:\n\n* Learn as much as you can about your loved one's health conditions.\n* Bring a list of all prescribed medicines, including supplements and herbs, to each provider appointment. If possible, bring the pill bottles with you to show the provider.\n* Find out what condition each medicine treats. Ensure you know the dosage and when it should be taken.\n* Ask which medicines need to be given daily and which are used only for specific symptoms or problems (also called \"prn use\").\n* Check if the medicine is covered by your loved one's health insurance. If not, discuss alternative options with the provider.\n* Write down any new instructions and ensure both you and your loved one understand them.\n\n**DON'T RUN OUT**\n\nKeep track of how many refills are left for each medicine. This information should be on the medicine bottle label. Make sure you know when to see the provider next for a refill.\n\nPlan ahead: Contact your loved one's pharmacy for refills up to a week before they're due to run out. Ask their provider which medicines can be obtained with a 90 or 100-day supply.\n\n**RISK OF MEDICINE INTERACTIONS**\n\nMany older adults take multiple medicines, which can lead to medicine or drug interactions. Be sure to discuss the medicines being taken with each provider. Some interactions can cause unwanted or serious side effects.\n\nTypes of interactions:\n\n* Medicine-medicine interactions: Older people are more likely to have harmful reactions between different medicines.\n* Medicine-alcohol interactions: Mixing alcohol and medicines may cause loss of memory, coordination issues, or irritability, increasing the risk of falls.\n* Medicine-food interactions: Certain foods can affect how well some medicines work. For example, avoid taking warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) with foods high in vitamin K, such as kale.\n\nSome medicines may worsen certain health conditions in older adults. For instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can increase the chance of fluid buildup and worsen heart failure symptoms.\n\n**TALK WITH YOUR LOVED ONE'S PHARMACIST**\n\nGet to know your loved one's pharmacist. They can help you keep track of the various medicines your loved one takes and answer questions about side effects.\n\nTips for working with the pharmacist:\n\n* Match the written prescription with the medicines you receive from a pharmacy.\n* Ask for large print on the prescription packaging to make it easier for your loved one to see.\n* If there's medicine that can be split in two, the pharmacist can help you split tablets to give the correct dosage.\n* If there are medicines that are difficult to swallow, ask the pharmacist for alternatives.\n\n**ORGANIZING MEDICINES**\n\nWith many medicines to keep track of, it's essential to learn certain tricks to help you stay organized:\n\n* Keep an up-to-date list of all medicines and supplements, as well as any allergies. Bring this list to every provider appointment and hospital visit.\n* Store all medicines in a safe place.\n* Check the \"expiration\" or \"use by\" date of all medicines.\n* Keep all medicines in original bottles. Use weekly pill organizers to keep track of what needs to be taken each day.\n* Devise a system to help you remember when to give each medicine during the day.\n\n**PLANNING AND ADMINISTERING THE MEDICINES PROPERLY**\n\nSimple steps can help you manage all medicines regularly:\n\n* Keep all medicines together in one place.\n* Use meal times and bedtimes as reminders to take medicines.\n* Use a watch alarm or notification on your mobile device for in-between medicines.\n* Read the instruction sheets fully before giving medicine in the form of eye-drops, inhaled medicines, or injections.\n* Dispose of any leftover medicines properly.\n\n---\n\n**Caregiving - Medication Management**\n\nAs a caregiver, it's essential to understand how to manage your loved one's medications effectively. This includes knowing what each medicine is for, about possible side effects, and working with all health care providers to keep track of the medicines taken.\n\n**Make a Care Plan with Providers**\n\nGoing to provider appointments with your loved one can help you stay on top of which medicines are prescribed and why they are needed. Discuss the plan of care with each provider on a regular basis:\n\n*   Learn as much as you can about your loved one's health conditions.\n*   Bring a list of all prescribed medicines, and those bought without a prescription, including supplements and herbs, to each provider appointment. If possible, bring the pill bottles with you to show the provider.\n*   Talk with the provider to make sure the medicines are still needed.\n*   Find out what condition each medicine treats. Be sure you know what the dosage is and when it should be taken.\n*   Ask which medicines need to be given every day and which are used only for certain symptoms or problems (also called \"prn use\").\n*   Check to make sure the medicine is covered by your loved one's health insurance. If not, discuss other options with the provider.\n*   Write down any new instructions and make sure both you and your loved one understand them.\n\n**Don't Run Out**\n\nKeep track of how many refills are left for each medicine. This should be on the medicine bottle label. Make sure you know when you need to see the provider next for a refill.\n\nPlan ahead. Contact your loved one's pharmacy for refills up to a week before they are due to run out. Ask their provider which medicines they can get a 90 or 100 day supply for.\n\n**Risk of Medicine Interactions**\n\nMany older adults take multiple medicines. This can lead to medicine or drug interactions. Be sure to talk with each provider about the medicines being taken. Some interactions can cause unwanted or serious side-effects. These are the different interactions that can occur:\n\n*   **Medicine-medicine interactions**: Older people are more likely to have more harmful reactions between different medicines.\n*   **Medicine-alcohol interactions**: Older people may be more affected by alcohol.\n*   **Medicine-food interactions**: Certain foods can cause some medicines not to work as well.\n\n**Organizing Medicines**\n\nWith many medicines to keep track of, it's essential to learn certain tricks to help you keep them organized:\n\n*   Keep an up-to-date list of all medicines and supplements and any allergies.\n*   Bring all of your medicines or a complete list to every provider appointment and hospital visit.\n*   Check the \"expiration\" or \"use by\" date of all medicines.\n*   Keep all the medicines in original bottles.

Others may interfere with how well the medicines work.\n\n*   Medicine-medicine interactions: Be sure to talk with each provider about the medicines being taken.\n*   Medicine-alcohol interactions: Older people may be more affected by alcohol. Mixing alcohol and medicines may cause a loss of memory or coordination or cause irritability. It can also increase the risk of falls.\n*   Medicine-food interactions: Certain foods can cause some medicines not to work as well.\n\n**Some Medicines May Worsen Health Conditions**\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen may increase the chance of fluid buildup and worsen heart failure symptoms.\n\n**TALK WITH YOUR LOVED ONE'S PHARMACIST**\n\nGet to know your loved one's pharmacist.

    "content": "**Carfilzomib Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCarfilzomib injection is used alone and in combination with other medications to treat people with multiple myeloma (a type of cancer of the bone marrow) who have already been treated with other medications. Carfilzomib is in a class of medications called proteasome inhibitors. It works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells in your body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCarfilzomib comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). Carfilzomib is given by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic usually over a period of 10 or 30 minutes. It may be given 2 days in a row each week for 3 weeks followed by a 12-day rest period or it may be given once a week for 3 weeks followed by a 13-day rest period. The length of treatment will depend on how well your body responds to the medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving carfilzomib injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to carfilzomib, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in carfilzomib injection.

You or your partner should not become pregnant while you are receiving carfilzomib. If you are female, you must take a pregnancy test before starting treatment and should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment with carfilzomib and for 6 months after your final dose. If you are a male, you and your partner should use birth control methods to prevent pregnancy during your treatment with carfilzomib and for 3 months after your final dose.\n\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. Do not breastfeed while you are receiving carfilzomib injection and for 2 weeks after your final dose.\n\nYou should know that carfilzomib may make you drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, or cause fainting.

    "content": "**Caring for Muscle Spasticity or Spasms**\n\nMuscle spasticity, or spasms, causes your muscles to become stiff or rigid. It can also cause exaggerated, deep tendon reflexes, like a knee-jerk reaction when your reflexes are checked. Muscle spasms are typically brief whereas spasticity lasts longer. Muscle spasticity is usually due to a neurologic condition but muscle spasms often occur in people with no known neurologic condition.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTo manage muscle spasticity, avoid the following:\n\n*   Being too hot or too cold\n*   The time of day (spasticity can worsen at certain times)\n*   Stress\n*   Tight clothing\n*   Bladder infections and spasms\n*   Your menstrual cycle (for women)\n*   Certain body positions\n*   New skin wounds or ulcers\n*   Hemorrhoids\n*   Being very tired or not getting enough sleep\n*   Use of diuretics\n*   Blood and electrolyte imbalances\n\nYour physical therapist can teach you and your caregiver stretching exercises to help keep your muscles from getting shorter or tighter. Being active also helps keep your muscles loose, so consider aerobic exercise, such as swimming, and strength-building exercises. Talk with your health care provider or physical therapist before starting any exercise program.\n\nYour provider or physical/occupational therapist may place splints or casts on some of your joints to prevent them from becoming too tight. Make sure to wear the splints or casts as directed. Be careful about getting pressure sores from exercise or being in the same position for too long.\n\nMuscle spasticity can increase your chances of falling and hurting yourself, so take precautions to avoid falls.\n\n**Medicines That Help With Spasticity**\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines to help with muscle spasticity. Some common ones are:\n\n*   Baclofen (Lioresal)\n*   Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection\n*   Dantrolene (Dantrium)\n*   Diazepam (Valium)\n*   Gabapentin (Neurontin)\n*   Tizanidine (Zanaflex)\n\nThese medicines have side effects. Contact your provider if you experience:\n\n*   Being tired during the day\n*   Confusion\n*   Feeling \"hung over\" in the morning\n*   Nausea\n*   Problems passing urine\n\nDo not stop taking these medicines without consulting your provider, especially Zanaflex.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nPay attention to changes in your muscle spasticity. Changes may indicate that your other medical problems are worsening. Contact your provider if you experience:\n\n*   Problems with the medicines you are taking for muscle spasms\n*   Joint contracture (difficulty moving your joints)\n*   Harder time moving around or getting out of your bed or chair\n*   Skin sores or skin redness\n*   Worsening pain\n\n---\n\n**Caring for Muscle Spasticity or Spasms**\n\n**What is muscle spasticity?**\n\nMuscle spasticity, also known as spasms, causes your muscles to become stiff or rigid.

These stretches will also help improve your range of motion.\n\n**Exercise Program**\n\nBeing active also helps keep your muscles loose. Aerobic exercise, such as swimming, and strength-building exercises are helpful as are playing sports and doing daily tasks. Talk with your health care provider or physical therapist first before starting any exercise program.\n\n**Splints or Casts**\n\nYour provider or physical/occupational therapist may place splints or casts on some of your joints to keep them from becoming so tight that you cannot move them easily. Make sure to wear the splints or casts as your provider tells you to.\n\n**Pressure Sores**\n\nBe careful about getting pressure sores from exercise or being in the same position in a bed or wheelchair for too long.\n\n**Falling Precautions**\n\nMuscle spasticity can increase your chances of falling and hurting yourself. Be sure to take precautions so you do not fall.\n\n**Medicines That Help With Spasticity**\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines for you to take to help with muscle spasticity. Some common ones are:\n\n*   Baclofen (Lioresal)\n*   Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection\n*   Dantrolene (Dantrium)\n*   Diazepam (Valium)\n*   Gabapentin (Neurontin)\n*   Tizanidine (Zanaflex)\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nThese medicines have side effects. Contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Being tired during the day\n*   Confusion\n*   Feeling \"hung over\" in the morning\n*   Nausea\n*   Problems passing urine\n\nDo not just stop taking these medicines, especially Zanaflex. It can be dangerous if you stop abruptly.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nPay attention to changes in your muscle spasticity. Changes may mean that your other medical problems are getting worse.\n\nAlways contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Problems with the medicines you are taking for muscle spasms\n*   Can't move your joints as much (joint contracture)\n*   Harder time moving around or getting out of your bed or chair\n*   Skin sores or skin redness\n*   Your pain is getting worse\n\n---\n\n**Caring for Muscle Spasticity or Spasms**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Care of Cle Stiffness**\n\nIf you have muscle spasticity or spasms, there are several things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n*   **Stretch regularly**: Stretching can help improve flexibility and reduce stiffness.\n*   **Exercise regularly**: Exercise can help improve strength and range of motion.\n*   **Practice good posture**: Good posture can help reduce strain on your muscles and joints.\n*   **Get enough sleep**: Getting enough sleep is essential for overall health, including muscle function.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Association of Neurological Surgeons website.

    "content": "**Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency**\n\n_Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from using certain fats for energy._\n\n*The signs and symptoms of CPT I deficiency are often brought on by episodes of increased energy demands in the body such as illness or periods of fasting. During these times, affected individuals usually develop low levels of glucose in the blood and a low level of ketones, which are normally produced when fats are broken down to be used for energy. Together, these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. This may cause individuals to experience confusion, seizures, or a lack of energy (lethargy).*\n\n_People with CPT I deficiency can also develop an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) that is not able to remove toxins from the blood efficiently. These toxins build up and can affect brain function (hepatic encephalopathy). As long as no brain damage occurs during these episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, individuals with CPT I deficiency often have normal development._\n\n_Health can decline quickly in people with CPT I deficiency. Affected individuals are encouraged to avoid prolonged fasting to prevent serious health problems. Individuals with CPT I deficiency are at risk for nervous system damage, liver failure, coma, and sudden death. These problems can begin any time between infancy to adulthood, though some individuals experience no health problems at all._\n\n_CPT I deficiency is often detected shortly after birth by newborn screening, which identifies abnormal levels of certain compounds in the blood. People with CPT I deficiency have high levels of a compound called carnitine. Cells use carnitine, a natural substance that is acquired mostly through the diet, to process fats and produce energy._\n\n---\n\n**Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency**\n\n**What is Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency, also known as CPT I deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to use certain fats for energy. It is caused by variants in the CPT1A gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also known as caused mutations) in the CPT1A gene cause CPT I deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which is found in the liver.\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. During periods of fasting, fats are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues. Within liver cells, fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers.\n\nBefore entering mitochondria, a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids must first be attached to carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A connects carnitine to long-chain fatty acids so they can enter mitochondria and be metabolized to produce energy.\n\nVariants in the CPT1A gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, leading to a buildup of fatty acids and related compounds in cells. This abnormal buildup causes the signs and symptoms of CPT I deficiency, including hypoketotic hypoglycemia, an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and damage to the liver, heart, and brain.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCPT I deficiency is a rare disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 750,000 to 2,000,000 infants in the United States. It is more common in certain populations, including some Native Alaskan populations and some Native Pacific Island populations. In certain regions of China, CPT I deficiency is estimated to have an incidence of 1 in 102,388 infants.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of CPT I deficiency are often brought on by episodes of increased energy demands in the body, such as illness or periods of fasting. During these times, affected individuals usually develop low levels of glucose in the blood and a low level of ketones, which are normally produced when fats are broken down to be used for energy.\n\nTogether, these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and they may cause individuals to experience confusion, seizures, or a lack of energy (lethargy). People with CPT I deficiency can also develop an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) that is not able to remove toxins from the blood efficiently.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHealth can decline quickly in people with CPT I deficiency. Affected individuals are encouraged to avoid prolonged fasting to prevent serious health problems. Individuals with CPT I deficiency are at risk for nervous system damage, liver failure, coma, and sudden death. These problems can begin any time between infancy to adulthood, though some individuals experience no health problems at all.\n\nCPT I deficiency is often detected shortly after birth by newborn screening, which identifies abnormal levels of certain compounds in the blood. People with CPT I deficiency have high levels of a compound called carnitine. Cells use carnitine, a natural substance that is acquired mostly through the diet, to process fats and produce energy.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nTo learn more about the gene associated with Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency, click on the link below:\n\n*   [CPT1A](#)\n\nThis will take you to a page where you can find more information about the CPT1A gene and its relationship to Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency**\n\n**What is Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in the CPT1A gene. This condition affects the body's ability to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy, leading to severe health problems.\n\n**How Does Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency Affect the Body?**\n\nVariants in the CPT1A gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. As a result, there are not enough enzymes available to attach carnitine to long-chain fatty acids when energy demands are high. Without carnitine, these fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria to be broken down and used for energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT I deficiency, such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Fatty acids and related compounds may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and brain.\n\n**What are the Signs and Symptoms of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of CPT I deficiency include:\n\n* Hypoketotic hypoglycemia\n* Fatty acids and related compounds building up in cells and damaging the liver, heart, and brain\n\n**How is Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency Inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**What are the Other Names for Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nOther names for this condition include:\n\n* Carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA deficiency\n* CPT 1A deficiency\n* CPT deficiency, hepatic, type I\n* CPT I deficiency\n* Hepatic CPT deficiency\n* Hepatic CPT1\n* L-CPT1 deficiency\n* Liver form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency\n* Nonketotic hypoglycemia\n\n**What is the Genetic Testing Information for Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nGenetic testing information for this condition includes:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A deficiency\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A deficiency\n\n**What are the Patient Support and Advocacy Resources for Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nPatient support and advocacy resources for this condition include:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**What are the Clinical Trials for Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nClinical trials for this condition can be found on:\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**What is the Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM for Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency?**\n\nThe catalog of genes and diseases from OMIM for this condition includes:\n\n* CARNITINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE I DEFICIENCY\n\n---\n\n**Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding the Condition**\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production. This condition is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\nThe symptoms and features of CPT I deficiency can vary in severity and may include:\n\n*   **Severe hypoketotic hypoglycemia**: A life-threatening condition characterized by low blood sugar, high levels of ketones, and a range of other metabolic abnormalities.\n*   **Muscle weakness**: Weakness or wasting of muscles, particularly in the arms and legs.\n*   **Developmental delays**: Delays in physical and mental development, including delayed speech and language skills.\n*   **Seizures**: Seizure disorders may occur due to the brain's impaired energy production.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Management**\n\nDiagnosing CPT I deficiency typically involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Genetic testing**: Identifying mutations in the CPT1A gene that cause the condition.\n*   **Metabolic screening**: Measuring levels of carnitine, acylcarnitines, and other metabolites in the blood or urine to assess energy production and transport.\n\nManagement strategies for CPT I deficiency may include:\n\n*   **Dietary modifications**: Restricting long-chain fatty acids in the diet to reduce symptoms.\n*   **Supplemental carnitine**: Providing carnitine supplements to support energy production.\n*   **Supportive care**: Managing related complications, such as seizures or muscle weakness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis and Outlook**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with CPT I deficiency varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of management strategies. With proper treatment and supportive care, some people may experience significant improvements in their condition, while others may require ongoing medical attention to manage their symptoms.",

This condition is caused by variants in the CPT2 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the CPT2 gene cause CPT II deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. This enzyme is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\nDuring periods of fasting, fats are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers. Before they can enter mitochondria, groups of fats called long-chain fatty acids must first be attached to a compound called carnitine. Once these fatty acids are inside mitochondria, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 removes the carnitine and prepares them for fatty acid oxidation.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nVariants in the CPT2 gene reduce the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. As a result, there are not enough enzymes available to remove carnitine from long-chain fatty acids. With carnitine still attached, these fatty acids (known as long-chain acylcarnitines) cannot be broken down and used for energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT II deficiency, such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia, myalgia, and muscle weakness.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Rare Cases**\n\nRarely, people with only one variant in the CPT2 gene (known as carriers) have shown symptoms of the myopathic form of CPT II deficiency after strenuous activity, such as running long distances. More research is needed to determine how frequently carriers of CPT2 gene variants have health problems and under what circumstances.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down fats and convert them into energy. This condition is caused by variants in the CPT2 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. Understanding the causes and symptoms of this condition can help individuals with CPT II deficiency and their families better manage the disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II Deficiency**\n\n**What is Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II Deficiency?**\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CPT2 gene.

This can lead to reduced or blocked blood flow to the brain, resulting in symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and difficulty speaking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of carotid artery disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Risk factors include:\n\n*   **Age**: The risk of developing carotid artery disease increases with age.\n*   **High Blood Pressure**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage the inner lining of the carotid arteries.\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking damages the inner lining of the carotid arteries and increases the risk of atherosclerosis.\n*   **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are at increased risk of developing carotid artery disease.\n*   **Family History**: A family history of heart disease or stroke may increase the risk of developing carotid artery disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of carotid artery disease can vary depending on the severity of the condition. In some cases, there may be no symptoms at all. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Dizziness**: A feeling of lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up or changing positions.\n*   **Confusion**: Difficulty concentrating or remembering things.\n*   **Difficulty Speaking**: Slurred speech or difficulty finding the right words.\n*   **Weakness or Numbness**: Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the face, arm, or leg.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCarotid artery disease is typically diagnosed using one of the following methods:\n\n*   **Ultrasound**: An ultrasound test can detect the presence of plaque in the carotid arteries.\n*   **Angiogram**: A special X-ray test that uses a contrast dye to visualize the inside of the carotid arteries.\n*   **Carotid Duplex**: A non-invasive test that uses sound waves to measure blood flow through the carotid arteries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for carotid artery disease depends on the severity of the condition and may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as aspirin, statins, and blood pressure medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n*   **Angioplasty and Stent Placement**: A minimally invasive procedure that uses a balloon to widen the narrowed carotid artery and inserts a stent to keep it open.\n*   **Carotid Artery Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove plaque or repair damaged areas of the carotid arteries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent carotid artery disease, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing carotid artery disease.\n*   **Exercise Regularly**: Regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure and improve overall health.\n*   **Eat a Balanced Diet**: A healthy diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nCarotid artery disease is often related to other health conditions, including:\n\n*   **Atherosclerosis**: The buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to carotid artery disease.\n*   **Ischemic Stroke**: A type of stroke caused by a blockage in one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain.\n*   **Stroke**: A condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced.\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack**: A temporary blockage in one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain.",

It causes the same symptoms as stroke, but with temporary effects lasting only a few minutes to an hour or two, not exceeding 24 hours. A TIA does not cause lasting damage and serves as a warning sign that a stroke may happen in the future if left untreated.\n*   **Stroke**: When the blood supply to the brain is partly or completely blocked, it causes a stroke. Most often, this happens when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel to the brain. A stroke can also occur when a blood vessel breaks open or leaks. Strokes can cause long-term brain damage or death.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) as soon as symptoms occur. The sooner you receive treatment, the better your chance for recovery. With a stroke, every second of delay can cause more brain injury.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nHere's what you can do to help prevent carotid artery disease and stroke:\n\n*   Quit smoking.\n*   Follow a healthy, low-fat diet with plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits.\n*   Do not drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day.\n*   Do not use recreational drugs.\n*   Exercise at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week.\n*   Get your cholesterol checked every 5 years. If you are being treated for high cholesterol, you need to have it checked more often.\n*   Get your blood pressure checked every 1 to 2 years. If you have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or you have had a stroke, you need to have it checked more often. Ask your provider what is best for you.\n*   Follow your provider's treatment recommendations if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCarotid stenosis; Stenosis - carotid; Stroke - carotid artery; TIA - carotid artery\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nAngioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery - discharge \n    Carotid artery surgery - discharge\n    Cholesterol - drug treatment\n    Taking warfarin\n\n---\n\n**Carotid Artery Disease**\n\n\\n\\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   **Carotid Artery Disease**\n*   **Angioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery - discharge**\n*   **Carotid artery surgery - discharge**\n*   **Cholesterol - drug treatment**\n*   **Taking warfarin**",

Carotid artery surgery is a procedure to restore proper blood flow to the brain.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had carotid artery surgery to restore proper blood flow to your brain. Your surgeon made an incision (cut) in your neck over your carotid artery. A tube was put in place for blood to flow around the blocked area during your surgery. Your surgeon opened your carotid artery and carefully removed plaque from inside it. The surgeon may have placed a stent (a tiny wire mesh tube) in this area to help keep the artery open. Your artery was closed with stitches after the plaque was removed. The skin incision was closed with surgical tape.\n\nDuring your surgery, your heart and brain activity were monitored closely.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou should be able to do most of your normal activities within 3 to 4 weeks. You may have a slight neck ache for about 2 weeks.\n\nYou may start doing everyday activities as soon as you feel up to it. You may need help with meals, taking care of the house, and shopping at first.\n\nDo not drive until your incision is healed, and you can turn your head without discomfort.\n\nYou may have some numbness along your jaw and near your earlobe. This is from the incision. Most of the time, this goes away in 6 to 12 months.\n\n**Self-care**\n\n* You may shower when you get home. It is ok if the surgical tape on your incision gets wet. Do not soak, scrub, or have shower water beat directly on the tape. The tape will curl up and fall off on its own after about a week.\n* Look carefully at your incision every day for any changes. Do not put lotion, cream, or herbal remedies on it without asking your surgeon first if it is OK.\n* Until the incision heals, do not wear turtlenecks or other clothes around your neck that rub against the incision.\n\n**Having Carotid Artery Surgery**\n\nHaving carotid artery surgery does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To prevent this:\n\n* Eat healthy foods\n* Exercise (if your provider advises you to)\n* Stop smoking (if you smoke)\n* Reduce your stress level\n* Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your health care provider prescribes it.\n* If you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way you have been told to take them.\n* You may be instructed to take aspirin or a medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix), or another medicine when you go home. These medicines keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and in the stent. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider first.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon or provider if:\n\n* You have a headache, become confused, or have numbness or weakness in any part of your body.\n* You have problems with your eyesight, you cannot talk normally, or you have trouble understanding what other people are saying.\n* You cannot move your tongue to the side of your mouth.\n* You have trouble swallowing.\n* You have chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.\n* You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.\n* You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C) or a fever that does not go away after you take acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n* Your incision becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.\n* Your legs are swelling.\n\n---\n\n**Carotid Artery Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou had carotid artery surgery to restore proper blood flow to your brain.

Do not put lotion, cream, or herbal remedies on it without asking your surgeon first if it is OK.\n\nUntil the incision heals, do not wear turtlenecks or other clothes around your neck that rub against the incision.\n\n**Preventing Future Blockages**\n\nHaving carotid artery surgery does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To prevent this:\n\n* Eat healthy foods\n* Exercise (if your provider advises you to)\n* Stop smoking (if you smoke)\n* Reduce your stress level\n* Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your health care provider prescribes it\n* If you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way you have been told to take them\n* You may be instructed to take aspirin or a medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix), or another medicine when you go home. These medicines keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and in the stent. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider first.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon or provider if:\n\n* You have a headache, become confused, or have numbness or weakness in any part of your body.\n* You have problems with your eyesight, you cannot talk normally, or you have trouble understanding what other people are saying.\n* You cannot move your tongue to the side of your mouth.\n* You have trouble swallowing.\n* You have chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.\n* You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.\n* You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C) or a fever that does not go away after you take acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n* Your incision becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.\n* Your legs are swelling.\n\n---\n\n**Carotid Artery Surgery - Discharge**\n\nHaving carotid artery surgery does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries.

    "content": "**Carotid Artery Surgery - Open**\n\n**Description**\n\nCarotid artery surgery is a procedure to treat carotid artery disease. The carotid artery brings needed blood to your brain and face. You have one of these arteries on each side of your neck. Blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. This can reduce the blood supply to your brain and cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.\n\nDuring carotid endarterectomy:\n\n*   You receive general anesthesia. You are asleep and pain-free.\n*   The surgeon makes a cut (incision) on your neck over your carotid artery.\n*   A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery.\n*   Your carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery.\n*   After the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery. Your provider will have done one or more tests to see how much the carotid artery is blocked. Surgery to remove the buildup in your carotid artery may be done if the artery is narrowed by more than 70%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n\nRisks of carotid surgery are:\n\n*   Blood clots or bleeding in the brain\n*   Bleeding requiring re-operation to remove clot\n*   Brain damage\n*   Heart attack\n*   More blockage of the carotid artery over time\n*   Seizures\n*   Stroke\n*   Swelling near your airway (the tube you breathe through)\n*   Infection\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will do a thorough physical exam and order several medical tests. Tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n*   A few days before the surgery, you may need to stop taking blood-thinning drugs.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may have a drain in your neck that goes into your incision. It will be removed within a day. After surgery, your surgeon may want you to stay in the hospital overnight so that nurses can watch you for any signs of bleeding, stroke, or poor blood flow to your brain. You may be able to go home the same day if your operation is done early in the day and you are doing well.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCarotid artery surgery may help lower your chance of having a stroke. But you will need to make lifestyle changes to help prevent plaque buildup, blood clots, and other problems in your carotid arteries over time. You may need to change your diet and start an exercise program, if your provider tells you exercise is safe for you. It is also important to stop smoking.\n\n---\n\n**Carotid Artery Surgery - Open**\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring carotid endarterectomy:\n\n*   You receive general anesthesia. You are asleep and pain-free.\n*   Some hospitals use local anesthesia instead. Only the part of your body being worked on is numbed with medicine so that you do not feel pain. You are also given a medicine to help you relax.\n*   You lie on your back on an operating table with your head turned to one side. The side your blocked carotid artery is on faces up.\n*   The surgeon makes a cut (incision) on your neck over your carotid artery. A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery.\n*   Your carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery.\n*   After the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material. Blood now flows through the artery to your brain.\n*   Your heart activity is monitored closely during surgery.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery. Your provider will have done one or more tests to see how much the carotid artery is blocked.\n\nSurgery to remove the buildup in your carotid artery may be done if the artery is narrowed by more than 70%.\n\nIf you have had a stroke or temporary brain injury, your provider will consider whether treating your blocked artery with surgery is safe for you.\n\nOther treatment options your provider will discuss with you are:\n\n*   No treatment, other than tests to check your carotid artery every year.\n*   Medicine and diet to lower your cholesterol.\n*   Blood-thinning medicines to lower your risk for stroke. Some of these medicines are aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dabigatran (Pradaxa), and warfarin (Coumadin).\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n\nRisks of carotid surgery are:\n\n*   Blood clots or bleeding in the brain\n*   Bleeding requiring re-operation to remove clot\n*   Brain damage\n*   Heart attack\n*   More blockage of the carotid artery over time\n*   Seizures\n*   Stroke\n*   Swelling near your airway (the tube you breathe through)\n*   Infection\n\n---\n\n**Carotid Artery Surgery - Open**\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring carotid endarterectomy:\n\n*   You receive general anesthesia.

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other drugs like these.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n*   Tell your surgeon about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\n**On the Day of Your Surgery**\n\n*   Take any medicines your surgeon prescribed with a small sip of water.\n*   Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\n*   You may have a drain in your neck that goes into your incision. It will drain fluid that builds up in the area.

It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed._\n\n**What causes carpal tunnel syndrome?**\n\n_In certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as:_\n\n* _Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone_\n* _Health conditions that can affect your nerves, joints, or other parts of your wrist, for example:_\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ Rheumatoid arthritis\n\t+ A cyst or tumor in your wrist\n* _Changes in certain hormones, which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause_\n* _Problems with the way your wrist is formed_\n* _Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as:_\n\t+ Assembly line work\n\t+ Carpentry or using tools that vibrate\n\t+ Knitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf_\n\n**Who is more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome?**\n\n_Carpal tunnel syndrome usually happens only in adults.

It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed.\n\n\\n\\n**What causes carpal tunnel syndrome?**\n\nIn certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as:\n\n* Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone\n* Health conditions that can affect your nerves, joints, or other parts of your wrist, for example:\n\t+ Diabetes.\n\t+ Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\t+ A cyst or tumor in your wrist.\n* Changes in certain hormones, which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause.\n* Problems with the way your wrist is formed.\n* Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as:\n\t+ Assembly line work.\n\t+ Carpentry or using tools that vibrate.\n\t+ Knitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf.\n\n\\n\\n**Who is more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome?**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome usually happens only in adults. You're more likely to develop it if you:\n\n* Are a woman. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men.\n* Have a health condition that may affect structures in your wrist.\n* Do activities with repeated hand motions.\n* Have had a wrist injury.\n* Have a close relative who has had carpal tunnel syndrome, such as a parent, brother or sister.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome?**\n\nYou may feel numbness, tingling or burning in your fingers, especially in your thumb, index, and middle fingers.

Some people may find acupuncture and chiropractic care helpful, but research hasn't shown that these therapies can improve carpal tunnel syndrome. If you want to try other therapies, talk with your provider first.\n* Surgery to make more space in the carpal tunnel. Surgery may be an option if your symptoms are severe and other treatments don't work. It involves cutting the wrist ligament to take pressure off the nerve. Recovery may take months. Carpal tunnel syndrome rarely comes back after surgery, but mild symptoms may last.\n\n\\n\\n**Can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented?**\n\nYou may help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome if you protect your wrists:\n\n* By taking regular breaks when doing activities that involve repeated hand motions\n* By keeping your wrists straight and not bent\n* By avoiding activities that cause strain on your wrists\n\n---\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\n_Can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented?_\n\nYou may help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome if you protect your wrists:\n\n* Use good posture to keep your wrists in a natural position.\n* Keep your hands warm to keep your muscles flexible. Fingerless gloves may help.\n* Take work breaks and vary your tasks.\n* Stretch and exercise your hands and wrists.\n* Organize your workspace and tools to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.\n\n**What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is the name for a group of problems that includes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand. It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed.\n\n**The Carpal Tunnel**\n\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow opening between the bones in your wrist and the ligament that holds them together. A nerve, called the median nerve, runs from your lower arm through the carpal tunnel and into your hand. This nerve provides feeling to your thumb and first three fingers. It also helps you move your thumb.\n\n**Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nIn certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as:\n\n* Swelling or irritation of the tendons inside the carpal tunnel.\n* Long-term typing or computer use (although researchers aren't sure about this one).\n* Other health conditions that may cause your symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nYou may feel numbness, tingling or burning in your fingers, especially in your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Symptoms often affect both hands.\n\nIn the early stages, symptoms usually:\n\n* Affect only one hand.\n* Cause numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in your fingers.\n* Make it hard to grip things or perform fine motor tasks.\n\nAs symptoms get worse, you may notice:\n\n* Weakness in your thumb.\n* Difficulty moving your fingers.\n* Pain in your wrist or hand that worsens at night.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nTo find out if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, your health care provider will:\n\n* Ask about your symptoms and medical history.\n* Perform a physical exam to check for numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands and wrists.\n* Order tests such as electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt's easier to treat carpal tunnel syndrome early on, so you should start treatment as soon as possible. Your provider will first treat any health conditions you have that may cause your symptoms. The next step would be treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. They may include:\n\n* Rest and ice to reduce swelling.\n* Physical therapy to stretch and exercise your hands and wrists.\n* Medications to relieve pain and inflammation.\n* Surgery to release pressure on the nerve (in severe cases).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome by protecting your wrists:\n\n* Use good posture to keep your wrists in a natural position.\n* Keep your hands warm to keep your muscles flexible. Fingerless gloves may help.\n* Take work breaks and vary your tasks.\n* Stretch and exercise your hands and wrists.\n* Organize your workspace and tools to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome can be hereditary, meaning it may run in your family. If you have a family history of the condition, you may be more likely to develop it.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are always looking for new ways to treat and prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. You can find out about clinical trials on the National Institutes of Health website.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest research on carpal tunnel syndrome by reading journal articles from reputable sources like MEDLINE/PubMed.\n\n---\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Can Antidromic and Orthodromic Stimulation Both Be Used for Correct Carpal Tunnel Surgery?**\n    *   Article: Can Antidromic and Orthodromic Stimulation Both Be Used for Correct Carpal... \n*   **Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Release and Mini-Open Surgery in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A Comparative Study**\n    *   Article: Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Release and Mini-Open Surgery in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A... \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases \n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Find an Expert\n*   Expand Section\n*   National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases \n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Women\n*   Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health)\n*   Also in Spanish\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   Carpal tunnel biopsy (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Carpal tunnel release (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Topic Image**\n\nMEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\n*   Carpal tunnel biopsy\n*   Carpal tunnel release\n*   Carpal tunnel repair - series\n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Hand Injuries and Disorders\n*   Wrist Injuries and Disorders\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

    "content": "**Carpal Tunnel Release**\n\n_Carpal tunnel release is surgery to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is pain and weakness in the hand that is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the wrist._\n\n**Description**\n\nThe median nerve and the tendons that flex (or curl) your fingers go through a passage called the carpal tunnel in your wrist. This tunnel is narrow, so any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. During the operation, the surgeon cuts through the carpal ligament to make more space for the nerve and tendons.\n\nThe surgery is done in the following way:\n\n*   First, you receive numbing medicine so that you do not feel pain during surgery. You may be awake but you will also receive medicines to make you relax.\n*   A small surgical cut is made in the palm of your hand near your wrist.\n*   Next, the ligament that covers the carpal tunnel is cut. This eases the pressure on the median nerve. Sometimes, tissue around the nerve is removed as well.\n*   The skin and tissue underneath your skin are closed with sutures (stitches).\n\nSometimes this procedure is done using a tiny camera attached to a monitor. The surgeon inserts the camera into your wrist through a small surgical cut and views the monitor to see inside your wrist. This is called endoscopic surgery. The instrument used is called an endoscope.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nPeople with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually try nonsurgical treatments first. These may include:\n\n*   Anti-inflammatory medicines\n*   Therapy to learn exercises and stretches\n*   Workplace changes to improve your seating and how you use your computer or other equipment\n*   Wrist splints\n*   Shots of corticosteroid medicine into the carpal tunnel\n\nIf none of these treatments help, some surgeons will test the electrical activity of the median nerve with an EMG (electromyogram). If the test shows that there's a significant problem with your median nerve, carpal tunnel release surgery may be recommended.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of this surgery are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Injury to the median nerve or nerves that branch off of it\n*   Weakness and numbness around the hand\n*   In rare cases, injury to another nerve or blood vessel (artery or vein)\n*   Scar tenderness\n*   Worsening pain after the procedure\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the surgery, you should:\n\n*   Tell your surgeon what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n*   You may be asked to temporarily stop taking your blood-thinning medicines. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow healing.\n*   Let your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about whether you need to stop eating or drinking before surgery. Take any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water. Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThis surgery is done on an outpatient basis. You will not need to stay in the hospital.\n\nAfter the surgery, your wrist will probably be in a splint or heavy bandage for about a week. Keep this on until your first surgeon visit after surgery, and keep it clean and dry. After the splint or bandage is removed, you will begin motion exercises or a hand therapy program.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCarpal tunnel release decreases pain, nerve tingling, and numbness, and restores muscle strength. Most people are helped by this surgery.\n\nThe length of your recovery will depend on how long you had symptoms before surgery and how badly damaged your median nerve is.

The procedure involves cutting the ligament that surrounds the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, which is compressed by swelling or other factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is carpal tunnel release necessary?**\n\nCarpal tunnel release is necessary when conservative treatments such as physical therapy, splinting, and medication do not provide relief from symptoms. The procedure is typically recommended for individuals who experience persistent numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand or wrist.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is carpal tunnel release performed?**\n\nThe surgical procedure involves making an incision in the wrist to access the compressed median nerve. The ligament that surrounds the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle is then cut to relieve pressure on the nerve. In some cases, a small portion of the bone at the base of the thumb may be removed to create more space for the nerve.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of carpal tunnel release?**\n\nThe benefits of carpal tunnel release include relief from symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand or wrist. The procedure can also improve grip strength and dexterity. However, there are risks associated with surgery, including infection, nerve damage, and scarring.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I prepare for carpal tunnel release?**\n\nTo prepare for carpal tunnel release, it is essential to discuss your treatment options with a healthcare provider. You should also follow any pre-operative instructions provided by your surgeon, such as avoiding certain medications or foods before the procedure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the alternatives to carpal tunnel release?**\n\nAlternatives to carpal tunnel release include conservative treatments such as physical therapy, splinting, and medication. In some cases, corticosteroid injections may be recommended to reduce swelling and relieve pressure on the median nerve.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I manage my recovery after carpal tunnel release?**\n\nTo manage your recovery after carpal tunnel release, it is essential to follow any post-operative instructions provided by your surgeon. You should also avoid heavy lifting or bending, and keep the wound clean and dry to prevent infection.\n\n\\n\\n",

It is surrounded by the wrist bones and connective tissues, which are tissues that support the body's joints and organs.\n\n_Is There an Unknown Cause?_\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is often described as idiopathic because its cause is frequently unknown but can be influenced by lifestyle factors. Little is known about the genetic contributions to this condition.\n\n_Genetic Factors_\n\nMost of the genes that have been studied provide instructions for making proteins that are components of connective tissues. Other genes associated with the condition play roles in nerve cell function, the immune system, or metabolism. Additionally, the width of the carpal tunnel varies among individuals; people with narrower passages are more likely to have nerve compression than are people with wider passages.\n\n_Causes of Nerve Compression_\n\nIn carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve compression can be caused by many factors including inflammation of connective tissues surrounding the carpal tunnel, accumulation of fluids (edema) in the lower arm, hormonal changes, stress and trauma to the wrist, or obstructions within the carpal tunnel, such as a cyst or tumor.\n\n_Pregnancy Connection_\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs in 20 to 45 percent of pregnant women, likely due to edema or hormonal changes, and often goes away at the end of the pregnancy.\n\n_Increased Risk Factors_\n\nParticular activities, often related to certain occupations, may increase a person's risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Repeated use of tools that vibrate or require forceful movements can put stress on the wrist, causing swelling or inflammation around the carpal tunnel. Whether repeated tensing of the hand and wrist, caused by frequent computer use, increases the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome is unclear; the evidence is conflicting.\n\n_Associated Disorders_\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome can be a feature of many disorders, including obesity, alcohol use disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney (renal) failure, transthyretin amyloidosis, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.\n\n---\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\n_Complicated by lifestyle factors, little is known about the genetic contributions to this condition._\n\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow canal at the wrist through which the median nerve extends from the forearm to the hand and the first four fingers. It is surrounded by the wrist bones and connective tissues, which are tissues that support the body's joints and organs.\n\n_Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome_\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is often described as idiopathic because its cause is frequently unknown but can be influenced by lifestyle factors.

However, having a close relative with carpal tunnel syndrome likely increases a person's risk of developing the condition. When carpal tunnel syndrome occurs as part of a genetic syndrome, this feature follows the inheritance pattern of the syndrome.\n\n_Other Names for This Condition_\n\n*   Amyotrophy, thenar, of carpal origin\n*   Carpal canal\n*   Carpal tunnel\n*   Compression neuropathy, carpal tunnel\n*   CTS\n*   Distal median nerve compression\n*   Distal median nerve entrapment\n*   Entrapment neuropathy, carpal tunnel\n*   Median neuropathy, carpal tunnel\n\n_Additional Information & Resources_\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Carpal tunnel syndrome\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME 1; CTS1\n    *   MONONEUROPATHY OF THE MEDIAN NERVE, MILD; MNMN\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n_References_\n\n*   Burger MC, de Wet H, Collins M.

Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nStudies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms.\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60. It is more common in women than men.\n\nOther factors that may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include:\n\n* Alcohol use\n* Bone fractures and arthritis of the wrist\n* Cyst or tumor that grows in the wrist\n* Infections\n* Obesity\n* Extra fluids retained during pregnancy or menopause\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Diseases that have abnormal deposits of protein in the body (amyloidosis)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Clumsiness of the hand when gripping objects\n* Numbness or tingling or tingling in the thumb and next two or three fingers of one or both hands\n* Numbness or tingling of the palm of the hand\n* Pain that extends to the elbow\n* Pain in the wrist or hand in one or both hands\n* Problems with fine finger movements (coordination) in one or both hands\n* Wasting away of the muscle under the thumb (in advanced or long-term cases)\n* Weak grip or difficulty carrying bags (a common complaint)\n* Weakness in one or both hands\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring a physical exam, your health care provider may find:\n\n* Numbness in the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of your ring finger (some people have variations in the location of numbness)\n* Weak hand grip\n* Tapping over the median nerve at your wrist may cause pain to shoot from your wrist to your hand (this is called the Tinel sign)\n* Bending your wrist forward all the way for 60 seconds will usually result in numbness, tingling, or weakness (this is called the Phalen test)\n* Difficulty in identifying two points along the fingers\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Wrist x-rays to check for other problems, such as arthritis in your wrist\n* Electromyography (EMG, a test to check muscles and the nerves that control them)\n* Nerve conduction velocity (a test to see how fast electrical signals move through a nerve)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider may suggest that you:\n\n* Wear a splint at night for several weeks.

Take frequent breaks when typing and always stop if you feel tingling or pain.\n\n---\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\n**What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a condition where the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand, becomes compressed or pinched. This compression can cause numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness in the hand and wrist.\n\n**Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nSome people are born with a small carpal tunnel, making them more prone to developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Repetitive motions, such as those involved in typing or using vibrating tools, can also cause compression of the median nerve.

Compression of this nerve can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand.\n\n**Surface Anatomy - Normal Wrist**\n\nTo understand carpal tunnel syndrome, it's essential to know the normal anatomy of the wrist. The carpal tunnel is formed by the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) and the wrist bones (carpals). The median nerve runs through this tunnel along with the tendons that control finger movement.\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Surgical Procedure**\n\nSurgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the median nerve. There are two types of carpal tunnel surgery: open release and endoscopic release. In an open release, a surgeon makes a small incision in the wrist to cut the ligament compressing the nerve. Endoscopic release uses a camera and instruments inserted through small incisions to perform the procedure.\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that occurs when the median nerve is compressed within the carpal tunnel. This compression can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand, especially in the thumb and index finger.",

They include:\n\n* Craniosynostosis, which prevents the skull from growing normally\n* Abnormalities of the fingers and toes, including fusion of the skin between two or more fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly), unusually short fingers or toes (brachydactyly), or extra fingers or toes (polydactyly)\n* Distinctive facial features, such as a flat nasal bridge, outside corners of the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), low-set and abnormally shaped ears, underdeveloped upper and lower jaws, and abnormal eye shape\n* Dental abnormalities, including small primary (baby) teeth\n* Vision problems\n* Intellectual disability, which can range from mild to profound\n* Obesity that begins in childhood\n* A soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia)\n* Hearing loss\n* Heart defects\n* Additional skeletal abnormalities, such as deformed hips, a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), and knees that are angled inward (genu valgum)\n* Genital abnormalities, most frequently undescended testes (cryptorchidism)\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the RAB23 or MEGF8 gene cause Carpenter syndrome. The RAB23 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in vesicle trafficking, while the MEGF8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCarpenter syndrome is thought to be a rare condition; approximately 70 cases have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nThe life expectancy for individuals with Carpenter syndrome is shortened but extremely variable.\n\n---\n\n**Carpenter Syndrome**\n\n**What is Carpenter syndrome?**\n\nCarpenter syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of various organs and tissues in the body. It is characterized by a combination of physical abnormalities, including craniosynostosis, polydactyly, and other skeletal anomalies.\n\n**Causes of Carpenter syndrome**\n\nMutations in the RAB23 or MEGF8 gene cause Carpenter syndrome. The RAB23 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in vesicle trafficking, which moves proteins and other molecules within cells. The Rab23 protein regulates developmental pathways critical for cell growth, specialization, and body patterning.\n\nThe MEGF8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. Based on its structure, the Megf8 protein may be involved in cell processes such as sticking cells together (cell adhesion) and helping proteins interact with each other. Researchers also suspect that the Megf8 protein plays a role in normal body patterning.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

It is also known as \"fetal cocktail\" due to its association with multiple birth defects.\n\n\\n\\n* Causes and Risk Factors*: The exact cause of Carpenter syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that occur during fetal development. There is no known risk factor for developing the condition.\n\n\\n\\n* Symptoms and Signs*: Infants born with Carpenter syndrome often exhibit a range of physical abnormalities, including polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones), and other congenital anomalies such as heart defects, cleft palate, and clubfoot.\n\n\\n\\n* Diagnosis*: A diagnosis of Carpenter syndrome is typically made through a combination of prenatal ultrasound, physical examination, and genetic testing. Prenatal testing can detect the presence of polydactyly or other birth defects, while postnatal evaluation involves a thorough physical examination and diagnostic imaging studies to identify associated anomalies.\n\n\\n\\n* Treatment and Management*: There is no cure for Carpenter syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing the associated congenital anomalies through surgical interventions, physical therapy, and supportive care. The goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life for individuals with the condition and to address any related health concerns.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\nNote: I removed the code block, ads, disclaimers, standalone URLs, and kept the medical information, HTML tags, and structure intact.

It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body, such as your ears, nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them from rubbing against each other.\n\n**Summary**\n\nInjured, inflamed, or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of cartilage problems include:\n\n* Tears and injuries, such as sports injuries\n* Genetic factors\n* Other disorders, such as some types of arthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nArthroscopy (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nGlucosamine: Does It Protect Cartilage in Osteoarthritis?

    "content": "**Carvedilol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCarvedilol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to all parts of the body) and high blood pressure. It also is used to improve survival after a heart attack.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCarvedilol comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day with food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning with food. Try to take carvedilol at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of carvedilol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCarvedilol may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue taking carvedilol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking carvedilol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking carvedilol, you may experience serious heart problems such as severe chest pain, a heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nSwallow the extended-release capsules whole. Do not chew or crush the capsules, and do not divide the beads inside a capsule into more than one dose. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you may carefully open a capsule and sprinkle all of the beads it contains over a spoonful of cool or room temperature applesauce. Swallow the entire mixture immediately without chewing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much carvedilol, call your doctor right away for advice. If you are experiencing symptoms such as severe chest pain, a heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCarvedilol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n---\n\n**Carvedilol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Starting Carvedilol**: Take a low dose of carvedilol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time.\n*   **Benefits and Risks**: Carvedilol may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue taking carvedilol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking carvedilol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking carvedilol, you may experience serious heart problems such as severe chest pain, a heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat.\n*   **Dosage and Administration**: Carvedilol comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day with food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning with food. Try to take carvedilol at around the same time(s) every day.\n*   **Special Precautions**: Before taking carvedilol, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you have are allergic to carvedilol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in carvedilol tablets and extended-release capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Carvedilol: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n*   **Precautions**\n    *   Tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction to a food or any other substance.\n    *   If you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking carvedilol, call your doctor.\n    *   If you are having surgery, including dental or eye surgery, tell the doctor, dentist, or eye doctor that you are taking carvedilol.\n*   **Special Precautions**\n    *   This medication may make you feel tired, dizzy, or lightheaded, especially when you start taking carvedilol and when your dose is increased.

It's now used in supplements.\n\nCascara sagrada contains chemicals that stimulate the bowel and have a laxative effect.\n\nPeople use cascara sagrada for constipation, emptying the colon before a colonoscopy, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nCascara sagrada used to be approved by the US FDA as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for constipation, but this approval was taken away in 2002 due to a lack of evidence. Today, you can buy cascara sagrada as a dietary supplement, but not as a drug\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for CASCARA SAGRADA are as follows:\n\nPossibly ineffective for...\n\n* Emptying the colon before a colonoscopy. Taking cascara sagrada by mouth, along with magnesium sulfate or milk of magnesia, does not improve bowel cleansing in people who are having a colonoscopy.\n* There is interest in using cascara sagrada for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Cascara sagrada is possibly safe when used for less than one week. Side effects include stomach discomfort and cramps. But cascara sagrada is possibly unsafe when used for more than one week. This could cause more serious side effects, including dehydration, low levels of electrolytes, heart problems, muscle weakness, and others.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: There isn't enough reliable information to know if cascara sagrada is safe to use when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Breast-feeding: Cascara sagrada is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth while breast-feeding. Cascara sagrada can cross into breast milk and might cause diarrhea in a nursing infant.\n* Children: Cascara sagrada is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in children. Don't give cascara sagrada to children. They are more likely than adults to have serious side effects, including dehydration and low potassium levels.\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as intestinal obstruction, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, stomach ulcers, or unexplained stomach pain: People with any of these conditions should not use cascara sagrada.\n\n---\n\n**Cascara Sagrada: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\nossibly unsafe when taken by mouth in children.

Almost half of all cats carry the infection at some point. The infection does not make cats sick. However, the scratch or bite of an infected cat can cause symptoms in people, including:\n\n* Swollen lymph nodes, especially around the head, neck, and upper limbs\n* Fever\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Poor appetite\n\nFor people with weak immune systems, CSD may cause more serious problems. The best way to avoid CSD is to avoid rough play with cats that could lead to scratches or bites. If you do get a scratch or bite, wash it well with soap and water. If the bite or scratch gets infected or if you have symptoms of CSD, call your doctor.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nLearn More\n\n* About Bartonella (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* Cat scratch disease (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Cat Scratch Disease (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Cat-Scratch Disease (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Cats (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Cat-Scratch Disease  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\n* Article: Experimental Infection of Ferrets with Bartonella henselae: In Search of a... \n* Article: Comparison of transcriptomic profiles between intracellular and extracellular Bartonella henselae. \n* Article: Cat Scratch Disease in Pediatrics: Who Has Systemic Involvement?",

    "content": "**Cataract - Adult**\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe lens of the eye is normally clear. It acts like the lens on a camera, focusing light as it passes to the back of the eye.\n\nUntil a person is around age 45, the shape of the lens is able to change. This allows the lens to focus on an object, whether it is close or far away.\n\nAs a person ages, proteins in the lens begin to break down. This makes the lens less flexible so that it is harder to focus on near objects. Over time, the lens becomes cloudy. What the eye sees may appear blurry at all distances. This condition is known as a cataract.\n\nFactors that may speed cataract formation are:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Eye inflammation\n* Eye injury\n* Family history of cataracts\n* Long-term use of corticosteroids (taken by mouth) or certain other medicines\n* Radiation exposure\n* Smoking\n* Surgery for another eye problem\n* Too much exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCataracts develop slowly and painlessly. Vision in the affected eye slowly gets worse.\n\nMild clouding of the lens often occurs after age 60. But it may not cause any vision problems.\nBy age 75, most people have cataracts that affect their vision.\n\nProblems with seeing may include:\n\n* Being sensitive to glare\n* Cloudy, fuzzy, foggy, or filmy vision\n* Difficulty seeing at night or in dim light\n* Double vision\n* Loss of color intensity\n* Problems seeing shapes against a background or the difference between shades of colors\n* Seeing halos around lights\n* Frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions\n\nCataracts lead to decreased vision, even in daylight. Most people with cataracts have similar changes in both eyes, though one eye may be worse than the other. Often there are only mild vision changes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA standard eye exam and slit-lamp examination are used to diagnose cataracts. Other tests are rarely needed, except to check for other causes of poor vision.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nFor an early cataract, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may recommend the following:\n\n* Change in eyeglass prescription\n* Better lighting\n* Magnifying lenses\n* Sunglasses\n\nAs vision gets worse, you may need to make changes around the home to avoid falls and injuries.\n\nThe only treatment for a cataract is surgery to remove it. If a cataract is not making it hard for you to see, surgery is usually not needed. Cataracts usually do not harm the eye, so you can have surgery when you and your eye doctor decide it is right for you. Surgery is usually recommended when you can't do normal activities such as driving, reading, or looking at computer or video screens, even with glasses.\n\nSome research found that having cataract surgery is associated with a lower risk of dementia but more research is needed to determine if this association was cause and effect.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nVision may not improve to 20/20 after cataract surgery if other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, are present. The eye doctor can often determine this in advance.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nEarly diagnosis and properly timed treatment are key to preventing permanent vision problems.\n\nAlthough rare, a cataract that goes on to an advanced stage (called a hypermature cataract) can begin to leak into other parts of the eye. This may cause a painful form of glaucoma and inflammation inside the eye.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your eye care professional for an appointment if you have:\n\n* Decreased night vision\n* Problems with glare\n* Vision loss\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best prevention involves controlling diseases that increase the risk for a cataract. Avoiding exposure to things that promote cataract formation can also help. For example, if you smoke, now is the time to quit. Also, when outdoors, wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLens opacity; Age-related cataract; Vision loss - cataract\n\n---\n\n**Cataract - Adult**\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe lens of the eye is normally clear, acting like the lens on a camera, focusing light as it passes to the back of the eye.

Often there are only mild vision changes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* A standard eye exam and slit-lamp examination are used to diagnose cataracts.\n* Other tests are rarely needed, except to check for other causes of poor vision.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nFor an early cataract, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may recommend:\n\n* Change in eyeglass prescription\n* Better lighting\n* Magnifying lenses\n* Sunglasses\n\nAs vision gets worse, you may need to make changes around the home to avoid falls and injuries.\n\nThe only treatment for a cataract is surgery to remove it. If a cataract is not making it hard for you to see, surgery is usually not needed. Cataracts usually do not harm the eye, so you can have surgery when you and your eye doctor decide it is right for you. Surgery is usually recommended when you can't do normal activities such as driving, reading, or looking at computer or video screens, even with glasses.\n\nSome research found that having cataract surgery is associated with a lower risk of dementia but more research is needed to determine if this association was cause and effect.\n\nSome people may have other eye problems, such as diabetic retinopathy, that can't be treated without first having cataract surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nVision may not improve to 20/20 after cataract surgery if other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, are present. The eye doctor can often determine this in advance.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nEarly diagnosis and properly timed treatment are key to preventing permanent vision problems.\n\nAlthough rare, a cataract that goes on to an advanced stage (called a hypermature cataract) can begin to leak into other parts of the eye. This may cause a painful form of glaucoma and inflammation inside the eye.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your eye care professional for an appointment if you have:\n\n* Decreased night vision\n* Problems with glare\n* Vision loss\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best prevention involves controlling diseases that increase the risk for a cataract. Avoiding exposure to things that promote cataract formation can also help. For example, if you smoke, now is the time to quit. Also, when outdoors, wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Lens opacity\n* Age-related cataract\n* Vision loss - cataract\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nCataracts - what to ask your doctor\n\n---\n\n**Cataract**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nCataracts are a common age-related condition that can cause vision loss. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, cataracts are caused by the clouding of the lens in the eye. The exact cause of cataracts is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to aging and oxidative stress.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cataracts can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Cloudy vision**: Cataracts can cause a cloudy or hazy appearance in your vision.\n*   **Double vision**: In some cases, cataracts can cause double vision or blurred vision.\n*   **Sensitivity to light**: Cataracts can make your eyes more sensitive to light.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for cataracts typically involves surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial one. There are several types of cataract surgery, including:\n\n*   **Phacoemulsification**: This is a common type of cataract surgery that uses ultrasound waves to break up the cloudy lens.\n*   **Extracapsular cataract extraction**: This type of surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial one.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent cataracts, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Wear sunglasses**: Wearing sunglasses can help protect your eyes from UV damage.\n*   **Eat a healthy diet**: Eating a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables can help reduce your risk of cataracts.\n*   **Get regular eye exams**: Getting regular eye exams can help detect cataracts early on.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology.

As a cataract develops, the lens becomes cloudy. This blocks light from entering your eye. Without enough light, you cannot see as clearly.\n\nCataracts are painless. They are most often seen in older adults. Sometimes, children are born with them. Cataract surgery is usually done if you cannot see well enough because of cataracts. Cataracts usually do not permanently damage your eye, so you and your eye doctor can decide when surgery is right for you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nCataract surgery is an outpatient procedure.

The goal of the surgery is to restore clear vision and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by cataracts.\n\n\\n\\n**Types of Cataract Removal**\n\nThere are several types of cataract removal procedures, including:\n\n*   **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common type of cataract surgery, where a small incision is made in the cornea and a specialized instrument breaks up the cloudy lens using ultrasonic waves.\n*   **Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)**: In this procedure, the cloudy lens is removed in one piece, leaving the back capsule intact.\n*   **Intracapsular Cataract Extraction (ICCE)**: This type of surgery involves removing the entire lens, including the back capsule.\n\n\\n\\n**Benefits of Cataract Removal**\n\nCataract removal can significantly improve vision and quality of life for individuals affected by cataracts. Some benefits of the procedure include:\n\n*   **Improved Vision**: Cataract removal can restore clear vision and reduce eye strain.\n*   **Increased Mobility**: By improving vision, cataract removal can increase mobility and independence in daily activities.\n*   **Enhanced Quality of Life**: Cataract removal can improve overall quality of life by reducing the emotional and social impacts of cataracts.\n\n\\n\\n**Risks and Complications**\n\nWhile cataract removal is generally a safe procedure, there are some risks and complications to be aware of, including:\n\n*   **Endophthalmitis**: A rare but serious infection that can occur after cataract surgery.\n*   **Retinal Detachment**: A possible complication where the retina separates from the back of the eye.\n*   **Cataract Recurrence**: In some cases, a new cataract may form over time.\n\n\\n\\n**Preparation and Recovery**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract removal, patients should:\n\n*   **Schedule a Pre-Surgical Consultation**: Meet with an ophthalmologist to discuss the procedure and any concerns.\n*   **Follow Pre-Surgical Instructions**: Adhere to instructions provided by the surgeon or healthcare team.\n*   **Plan for Post-Surgical Recovery**: Arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and plan for rest and recovery.\n\nAfter cataract removal, patients should:\n\n*   **Attend Follow-Up Appointments**: Schedule follow-up appointments with the ophthalmologist to monitor healing and adjust any necessary medications.\n*   **Follow Post-Surgical Instructions**: Adhere to instructions provided by the surgeon or healthcare team regarding eye care and activity levels.\n*   **Report Any Concerns**: Notify the ophthalmologist of any concerns or changes in vision.",

    "content": "**Catecholamine Tests**\n\n**What are catecholamine tests?**\n\nCatecholamines are a group of hormones made by your adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. Hormones act as chemical messengers in your bloodstream. They carry information that controls the actions of certain cells or organs. The main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Epinephrine is also known as adrenaline.\n\nThese hormones are released into the body in response to physical or emotional stress. This response is sometimes referred to as your body's \"fight or flight\" response to stress. When catecholamines enter your bloodstream:\n\n* Your blood flow increases to your muscles and brain\n* You become more alert\n* Your heart rate and blood pressure increase\n* You get more adrenaline for energy\n\nCatecholamine tests measure the amount of catecholamines in your urine or blood. Usually, these hormone levels are low and increase during and just after a stressful situation. Then these levels return to a normal level once the stressful situation has ended. Blood or urine levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine that stay higher than normal can be a sign of certain rare tumors.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nCatecholamine tests are most often used to diagnose or rule out certain types of rare tumors, including:\n\n* Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands. This type of tumor is usually benign (not cancerous). But it can be fatal if left untreated.\n* Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor that develops from nerve tissue. It mostly affects infants and children.\n* Paraganglioma, a type of tumor that forms near the adrenal glands and can cause high blood pressure. This type of tumor is sometimes cancerous, but it usually grows very slowly.\n\nThe tests may also be used to see if treatments for these tumors are working.\n\n**Why do I need a catecholamine test?**\n\nYou or your child may need this test if you have symptoms of a tumor that affects catecholamine levels. Symptoms in adults include:\n\n* High blood pressure, especially if it isn't getting better with treatment\n* Severe headaches\n* Sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Anxiety\n* Tingling in your arms and legs\n\nSymptoms in children include:\n\n* Bone pain or tenderness\n* An abnormal lump in the abdomen\n* Weight loss for no known reason\n* Uncontrolled eye movements\n\nTreatment of these rare tumors may help to control or reduce your high blood pressure. But if the tumors are not treated, your symptoms may get worse. The tumors may continue to grow and could cause more severe health problems.\n\n**What happens during a catecholamine test?**\n\nA catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.\n\nBut blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. This type of tumor may make certain substances and release them into your bloodstream. These substances may include extra catecholamines.\n\nFor a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, you'll be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start.\n\nThe test generally includes the following steps:\n\n* To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated.\n* For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container.\n* During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or cooler with ice.\n* 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test.\n* Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.\n\nDuring a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may be asked to avoid certain foods for two to three days before the test. These could include:\n\n* Caffeinated foods and drinks, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, and chocolate\n* Alcohol and tobacco\n* Bananas\n* Citrus fruits\n* Foods that contain vanilla\n\nYou may also be asked to avoid stress and vigorous exercise before your test, as these can affect catecholamine levels. Certain medicines may also affect levels. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf you are having a blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no risk to having a urine test.\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show high levels of catecholamines in your urine or blood, it may be a sign of a pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, or paraganglioma tumor. If you are being treated for one of these tumors, high levels may mean your treatment is not working.\n\nHigh levels of these hormones don't always mean you have a tumor. Your levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine can be affected by stress, vigorous exercise, caffeine, smoking, and alcohol.\n\nTo understand the results of your catecholamine test, your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about catecholamine tests?**\n\nThese tests can help diagnose certain tumors, but they can't tell whether the tumor is cancerous. Most tumors are not. If your results showed high levels of these hormones, your provider will probably order more tests. These include imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI, which can help your provider get more information about a suspected tumor.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Catecholamine Tests**\n\n**What are catecholamines?**\n\nCatecholamines are a group of hormones made by your adrenal glands. Hormones act as chemical messengers in your bloodstream, carrying information that controls the actions of certain cells or organs.\n\n**Main types of catecholamines:**\n\n* Dopamine\n* Norepinephrine\n* Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline)\n\n**What happens during a stressful situation?**\n\nWhen you experience physical or emotional stress, your body releases catecholamines into the bloodstream. This response is sometimes referred to as your body's \"fight or flight\" response to stress.\n\n**Catecholamine tests:**\n\nCatecholamine tests measure the amount of catecholamines in your urine or blood. Usually, these hormone levels are low and increase during and just after a stressful situation. Then these levels return to a normal level once the stressful situation has ended.\n\n**Rare tumors that can cause high catecholamine levels:**\n\n* Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal glands)\n* Neuroblastoma (a cancerous tumor that develops from nerve tissue)\n* Paraganglioma (a type of tumor that forms near the adrenal glands)\n\n**Symptoms in adults:**\n\n* High blood pressure\n* Severe headaches\n* Sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Anxiety\n* Tingling in your arms and legs\n\n**Symptoms in children:**\n\n* Bone pain or tenderness\n* An abnormal lump in the abdomen\n* Weight loss for no known reason\n* Uncontrolled eye movements\n\n**Treatment of rare tumors:**\n\nTreatment of these rare tumors may help to control or reduce your high blood pressure.

    "content": "**Catecholamine Blood Test**\n\nThis test measures the levels of catecholamines in the blood. Catecholamines are hormones made by the adrenal glands. The three catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine, and dopamine.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will likely be told not to eat anything (fast) for 10 hours before the test. You may be allowed to drink water during this time.\n\nThe accuracy of the test can be affected by certain foods and medicines. Foods that can increase catecholamine levels include:\n\n* Coffee\n* Tea\n* Bananas\n* Chocolate\n* Cocoa\n* Citrus fruits\n* Vanilla\n\nYou should not eat these foods for several days before the test. This is especially true if both blood and urine catecholamines are to be measured.\n\nYou should also avoid stressful situations and vigorous exercise. Both can affect the accuracy of the test results.\n\nMedicines and substances that can increase catecholamine measurements include:\n\n* Acetaminophen\n* Albuterol\n* Aminophylline\n* Amphetamines\n* Buspirone\n* Caffeine\n* Calcium channel blockers\n* Cocaine\n* Cyclobenzaprine\n* Levodopa\n* Methyldopa\n* Nicotine\n* Nicotinic acid (large doses)\n* Phenoxybenzamine\n* Phenothiazines\n* Pseudoephedrine\n* Reserpine\n* Tricyclic antidepressants\n\nMedicines that can decrease catecholamine measurements include:\n\n* Clonidine\n* Guanethidine\n* Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors\n\nIf you take any of the above medicines, check with your health care provider before the blood test about whether you should stop taking your medicine.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCatecholamines are released into the blood when a person is under physical or emotional stress. The main catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (which used to be called adrenalin).\n\nThis test is used to diagnose or rule out certain rare tumors, such as pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma. It may also be done in people with those conditions to determine if treatment is working.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range for epinephrine is 0 to 140 pg/mL (764.3 pmol/L).\n\nThe normal range for norepinephrine is 70 to 1700 pg/mL (413.8 to 10048.7 pmol/L).\n\nThe normal range for dopamine is 0 to 30 pg/mL (195.8 pmol/L).\n\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nHigher-than-normal levels of blood catecholamines may suggest:\n\n* Acute anxiety\n* Ganglioblastoma (very rare tumor)\n* Ganglioneuroma (very rare tumor)\n* Neuroblastoma (rare tumor)\n* Pheochromocytoma (rare tumor)\n* Severe stress\n\nAdditional conditions under which the test may be performed include multiple system atrophy.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Catecholamine Blood Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThis test measures the levels of catecholamines in your blood.

    "content": "**Caterpillars**\n\n_Caterpillars are the larvae (immature forms) of butterflies and moths. There are many thousands of types, with a huge variety of colors and sizes. They look like worms and are covered in small hairs. Most are harmless, but some can cause allergic reactions, especially if your eyes, skin, or lungs come in contact with their hairs, or if you eat them._\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_Below are symptoms of exposure to caterpillar hairs in different parts of the body._\n\n* **EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND THROAT**\n\t+ Drooling\n\t+ Pain\n\t+ Redness\n\t+ Inflamed membranes in the nose\n\t+ Increased tears\n\t+ Mouth and throat burning and swelling\n\t+ Pain\n\t+ Redness of the eye\n* **NERVOUS SYSTEM**\n\t+ Headache\n* **RESPIRATORY SYSTEM**\n\t+ Cough\n\t+ Shortness of breath\n\t+ Wheezing\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Blisters\n\t+ Hives\n\t+ Itching\n\t+ Rash\n\t+ Redness\n* **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n\t+ Vomiting, if caterpillar or caterpillar hairs are eaten\n* **WHOLE BODY**\n\t+ Pain\n\t+ Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). This is rare.\n\t+ A combination of symptoms including itching, nausea, headache, fever, vomiting, muscle spasms, tingling in the skin, and swollen glands. This is also rare.\n\n**Home Care**\n\n_Remove irritating caterpillar hairs. If the caterpillar was on your skin, put sticky tape (such as duct or masking tape) where the hairs are, then pull it off. Repeat until all hairs are removed. Wash the contact area with soap and water, and then ice. Place the ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the affected area for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time ice is used to prevent possible damage to the skin. After several ice treatments, apply a paste of baking soda and water to the area._\n\n_If the caterpillar touched your eyes, flush your eyes right away with plenty of water, and then get medical help._\n\n_Get medical care if you breathe in caterpillar hairs._\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\n_Have this information ready:_\n\n* _Person's age, weight, and condition_\n* _Type of caterpillar, if known_\n* _Time of the incident_\n* _Poison Control_\n\n_Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions._\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\n_Bring the caterpillar to the hospital, if possible. Make sure it is in a secure container._\n\n_The health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
