    "content": "**CEA Test**\n\n**What is a CEA test?**\n\nCEA stands for carcinoembryonic antigen. CEA is a protein that is a type of \"tumor marker.\" Tumor markers are substances that are often made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer.\n\nHigh levels of CEA are normal in healthy, unborn babies. After birth, CEA levels become very low or disappear completely. So, healthy adults should have little or no CEA in their bodies.\n\nCancers that may cause high levels of CEA include cancers of the:\n\n* Colon and rectum (colorectal or bowel cancer)\n* Prostate\n* Ovary\n* Lung\n* Thyroid\n* Liver\n* Pancreas\n* Breast\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with a cancer that can cause high CEA levels, CEA testing may help your health care provider learn more about your cancer and chance of recovery. The test is often used with other tests to check if cancer treatment is working.\n\n**CEA tests are not used to screen for or diagnose cancer**\n\nThat's because:\n\n* Cancers that often cause high CEA levels don't always cause high levels. You can have normal CEA test results even though you have one of these cancers.\n* Many other health problems that aren't cancer can make CEA levels rise, including certain conditions that affect your liver, digestion, or breathing.\n\n**Most CEA tests use a sample of your blood to measure your CEA level**\n\nSometimes the test uses a sample of fluid from your spine, chest, or abdomen (belly), but this is less common.\n\n**Other names: CEA assay, CEA blood test, carcinoembryonic antigen test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CEA test is mostly used in people who have been diagnosed with cancers that often increase CEA levels. It's most commonly used in colorectal cancer. A provider may order a CEA test along with other tests to:\n\n* Learn more about a cancer soon after it has been diagnosed. CEA levels can help predict the likelihood of recovery and/or the chance that cancer will come back after treatment.\n* Check how well cancer treatment is working.\n* See if cancer has returned after treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why do I need a CEA test?**\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with a type of cancer that can cause high CEA levels, you may need CEA testing:\n\n* Before treatment to:\n\t+ Help understand how serious your cancer is.\n\t+ Help guide treatment decisions.\n\t+ Get a measurement of your CEA level before treatment to compare with CEA levels after treatment.\n* During cancer treatment to see if the treatment working.\n* After treatment to check whether cancer has come back. You may need to have tests on a regular schedule.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What happens during a CEA test?**\n\nCEA is usually measured with a blood sample. During a CEA blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nSometimes, CEA is tested in other body fluids. For these tests, your provider will remove a small sample of fluid using a thin needle.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFor a CEA blood test, you usually don't need to prepare. If you smoke, you may need to stop for a while before your test. That's because smoking increases CEA levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nA CEA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nTo understand your CEA test results, your provider will consider the results of other tests and exams. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health and treatment.\n\nIf you had a test before starting cancer treatment, in general:\n\n* A low level of CEA may mean your tumor is small and the cancer has not spread to other parts of your body. But some cancers don't make much CEA, so your provider may use other tests to learn more about how much cancer you have and if it's spread.\n* A high level of CEA may mean you have a larger tumor and/or your cancer has spread. You'll need other tests to confirm how serious your cancer is.\n\nIf you had a test to monitor your cancer during or after treatment, your provider will compare your current CEA test results with your past test results. In general:\n\n* Decreases in CEA over time often mean that treatment is working.\n* Increases in CEA or high levels that stay high may mean that treatment isn't working. For example, if you had surgery for colorectal cancer, these levels may mean that the entire tumor wasn't removed or the cancer is growing back.\n* Decreases in CEA after treatment followed by increases may mean cancer has come back.\n\nCEA levels that remain high or increase after treatment don't always mean that treatment isn't working, or cancer is growing. So, if your CEA levels don't come down, your provider will likely order other tests to find out why.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CEA test?**\n\nLabs use different methods to measure CEA. The test method can affect your results. So, it's best to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab. This allows your provider to compare your results over time. If you have questions about how your tests are done, ask your provider.\n\n---\n\n**CEA Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CEA test is mostly used in people who have been diagnosed with cancers that often increase CEA levels.

This test is used to help diagnose and monitor certain types of cancer, including colorectal, lung, breast, and ovarian cancers.\n\n**How the Test Works**\n\nThe CEA test works by detecting the presence of carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient's bodily fluids. Carcinoembryonic antigen is a protein that is normally present in small amounts in the body, but its levels can increase in people with certain types of cancer. The test involves collecting a sample of bodily fluid from the patient and sending it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**Types of CEA Tests**\n\nThere are several types of CEA tests available, including:\n\n* **Serum CEA Test**: This test measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient's blood.\n* **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) CEA Test**: This test measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient's cerebrospinal fluid.\n* **Peritoneal Fluid CEA Test**: This test measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient's peritoneal fluid.\n\n**Interpreting CEA Test Results**\n\nCEA test results are typically reported as a numerical value, with higher values indicating an increased risk of cancer. However, it's essential to note that CEA test results should be interpreted in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and medical history.\n\n**When to Use the CEA Test**\n\nThe CEA test is used to help diagnose and monitor certain types of cancer, including:\n\n* **Colorectal Cancer**: The CEA test can help detect colorectal cancer in its early stages.\n* **Lung Cancer**: The CEA test can help detect lung cancer in its early stages.\n* **Breast Cancer**: The CEA test can help detect breast cancer in its early stages.\n* **Ovarian Cancer**: The CEA test can help detect ovarian cancer in its early stages.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nThe CEA test is related to several other health topics, including:\n\n* **Breast Cancer**\n* **Cancer**\n* **Colorectal Cancer**\n* **Liver Cancer**\n* **Lung Cancer**\n* **Ovarian Cancer**\n* **Prostate Cancer**\n* **Thyroid Cancer**\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\nThe CEA test is related to several other medical tests, including:\n\n* **Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test**\n* **BRAF Genetic Test**\n* **CA 19-9 Blood Test (Pancreatic Cancer)**\n* **CA-125 Blood Test (Ovarian Cancer)**\n* **Calcitonin Test**\n* **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**\n* **How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety**\n* **How to Understand Your Lab Results**\n* **Lung Cancer Genetic Tests**\n* **Pleural Fluid Analysis**\n* **TP53 Genetic Test**\n* **Tumor Marker Tests**\n* **What You Need to Know About Blood Testing**",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cftr/",
    "content": "**CFTR Gene**\n\nThe CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes.\n\n*   The channel transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells.\n*   The transport of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus.\n*   Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues.\n\nThe CFTR protein also regulates the function of other channels, such as those that transport positively charged particles called sodium ions across cell membranes. These channels are necessary for the normal function of organs such as the lungs and pancreas.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens**: About 80 CFTR mutations have been identified in males with this condition. Most affected males have a mild mutation in at least one copy of the gene in each cell, allowing the CFTR protein to retain some function.\n*   **Cystic fibrosis**: More than 1,000 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in people with cystic fibrosis. The most common mutation is delta F508, which deletes one amino acid at position 508 in the CFTR protein.\n*   **Hereditary pancreatitis**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about this condition.\n\nThe abnormal mucus obstructs the airways and glands, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\n---\n\n**CFTR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other Disorders**\n    A few mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in people with isolated problems affecting the digestive or respiratory system. For example, CFTR mutations have been found in some cases of idiopathic pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas that causes abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Although CFTR mutations may be a risk factor, the cause of idiopathic pancreatitis is unknown.\n\n    Changes in the CFTR gene also have been associated with rhinosinusitis, which is a chronic inflammation of the tissues that line the sinuses. This condition causes sinus pain and pressure, headache, fever, and nasal congestion or drainage. Other respiratory problems, including several conditions that partially block the airways and interfere with breathing, are also associated with CFTR mutations. These conditions include bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (the bronchi), and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which results from hypersensitivity to a certain type of fungal infection. Additional genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of these complex conditions.\n\n*   **Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens**\n    About 80 CFTR mutations have been identified in males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Most affected males have a mild mutation in at least one copy of the gene in each cell. These mutations allow the CFTR protein to retain some of its function. Some affected males have a mild mutation in one copy of the CFTR gene in each cell and a more severe, cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of the gene.\n\n    Mutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of the chloride channel, preventing the usual flow of chloride ions and water into and out of cells. As a result, cells in the male genital tract produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the tubes that carry sperm from the testes (the vas deferens) as they are forming, causing them to deteriorate before birth. Without the vas deferens, sperm cannot be transported from the testes to become part of semen. Men with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens are unable to father children (infertile) unless they use assisted reproductive technologies.\n\n*   **Cystic Fibrosis**\n    More than 1,000 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in people with cystic fibrosis. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CFTR protein or delete a small amount of DNA from the CFTR gene. The most common mutation, called delta F508, is a deletion of one amino acid at position 508 in the CFTR protein. The resulting abnormal channel breaks down shortly after it is made, so it never reaches the cell membrane to transport chloride ions.\n\n    Disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene alter the production, structure, or stability of the chloride channel. All of these changes prevent the channel from functioning properly, which impairs the transport of chloride ions and the movement of water into and out of cells. As a result, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. The abnormal mucus obstructs the airways and glands, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\n---\n\n**CFTR Gene**\n\nThe CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which is involved in the movement of chloride ions and water into and out of cells.\n\n**Hereditary Pancreatitis**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about hereditary pancreatitis. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever due to inflammation of the pancreas.\n\n**Other Disorders Associated with CFTR Mutations**\n\nA few mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in people with isolated problems affecting the digestive or respiratory system.

    "content": "**CHST3-related Skeletal Dysplasia**\n\n**Description**\n\nCHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is a genetic condition characterized by bone and joint abnormalities that worsen over time. Affected individuals have short stature throughout life, with an adult height under 4 and a half feet. Joint dislocations, most often affecting the knees, hips, and elbows, are present at birth (congenital). Other bone and joint abnormalities can include an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), a limited range of motion in large joints, and abnormal curvature of the spine.\n\nThe features of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia are usually limited to the bones and joints; however, minor heart defects have been reported in a few affected individuals. Researchers have not settled on a preferred name for this condition. It is sometimes known as autosomal recessive Larsen syndrome based on its similarity to another skeletal disorder called Larsen syndrome.\n\nOther names that have been used to describe the condition include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Omani type; humero-spinal dysostosis; and chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations. Recently, researchers have proposed the umbrella term CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia to refer to bone and joint abnormalities resulting from mutations in the CHST3 gene.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is unknown. More than 30 affected individuals have been reported.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAs its name suggests, CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia results from mutations in the CHST3 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called C6ST-1, which is essential for the normal development of cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development.\n\nMost cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Mutations in the CHST3 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the C6ST-1 enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme disrupts the normal development of cartilage and bone, resulting in the abnormalities associated with CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia.\n\n---\n\n**CHST3-related Skeletal Dysplasia**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia\n\n**The Gene Behind the Condition**\n\nCHST3-related skeletal dysplasia results from mutations in the CHST3 gene.

    "content": "**CLN4 Disease**\n\nCLN4 disease is a condition that primarily affects the nervous system, causing problems with movement and intellectual function that worsen over time. The signs and symptoms of CLN4 disease typically appear around age 30, but they can develop anytime between adolescence and late adulthood.\n\nPeople with CLN4 disease often develop seizures and uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy), a decline in intellectual function (dementia), problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics), and speech difficulties (dysarthria). The signs and symptoms of CLN4 disease worsen over time, and affected individuals usually survive about 15 years after the disorder begins.\n\nCLN4 disease is one of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), which may also be collectively referred to as Batten disease. (The adult forms of NCLs, which includes CLN4 disease, are sometimes known as Kufs disease.) All the NCLs affect the nervous system and typically cause worsening problems with vision, movement, and thinking ability. The different NCLs are distinguished by their genetic cause. Each disease type is given the designation \"CLN,\" meaning ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, and then a number to indicate its subtype.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCLN4 disease is a rare disorder, but its prevalence is unknown. Collectively, all forms of NCL affect an estimated 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the DNAJC5 gene cause CLN4 disease. The DNAJC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cysteine string protein alpha (CSPα). This protein is found in the brain, where it plays a role in the transmission of nerve impulses, helping nerve cells communicate with each other. Specifically, CSPα is involved in recycling certain proteins that are involved in nerve impulse transmission by refolding misshapen proteins so that they can be used in additional transmissions.\n\nDNAJC5 gene mutations lead to the production of an altered CSPα protein.\n\n---\n\n**CLN4 Disease**\n\n**What is CLN4 disease?**\n\nCLN4 disease, like other NCLs, is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and other substances in lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects.\n\n**How does CLN4 disease affect the brain?**\n\nThe progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues contributes to the decline of neurological function in CLN4 disease.\n\n**What is the genetic cause of CLN4 disease?**\n\nMutations in the DNAJC5 gene cause CLN4 disease. The DNAJC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cysteine string protein alpha (CSPα). This protein is found in the brain, where it plays a role in the transmission of nerve impulses, helping nerve cells communicate with each other.\n\n**How does the altered CSPα protein affect the body?**\n\nThe altered protein cannot perform its function, which reduces protein recycling, causing a shortage (deficiency) of functional proteins needed for impulse transmission. Without normal communication between nerve cells, neurological functions are impaired, contributing to the features of CLN4 disease.\n\n**Is there a connection between DNAJC5 gene mutations and lysosome buildup?**\n\nIt is unclear how mutations in the DNAJC5 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes.\n\n**How is CLN4 disease inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some cases result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual’s parent or in early embryonic development.\n\n**Other names for CLN4 disease**\n\nAdult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, 4B, autosomal dominant, CLN4B, Parry disease\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, 4 (Kufs type)\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 4 (KUFS TYPE); CLN4\n\n---\n\n**CLN4 Disease**\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 4 (KUFS TYPE); CLN4\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Information\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, 4 (Kufs type)\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n    *   Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**CMV - Gastroenteritis/Colitis**\n\nCMV gastroenteritis/colitis is inflammation of the stomach or intestine due to infection with cytomegalovirus. This same virus can also cause lung infection, infection in the back of the eye, and infections of a baby while still in the womb.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes-type virus related to the virus that causes chickenpox. Infection with CMV is very common and is spread by saliva, urine, respiratory droplets, sexual contact, and blood transfusions. Most people are exposed at some point, but most of the time, the virus produces mild or no symptoms in healthy people.\n\nSerious CMV infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems due to:\n\n*   AIDS\n*   Chemotherapy treatment for cancer\n*   During or after bone marrow or organ transplant\n*   Ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease\n\nRarely, serious CMV infection involving the GI tract has occurred in people with a healthy immune system.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) CMV disease may affect one area or the entire GI system. Ulcers due to CMV can occur in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or colon. These ulcers are associated with symptoms such as:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Difficulty swallowing or pain with swallowing\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\nWhen the intestines are involved, the ulcers may cause:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Bloody stools\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Fever\n*   Weight loss\n\nMore severe infections can result in gastrointestinal bleeding or a hole through the wall of the bowel (perforation).\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Barium enema\n*   Colonoscopy with biopsy\n*   Upper endoscopy (EGD) with biopsy\n*   Stool culture or similar stool tests to check for other causes of infection\n*   Upper GI and small bowel series\n\nLaboratory tests will be done on a sample of tissue taken from your stomach or intestine. The tests, such as a gastric or intestinal tissue culture or biopsy, determine if the virus is in the tissue.\n\nA CMV serology test may be done to look for antibodies to the CMV virus in your blood.\n\nAnother blood test that looks for the presence and number of virus particles in the blood can also be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is meant to control the infection and relieve symptoms. Medicines to fight the virus (antiviral medicines) are prescribed. The medicines may be given through a vein (IV), and sometimes by mouth, for several weeks. The most commonly used medicines are ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and foscarnet.\n\nIn some cases, long-term therapy may be needed. A medicine called CMV hyperimmune globulin may be used when other medicines don't work.\n\nOther medicines may include:\n\n*   Medicines to prevent or reduce diarrhea\n*   Painkillers (analgesics)\n\nNutritional supplements or nutrition given through a vein (IV) may be used to treat muscle loss due to the disease.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn people with a healthy immune system, symptoms go away without treatment in most cases. Symptoms are more severe in those with a weakened immune system. The outcome depends on how severe the immune system deficiency and the CMV infection are.\n\nPeople with AIDS may have a worse outcome than those with a weakened immune system due to another reason.\n\nCMV infection typically affects the entire body, even if only (GI) symptoms are present. How well a person does depends on how well the antiviral medicines work.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe medicines used to fight the virus may cause side effects. The type of side effect depends on the specific medicine used. For example, ganciclovir may lower your white blood cell count. Another medicine, foscarnet, may lead to kidney problems.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of CMV gastroenteritis/colitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is a high risk of CMV infection in people who receive an organ transplant from a CMV-positive donor. Taking the antiviral medicines ganciclovir (Cytovene) and valganciclovir (Valcyte) by mouth before the transplant can lower your chance of getting a new infection or reactivating an old infection.\n\nPeople with AIDS who are effectively treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy are much less likely to get a CMV infection.\n\n---\n\n**CMV Gastroenteritis/Colitis**\n\nCMV gastroenteritis/colitis is inflammation of the stomach or intestine due to infection with cytomegalovirus.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes-type virus.

    "content": "**CMV Blood Test**\n\nThe CMV blood test determines the presence of substances (proteins) called antibodies to a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCMV infection is a disease caused by a type of herpes virus. The CMV blood test is performed to detect current active CMV infection, or past CMV infection in people who are at risk for reactivation of infection. These people include organ transplant recipients and those with a suppressed immune system. The test may also be performed to detect CMV infection in newborns.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nPeople who have never been infected with CMV have no detectable antibodies to CMV. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe presence of antibodies to CMV indicates a current or past infection with CMV. If the number of antibodies (called the antibody titer) rises over a few weeks, it may mean that you have a current or recent infection. Long-term (chronic) CMV infection (in which the antibody count stays about the same over time) can reactivate in a person with a suppressed immune system.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nTo detect a blood or organ infection with CMV, your provider can test for the presence of CMV itself in the blood or a specific organ.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCMV antibody tests\n\n---\n\n**CMV Blood Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe CMV blood test is a diagnostic tool used to detect current active or past CMV infection in individuals who are at risk for reactivation of the infection.

If there are symptoms, they may include:\n\n*   Blind spots\n*   Blurred vision and other vision problems\n*   Floaters\n\nRetinitis usually begins in one eye, but often progresses to the other eye. Without treatment, damage to the retina can lead to blindness in 4 to 6 months or less.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nCMV retinitis is diagnosed through an ophthalmologic exam. Dilation of the pupils and ophthalmoscopy will show signs of CMV retinitis.\n\nCMV infection may be diagnosed with blood or urine tests that look for substances specific to the infection. However, an infection may be present even with a negative blood or urine test. CMV can affect specific organs, such as the retina or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and blood and urine tests can be negative. A tissue biopsy can detect the viral infection and presence of CMV virus particles, but this may be done only for some organs (GI tract) and not others (eyes).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stop the virus from replicating and to stabilize or restore vision and prevent blindness. Long-term treatment is often needed. Medicines may be given by mouth (orally), through a vein (intravenously), or injected directly into the eye (intravitreously).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEven with treatment, the disease can worsen to blindness. This progression may happen because the virus becomes resistant to the antiviral medicines so the medicines are no longer effective, or because the person's immune system has deteriorated further.\n\nCMV retinitis may also lead to retinal detachment, in which the retina detaches from the back of the eye, causing blindness.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result include:\n\n*   Kidney function impairment (from medicines used to treat the condition)\n*   Low white blood cell count (from medicines used to treat the condition)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop, contact your health care provider.\n\nPeople with HIV/AIDS (especially those with a very low CD4 count) who have vision problems should make an appointment right away for an eye exam.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nA CMV infection usually only causes symptoms in people with a weakened immune system. Certain medicines (such as cancer therapy) and diseases (such as HIV/AIDS) can cause a weakened immune system.\n\nPeople with AIDS who have a CD4 count of less than 250 cells/microliter (cells/µL) or 250 cells/cubic millimeter (cells/mm3) should be examined regularly for this condition, even if they do not have symptoms.

    "content": "**CO2 Blood Test**\n\nThe CO2 blood test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid part of your blood, called the serum. In the body, most of the CO2 is in the form of a substance called bicarbonate (HCO3-). Therefore, the CO2 blood test is really a measure of your blood bicarbonate level.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed for this test. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe CO2 test is most often done as part of an electrolyte or basic metabolic panel. Changes in your CO2 level may suggest that you are losing or retaining acidic fluid. This may cause an imbalance in your body's electrolytes. CO2 levels in the blood are affected by kidney and lung function. The kidneys help maintain the normal bicarbonate levels.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 23 to 29 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or 23 to 29 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal levels may be due to the following problems:\n\n* Lower-than-normal levels:\n\t+ Addison disease\n\t+ Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (used to treat glaucoma)\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Ethylene glycol poisoning\n\t+ Ketoacidosis\n\t+ Kidney disease\n\t+ Lactic acidosis\n\t+ Metabolic acidosis\n\t+ Methanol poisoning\n\t+ Renal tubular acidosis -- distal\n\t+ Renal tubular acidosis -- proximal\n\t+ Respiratory alkalosis (compensated)\n\t+ Salicylate toxicity (such as aspirin overdose)\n\t+ Ureteral diversion\n* Higher-than-normal levels:\n\t+ Bartter syndrome\n\t+ Burns\n\t+ Congestive heart failure\n\t+ Cushing syndrome\n\t+ Dehydration\n\t+ Excessive sweating\n\t+ Hyperaldosteronism\n\t+ Metabolic alkalosis\n\t+ Respiratory acidosis (compensated)\n\t+ Syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)\n\t+ Vomiting\n\nDelirium may also alter bicarbonate levels.\n\n---\n\n**CO2 Blood Test**\n\nThe CO2 blood test is a simple procedure that measures the level of carbon dioxide in your blood.

It's an important test that can help diagnose various health problems, such as respiratory and metabolic disorders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is a CO2 blood test necessary?**\n\nThe CO2 blood test is crucial because it helps detect abnormalities in the body's acid-base balance. When the body's pH levels become too high or too low, it can lead to serious health issues. The test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood, which is an indicator of your body's acid-base balance.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is a CO2 blood test performed?**\n\nA CO2 blood test is typically performed by drawing a sample of blood from a vein in your arm.

    "content": "**COPD - Managing Stress and Your Mood**\n\nPeople with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a greater risk for depression, stress, and anxiety. Being stressed or depressed can make COPD symptoms worse and make it harder to care for yourself.\n\n**When You Have COPD, Caring for Your Emotional Health is Just as Important as Taking Care of Your Physical Health**\n\nLearning how to deal with stress and anxiety and seeking care for depression can help you manage COPD and feel better in general.\n\n**COPD and Your Emotions**\n\nHaving COPD can affect your mood and emotions for several reasons:\n\n* You cannot do all the things you used to do.\n* You may need to do things much slower than you used to.\n* You may often feel tired.\n* You may have a hard time sleeping.\n* You may feel ashamed or blame yourself for having COPD.\n* You may be more isolated from others because it is harder to get out to do things.\n* Breathing problems can be stressful and scary.\n\nAll of these factors can make you feel stressed, anxious, or depressed.\n\n**How Your Emotions Can Affect COPD**\n\nHaving COPD can change how you feel about yourself. And how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself.\n\n* People with COPD who are depressed may have more COPD flare-ups and may have to go to the hospital more often.\n* Depression saps your energy and motivation.\n* When you are depressed, you may be less likely to:\n\t+ Eat well.\n\t+ Exercise.\n\t+ Take your medicines as directed.\n\t+ Follow your treatment plan.\n\t+ Get enough rest or sleep.\n\n**Stress is a Known COPD Trigger**\n\nWhen you feel stressed and anxious, you may breathe faster, which can make you feel short of breath. When it is harder to breathe, you feel more anxious, and the cycle continues, leading you to feel even worse.\n\n**How to Manage Stress and Avoid Depression**\n\nThere are things you can and should do to protect your emotional health. While you cannot get rid of all the stress in your life, you can learn how to manage it. These suggestions may help you relieve stress and stay positive:\n\n* Identify the people, places, and situations that cause stress.\n* Try to avoid things that make you anxious.\n* Practice relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing, visualization, letting go of negative thoughts, and muscle relaxation exercises.\n* Do not take on too much. Take care of yourself by letting go and learning to say no.\n* Stay involved. Do not isolate yourself.\n* Practice positive daily health habits, such as getting up and getting dressed every morning, moving your body every day, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep every night.\n* Talk it out. Share your feelings with trusted family members or friends.\n\n**Feeling Angry, Upset, Sad, or Anxious is Understandable**\n\nHaving COPD changes your life, and it can be hard to accept a new way of living. However, depression is more than occasional sadness or frustration. Symptoms of depression include:\n\n* Low mood most of the time\n* Frequent irritability\n* Not enjoying your usual activities\n* Trouble sleeping, or sleeping too much\n* A big change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss\n* Increased tiredness and lack of energy\n* Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt\n* Trouble concentrating\n* Feeling hopeless or helpless\n* Repeated thoughts of death or suicide\n\nIf you have symptoms of depression that last for 2 weeks or more, contact your health care provider. You do not have to live with these feelings. Treatment can help you feel better.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your doctor if:\n\n* You hear voices or other sounds that are not there.\n* You cry often for no apparent reason.\n* Your depression has affected your work, school, or family life for longer than 2 weeks.\n* You have 3 or more symptoms of depression (listed above).\n* You think one of your current medicines may be making you feel depressed. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without checking with your doctor.\n\nYou should also call your doctor if your COPD symptoms get worse, despite following your treatment plan.\n\n**If You or Someone You Know is Thinking About Suicide**\n\nCall or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\n---\n\n**COPD - Managing Stress and Your Mood**\n\nHaving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can change how you feel about yourself, and how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself.\n\n**How Your Emotions Can Affect COPD**\n\nPeople with COPD who are depressed may have more COPD flare-ups and may have to go to the hospital more often. Depression saps your energy and motivation. When you are depressed, you may be less likely to:\n\n* Eat well\n* Exercise\n* Take your medicines as directed\n* Follow your treatment plan\n* Get enough rest or sleep\n\nStress is a known COPD trigger.

While you cannot get rid of all the stress in your life, you can learn how to manage it. These suggestions may help you relieve stress and stay positive:\n\n* Identify the people, places, and situations that cause stress. Knowing what causes you stress can help you avoid or manage it.\n* Try to avoid things that make you anxious. For example, do not spend time with people who stress you out. Instead, seek out people who nurture and support you. Go shopping during quieter times when there's less traffic and fewer people around.\n* Practice relaxation exercises. Deep breathing, visualization, letting go of negative thoughts, and muscle relaxation exercises are all simple ways to release tension and reduce stress.\n* Do not take on too much. Take care of yourself by letting go and learning to say no. For example, perhaps you typically host 25 people for Thanksgiving dinner. Cut it back to 8. Or better yet, ask someone else to host. If you work, talk with your boss about ways to manage your workload so you do not feel overwhelmed.\n* Stay involved. Do not isolate yourself. Make time every week to spend time with friends or attend social events.\n* Practice positive daily health habits. Get up and get dressed every morning. Move your body every day. Exercise is one of the best stress busters and mood boosters around. Eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep every night.\n* Talk it out. Share your feelings with trusted family members or friends. Or talk with a clergy member. Do not keep things bottled up inside.\n* Follow your treatment plan. When your COPD is well-managed, you will have more energy for the things you enjoy.\n\n**Feeling Angry, Upset, Sad, or Anxious**\n\nFeeling angry, upset, sad, or anxious at times is understandable. Having COPD changes your life, and it can be hard to accept a new way of living. However, depression is more than occasional sadness or frustration.

Do not change or stop taking any medicines without checking with your doctor.\n* You think you should cut back on drinking or drug use, or a family member or friend has asked you to cut back.\n* You feel guilty about the amount of alcohol you drink, or you drink alcohol first thing in the morning.\n\nYou should also call your doctor if your COPD symptoms get worse, despite following your treatment plan.\n\n---\n\n**COPD - Managing Stress and Your Mood**\n\nHaving COPD can change how you feel about yourself. And how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself.\n\n*   You may feel ashamed or blame yourself for having COPD.\n*   You may be more isolated from others because it is harder to get out to do things.\n*   Breathing problems can be stressful and scary.\n\nAll of these factors can make you feel stressed, anxious, or depressed.

You don't have to live with these feelings.\n\n**Protecting Your Emotional Health**\n\nWhile you can't eliminate all stress from your life, you can learn how to manage it. Here are some suggestions:\n\n*   **Exercise regularly**: Physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.\n*   **Practice relaxation techniques**: Deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can calm your mind and body.\n*   **Connect with others**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings and concerns.\n*   **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help regulate your mood.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your doctor if:\n\n*   You hear voices or other sounds that are not there.\n*   You cry often for no apparent reason.\n*   Your depression has affected your work, school, or family life for longer than 2 weeks.\n*   You have 3 or more symptoms of depression (listed above).\n*   You think one of your current medicines may be making you feel depressed.

    "content": "**COPD - Quick-Relief Drugs**\n\nQuick-relief medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) work quickly to help you breathe better. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, or having trouble breathing, such as during a flare-up. For this reason, they are also called rescue medicines.\n\n**What Are Quick-Relief Medicines?**\n\nThe medical name of these medicines is bronchodilators, meaning medicines that open the airways (bronchi). They relax the muscles of your airways and open them up for easier breathing. You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take your medicine and how much you should take.\n\n**Follow Instructions**\n\n*   Follow instructions on how to use your medicines the right way.\n*   Make sure you get your medicine refilled before you run out.\n\n**Quick-Relief Beta-Agonist Inhalers**\n\nQuick-relief beta-agonists help you breathe better by relaxing the muscles of your airways. They are short-acting, which means they stay in your system only for a short time.\n\n*   Some people take them just before exercising. Ask your provider if you should do this.\n*   If you need to use these medicines more than 3 times a week, or if you use more than one canister a month, your COPD probably is not under control. You should contact your provider to see if any changes should be made.\n\n**Kinds of Quick-Relief Beta-Agonists**\n\nQuick-relief beta-agonists inhalers include:\n\n*   Albuterol (ProAir HFA; Proventil HFA; Ventolin HFA)\n*   Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)\n*   Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\n\nMost of the time, these medicines are used as metered dose inhalers (MDI) with a spacer. Sometimes, especially if you have a flare-up, they are used with a nebulizer.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nSide effects might include:\n\n*   Anxiety.\n*   Tremor.\n*   Restlessness.\n*   Headache.\n*   Fast or irregular heartbeats. Call your provider right away if you have this side effect.\n\nSome of these medicines also exist in pills, but the side effects are a lot more significant, so they are very rarely used that way.\n\n**Quick Relief Muscarinic Antagonists (Anti-Cholinergics)**\n\nThere is one medicine, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA), which works slower than beta-agonists, but faster than other long-acting medicines.\n\n**Oral Steroids**\n\nOral steroids (also called corticosteroids) are medicines you take by mouth, as pills, capsules, or liquids. They are not quick-relief medicines, but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up.

    "content": "**COPD and Other Health Problems**\n\nIf you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), you are more likely to have other health problems, too. These are called comorbidities. People with COPD tend to have more health problems than people who do not have COPD.\n\n**Information**\n\nHaving other health problems can affect your symptoms and treatments. You may need to visit your doctor more often. You also may need to have more tests or treatments.\n\nHaving COPD is a lot to manage. But try to stay positive. You can protect your health by understanding why you are at risk for certain conditions and learning how to prevent them.\n\n**Other Health Problems You May Have**\n\nIf you have COPD, you are more likely to have:\n\n* Repeat infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. COPD increases your risk for complications from colds and the flu. It increases your risk of needing to be hospitalized due to a lung infection.\n* High blood pressure in the lungs. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension.\n* Heart disease. COPD increases your risk for heart attack, heart failure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and blood clots.\n* Diabetes. Having COPD increases your risk of developing diabetes. Also, some COPD medicines can cause high blood sugar.\n* Osteoporosis (weak bones). People with COPD often have low levels of vitamin D, are inactive, and smoke. These factors increase your risk for bone loss and weak bones. Certain COPD medicines also may cause bone loss if taken often or for a long time.\n* Depression and anxiety. It is common for people with COPD to feel depressed or anxious. Being breathless can cause anxiety. Plus, having symptoms slows you down so you can't do as much as you used to.\n* Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and heartburn can lead to more COPD symptoms and flare-ups.\n* Lung cancer. Continuing to smoke increases this risk. COPD can make it harder to treat lung cancer.\n\nMany factors play a role in why people with COPD often have other health problems. Smoking is one of the biggest culprits. Smoking is a risk factor for most of the problems above.\n\n**Staying Healthy With COPD**\n\nWork closely with your doctor to keep COPD and other medical problems under control. Taking the following steps can also help protect your health:\n\n* Take medicines and treatments as directed.\n* If you smoke, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your doctor about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation medicines.\n* Discuss the risks and side effects of your medicines with your doctor. There may be better options available or things you can do to reduce or offset the potential harms. Tell your doctor if you notice any side effects.\n* Have the COVID-19 vaccines, yearly flu vaccine, and the pneumococcal vaccines (also called \"pneumonia vaccines\") to help guard against infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from people with colds or other infections.\n* Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight training. Talk with your doctor about ways to get exercise.\n* Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating several small healthy meals a day can give you the nutrients you need without feeling bloated. An overfull belly can make it hard to breathe.\n* Check with your doctor if you feel sad, helpless, or worried. There are programs, treatments, and medicines that can help you feel more positive and hopeful and reduce your symptoms of anxiety or depression.\n\nRemember that you are not alone. Your doctor will work with you to help you stay as healthy and active as possible.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your doctor when:\n\n* You have new signs or symptoms that concern you.\n* You are having trouble managing one or more of your health conditions.\n* You have concerns about your health problems and treatments.\n* You feel hopeless, sad, or anxious.\n* You notice medicine side effects that bother you.\n\n---\n\n**COPD and Other Health Problems**\n\nIf you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), you are more likely to have other health problems, too.

    "content": "**COPD | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n**What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.\n\nNormally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:\n\n*   The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic\n*   The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed\n*   The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed\n*   The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged\n\n**What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nCOPD includes two main types:\n\n*   **Emphysema**: affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.\n*   **Chronic bronchitis**, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.\n\nMost people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\n\n**What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nThe cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.\n\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\n\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD.\n\n**Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nThe risk factors for COPD include:\n\n*   Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.\n*   Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace\n*   Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\n*   Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\n*   Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD.\n\n**What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\n\n*   Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus\n*   Wheezing\n*   A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\n*   Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity\n*   Tightness in your chest\n\nSome people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.\n\n**How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n*   A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   A family history\n*   Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\n\nYour doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.\n\n**What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?**\n\nThere is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\n\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as\n    *   Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.\n    *   Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\n    *   Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\n*   Medicines, such as\n    *   Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.\n    *   Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases\n    *   Antibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infection\n    *   Oxygen therapy, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.\n    *   Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\n        *   An exercise program\n        *   Disease management training\n        *   Nutritional counseling\n        *   Psychological counseling\n*   Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines:\n    *   For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that:\n        *   Remove damaged lung tissue\n        *   Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.\n    *   For severe COPD, some people may need lung transplant\n\nIf you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.\n\n**Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented?**\n\nSince smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.\n\n---\n\n**COPD | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n**What is COPD?**\n\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.\n\nNormally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:\n\n*   The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic\n*   The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed\n*   The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed\n*   The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged\n\n**Types of COPD**\n\nCOPD includes two main types:\n\n*   Emphysema: affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.\n*   Chronic bronchitis: in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.\n\nMost people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\n\n**Causes of COPD**\n\nThe cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.\n\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\n\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD.\n\n**Risk Factors for COPD**\n\nThe risk factors for COPD include:\n\n*   Smoking\n*   Exposure to other inhaled irritants\n*   Genetic conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\n\n---\n\n**COPD | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n\\n\\n**What Causes COPD?**\n\nCOPD includes two main types:\n\n*   Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\n*   The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.\n\n\\n\\n**Risk Factors for COPD**\n\nThe risk factors for COPD include:\n\n*   Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.\n*   Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace\n*   Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\n*   Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of COPD**\n\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\n\n*   Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus\n*   Wheezing\n*   A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\n*   Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity\n*   Tightness in your chest\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosing COPD**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n*   A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   A family history\n*   Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\n\n\\n\\n**Treatments for COPD**\n\nThere is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\n\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.\n*   Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\n*   Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\n*   Medicines, such as bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler.

It's the third leading cause of death in the US and affects millions of people worldwide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of COPD are still not fully understood, but it's believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Smoking is the most significant risk factor for developing COPD, as it damages the lungs and makes them more susceptible to disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of COPD can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Coughing up mucus\n* Wheezing or difficulty breathing\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nCOPD is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as lung function tests. There is no cure for COPD, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. This may include medications to open airways, oxygen therapy, and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n* Blood gases\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - adults - discharge\n* COPD - control drugs\n* COPD - managing stress and your mood\n* COPD - quick-relief drugs\n* COPD - what to ask your doctor\n* COPD and other health problems\n* COPD flare-ups\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Asthma\n* Breathing Problems\n* Chronic Bronchitis\n* Emphysema\n* Oxygen Therapy\n* Pulmonary Rehabilitation",

    "content": "**COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA, Bivalent (Pfizer-BioNTech)**\n\n**What is COVID-19?**\n\nCOVID-19 disease is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predominantly a respiratory (lung) illness, but it can also affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness leading to death. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include:\n\n* fever\n* chills\n* cough\n* shortness of breath\n* fatigue\n* muscle or body aches\n* headache\n* loss of taste or smell\n* sore throat\n* congestion\n* runny nose\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* or diarrhea.\n\n**How is the COVID-19, mRNA, bivalent vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) given?**\n\nThe FDA has approved an EUA for the COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA, bivalent (Pfizer-BioNTech) for individuals 6 months of age or older who have not received any previous COVID-19 vaccine, to be given as:\n\n* a 3-dose series for individuals 6 months through 5 years given at 0, 3 weeks and then at least 8 weeks after the second dose\n* a single dose for individuals 5 through 64 years of age\n* a single dose for individuals 65 years of age and older with an additional dose 4 months or more later\n\nThe FDA has also approved an EUA for the COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA, bivalent (Pfizer-BioNTech) for individuals 6 months through 4 years of age who have previously been vaccinated against COVID-19 with COVID-19, mRNA, monovalent (Pfizer-BioNtech) (no longer authorized for use in the United States) to be given as one dose at least 3 weeks after the COVID-19, mRNA, monovalent dose followed by another dose at least 8 weeks later. If the individual had received more than 1 dose of the previous vaccine, at least two months should pass since the last dose before the COVID-19, mRNA, bivalent is given.\n\nThe FDA has also approved an EUA for the COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA, bivalent for individuals 5 years of age and older who have previously been vaccinated with 1 or more dose of any monovalent COVID-19 vaccine given as a single dose at least 2 months after their last dose of the monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. For individuals over 65 years of age, one additional dose may be given at least 4 months after the first dose of COVID-19, mRNA, bivalent vaccine.\n\n**What should I do about side effects?**\n\nTalk to your doctor or vaccine provider about the risks and benefits of receiving this medication.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA, Bivalent (Pfizer-BioNTech)**\n\n**What are the possible side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine?**\n\nSide effects that have been reported with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine include:\n\n*   non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face\n*   injection site pain, swelling, and redness\n*   tiredness\n*   headache\n*   muscle pain\n*   chills\n*   joint pain\n*   fever\n*   nausea\n*   feeling unwell\n*   swollen lymph nodes\n*   decreased appetite\n*   diarrhea\n*   vomiting\n*   arm pain\n*   fainting at the time you receive your injection\n\n**What are the rare but serious side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine?**\n\nThere is a remote chance that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include:\n\n*   difficulty breathing\n*   swelling of your face and throat\n*   a fast heartbeat\n*   a bad rash all over your body\n*   dizziness and weakness\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis have occurred in some people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days after getting the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low.\n\nYou should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine:\n\n*   chest pain\n*   shortness of breath\n*   feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\n---\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, seek medical attention immediately:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nThese may not be all the possible side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur.\n\n**Severe Allergic Reaction**\n\nThere is a remote chance that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Myocarditis and Pericarditis**\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis have occurred in some people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days after getting the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**What to Do About Side Effects**\n\nIf you experience any side effects, follow these steps:\n\n* If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital.\n* Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.\n* Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) by calling 1-800-822-7967 or reporting online at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. Please include the relevant information in the first line of box #18 of the report form.\n* You can also report side effects to Pfizer Inc. at http://www.pfizersafetyreporting.com or by calling 1-800-438-1985.\n\n**Immunocompromised Individuals**\n\nCertain children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years who are considered immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) may receive a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at least 1 month after the 3rd dose of either the monovalent or bivalent form of COVID-19, mRNA vaccine. For individuals 5 years of age and older considered immunocompromised, a single additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA, bivalent may be administered at least 2 months following the initial dose.\n\n**Will the Vaccine Give Me COVID-19?**\n\nNo. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain SARS-CoV-2 and cannot give you COVID-19.\n\n**Keep Your Vaccination Card**\n\nWhen you get your first dose, you will receive a vaccination card to show you when to return for your next dose(s) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Remember to bring your card when you return.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA, Bivalent (Pfizer-BioNTech)**\n\n**Where will my vaccination information be recorded?**\n\nThe vaccination provider may include your vaccination information in your state/local jurisdiction's Immunization Information System (IIS) or other designated system. This will ensure that you receive the same vaccine when you return for your next dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**How can I learn more?**\n\nYou can learn more by:\n\n* Asking the vaccination provider\n* Visiting CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\n* Visiting FDA at http://bit.ly/3qI0njF\n* Contacting your local or state public health department\n\n**Can I be charged an administration fee for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine?**\n\nNo. At this time, the provider cannot charge you for a vaccine dose and you cannot be charged an out-of-pocket vaccine administration fee or any other fee if only receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n**Where can I report cases of suspected fraud?**\n\nIndividuals becoming aware of any potential violations of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS or TIPS.HHS.GOV.\n\n**What is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program?**\n\nThe Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for costs of medical care and other specific expenses of certain people who have been seriously injured by certain medicines or vaccines, including this vaccine.

Antibodies are proteins produced by the body in response to harmful substances, such as viruses and bacteria. Antibodies may help protect you from getting infected again (immune).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\nThe blood sample will be sent to a laboratory for testing. The test can detect one or more types of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe COVID-19 antibody test is used for the following:\n\n* To see if you have COVID-19 antibodies, which indicates you had a past infection or vaccination.\n* To help diagnose multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare complication from COVID-19\n* To check the level of immunity within a population and estimate vaccine coverage\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe test is considered normal when it is negative. If you test negative, you likely have not had COVID-19 in the past.\n\nHowever, there are other reasons that may explain a negative test result:\n\n* If you have recently been infected with COVID-19, antibodies may not yet be present, so you can still test negative.\n* Some people infected with COVID-19 do not develop enough antibodies to be detected.\n* If infection occurred a long time ago, there may not be enough antibodies to detect.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe test is considered abnormal when it is positive. This means you have antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. A positive test suggests:\n\n* You may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n* You may have been infected with another virus from the same family of viruses (coronavirus). This is considered a false positive test for SARS-CoV-2.\n* Because people vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 commonly have positive antibody tests to the S (spike) protein, a positive antibody test does not always mean you were infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nYou may or may not have had symptoms at the time of the infection.\n\nA positive result does not mean that you are immune to COVID-19. It is not certain if having these antibodies means that you are protected from future infections, or for how long the protection might last. Talk with your provider about what your test results mean.\n\nIf you tested positive and you have symptoms of COVID-19, you may need a diagnostic test to confirm an active infection with SARS-CoV-2.

    "content": "**COVID-19 Symptoms**\n\nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Cough\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle aches\n* Headache\n* Loss of sense of taste or smell\n* Sore throat\n* Stuffy or runny nose\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n\nThis is not a complete list of possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new variants of the virus.\n\nSome people may have no symptoms at all. Many have only some, but not all of the symptoms. Symptoms can also vary, depending on whether you are vaccinated.\n\n**Development of Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may develop within 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Most often, symptoms appear around 5 days after exposure. However, you can spread the virus even when you do not have symptoms.\n\n**Severe Symptoms**\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Chest pain or pressure that persists\n* Confusion\n* Inability to wake up\n* Blue, gray, or pale skin, lips, face, or nail beds, depending on your skin tone\n\nOlder people and people with certain existing health conditions have a higher risk of developing severe illness and death. Health conditions that increase your risk include cancer, COPD, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, a weak immune system (immunocompromised), and many others.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSome symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the common cold and the flu, so it can be hard to know for sure if you have the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But COVID-19 is not a cold, and it is not a flu.\n\nThe only way to know if you have COVID-19 is to be tested. If you want to be tested, you should contact your health care provider or use a home diagnostic test.\n\nMost people with the illness have mild to moderate symptoms and recover fully. Whether you get tested or not, if you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should avoid contact with other people so you don't spread the illness.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can affect people and animals. They can cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf you have COVID-19 or think you have it, stay at home and avoid contact with other people, both inside and outside your home, to avoid spreading the illness. You should do this right away and not wait for any COVID-19 testing.\n\nTo help treat the symptoms of COVID-19, the following tips may help:\n\n* Rest and drink plenty of fluids.\n* Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever. Sometimes, providers advise you to use both types of medicine. Take the recommended amount to reduce fever. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.\n* A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. Keep taking medicine -- otherwise your temperature might go back up.\n* If you have a dry, tickling cough, try cough drops or hard candy.\n* Use a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to increase moisture in the air and help soothe a dry throat and cough.\n* Do not smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nYou should contact your provider right away:\n\n* If you have symptoms and think you may have COVID-19\n* If you have COVID-19 and you are in a group for whom antiviral medicine may be given\n* If you have COVID-19 and your symptoms are getting worse\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Chest pain or pressure that persists\n* Confusion or inability to wake up\n* Blue, gray, or pale skin, lips, face, or nail beds\n* Any other symptoms that are severe or that concern you\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Symptoms**\n\nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Cough\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle aches\n* Headache\n* Loss of sense of taste or smell\n* Sore throat\n* Stuffy or runny nose\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n\nThis is not a complete list of possible symptoms.

Health conditions that increase your risk include cancer, COPD, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, a weak immune system (immunocompromised), and many others.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSome symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the common cold and the flu, so it can be hard to know for sure if you have the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But COVID-19 is not a cold, and it is not a flu.\n\nThe only way to know if you have COVID-19 is to be tested. If you want to be tested, you should contact your health care provider or use a home diagnostic test.\n\nMost people with the illness have mild to moderate symptoms and recover fully. Whether you get tested or not, if you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should avoid contact with other people so you don't spread the illness.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Symptoms**\n\n**Causes of COVID-19**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can affect people and animals. They can cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses.\n\nCOVID-19 spreads to people within close contact (about 6 feet or 2 meters). When someone with the illness coughs or sneezes, infectious droplets spray into the air. You can catch the illness if you breathe in or touch these particles and then touch your face, nose, mouth, or eyes.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf you have COVID-19 or think you have it, stay at home and avoid contact with other people, both inside and outside your home, to avoid spreading the illness. You should do this right away and not wait for any COVID-19 testing.\n\nTo help treat the symptoms of COVID-19, the following tips may help:\n\n* Rest and drink plenty of fluids.\n* Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever. Sometimes, providers advise you to use both types of medicine. Take the recommended amount to reduce fever. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.\n* A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. Keep taking medicine -- otherwise your temperature might go back up.\n* If you have a dry, tickling cough, try cough drops or hard candy.\n* Use a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to increase moisture in the air and help soothe a dry throat and cough.\n* Do not smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nYou should contact your provider right away:\n\n* If you have symptoms and think you may have COVID-19\n* If you have COVID-19 and you are in a group for whom antiviral medicine may be given\n* If you have COVID-19 and your symptoms are getting worse\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Chest pain or pressure that persists\n* Confusion or inability to wake up\n* Blue, gray, or pale skin, lips, face, or nail beds\n* Any other symptoms that are severe or that concern you\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will ask about your symptoms, any recent travel, and any possible exposure to COVID-19. Your provider may take swab samples from the back of your nose and throat.\n\nIf your symptoms do not indicate a medical emergency, you can recover at home.\n\nFor more serious symptoms, you may need to go to the hospital for care.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCoronavirus novel 2019 - symptoms; 2019 Novel coronavirus - symptoms; SARS-Co-V2 - symptoms\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Symptoms**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of COVID-19**\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common symptoms of COVID-19 include:\n\n*   **Coughing**: A persistent cough is one of the most noticeable symptoms of COVID-19.\n*   **Thermometer temperature**: Fever, which can range from mild to severe, is another hallmark symptom of the disease.\n*   **Respiratory system**: Inflammation and damage to the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system are common in people with COVID-19.\n*   **Upper respiratory tract**: The upper respiratory tract, including the nose, throat, and sinuses, can also be affected by the virus.\n\n**Testing for COVID-19**\n\nThe CDC recommends that individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 undergo testing to determine whether they have contracted the disease. Testing can help identify cases early on, allowing for prompt treatment and reducing the risk of transmission to others.\n\n**Types of COVID-19 Treatment**\n\nThere are several types of treatment available for people with COVID-19, including:\n\n*   **Antiviral medications**: These medications can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.\n*   **Supportive care**: This type of care focuses on managing symptoms and supporting the body's natural recovery processes.\n\n**Review Date**\n\nThis article was last reviewed on February 22, 2023.",

    "content": "**COVID-19 Vaccines - What to Expect**\n\n**Before You Get the Vaccine**\n\nIf you take any medicines, keep taking them as you usually do. If you take medicines that affect the immune system, talk with your provider to find out if getting the COVID-19 vaccine will work or cause any problems for you.\n\nYou should not take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen to help prevent side effects before you get the vaccine. It is not known if these medicines will affect how well the vaccine works. However, if you take these medicines regularly for other reasons, you can take them as you always do.\n\nYou should also not take antihistamines to help prevent an allergic reaction before you get the vaccine.\n\nIf you have any questions about your medicines, ask your provider or the vaccine provider.\n\n**During Your Vaccine Appointment**\n\nAt your appointment, the vaccine provider will tell you if you need to stay at the site afterwards for any needed monitoring. You should receive a vaccination card (or access to a vaccine record website) that tells you what vaccine you received and the date and location you received it.

This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your body is making antibodies against the virus.\n\nCommon side effects include:\n\n*   Pain, redness, and swelling on the arm where you got the shot\n*   Tiredness\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Chills\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n\nSome people get a red, itchy, swollen, painful rash in the arm where they got the shot. This is known as COVID arm. This can occur days after getting the first shot. You should still get your second shot if you got a 2-dose vaccine. You can ask to have it in the other arm.\n\nTo help relieve side effects, you should:\n\n*   Move the arm where you got the shot often during the day\n*   Apply a clean, cool washcloth to ease swelling and discomfort\n*   Drink plenty of fluids\n*   Dress lightly if you have a fever\n\nNote that the side effects from the second dose may be more intense than those from the first shot. Symptoms from the shot may make you feel bad enough that you need to take time off from work or daily activities, but they should go away within a few days. Even if you do have side effects, it is still important to get the second shot. The risks of any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19.\n\nYou may be instructed by the vaccine provider that you can take an antihistamine or acetaminophen or another OTC medicine such as ibuprofen or aspirin to help relieve any vaccine side effects. Or, talk with your provider about taking OTC medicine if you are not sure.\n\nIf symptoms do not go away in a few days, or if you have any concerns, you should contact your provider.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn rare cases, people have had severe and non-severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If you have a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after getting the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second shot. Talk with your provider to see if there are other options.\n\nIf you think you are having a severe reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine after leaving the vaccination site, you should call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Symptoms of severe allergic reaction appearing in the first 4 hours after receiving the vaccine include:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds\n*   Swelling of the face, eyes, tongue, or throat\n*   Hives, itchiness, redness of the skin\n*   Lowering of blood pressure\n\nSymptoms of severe reactions may also include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Chest discomfort or tightness\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Palpitations\n*   Slurred speech\n*   Unconsciousness\n\nIf you notice any unusual or concerning symptoms, seek medical care right away.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis reaction has tended to occur more often in male adolescents and young adults ages 12 to 39 years. However, it also has occurred in females, in other age groups, after other doses, and after receiving the Novavax vaccine.\n\nIt occurs more often after the second dose, most often within 7 days after vaccination. Studies show that this rare risk may be reduced by waiting 8 weeks between the first and second dose.\n\nWith proper care and rest, most people who had the reaction got better quickly without any lasting effects.\n\nFor people who had this rare reaction, it is important to talk with a cardiologist (heart doctor) about how and when to return to exercise and sports.\n\nSymptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include:\n\n*   Chest pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fast-beating heart, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\n\nAll these associations are so rare that they should not cause hesitation in receiving any of these vaccines.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccination**\n\nAdults and children ages 6 months and older should get the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n**What to Expect Before You Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways to sign up for a vaccine:\n\n*   Ask your health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines.\n*   Check your local pharmacy's website or call the pharmacy to see if vaccination appointments are available.\n*   Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in the area.\n*   Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website Vaccines.gov to find out where to get a vaccine in your area.\n\n**Medications Before Getting the Vaccine**\n\nIf you take any medicines, you should keep taking them as you usually do. If you take medicines that affect the immune system, talk with your provider to find out if getting the COVID-19 vaccine will work or cause any problems for you.\n\nYou should not take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen to help prevent side effects before you get the vaccine. It is not known if these medicines will affect how well the vaccine works. However, if you take these medicines regularly for other reasons, you can take them as you always do.\n\nYou should also not take antihistamines to help prevent an allergic reaction before you get the vaccine.\n\nIf you have any questions about your medicines, ask your provider or the vaccine provider.\n\n**During Your Vaccine Appointment**\n\nAt your appointment, the vaccine provider will tell you if you need to stay at the site afterwards for any needed monitoring. You should receive a vaccination card (or access to a vaccine record website) that tells you what vaccine you received and the date and location you received it. Be sure to keep this information in case it’s needed for future use.\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make you sick with COVID-19, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms.

    "content": "**COVID-19 Vaccines for Children Ages 6 Months and Older**\n\n**Information**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines protect people from getting COVID-19. These vaccines \"teach\" your child's body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\n\n**Why Children and Teens Should Get Vaccinated**\n\nIt's true that most children and teens are at lower risk from becoming very sick from COVID-19. But low risk does not mean no risk. Children and teens can:\n\n* Become infected with COVID-19\n* Become seriously ill from COVID-19 and need to be hospitalized\n* Have serious short- and long-term effects or complications from COVID-19\n* Die from COVID-19, although this is very rare\n* Spread COVID-19 to others, including those at risk for serious illness, such as grandparents\n\nChildren with underlying medical conditions are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. So, vaccination is very important to help protect against the virus.\n\nThere are many good reasons to have your child or teen get a COVID-19 vaccination:\n\n* It will protect your child from serious illness if they do get COVID-19.\n* It will protect other people in the family at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.\n\nIt is a safer way to build protection than from getting COVID-19.\n\n**About COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines for Children and Teens**\n\nThere are two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the United States, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nChildren ages 6 months to 17 years can get either the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell cells in the body how to briefly create a harmless piece of \"spike\" protein that is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Cells then get rid of the mRNA.\nThis \"spike\" protein triggers an immune response inside the body, making antibodies that protect against COVID-19. Your child's immune system then learns to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if they are ever exposed to it.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine given to children and teens has the same active ingredients as the vaccine given to adults. Dosage is based on the child's age on the day of vaccination. It is not based on the child's size or weight.\n\n**Subunit Vaccine**\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the \"spike\" protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect you from the virus. The 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine also protects against current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n**Vaccination Schedule**\n\nYour child's vaccination schedule is based on age and vaccination history.\n\nChildren ages 6 months to 4 years who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Moderna vaccine or 3 doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n\nChildren ages 12 and older have never received a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine.\n\nChildren who have had a COVID-19 vaccine before can have the following shots:\n\n* Children ages 6 months to 4 years who got 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n* Children ages 6 months to 4 years who got 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, should get 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n* Children ages 6 months to 4 years who got 1 or more doses of the Moderna vaccine, should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n* Children ages 12 and older who have had a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine.\n\nRegardless of vaccination history, to be up to date on their shots\n\nChildren ages 5 to 11 years should receive 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the 2024-2025 Moderna vaccine.\nChildren ages 12 years and older should receive 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the 2024-2025 Moderna vaccine.\nChildren ages 12 and older who have had a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine. If they have never had a COVID-19 vaccine before, they should get 2 doses of the Novavax vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Myths**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\n\n* DO NOT contain any live virus, and they cannot give children COVID-19\n* DO NOT affect or interfere with children's genes (DNA)\n* DO NOT affect or interfere with fertility or future fertility in children\n\nTo get up-to-date accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html\nMyths & facts about COVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make children sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your child's body is making antibodies against the virus. Common side effects include:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling on the arm (or leg up to age 3) where they got the shot\n* Tiredness\n* Headache\n* Muscle pain\n* Chills\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nSome side effects from the shot may affect your child's ability to do daily activities, but any side effects will go away in a few days. Even if your child has side effects, they should get the second shot if needed. Any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19.\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways to find vaccination providers near you.\n\n* Ask your child's health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines for children and teens.\n* Check your local pharmacy's website or call them to see if they offer vaccines for children and teens.\n* Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in the area.\n* Go to the CDC website Vaccines.gov.\n* Check the CDC's Vaccines for Children (VFC) program that provides no-cost vaccines to American Indian, Alaska Native, Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, and underinsured children.\n\nLearn what to expect when you get your COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines for children have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis reaction has tended to occur more often in male adolescents and young adults ages 12 to 39 years. However, it also has occurred in females, in other age groups, after other doses, and after receiving the Novavax vaccine.\nIt occurs more often after getting a second dose, usually within 7 days after vaccination. Studies show that this rare risk may be reduced by waiting 8 weeks between the first and second dose.\nWith proper care and rest, most people who had the reaction got better quickly without any lasting effects.\nFor people who had this rare reaction, it is important to talk with a cardiologist (heart doctor) about how and when to return to exercise and sports.\n\nSymptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fast-beating heart, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines for Children Ages 6 Months and Older**\n\n**Information**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines protect people from getting COVID-19.

Any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19.\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways to find vaccination providers near you.\n\n* Ask your child's health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines for children and teens.\n* Check your local pharmacy's website or call them to see if they offer vaccines for children and teens.\n* Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in the area.\n* Go to the CDC website Vaccines.gov.\n* Check the CDC's Vaccines for Children (VFC) program that provides no-cost vaccines to American Indian, Alaska Native, Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, and underinsured children.\n\nLearn what to expect when you get your COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines for children have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines for Children Ages 6 Months and Older**\n\n**Protecting Your Child Against COVID-19**\n\nAs a parent, it's natural to have concerns about vaccinating your child against COVID-19. But the truth is, low risk does not mean no risk. Children and teens can become infected with COVID-19, become seriously ill from COVID-19, and even die from COVID-19, although this is very rare.\n\n**Why Children and Teens Should Get Vaccinated**\n\nThere are many good reasons to have your child or teen get a COVID-19 vaccination:\n\n*   It will protect your child from serious illness if they do get COVID-19.\n*   It will protect other people in the family at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.\n*   It is a safer way to build protection than from getting COVID-19.\n\n**About COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines for Children and Teens**\n\nThere are two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the United States, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n*   Children ages 6 months to 17 years can get either the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine.\n*   The COVID-19 vaccine given to children and teens has the same active ingredients as the vaccine given to adults. Dosage is based on the child's age on the day of vaccination.\n\n**Subunit Vaccine**\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine that includes harmless pieces of the \"spike\" protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect against the virus.\n\n**Vaccination Schedule**\n\nYour child's vaccination schedule is based on age and vaccination history.\n\n*   Children ages 6 months to 4 years who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Moderna vaccine or 3 doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n*   Children ages 12 and older have never received a COVID-19 vaccine before can have 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Myths**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\n\n*   DO NOT contain any live virus, and they cannot give children COVID-19\n*   DO NOT affect or interfere with children's genes (DNA)\n*   DO NOT affect or interfere with fertility or future fertility in children\n\nTo get up-to-date accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website:\n\n*   COVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html\n*   Myths & facts about COVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines for Children Ages 6 Months and Older**\n\n**Why Children and Teens Should Get Vaccinated**\n\nIt's true that most children and teens are at lower risk from becoming very sick from COVID-19. But low risk does not mean no risk. Children and teens can:\n\n* Become infected with COVID-19\n* Become seriously ill from COVID-19 and need to be hospitalized\n* Have serious short- and long-term effects or complications from COVID-19\n* Die from COVID-19, although this is very rare\n* Spread COVID-19 to others, including those at risk for serious illness, such as grandparents\n\nChildren with underlying medical conditions are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. So, vaccination is very important to help protect against the virus.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines for children have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis reaction has tended to occur more often in male adolescents and young adults ages 12 to 39 years. However, it also has occurred in females, in other age groups, after other doses, and after receiving the Novavax vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make children sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your child's body is making antibodies against the virus. Common side effects include:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling on the arm (or leg up to age 3) where they got the shot\n* Tiredness\n* Headache\n* Muscle pain\n* Chills\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nSome side effects from the shot may affect your child's ability to do daily activities, but any side effects will go away in a few days.

You should get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine even if:\n\n* You have already had COVID-19\n* You previously have been vaccinated with earlier versions of the vaccine\n\n**How COVID-19 Vaccines Work**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines protect people from getting COVID-19 and from getting more severe symptoms if they do get COVID-19. These vaccines \"teach\" your body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been shown to do a very good job of:\n\n* Preventing infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19\n* Protecting against serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19\n* Reducing the risk of people spreading COVID-19\n\n**mRNA Vaccines**\n\nThe mRNA vaccines approved in the United States work differently from many other vaccines.\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell cells in the body how to briefly create a harmless piece of \"spike\" protein that is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Cells then get rid of the mRNA.\nThis \"spike\" protein triggers an immune response inside your body, making antibodies that protect against COVID-19. Your immune system then learns to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are ever exposed to it.\nThere are two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the United States, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is given as an injection (shot) in the arm. The 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n**Subunit Vaccine**\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the \"spike\" protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect you from the virus. The 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine also protects against current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n**Vaccination Schedule**\n\nThe vaccination schedule is based on your age, vaccination history, and whether you are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n\n* Children ages 6 months to 4 years may need multiple doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, depending on their COVID-19 vaccination history. Talk with your provider about what is right for your child.\n* Children ages 5 to 11 years should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to protect against serious illness from COVID-19.\n* People ages 12 to 64 years should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. You also have the option to get the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine. You will get 1 dose of the vaccine unless you have never received any COVID-19 vaccine before. In that case, you will need 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccines to be up to date.\n* People ages 65 years and older should get 2 doses of any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine 6 months apart. You may get 2 doses 2 months apart if needed for travel, health care visits, prior to COVID-19 surges or for other life events. If you have not had a COVID-19 vaccine before and are getting Novavax you may need additional doses.\n* People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines. Talk with your health care provider about additional doses.\n\n**Vaccine Myths**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\n\n* DO NOT contain any live virus, and they cannot give you COVID-19\n* DO NOT affect or interfere with your genes (DNA)\n* DO NOT affect or interfere with pregnancy, nor do they make you infertile\n\nTo get up-to-date accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html\nMyths & facts about COVID-19 vaccines - www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make you sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your body is making antibodies against the virus.\n\nSide effects can vary from person to person. Common side effects include:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling on the arm where you got the shot\n* Tiredness\n* Headache\n* Muscle pain\n* Chills\n* Fever\n* Nausea\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nSome side effects from the shot may affect your ability to do daily activities, but any side effects will go away in a few days. Any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19.\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways you can look for vaccination providers near you.\n\n* Ask your health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines.\n* Check your local pharmacy's website or call the pharmacy to see if vaccination appointments are available.\n* Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in your area.\n* Go to the CDC website Vaccines.gov.\n\nLearn what to expect when you get your COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. Millions of people have received the vaccine, and no long-term side effects have been reported. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nThere have been reports of some people who have had an allergic reaction to the current vaccines. So it is important to follow certain precautions:\n\n* If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a particular type of COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that vaccine. You may be able to get another type of COVID-19 vaccine.\n* If you have a non-severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, you may be able to get another dose in some cases. Your provider may refer you to an allergy and immunology provider for care.\n* If you only had a skin rash on the arm you got the shot (COVID arm), you should still get additional shots.\n\nIf you have had an allergic reaction, even if not severe, to other vaccines or injectable therapies, you should ask your provider if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your provider will help you decide if it is safe to get vaccinated.\n\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare. Adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis reaction has tended to occur more often in male adolescents and young adults ages 12 to 39 years. However, it has also occurred in females, in other age groups, after other doses, and after receiving the Novavax vaccine.\n\nIt occurs more often after getting a second dose, most often within 7 days after vaccination. Studies show that this rare risk may be reduced by waiting 8 weeks between the first and second dose.\nWith proper care and rest, most people who had the reaction got better quickly without any lasting effects.\nFor people who had this rare reaction, it is important to talk with a cardiologist (heart doctor) about how and when to return to exercise and sports.\n\nSymptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fast-beating heart, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\nEveryone ages 6 months and older should get a 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.

But with so many myths and misconceptions floating around, it's essential to separate fact from fiction.\n\n**How COVID-19 Vaccines Work**\n\nSo, how do these vaccines work? Simply put, they \"teach\" your body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The mRNA vaccine, for example, uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell cells in the body how to briefly create a harmless piece of \"spike\" protein that is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Here's a breakdown of the recommended vaccination schedule:\n\n* Children ages 6 months to 4 years: multiple doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines\n* Children ages 5 to 11 years: 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine\n* People ages 12 to 64 years: 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (or 2 doses of the Novavax vaccine if you've never received any COVID-19 vaccine before)\n* People ages 65 years and older: 2 doses of any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine 6 months apart\n* People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised: additional doses may be recommended\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines won't make you sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. These symptoms are a sign that your body is making antibodies against the virus. Common side effects include:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling on the arm where you got the shot\n* Tiredness\n* Headache\n* Muscle pain\n* Chills\n* Fever\n* Nausea\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways to look for vaccination providers near you:\n\n* Ask your health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines\n* Check your local pharmacy's website or call the pharmacy to see if vaccination appointments are available\n* Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in your area\n* Go to the CDC website Vaccines.gov\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. Millions of people have received the vaccine, and no long-term side effects have been reported. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. However, these associations are so rare that they should not cause hesitation in receiving any of these vaccines.\n\n**Get Vaccinated Today!**\n\nDon't wait – get vaccinated today and protect yourself and your loved ones from the deadly COVID-19 virus.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\n\\n\\n**How COVID-19 Vaccines Work**\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is given as an injection (shot) in the arm. The 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n**SUBUNIT VACCINE**\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the \"spike\" protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect you from the virus. The 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine also protects against current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n**VACCINATION SCHEDULE**\n\nThe vaccination schedule is based on your age, vaccination history, and whether you are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n\n*   Children ages 6 months to 4 years may need multiple doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, depending on their COVID-19 vaccination history. Talk with your provider about what is right for your child.\n*   Children ages 5 to 11 years should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to protect against serious illness from COVID-19.\n*   People ages 12 to 64 years should get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. You also have the option to get the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine. You will get 1 dose of the vaccine unless you have never received any COVID-19 vaccine before. In that case, you will need 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccines to be up to date.\n*   People ages 65 years and older should get 2 doses of any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine 6 months apart. You may get 2 doses 2 months apart if needed for travel, health care visits, prior to COVID-19 surges or for other life events. If you have not had a COVID-19 vaccine before and are getting Novavax you may need additional doses.\n*   People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines. Talk with your health care provider about additional doses.\n\n**Vaccine Myths**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\n\n*   **DO NOT** contain any live virus, and they cannot give you COVID-19\n*   **DO NOT** affect or interfere with your genes (DNA)\n*   **DO NOT** affect or interfere with pregnancy, nor do they make you infertile\n\n**Vaccine Side Effects**\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make you sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your body is making antibodies against the virus.\n\nSide effects can vary from person to person. Common side effects include:\n\n*   Pain, redness, or swelling on the arm where you got the shot\n*   Tiredness\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Chills\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n\nSome side effects from the shot may affect your ability to do daily activities, but any side effects will go away in a few days. Any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19.\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways you can look for vaccination providers near you.\n\n*   Ask your health care provider if they offer COVID-19 vaccines.\n*   Check your local pharmacy's website or call the pharmacy to see if vaccination appointments are available.\n*   Contact your state or local health department to find additional vaccination locations in your area.\n*   Go to the CDC website Vaccines.gov.\n\nLearn what to expect when you get your COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. Millions of people have received the vaccine, and no long-term side effects have been reported. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nThere have been reports of some people who have had an allergic reaction to the current vaccines. So it is important to follow certain precautions:\n\n*   If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a particular type of COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that vaccine. You may be able to get another type of COVID-19 vaccine.\n*   If you have a non-severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, you may be able to get another dose in some cases. Your provider may refer you to an allergy and immunology provider for care.\n*   If you only had a skin rash on the arm you got the shot (COVID arm), you should still get additional shots.\n\nIf you have had an allergic reaction, even if not severe, to other vaccines or injectable therapies, you should ask your provider if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your provider will help you decide if it is safe to get vaccinated.\n\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare. Adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare.\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis reaction has tended to occur more often in male adolescents and young adults ages 12 to 39 years. However, it has also occurred in females, in other age groups, after other doses, and after receiving the Novavax vaccine.\n\nIt occurs more often after getting a second dose, most often within 7 days after vaccination. Studies show that this rare risk may be reduced by waiting 8 weeks between the first and second dose.\n\nWith proper care and rest, most people who had the reaction got better quickly without any lasting effects.\n\nFor people who had this rare reaction, it is important to talk with a cardiologist (heart doctor) about how and when to return to exercise and sports.\n\nSymptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include:\n\n*   Chest pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fast-beating heart, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\n\nAll these associations are so rare that they should not cause hesitation in receiving any of these vaccines.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\n**How COVID-19 Vaccines Work**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines protect people from getting COVID-19 and from getting more severe symptoms if they do get COVID-19. These vaccines \"teach\" your body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\n\n**Types of COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\n*   **mRNA VACCINES**: The mRNA vaccines approved in the United States work differently from many other vaccines.\n*   **SUBUNIT VACCINE**: The Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the \"spike\" protein that causes COVID-19.\n\n**Vaccination Schedule**\n\nThe vaccination schedule is based on your age, vaccination history, and whether you are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n\n**People Who Recently Had COVID-19**\n\nYou may delay getting a COVID-19 vaccine for 3 months if you recently had COVID-19. You are much less likely to get COVID-19 in the weeks and months after having the illness.\n\n**Vaccine Myths**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\n\n*   Will not make you sick\n*   May cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms, which are normal\n*   Are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19\n\n**How to Get the Vaccine**\n\nThere are several ways you can look for vaccination providers near you.\n\n**Vaccine Safety**\n\nThe safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. Millions of people have received the vaccine, and no long-term side effects have been reported. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\n**Rare Cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis**\n\nRare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n**Symptoms to Watch For**\n\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away:\n\n*   Chest pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Feeling weak or tired\n\nAll these associations are so rare that they should not cause hesitation in receiving any of these vaccines.\n\n**CDC Recommendations**\n\nThe CDC recommends that people may still get vaccinated if they have a history of:\n\n*   Severe allergic reactions NOT related to vaccines or injectable medicines -- such as food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies\n*   Allergies to oral medicines or a family history of severe allergic reactions\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Benefits of Getting Vaccinated**\n    *   Get vaccinated to protect yourself and others from getting severely ill with COVID-19.\n    *   COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19.\n    *   COVID-19 vaccines also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities.\n*   **Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine Safety**\n    *   COVID-19 vaccines have been extensively tested for safety and effectiveness before being licensed for use.\n    *   Serious side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are rare, but may include allergic reactions, blood clots, or Guillain-Barré Syndrome.\n    *   If you experience any unusual symptoms after getting vaccinated, seek medical attention immediately.\n*   **COVID-19 Vaccination for People Who Would Like to Have a Baby**\n    *   Pregnant women can get vaccinated against COVID-19 during any trimester of pregnancy.\n    *   COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19 in pregnant women.\n    *   If you're planning to have a baby, talk to your healthcare provider about getting vaccinated against COVID-19.\n*   **Myths & Facts About COVID-19 Vaccines**\n    *   Myth: COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips or other tracking devices.\n        Fact: This is false. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any tracking devices.\n    *   Myth: COVID-19 vaccines cause blood clots or other serious side effects.\n        Fact: Serious side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are rare, but may include allergic reactions, blood clots, or Guillain-Barré Syndrome.\n*   **Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines**\n    *   Get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available in your area.\n    *   Stay up to date on recommended COVID-19 vaccines by following guidance from local health authorities or healthcare providers.\n*   **Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States**\n    *   COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the US and can be obtained through various channels, including healthcare providers, pharmacies, and community clinics.\n    *   Follow guidance from local health authorities or healthcare providers to determine which COVID-19 vaccine is right for you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review Date:** 2/22/2023\n\n**Updated by:** Frank D.

    "content": "**COVID-19 Virus Test**\n\nThe COVID-19 virus test is used to diagnose COVID-19 by detecting the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a mucus sample from your upper respiratory tract.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are two types of tests:\n\n*   **Nasopharyngeal Test**: You will be asked to cough before the test begins and then tilt your head back slightly. A sterile, cotton-tipped swab is gently passed through a nostril and into the nasopharynx. The swab is left in place for several seconds, rotated, and removed.\n*   **Anterior Nasal Test**: The swab will be inserted into your nostril no more than 3/4 of an inch (2 centimeters). The swab will be rotated at least 4 times while pressing against the inside of your nostril.\n\n**Types of Virus Tests**\n\nThere are two types of virus tests available that can diagnose COVID-19:\n\n*   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Tests**: Detect the genetic material of the virus that causes COVID-19. The samples are usually sent to a laboratory for testing, and results are usually available in 1 to 3 days.\n*   **Antigen Tests**: Detect specific proteins on the virus that causes COVID-19. Antigen tests are rapid diagnostic tests, which means results are available in several minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive test means that you are infected with SARS-CoV-2. You may or may not have symptoms of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Whether you have symptoms or not, you can still spread the illness to others.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Virus Test**\n\nThe COVID-19 virus test is a diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\n\n**Types of Tests**\n\nThere are two main types of tests available:\n\n*   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Tests**: These tests detect the genetic material of the virus and are usually sent to a laboratory for testing. Results are typically available in 1 to 3 days.\n*   **Antigen Tests**: These rapid diagnostic tests detect specific proteins on the virus and provide results in several minutes.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test involves taking a mucus sample from your upper respiratory tract using a nasal swab. There are two methods:\n\n*   **Nasopharyngeal Test**: You will be asked to cough before the test begins, then tilt your head back slightly. A sterile, cotton-tipped swab is gently passed through a nostril and into the nasopharynx.\n*   **Anterior Nasal Test**: The swab is inserted into your nostril no more than 3/4 of an inch (2 centimeters) and rotated at least 4 times while pressing against the inside of your nostril.\n\n**At-Home Testing Kits**\n\nSelf-tests are available over-the-counter, allowing you to collect a sample using a nasal swab and receive results at home in minutes. Be sure to follow the instructions provided with the kit.\n\n**Accuracy and Reliability**\n\nRapid diagnostic tests, including antigen tests, are less accurate than PCR tests. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and receive a negative result on a rapid test, your provider may recommend a non-rapid PCR test for confirmation.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA negative test indicates that, at the time of testing, you likely did not have the virus in your respiratory tract. However, this does not rule out infection, as the test may be negative if taken too early after exposure or if you are exposed to the virus after testing.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nA positive test means you are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and should take precautions to prevent spreading the illness to others. Stay home until your symptoms improve, and continue to take precautions for 5 days after recovery.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Virus Test**\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nDepending on the type of test, you may have slight or moderate discomfort, your eyes may water, and you may gag.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test identifies the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which causes COVID-19.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe test is considered normal when it is negative. A negative test means that at the time you were tested, you probably didn't have the virus that causes COVID-19 in your respiratory tract. But you can test negative if you were tested too early after infection for COVID-19 to be detected. And you can have a positive test later if you are exposed to the virus after you were tested. Also, rapid diagnostic tests of any kind are less accurate than the regular PCR test, and either test may remain positive for weeks after you've recovered from the illness.\n\nFor this reason, if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you are at risk for contracting COVID-19 and your first test result was negative, your provider may recommend being retested at a later time. A single negative self-test will not rule out infection. If you used a self-test, you should take at least one more test again in 48 hours. Take a third test 48 hours after the second test if you don’t have symptoms. Or, your provider may recommend a PCR test to confirm your results.\n\n**Types of Virus Tests**\n\nThere are two types of virus tests available that can diagnose COVID-19:\n\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests (also called Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests [NAATs]) detect the genetic material of the virus that causes COVID-19. The samples are usually sent to a laboratory for testing, and results are usually available in 1 to 3 days.\n* Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the virus that causes COVID-19. Antigen tests are rapid diagnostic tests, which means results are available in several minutes.\n\n**How Tests Are Done**\n\nTests may be done by a health care provider at an office, drive-through, or walk-up location. Check with your local health department to find out where testing is available in your area.\n\nAt-home testing kits (self-tests) are available over-the-counter. Most kits have you collect a sample using a nasal swab, and you can get results at home in minutes. Be sure to follow the instructions that come with the kit.\n\n**Types of Nasal Swab Tests**\n\nThere are two types of nasal swab tests:\n\n* Anterior nasal test: The swab will be inserted into your nostril no more than 3/4 of an inch (2 centimeters). The swab will be rotated at least 4 times while pressing against the inside of your nostril. The same swab will be used to collect samples from both nostrils.\n* Nasopharyngeal test: You will be asked to cough before the test begins and then tilt your head back slightly. A sterile, cotton-tipped swab is gently passed through a nostril and into the nasopharynx. This is the uppermost part of the throat, behind the nose. The swab is left in place for several seconds, rotated, and removed. This same procedure may be done on your other nostril.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results mean that you have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which causes COVID-19. If you receive an abnormal result, your provider will discuss the next steps for treatment and care.\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Virus Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What to Do If Your Test Is Positive**\n\nIf your test is positive, it means you are infected with SARS-CoV-2. You may or may not have symptoms of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Whether you have symptoms or not, you can still spread the illness to others.\n\n\\n\\n**Stay Home and Take Precautions**\n\nYou should stay at home away from others until your symptoms are better, and you are free of fever for at least 24 hours (without taking fever-reducing medicine). Continue to take precautions for another 5 days to protect others from developing COVID-19.\n\n\\n\\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   **COVID-19 - Nasopharyngeal swab**\n*   **SARS CoV-2 test**\n*   **COVID-19 PCR test**\n\n\\n\\n**Images**\n\n    *   **COVID-19**\n    *   **Respiratory system**\n    *   **Upper respiratory tract**\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**COVID-19 – What to Do When You Are Sick**\n\nStaying at home when you have COVID-19 helps protect other people who are not infected with the virus. You should stay at home and away from other people until it is safe to be around others.\n\n**How to Isolate from Other People**\n\n* Even if you have been vaccinated, you should stay at home and away from others inside and outside your home if you have symptoms of COVID-19, with or without a positive test.\n* These are important steps you can take to help prevent spreading COVID-19.\n\n**Self-Care While Isolated**\n\n* Stay in a specific room and away from others in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.\n* Do not leave your home except to get medical care.\n* Avoid traveling while sick. If you need to travel while sick, wear a mask to prevent spreading the virus to others.\n* Take care of yourself by getting plenty of rest, taking over-the-counter medicines for specific symptoms, and staying hydrated.\n\n**Monitoring Symptoms**\n\n* Keep track of your symptoms (such as a fever >100.4°F or >38°C, cough, shortness of breath). You may receive instructions from your health care provider on how to check and report your symptoms.\n* Ask your provider if you are eligible for treatment with antiviral medicines (such as Paxlovid).\n\n**Visiting Your Provider**\n\n* Use a well-fitting face mask or respirator that fits well over your nose and mouth without gaps when you see your provider and anytime other people are in the same room with you.\n* If you can't wear a mask, for example, due to breathing problems, people in your home should wear a mask if they need to be in the same room with you.\n\n**Preventing Spread**\n\n* Avoid contact with pets or other animals. While rare, SARS-CoV-2 can spread from people to animals.\n* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n* Wash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds.\n* Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n* Do not share personal items such as cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding.\n\n**Cleaning and Ventilation**\n\n* Clean all high-touch areas in the home, such as doorknobs, bathroom and kitchen fixtures, toilets, phones, tablets, counters, and other surfaces. Use a household cleaning spray and follow instructions for use.\n* Take steps to improve ventilation in your home. You can do this by opening windows, turning on exhaust fans in your bathrooms and kitchen, using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners, and setting the fan on your furnace or air conditioning to \"on\" if you have central heating and cooling in your home.\n\n**When to End Home Isolation**\n\n* Once you start to feel better, you can go back to your normal activities if both of the following things are true:\n\t+ For at least 24 hours, your symptoms have improved\n\t+ You have not had a fever for at least 24 hours, and you are not using fever-reducing medicine\n\n**Continuing Precautions**\n\n* Even though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days. For this reason, once you go back to your normal activities, protect others from illness by continuing to take these steps for 5 days:\n\t+ Practice good hygiene by washing your hands and cleaning \"high touch\" areas around your home\n\t+ Take steps to bring cleaner air inside your home by opening windows and using exhaust fans\n\t+ Wear a mask around others\n\t+ Practice physical distancing by avoiding close contact and avoiding crowds\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\n* You should contact your provider:\n\t+ If you have symptoms and think you may have COVID-19\n\t+ If you have COVID-19 and your symptoms are getting worse\n* Call 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\n\t+ Trouble breathing\n\t+ Chest pain or pressure\n\t+ Confusion or inability to wake up\n\t+ Blue, gray, or pale skin, lips, face, or nail beds\n\t+ Any other symptoms that are severe or concern you\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 Isolation**\n\nStaying at home when you have COVID-19 helps protect other people who are not infected with the virus.

Antiviral medicines help protect people at risk from getting severe illness.\n* If you have severe symptoms, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**Precautions to Take**\n\n* Use a well-fitting face mask or respirator that fits well over your nose and mouth without gaps when you see your provider and anytime other people are in the same room with you. If you can't wear a mask, for example, due to breathing problems, people in your home should wear a mask if they need to be in the same room with you.\n* Avoid contact with pets or other animals. While rare, SARS-CoV-2 can spread from people to animals.\n* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Droplets that are released when a person sneezes or coughs are infectious. Throw out the tissue after use.\n* Wash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before eating or preparing food, after using the toilet, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. If soap and water are not easily available, you should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n* Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n* Do not share personal items such as cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding. Wash anything you have used in soap and water.\n* Clean all high-touch areas in the home, such as doorknobs, bathroom and kitchen fixtures, toilets, phones, tablets, counters, and other surfaces. Use a household cleaning spray and follow instructions for use.\n\n**When to End Home Isolation**\n\nOnce you start to feel better, you can go back to your normal activities if both of the following things are true:\n\n* For at least 24 hours, your symptoms have improved\n* You have not had a fever for at least 24 hours, and you are not using fever-reducing medicine\n\nEven though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days.

Even though you have no symptoms, you can still spread the virus to others. Doing so will protect people at risk for serious illness, such as people who are immunocompromised.\n\nIf your fever returns after resuming normal activities, you should go back to staying home and away from others. Once your fever and symptoms improve for more than 24 hours, you can resume activities while taking steps to protect others for 5 more days.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your provider:\n\n* If you have symptoms and think you may have COVID-19\n* If you have COVID-19 and your symptoms are getting worse\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Chest pain or pressure\n* Confusion or inability to wake up\n* Blue, gray, or pale skin, lips, face, or nail beds\n* Any other symptoms that are severe or concern you\n\n---\n\n**COVID-19 - What to Do When You Are Sick**\n\n\\n\\n**Stay Home and Away from Others**\n\nEven if you have been vaccinated, you should stay at home and away from others inside and outside your home if you have symptoms of COVID-19, with or without a positive test.\n\nThese are important steps you can take to help prevent spreading COVID-19.\n\n*   Stay in a specific room and away from others in your home.

    "content": "**CPK Isoenzymes Test**\n\nThe creatine phosphokinase (CPK) isoenzymes test measures the different forms of CPK in the blood. CPK is an enzyme found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. This may be taken from a vein. The test is called a venipuncture.\n\nIf you are in the hospital, this test may be repeated over 2 or 3 days. A significant rise or fall in the total CPK or CPK isoenzymes can help your health care provider diagnose certain conditions.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed in most cases.\n\nTell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. Some drugs can interfere with test results. Drugs that can increase CPK measurements include:\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Amphotericin B\n*   Certain anesthetics\n*   Cocaine\n*   Fibrate drugs\n*   Statins\n*   Steroids, such as dexamethasone\n\nThis list is not all-inclusive.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel slight pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Some people feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done if a CPK test shows that your total CPK level is elevated. CPK isoenzyme testing can help find the exact source of the damaged tissue.\n\nCPK is made of three slightly different substances:\n\n*   **CPK-1 (also called CPK-BB)**: found mostly in the brain and lungs\n*   **CPK-2 (also called CPK-MB)**: found mostly in the heart\n*   **CPK-3 (also called CPK-MM)**: found mostly in skeletal muscle\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nHigher-than-normal CPK-1 levels:\n\nBecause CPK-1 is found mostly in the brain and lungs, injury to either of these areas can increase CPK-1 levels. Increased CPK-1 levels may be due to:\n\n*   Brain cancer\n*   Brain injury (due to any type of injury including, stroke, or bleeding in the brain)\n*   Electroconvulsive therapy\n*   Pulmonary infarction\n*   Seizure\n\nHigher-than-normal CPK-2 levels:\n\nCPK-2 levels rise 3 to 6 hours after a heart attack. If there is no further heart muscle damage, the level peaks at 12 to 24 hours and returns to normal 12 to 48 hours after tissue death.\n\nIncreased CPK-2 levels may also be due to:\n\n*   Electrical injuries\n*   Heart defibrillation (purposeful shocking of the heart by medical personnel)\n*   Heart injury (for instance, from a car accident)\n*   Inflammation of the heart muscle usually due to a virus (myocarditis)\n*   Open heart surgery\n\nHigher-than-normal CPK-3 levels are most often a sign of muscle injury or muscle stress. They may be due to:\n\n*   Crush injuries\n*   Dermatomyositis or polymyositis\n*   Muscle damage due to drugs or being immobile for a long time (rhabdomyolysis)\n*   Muscular dystrophy\n*   Myopathy\n*   Myositis (skeletal muscle inflammation)\n*   Receiving many intramuscular injections\n*   Recent nerve and muscle function testing (electromyography)\n*   Recent seizures\n*   Recent surgery\n*   Rhabdomyolysis\n*   Strenuous exercise\n\n**Considerations**\n\nFactors that can affect test results include cardiac catheterization, intramuscular injections, recent surgery, and vigorous and prolonged exercise or immobilization.\n\nIsoenzyme testing for specific conditions is about 90% accurate.\n\n---\n\n**CPK Isoenzymes Test**\n\nThe creatine phosphokinase (CPK) isoenzymes test measures the different forms of CPK in the blood.

    "content": "**CPR - Adult and Child After Onset of Puberty**\n\n**What is CPR?**\n\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after an electric shock, drowning, or heart attack.\n\n**How to Perform CPR**\n\nTo perform CPR, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check for responsiveness**: Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise.\n2. **Call 911 or the local emergency number**: If there is no response, call 911 or the local emergency number and shout for help.\n3. **Carefully place the person on their back**: If there is a chance the person has a spinal injury, two people should move the person to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4. **Perform chest compressions**:\n\t* Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone (right between the nipples).\n\t* Place the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand.\n\t* Position your body directly over your hands.\n\t* Give 30 chest compressions, pressing down about 2 inches (5 centimeters) into the chest. Each time, let the chest rise completely.\n5. **Open the airway**: Lift up the chin with 2 fingers and tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6. **Look, listen, and feel for breathing**: Place your ear close to the person's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7. **Give rescue breaths**: If the person is not breathing or has trouble breathing:\n\t* Cover their mouth tightly with your mouth.\n\t* Pinch the nose closed.\n\t* Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n\t* Give 2 rescue breaths, each taking about a second and making the chest rise.\n\n**When to Perform CPR**\n\nPerform CPR if a person has any of the following symptoms:\n\n* No breathing or difficulty breathing (gasping)\n* No pulse\n* Unconsciousness\n\n**Prevention Tips**\n\nTo avoid injuries and heart problems that can lead to the heart stopping beating, adults should:\n\n* Eliminate or reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease, such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and stress.\n* Get plenty of exercise.\n* See your health care provider regularly.\n* Always use seat belts and drive safely.\n* Avoid using illegal drugs.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation - adult; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - adult; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - adult; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - child 9 years and older; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - child 9 years and older; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - child 9 years and older\n\n---\n\n**Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)**\n\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after an electric shock, drowning, or heart attack.\n\n**What is CPR?**\n\nCPR involves:\n\n*   **Rescue Breathing**: Providing oxygen to a person's lungs.\n*   **Chest Compressions**: Keeping the person's blood circulating.\n\n**Why is CPR Important?**\n\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur within 4 minutes if a person's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the person's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\n\n**Who Should Perform CPR?**\n\nCPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training.\n\n**Time is of the Essence**\n\nTime is very important when an unconscious person is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\n\n**Using Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs)**\n\nMachines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. When using an AED, follow the instructions exactly.\n\n**Causes of Cardiac Arrest**\n\nIn adults, major reasons that heartbeat and breathing stop include:\n\n*   **Drug Overdose**\n*   **Excessive Bleeding**\n*   **Heart Problem (heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm, fluid in the lungs or compressing the heart)**\n*   **Infection in the bloodstream (sepsis)**\n*   **Injuries and accidents**\n*   **Drowning**\n*   **Stroke**\n\nThere are many things that cause an older child or teen's heartbeat and breathing to stop, including:\n\n*   **Choking**\n*   **Drowning**\n*   **Electrical shock**\n*   **Excessive bleeding**\n*   **Head trauma or other serious injury**\n*   **Lung disease**\n*   **Poisoning**\n*   **Suffocation**\n\n**Symptoms of Cardiac Arrest**\n\nCPR should be done if a person has any of the following symptoms:\n\n*   **No breathing or difficulty breathing (gasping)**\n*   **No pulse**\n*   **Unconsciousness**\n\n**First Aid for Cardiac Arrest**\n\n1.  Check for responsiveness. Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise. Shout, \"Are you OK?\"\n2.  Call 911 or the local emergency number if there is no response. Shout for help and send someone to call 911 or the local emergency number. If you are alone, call 911 or the local emergency number and retrieve an AED (if available), even if you have to leave the person.\n3.  Carefully place the person on their back. If there is a chance the person has a spinal injury, two people should move the person to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4.  Perform chest compressions:\n\n    *   Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- right between the nipples.\n    *   Place the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand.\n    *   Position your body directly over your hands.\n    *   Give 30 chest compressions. These compressions should be fast and hard. Press down about 2 inches (5 centimeters) into the chest. Each time, let the chest rise completely. Count the 30 compressions quickly: \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off\".\n5.  Open the airway. Lift up the chin with 2 fingers. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6.  Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the person's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7.  If the person is not breathing or has trouble breathing:\n\n    *   Cover their mouth tightly with your mouth.\n    *   Pinch the nose closed.\n    *   Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n    *   Give 2 rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n\n**Prevention of Cardiac Arrest**\n\nIn adults, to avoid injuries and heart problems that can lead to the heart stopping beating:\n\n*   Eliminate or reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease, such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and stress.\n*   Get plenty of exercise.\n*   See your health care provider regularly.\n*   Always use seat belts and drive safely.\n*   Avoid using illegal drugs.\n\nMost children need CPR because of a preventable accident. The following tips may help prevent some accidents in children:\n\n*   Teach your children the basic principles of family safety.\n*   Teach your child to swim.\n*   Teach your child to watch for cars and ride bikes safely.\n*   Teach your child firearm safety. If you have guns in your home, keep them locked in an isolated cabinet.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Heart Association website.

It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after an electric shock, drowning, or heart attack.\n\n\\n\\n**Why is Time Important in CPR?**\n\nPermanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\n\n\\n\\n**Who Should Perform CPR?**\n\nCPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training. See cpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search for classes near you.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the Causes of Heartbeat and Breathing Stopping in Adults?**\n\nMajor reasons that heartbeat and breathing stop include:\n\n*   Drug overdose\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Heart problem (heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm, fluid in the lungs or compressing the heart)\n*   Infection in the bloodstream (sepsis)\n*   Injuries and accidents\n*   Drowning\n*   Stroke\n\n\\n\\n**What are the Causes of Heartbeat and Breathing Stopping in Older Children and Teens?**\n\nThere are many things that cause an older child or teen's heartbeat and breathing to stop, including:\n\n*   Choking\n*   Drowning\n*   Electrical shock\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Head trauma or other serious injury\n*   Lung disease\n*   Poisoning\n*   Suffocation\n\n\\n\\n**What are the Symptoms of Heartbeat and Breathing Stopping?**\n\nCPR should be done if a person has any of the following symptoms:\n\n*   No breathing or difficulty breathing (gasping)\n*   No pulse\n*   Unconsciousness\n\n\\n\\n**How to Perform CPR on an Adult or Child After Onset of Puberty**\n\n1.  Check for responsiveness. Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise. Shout, \"Are you OK?\"\n2.  Call 911 or the local emergency number if there is no response.

This may happen after drowning, suffocation, choking, or other injuries.\n\n**What to Do**\n\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a baby's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue these procedures until the infant's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\n\nConsiderations\n\nCPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway, reversing long-standing practice.\n\nAll parents and those who take care of children should learn infant and child CPR. See cpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search for classes near you. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training.\n\n**Time is Very Important**\n\nTime is very important when dealing with an unconscious baby who is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\n\nMachines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. Make sure the AED can be used on infants.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many things that cause an infant's heartbeat and breathing to stop. Some reasons you may need to do CPR on an infant include:\n\n* Choking\n* Drowning\n* Electrical shock\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Head trauma or other serious injury\n* Lung disease\n* Poisoning\n* Suffocation\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCPR should be done if the infant has the following symptoms:\n\n* No breathing\n* No pulse\n* Unconsciousness\n\n**First Aid**\n\n1. Check for alertness. Tap the bottom of the infant's foot. See if the infant moves or makes a noise.\n2. If there is no response, shout for help. Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number and get an AED, if available.\n3. Carefully place the infant on its back. If there is a chance the infant has a spinal injury, two people should move the infant to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4. Perform chest compressions:\n\t* Place 2 fingers on the breastbone, just below the nipples.\n\t* Make sure not to press at the very end of the breastbone.\n\t* Keep your other hand on the infant's forehead, keeping the head tilted back.\n\t* Press down on the infant's chest so that it compresses about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n\t* Give 30 chest compressions. Each time, let the chest rise completely.\n5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with one hand. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the infant's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7. If the infant is not breathing:\n\t* Cover the infant's mouth and nose tightly with your mouth.\n\t* Or, cover just the nose with your mouth. Hold the infant's mouth shut.\n\t* Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n\t* Give 2 rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSteps to take if you are with another person or if you are alone with an infant:\n\nIf you have help, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.\nIf you are alone, shout loudly for help and begin CPR. After doing CPR for about 2 minutes, if no help has arrived, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost children need CPR because of a preventable accident. The following tips may help prevent some accidents in children:\n\n* Never underestimate what an infant can do.\n* Assume the baby can move more than you think.\n* Never leave an infant unattended on a bed, table, or other surface from which the infant could roll off.\n* Always use safety straps on high chairs and strollers. Never leave an infant in a mesh playpen with one side down.\n* Follow the guidelines for using infant car seats.\n* Teach your baby the meaning of \"don't touch\".\n* Choose age-appropriate toys.\n* Do not give infants toys that are heavy or fragile.\n* Inspect toys for small or loose parts, sharp edges, points, loose batteries, and other hazards.\n* Create a safe environment. Watch children carefully, particularly around water and near furniture.\n* Keep toxic chemicals and cleaning solutions safely stored in childproof cabinets in their original containers with labels attached.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRescue breathing and chest compressions - infant; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - infant; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - infant\n\n---\n\n**CPR for Infants**\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, is a lifesaving procedure that can be done when an infant's breathing or heartbeat has stopped.

Each time, let the chest rise completely. These compressions should be FAST and hard with no pausing. Count the 30 compressions quickly: (\"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off.\")\n\t* Rescuers, especially those who are trained in CPR, may also perform chest compressions by the 'two-thumb encircling hands technique.' To do this, encircle the infant's chest with both hands, and compress the chest with both thumbs about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with one hand. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the infant's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7. If the infant is not breathing:\n\t* Cover the infant's mouth and nose tightly with your mouth.\n\t* Or, cover just the nose with your mouth. Hold the infant's mouth shut.\n\t* Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n\t* Give 2 rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n8. After about 2 minutes of CPR, if the infant still does not have normal breathing, coughing, or any movement, leave the infant if you are alone and call 911 or the local emergency number. If an AED for children is available, use it now.\n9. Repeat rescue breathing and chest compressions until the infant recovers or help arrives. Infants and children undergoing CPR should receive two breaths after every 30 chest compressions if there is a single rescuer. If there are two rescuers, the child should receive the two breaths after every 15 chest compressions.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nAvoid making the situation worse by following these tips:\n\n* Do not leave the infant yourself to call 911 or the local emergency number until you have done CPR for about 2 minutes.\n* Do not press at the very end of the breastbone when performing chest compressions.\n\n---\n\n**CPR - Infant**\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nSteps to take if you are with another person or if you are alone with an infant:\n\n* If you have help, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.\n* If you are alone, shout loudly for help and begin CPR.

Assume the baby can move more than you think.\n* Never leave an infant unattended on a bed, table, or other surface from which the infant could roll off.\n* Always use safety straps on high chairs and strollers. Never leave an infant in a mesh playpen with one side down. Follow the guidelines for using infant car seats.\n* Teach your baby the meaning of \"don't touch\". The earliest safety lesson is \"No!\"\n* Choose age-appropriate toys. Do not give infants toys that are heavy or fragile. Inspect toys for small or loose parts, sharp edges, points, loose batteries, and other hazards.\n* Create a safe environment. Watch children carefully, particularly around water and near furniture.\n* Keep toxic chemicals and cleaning solutions safely stored in childproof cabinets in their original containers with labels attached.\n* To reduce the risk for choking accidents, make sure infants and small children cannot reach buttons, watch batteries, popcorn, coins, grapes, or nuts.\n* Sit with an infant while they eat. Do not allow an infant to crawl around while eating or drinking from a bottle.\n* Never tie pacifiers, jewelry, chains, bracelets, or anything else around an infant's neck or wrists.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRescue breathing and chest compressions - infant; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - infant; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - infant\n\n---\n\n**CPR - Infant**\n\n\\n\\n**What is CPR?**\n\nCPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a lifesaving technique that's performed when someone's heart stops beating. It involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to help restore blood flow and oxygenation to the brain and other vital organs.\n\n\\n\\n**Why is CPR important for infants?**\n\nInfants are particularly vulnerable to cardiac arrest due to their small size and developing cardiovascular system. Prompt and proper CPR can significantly improve survival rates and reduce long-term neurological damage in infants who suffer a cardiac arrest.\n\n\\n\\n**How do I perform CPR on an infant?**\n\nTo perform CPR on an infant, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Call for emergency medical help or have someone else do so while you start CPR.\n2.  Check the infant's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). If they're not breathing or have no pulse, start CPR.\n3.  Place the infant on their back on a firm, flat surface.\n4.  Position your hands correctly: one hand on top of the other, with your fingers together and your thumbs side by side.\n5.  Give 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute. For infants, this means compressing the chest to a depth of about 1/3 of the chest cavity.\n6.  After 30 compressions, give two breaths. Each breath should last one second and make the infant's chest rise.\n7.  Continue cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths until emergency medical help arrives.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the guidelines for CPR in infants?**\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) provides guidelines for CPR in infants. According to the AHA, CPR should be initiated immediately if an infant is found unresponsive or not breathing. The recommended ratio of chest compressions to rescue breaths is 30:2.\n\n\\n\\n**How can I learn more about CPR and infant care?**\n\nTo learn more about CPR and infant care, consider taking a pediatric advanced life support (PALS) course or attending a community lecture on infant first aid. Additionally, consult reputable online resources, such as the American Heart Association website, for up-to-date information on CPR techniques and guidelines.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the risks associated with delayed CPR in infants?**\n\nDelayed CPR can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in infants who suffer a cardiac arrest. The longer the delay, the greater the risk of long-term neurological damage or death. Prompt initiation of CPR is critical to improving survival rates and reducing long-term consequences.\n\n\\n\\n**How can I stay up-to-date on the latest CPR guidelines for infants?**\n\nStay informed about the latest CPR guidelines by regularly visiting reputable online resources, such as the American Heart Association website, and attending continuing education courses or community lectures on infant first aid. This will help you stay current with the most effective techniques and recommendations for CPR in infants.\n\n\\n\\n**What role does teamwork play in performing CPR on an infant?**\n\nTeamwork is essential when performing CPR on an infant. Multiple individuals should be involved to ensure that someone is always available to provide assistance, whether it's calling for emergency help or taking turns performing chest compressions and rescue breaths. This collaborative approach can significantly improve outcomes for infants who require CPR.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the long-term consequences of delayed CPR in infants?**\n\nDelayed CPR can result in long-term neurological damage or death in infants who suffer a cardiac arrest. The extent of the damage often depends on the duration of the delay and the effectiveness of the subsequent resuscitation efforts.

    "content": "**CPR for Young Children (Age 1 Year to Onset of Puberty)**\n\n**What is CPR?**\n\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when a child's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after drowning, suffocation, choking, or an injury.\n\n**Why is CPR Important?**\n\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur within 4 minutes if a child's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the child's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\n\n**Who Should Learn CPR?**\n\nAll parents and those who take care of children should learn infant and child CPR if they have not already. See cpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search for classes near you.\n\n**What to Do in Case of an Emergency**\n\nTime is very important when dealing with an unconscious child who is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\n\nMachines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They use computers to automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm.\n\n**Symptoms That Require CPR**\n\nCPR should be done if the child has any of the following symptoms:\n\n* No breathing\n* No pulse\n* Unconsciousness\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions for CPR**\n\n1. Check for alertness. Tap the child gently. See if the child moves or makes a noise.\n2. If there is no response, shout for help. Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number and get an AED if available.\n3. Carefully place the child on its back. If there is a chance the child has a spinal injury, two people should move the child to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4. Perform chest compressions:\n\t* Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- just below the nipples.\n\t* Keep your other hand on the child's forehead, keeping the head tilted back.\n\t* Press down on the child's chest so that it compresses about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n\t* Give 30 chest compressions. Each time, let the chest rise completely.\n5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with one hand. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the child's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7. If the child is not breathing:\n\t* Cover the child's mouth tightly with your mouth.\n\t* Pinch the nose closed.\n\t* Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n\t* Give two rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n\n**Prevention Tips**\n\nMost children need CPR because of a preventable accident. The following tips may help prevent an accident:\n\n* Teach your children the basic principles of family safety.\n* Teach your child to swim.\n* Teach your child to watch for cars and how to ride a bike safely.\n* Make sure you follow the guidelines for using children's car seats.\n* Teach your child firearm safety. If you have guns in your home, keep them locked in an isolated cabinet.\n* Teach your child the meaning of \"don't touch.\"\n\nNever underestimate what a child can do. Assume the child can move and pick up things more than you think they can. Think about what the child may get into next, and be ready. Climbing and squirming are to be expected. Always use safety straps on high chairs and strollers.\n\nChoose age-appropriate toys. Do not give small children toys that are heavy or fragile. Inspect toys for small or loose parts, sharp edges, points, loose batteries, and other hazards. Keep toxic chemicals and cleaning solutions safely stored in childproof cabinets.\n\nCreate a safe environment and supervise children carefully, particularly around water and near furniture.

Do not leave the child alone until you have done CPR for about 2 minutes.\n\n**Performing Chest Compressions**\n\n1. Carefully place the child on its back. If there is a chance the child has a spinal injury, two people should move the child to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n2. Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- just below the nipples. Make sure your heel is not at the very end of the breastbone. You may need to use both hands depending on your size and the size of the child.\n3. Keep your other hand on the child's forehead, keeping the head tilted back.\n4. Press down on the child's chest so that it compresses about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n5. Give 30 chest compressions. Each time, let the chest rise completely. These compressions should be fast and hard with no pausing. Count the 30 compressions quickly: \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off''.\n6. Rescuers, especially those who are trained in CPR, may also perform chest compressions by the 'two-thumb encircling hands technique.' To do this, encircle the infant's chest with both hands, and compress the chest with both thumbs about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n\n**Opening the Airway**\n\n1. Lift up the chin with one hand.\n2. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n\n**Checking for Breathing**\n\n1. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the child's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n\n**Giving Rescue Breaths**\n\n1. If the child is not breathing:\n\t* Cover the child's mouth tightly with your mouth.\n\t* Pinch the nose closed.\n\t* Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.\n\t* Give two rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n\n**Continuing CPR**\n\n1. After about 2 minutes of CPR, if the child still does not have normal breathing, coughing, or any movement, leave the child if you are alone and call 911 or the local emergency number. If an AED for children is available, use it now.\n2. Repeat rescue breathing and chest compressions until the child recovers or help arrives. Children undergoing CPR should receive two breaths after every 30 chest compressions if there is a single rescuer. They should receive the two breaths after every 15 chest compressions if there are two rescuers.\n\n**Recovery Position**\n\n1. If the child starts breathing again, place them in the recovery position.\n2. Keep checking for breathing until help arrives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**DO NOT**\n\n1. If you think the child has a spinal injury, pull the jaw forward without moving the head or neck. DO NOT let the mouth close.\n2. If the child has signs of normal breathing, coughing, or movement, DO NOT begin chest compressions. Doing so may cause the heart to stop beating.\n3. Unless you are a health professional, DO NOT check for a pulse. Only a health care professional is properly trained to check for a pulse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n1. If you have help, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.\n2. If you are alone, shout loudly for help and begin CPR. After doing CPR for about 2 minutes, if no help has arrived, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n---\n\n**CPR for Young Children (Age 1 to Onset of Puberty)**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have help, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.

As a parent or caregiver, knowing how to perform CPR on a child is crucial in case of an emergency. In this section, we'll delve into the specifics of pediatric CPR, covering the guidelines, techniques, and best practices for children aged 1-12.\n\n**Guidelines and Techniques**\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association (AHA), the approach to pediatric CPR varies depending on the child's age and the underlying cause of cardiac arrest. For young children (1-8 years old), the AHA recommends a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2, with a focus on high-quality chest compressions.\n\nFor older children (9-12 years old), the approach is similar to adult CPR, with a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2. However, it's essential to note that the AHA emphasizes the importance of proper training and equipment for pediatric CPR.\n\n**Key Considerations**\n\nWhen performing CPR on a young child, keep the following points in mind:\n\n*   **Proper positioning**: Ensure the child is placed on a firm, flat surface with their head tilted back slightly.\n*   **High-quality compressions**: Focus on delivering high-quality chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute.\n*   **Effective ventilation**: Provide two breaths after every 30 compressions, making sure the child's airway is clear.\n\n**Training and Equipment**\n\nTo ensure the best possible outcome in case of an emergency, it's crucial to receive proper training in pediatric CPR. This includes understanding the guidelines, techniques, and equipment required for effective resuscitation.\n\nAs a parent or caregiver, being aware of your surroundings and having access to necessary equipment can make all the difference in saving a young life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCPR for young children requires a specific approach, taking into account their age, size, and underlying medical conditions. By understanding the guidelines, techniques, and best practices outlined in this section, you'll be better equipped to respond in case of an emergency and provide the necessary care to save a child's life.",

If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), you could save a life.\n\n**What is CPR?**\n\nCPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped (called sudden cardiac arrest) or who is no longer breathing. CPR can maintain the blood flow breathing until emergency medical help arrives.\n\n**Steps to Take if Someone is in Sudden Cardiac Arrest:**\n\n1. Call 911.\n2. If someone else is around, have them look for an automated external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm. AEDs are available in many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports .\n3. Make sure that the person with sudden cardiac arrest is lying on their back on a firm surface.\n4. If you haven't had any CPR training, you can do \"hands-only\" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating (\"hands-only\" CPR isn't recommended for children). \"Hands-only\" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating. Chest compressions involve pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest.\n5. If you've had training, you can use chest compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing. To keep your skills up, repeat the CPR training every two years.\n6. Use the AED as soon as possible, if there is one available.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): First Aid (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n* What Is CPR?

It involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to keep oxygen flowing to the brain and other vital organs.\n\n**Why is CPR important?**\n\nCPR can help save lives in cases of sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when the heart suddenly stops functioning due to a problem with its electrical system. Early CPR can double or triple the chances of survival and minimize damage to the brain and other organs.\n\n**How do I perform CPR?**\n\nTo perform CPR, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Call 911**: If you are alone with the person who has collapsed, call 911 or your local emergency number first.\n2. **Check for responsiveness**: Tap the person on the shoulder and ask if they're okay. If they don't respond, start CPR.\n3. **Start chest compressions**: Place the person on their back on a firm surface and push down on their chest with the heel of your hand to create a heartbeat-like rhythm. Aim for 100-120 compressions per minute.\n4. **Give rescue breaths**: After every 30 compressions, give two breaths. Each breath should last one second and make the person's chest rise.\n5. **Continue CPR until help arrives**: Keep performing CPR until emergency medical personnel arrive.\n\n**Who needs CPR?**\n\nCPR can be performed on adults, children, and infants who have stopped breathing or whose heart has stopped beating. The technique is slightly different for each age group:\n\n* **Adults**: Same as above\n* **Children (1-8 years)**: Use a child-sized version of the adult CPR technique\n* **Infants (0-12 months)**: Use a specialized infant CPR technique that involves shorter compressions and breaths\n\n**Where can I learn more about CPR?**\n\nFor more information on CPR, visit the following resources:\n\n* American Heart Association (AHA)\n* American Red Cross (ARC)\n* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)\n\nRemember, CPR is a lifesaving technique that requires practice to become proficient.

    "content": "**CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index**\n\n**What is a CSF IgG index?**\n\nA CSF IgG index measures the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in your cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless fluid that flows in and around your brain and spinal cord.\n\n**CSF IgG Index Basics**\n\n* Normally you have a tiny amount of IgG in your cerebrospinal fluid.\n* High levels of IgG may mean you have an infection or an inflammatory or autoimmune disease that involves your central nervous system.\n* An autoimmune disorder causes your immune system to attack your own healthy cells by mistake, which can lead to serious health problems.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CSF IgG index is used to check for diseases of the central nervous system. It is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder that attacks the outside covering of your nerves.\n\n* Most people with MS have higher than normal levels of IgG.\n* But a CSF IgG test alone can't diagnose MS.\n\n**Why do I need a CSF IgG index?**\n\nYou may need a CSF IgG index if you have symptoms of a central nervous system disorder, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). The symptoms of MS often vary and may include:\n\n* Blurred or double vision\n* Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, body, or face\n* Painful muscle spasms\n* Weak muscles, often in the hands and legs\n* Dizziness\n* Problems with balance and walking\n* Bladder control problems\n* Fatigue\n* Problems with thinking or memory\n\n---\n\n**CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n\\n\\nYou may need a CSF IgG index if you have symptoms of a central nervous system disorder, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). The symptoms of MS often vary. They may come and go or steadily get worse. They include:\n\n*   **Blurred or double vision**\n*   **Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, body, or face**\n*   **Painful muscle spasms**\n*   **Weak muscles, often in the hands and legs**\n*   **Dizziness**\n*   **Problems with balance and walking**\n*   **Bladder control problems**\n*   **Fatigue**\n*   **Problems with thinking or memory**\n\n\\n\\n**What happens during a CSF IgG index?**\n\nTo get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure:\n\n*   You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.\n*   A provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.\n*   When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.\n*   Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.\n*   You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.\n\n\\n\\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CSF IgG index, but you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.\n\n\\n\\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted.\n\nYou may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more. Your provider may suggest treatment to help relieve the pain.\n\n\\n\\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA CSF IgG index that's higher than normal may be a sign of an infection or an inflammatory or autoimmune condition that affects your central nervous system, such as:\n\n*   **Multiple sclerosis**\n*   **Transverse myelitis (TM)**\n*   **Syphilis that infects your nervous system (neurosyphilis)**\n*   **Connective tissue disorders**\n*   **Guillain-Barre syndrome**\n*   **Encephalitis caused by herpes simplex**\n\nYou may need more tests before your provider can diagnose your condition.\n\nA CSF IgG index that's lower than normal may be a sign that your body is unable to make enough IgG antibodies, and you are likely to get sick with infections. Experts don't know what causes this problem. Normally, a test of IgG levels in blood is used to check whether you may lack IgG antibodies.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n\\n\\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CSF IgG index?**\n\nThe CSF IgG index is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS), but there is no specific test for MS. If your provider thinks you have MS, you will probably have other tests to help diagnose or rule out the disease.\n\nWhile there is no cure for MS, there are many treatments available that can relieve symptoms and help keep it from getting worse.\n\n---\n\n**CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index?**\n\nThe CSF Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index is a medical test used to diagnose and monitor various neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. It measures the ratio of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Autoimmune Diseases\n*   Immune System and Disorders\n*   Multiple Sclerosis\n*   Neurologic Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n*   Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis\n*   How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n*   How to Understand Your Lab Results\n*   Immunoglobulins Blood Test\n*   Neurological Exam",

    "content": "**CSF Coccidioides Complement Fixation Test**\n\nThis test checks for infection due to the fungus Coccidioides in the cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The name of this infection is coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever. When the infection involves the covering of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges), it is called coccidioidal meningitis.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA sample of spinal fluid is needed for this test, usually obtained by lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The sample is sent to a laboratory where it is examined for Coccidioides antibodies using a laboratory method called complement fixation. This technique checks if your body has produced substances called antibodies to a specific foreign substance (antigen), in this case Coccidioides.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test. Expect to be in the hospital for several hours afterward.\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nDuring the test:\n\n*   You lie on your side with knees pulled up toward your chest and chin tucked downward.\n*   After your back is cleaned, the doctor injects a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into your lower spine.\n*   A spinal needle is inserted, usually into the lower back area.\n*   Once the needle is properly positioned, CSF pressure is measured, and a sample is collected.\n*   The needle is removed, the area is cleaned, and a bandage is placed over the needle site.\n*   You are taken to a recovery area where you rest for several hours to prevent any CSF leakage.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test checks if your central nervous system has an active infection from Coccidioides.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe absence of fungus (a negative test) is normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf the test is positive for fungus, there may be an active infection in the central nervous system. An abnormal spinal fluid test means that the central nervous system is infected. During the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of lumbar puncture include:\n\n*   Bleeding into the spinal canal\n*   Discomfort during the test\n*   Headache after the test\n*   Hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic\n*   Infection introduced by the needle going through the skin\n*   Damage to the nerves in the spinal cord, occurs more commonly if the person moves during the test\n\n---\n\n**CSF Coccidioides Complement Fixation Test**\n\n**What is it?**\nInfection with Coccidioides, also known as valley fever, can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause coccidioidal meningitis.

    "content": "**CSF Leak**\n\nA CSF leak is an escape of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n**Causes**\n\nAny tear or hole in the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (dura) can allow the fluid that surrounds those organs to leak. When it leaks out, the pressure around the brain and spinal cord drops.\n\nCauses of leakage through the dura include:\n\n* Certain head, brain, or spinal surgeries\n* Head or spine injury\n* Placement of tubes for epidural anesthesia or pain medicines\n* Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)\n\nSometimes, no cause can be found. This is called a spontaneous CSF leak.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* A headache that is worse when you sit up and improves when you lie down. It may be associated with light sensitivity, nausea, and neck stiffness.\n* Drainage of CSF from the ear (rarely).\n* Drainage of CSF from the nose (rarely).\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Tests may include:\n\n* CT scan of the head with contrast dye\n* CT myelogram of the spine\n* MRI of the head or spine\n* Radioisotope test of the CSF to track the leakage\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDepending on the cause of the leak, many symptoms improve on their own after a few days. Complete bed rest for several days is usually recommended. Drinking more fluids, especially drinks with caffeine, can help slow or stop the leak and may help with headache pain.\n\nYour headache may be treated with pain relievers and fluids. If your headache lasts longer than a week after a lumbar puncture, a procedure may be done to block the hole that may be leaking fluid. This is called a blood patch, because a blood clot can be used to seal the leak. In most cases, this makes symptoms go away. In rare cases, surgery is needed to repair the tear in the dura and stop your headache.\n\nIf symptoms of infection (fever, chills, change in mental status) are present, treatment with antibiotics will likely be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook is usually good depending on the cause. Most cases heal by themselves with no lasting symptoms.\n\nIf the CSF leak keeps coming back, high pressure of the CSF (hydrocephalus) might be the cause and should be treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may occur if the cause is surgery or trauma. Infections after surgery or trauma can lead to meningitis and serious complications, such as swelling of the brain, and need to be treated right away.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a headache that gets worse when you sit up, especially if you have recently had a head injury, surgery, or childbirth involving epidural anesthesia.\n* You have a moderate head injury, and then develop a headache that is worse when you sit up, or you have a thin, clear fluid draining from your nose or ear.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost CSF leaks are a complication of a spinal tap or surgery. The provider should use the smallest needle possible when doing a spinal tap.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nIntracranial hypotension; Cerebrospinal fluid leak\n\n**References**\n\nMaslak JP, Casper DS, Pelle D.

Tests may include:\n\n* CT scan of the head with contrast dye\n* CT myelogram of the spine\n* MRI of the head or spine\n* Radioisotope test of the CSF to track the leakage\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDepending on the cause of the leak, many symptoms improve on their own after a few days. Complete bed rest for several days is usually recommended. Drinking more fluids, especially drinks with caffeine, can help slow or stop the leak and may help with headache pain.\n\nYour headache may be treated with pain relievers and fluids. If your headache lasts longer than a week after a lumbar puncture, a procedure may be done to block the hole that may be leaking fluid. This is called a blood patch, because a blood clot can be used to seal the leak. In most cases, this makes symptoms go away. In rare cases, surgery is needed to repair the tear in the dura and stop your headache.\n\nIf symptoms of infection (fever, chills, change in mental status) are present, treatment with antibiotics will likely be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook is usually good depending on the cause. Most cases heal by themselves with no lasting symptoms.\n\nIf the CSF leak keeps coming back, high pressure of the CSF (hydrocephalus) might be the cause and should be treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may occur if the cause is surgery or trauma. Infections after surgery or trauma can lead to meningitis and serious complications, such as swelling of the brain, and need to be treated right away.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a headache that gets worse when you sit up, especially if you have recently had a head injury, surgery, or childbirth involving epidural anesthesia.\n* You have a moderate head injury, and then develop a headache that is worse when you sit up, or you have a thin, clear fluid draining from your nose or ear.\n\n---\n\n**CSF Leak**\n\nYou have a moderate head injury, and then develop a headache that is worse when you sit up, or you have a thin, clear fluid draining from your nose or ear.\n\n**Contact Your Provider If:**\n\n* You have a headache that worsens when sitting up\n* You have a thin, clear fluid draining from your nose or ear\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost CSF leaks are a complication of a spinal tap or surgery. The provider should use the smallest needle possible when doing a spinal tap.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nIntracranial hypotension; Cerebrospinal fluid leak\n\n**Images**\n\n*Cerebrospinal fluid leak*\n\n**References**\n\n* Maslak JP, Casper DS, Pelle D.

    "content": "**CSF Myelin Basic Protein**\n\n_CSF myelin basic protein is a test to measure the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)._\n\n**What is CSF?**\n\n_CSF is a clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord._\n\n**What is MBP?**\n\n_MBP is found in the material that covers many of your nerves._\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\n_A sample of spinal fluid is needed. This is done using a lumbar puncture._\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\n_This test is done to see if myelin is breaking down. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause for this, but other causes may include:_\n\n* _Bleeding of the central nervous system_\n* _Central nervous system trauma_\n* _Certain brain diseases (encephalopathies)_\n* _Infection of the central nervous system_\n* _Stroke_\n* _Traumatic brain injury_\n\n**What are Normal Results?**\n\n_In general, there should be less than 4 ng/mL of myelin basic protein in the CSF._\n\n**How to Interpret Test Results**\n\n_Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results._\n\n---\n\n**CSF Myelin Basic Protein**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nMyelin basic protein (MBP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a test used to diagnose and monitor multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the central nervous system.\n\n**Normal Value Range**\n\nThe normal value range for myelin basic protein in the CSF is less than 4 ng/mL. However, this may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\n* Myelin basic protein levels from 4 to 8 ng/mL may indicate a long-term (chronic) breakdown of myelin or recovery from an acute episode of myelin breakdown.\n* If the myelin basic protein level is 9 ng/mL or greater, it indicates that myelin is actively breaking down.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe test involves collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The CSF is then analyzed for myelin basic protein levels.\n\n**References**\n\n* Euerle BD. Spinal puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination. In: Roberts JR, Custalow CB, Thomsen TW, eds.
