    "content": "**Common Symptoms During Pregnancy**\n\nGrowing a baby is hard work. Your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the aches and pains of pregnancy, you will feel other new or changing symptoms.\n\nEven so, many pregnant women say that they feel healthier than ever.\n\n* **Fatigue**\nBeing tired is common during pregnancy. Most women feel tired the first few months, then again toward the end. Exercise, rest, and a proper diet can make you feel less tired. It may also help to take rest breaks or naps every day.\n* **Problems With Urination**\nEarly on in the pregnancy, you will likely be making more trips to the bathroom.\n\nAs your uterus grows and rises higher in your abdomen (belly), the need to urinate often may lessen.\nEven so, you will continue to urinate more throughout pregnancy. That means you also need to drink more water, and may be thirstier than before you were pregnant.\nAs you get closer to delivery and your baby descends into your pelvis, you will need to pee much more, and the amount of urine passed at one time will be less (the bladder holds less due to pressure from the baby).\n\nIf you have pain when you urinate or a change in urine odor or color, contact your health care provider. These could be signs of a bladder infection.\n\nSome pregnant women also leak urine when they cough or sneeze. For most women, this goes away after the baby is born. If this happens to you, start doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor.\n* **Vaginal Discharge**\nYou may see more vaginal discharge while pregnant. Contact your provider if the discharge:\n\nHas a foul odor\nHas a greenish color\nMakes you feel itchy\nCauses pain or soreness\n\nCertain vaginal infections are important to treat during pregnancy, as they may cause preterm labor.\n* **Constipation**\nHaving a harder time than usual moving your bowels is normal during pregnancy. This is because:\n\nHormone changes during pregnancy slow down your digestive system.\nLater in your pregnancy, the pressure from your uterus on your rectum may also worsen the problem.\n\nYou can ease constipation by:\n\nEating raw fruits and vegetables, such as prunes, to get extra fiber.\nEating whole grain or bran cereals for more fiber.\nUsing a fiber supplement regularly.\nDrinking plenty of water (8 to 9 cups daily).\n\nAsk your provider about trying a stool softener. Also ask before using laxatives during pregnancy.\n* **Heartburn**\nWhile you are pregnant, food stays in your stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn (stomach acid moving back up into the esophagus). This may cause nausea and vomiting throughout your pregnancy.\n\nYou can reduce heartburn by:\n\nEating small meals\nAvoiding spicy and greasy foods\nNot drinking large amounts of liquid before bedtime\nNot exercising for at least 2 hours after you eat\nNot lying down flat right after a meal\n\nIf you continue to have heartburn, talk to your provider about medicines that can help.\n* **Nosebleeds and Bleeding Gums**\nSome women have nose and gum bleeding while they are pregnant. This is because the tissues in their nose and gums get dry, and the blood vessels dilate and are closer to the surface. You can avoid or reduce this bleeding by:\n\nDrinking lots of fluids\nGetting lots of vitamin C, from orange juice or other fruits and juices\nUsing a humidifier (a device that puts water in the air) to decrease dryness of the nose or sinuses\nUse saline nasal spray\nBrushing your teeth with a soft toothbrush to decrease bleeding gums\nMaintaining good dental hygiene and using floss every day to keep your gums healthy\n* **Swelling, Varicose Veins, and Hemorrhoids**\nSwelling in your legs is common. You may see more swelling as you get closer to giving birth. The swelling is caused by your uterus pressing on the veins.\n\nYou may also notice that the veins in your lower body are becoming larger.\nIn the legs, these are called varicose veins.\nYou may also have veins close to your vulva and vagina that swell.\nIn your rectum, veins that swell are called hemorrhoids.\n\nTo reduce leg swelling:\n\nRaise your legs and rest your feet on a surface higher than your belly.\nLie on your side in bed. Lying on the left side is better if you can do it comfortably. It also provides better circulation for the baby.\nWear support pantyhose or compression stockings.\nLimit salty foods. Salt works like a sponge and makes your body hold more water.\nTry not to strain during bowel movements. This can worsen hemorrhoids.\n\nLeg swelling that occurs with headaches or high blood pressure can be a sign of a serious medical complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia. It is important to discuss leg swelling with your provider.\n* **Breathing Problems**\nSome women feel short of breath at times while they are pregnant. You may notice that you're breathing more rapidly than usual. It happens more often in the early part of the pregnancy due to the changes in your hormones. It may also happen again toward the end of your pregnancy because of pressure from the baby. Mild shortness of breath from exercise that quickly gets better is not serious.\n\nSevere chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away can be a sign of a serious medical complication. Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room right away if you have these symptoms.\n\nYou may get short of breath again in the later weeks of pregnancy. This is because the uterus takes up so much room that your lungs do not have as much space to expand.\n\nDoing these things might help with shortness of breath:\n\nSitting up straight\nSleeping propped up on a pillow\nResting when you feel short of breath\nMoving at a slower pace\n\nLet your provider know if you have a history of asthma, as asthma may worsen during pregnancy. If you suddenly have a hard time breathing that is unusual for you, see your provider right away or go to the emergency room.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n**Common Symptoms During Pregnancy**\n\nGrowing a baby is hard work.

    "content": "**Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\n**What is Common Variable Immune Deficiency?**\n\nCommon variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a disorder that impairs the immune system. People with CVID are highly susceptible to infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, or more rarely, viruses and often develop recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears.\n\n**Symptoms of Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\n* Recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears\n* Pneumonia is common in people with CVID\n* Over time, recurrent infections can lead to chronic lung disease\n* Infection or inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause diarrhea and weight loss\n* Abnormal accumulation of immune cells causes enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)\n* Immune cells can accumulate in other organs, forming small lumps called granulomas\n\n**Autoimmune Disorders Associated with Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\nApproximately 25 percent of people with CVID have an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. The blood cells are most frequently affected by autoimmune attacks in CVID; the most commonly occurring autoimmune disorders are:\n\n* Immune thrombocytopenia, which is an abnormal bleeding disorder caused by a decrease in cells involved in blood clotting called platelets\n* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which results in premature destruction of red blood cells\n* Other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can occur\n\n**Cancer Risk Associated with Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\nIndividuals with CVID also have a greater than normal risk of developing certain types of cancer, including:\n\n* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of immune system cells\n* Less frequently, stomach (gastric) cancer\n\n**Diagnosis and Life Expectancy of Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\nPeople with CVID may start experiencing signs and symptoms of the disorder anytime between childhood and adulthood; most people with CVID are diagnosed in their twenties or thirties. The life expectancy of individuals with CVID varies depending on the severity and frequency of illnesses they experience. Most people with CVID live into adulthood.\n\n**Types of Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\nThere are many different types of CVID that are distinguished by genetic cause. People with the same type of CVID may have varying signs and symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID)**\n\n**What is Common Variable Immune Deficiency?**\n\nCommon Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID) is a disorder that impairs the immune system.

Most people with CVID live into adulthood.\n\n**Types of CVID**\n\nThere are many different types of CVID that are distinguished by genetic cause. People with the same type of CVID may have varying signs and symptoms.\n\n**Frequency of CVID**\n\nCVID is estimated to affect 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide, although the prevalence can vary across different populations.\n\n**Causes of CVID**\n\nThe cause in CVID is unknown in approximately 90 percent of cases. It is likely that this condition is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. While the specific environmental factors are unclear, the genetic influences in CVID are believed to be mutations in genes that are involved in the development and function of immune system cells called B cells.\n\n**Genetic Mutations**\n\nIn about 10 percent of cases, a genetic cause for CVID is known. Mutations in at least 13 genes have been associated with CVID. The most frequent mutations occur in the TNFRSF13B gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a role in the survival and maturation of B cells and in the production of antibodies.\n\n**Antibody Deficiency**\n\nAll individuals with CVID have a shortage (deficiency) of two or three specific antibodies. Some have a deficiency of the antibodies called immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA), while others, in addition to lacking IgG and IgA, are also deficient in immunoglobulin M (IgM). A shortage of these antibodies makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off infections.\n\n---\n\n**Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\n**What is Common Variable Immune Deficiency?**\n\nCommon variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a rare disorder that affects the immune system. People with CVID have difficulty fighting off infections due to a shortage of specific antibodies in their blood.\n\n**Causes of CVID**\n\nThe cause of CVID is unknown in approximately 90 percent of cases.

A shortage of these antibodies makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off infections.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of CVID are sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. These cases probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. In rare cases, CVID is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Learn more about the gene associated with Common variable immune deficiency\n*   Additional Information from NCBI Gene:\n    *   CD19\n    *   CD81\n    *   CR2\n    *   ICOS\n    *   IKZF1\n    *   IL21\n    *   LRBA\n    *   MS4A1\n    *   NFKB1\n    *   NFKB2\n    *   PRKCD\n    *   TNFRSF13C\n\n---\n\n**Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\n**What is Common Variable Immune Deficiency?**\n\nCommon variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a rare disorder characterized by impaired antibody production and increased susceptibility to infections. It is also known as common variable hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\n**Causes of CVID**\n\nThe exact cause of CVID is still not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. In some cases, the disorder may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or dominant pattern.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nMutations in certain genes, such as TNFRSF13B, have been associated with CVID. When these mutations are inherited, they can cause either autosomal dominant CVID or autosomal recessive CVID. However, not all individuals who inherit a gene mutation associated with CVID will develop the disease.\n\n**Types of Inheritance**\n\nCVID can be inherited in three ways:\n\n*   Autosomal recessive pattern: Both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations.\n*   Autosomal dominant pattern: One copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n*   Sporadic cases: Result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nCVID can manifest differently in various individuals, but common symptoms include recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. Diagnosing CVID involves ruling out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms and measuring immunoglobulin levels to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for CVID, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing infections through:\n\n*   Intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy\n*   Antibiotic prophylaxis\n*   Vaccination against common pathogens\n*   Close monitoring of immune function and overall health\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on CVID, refer to the following studies:\n\n*   Ameratunga R, et al. (2013) - New diagnostic criteria for common variable immune deficiency.\n*   Cunningham-Rundles C. (2008) - Autoimmune manifestations in common variable immunodeficiency.\n*   Lopez-Herrera G, et al.

(2013) - \n\nThese studies provide valuable insights into the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and management of CVID.\n\n---\n\n**Common Variable Immune Deficiency**\n\n**What is Common Variable Immune Deficiency?**\n\nCommon variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with CVID have difficulty fighting off infections and may experience autoimmune problems.\n\n**Causes of CVID**\n\nResearch has identified several genes associated with CVID, including LRBA and TACI. Mutations in these genes can lead to impaired immune function.\n\n**Symptoms of CVID**\n\nCVID can cause a range of symptoms, including recurrent infections, autoimmune disorders, and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n**Diagnosing CVID**\n\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to rule out other conditions.\n\n**Treatment of CVID**\n\nTreatment for CVID may include intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy to replace missing antibodies. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected organs.\n\n**Prognosis of CVID**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with CVID varies widely depending on the severity of their symptoms and their response to treatment.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nCVID is a genetic disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Autoimmune Diseases\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Immune System and Disorders",

    "content": "**Communicating with Someone with Aphasia**\n\nAphasia is the loss of ability to understand or express spoken or written language, commonly occurring after strokes or traumatic brain injuries. It can also occur in people with brain tumors or degenerative diseases that affect the language areas of the brain.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nPeople who have aphasia have language problems, including trouble saying and/or writing words correctly. This type of aphasia is called expressive aphasia. People who have it may understand what another person is saying, but others may not understand them or written words, resulting in receptive aphasia. Some people have a combination of both types.\n\nExpressive aphasia may be non-fluent, causing trouble with:\n\n* Finding the right words\n* Saying more than 1 word or phrase at a time\n* Speaking overall\n\nAnother kind of expressive aphasia is fluent aphasia, where people can put many words together but what they say doesn't make sense. They are often unaware that they're not making sense.\n\nPeople who have aphasia may become frustrated:\n\n* When others cannot understand them\n* When they cannot understand others\n* When they cannot find the right words\n\nSpeech and language therapists can work with people who have aphasia and their family or caregivers to improve communication.\n\nThe most common cause of aphasia is stroke, with recovery taking up to 2 years. Aphasia may also be due to brain function loss, such as Alzheimer disease, in which case it will not get better.\n\n**Improving Daily Communication**\n\nHelp people with aphasia by:\n\n* Keeping distractions and noise down\n* Turning off the radio and TV\n* Moving to a quieter room\n\nTalk to people who have aphasia in adult language, avoiding making them feel like children or pretending to understand if you don't. If they cannot understand you, don't shout; make eye contact instead.\n\nWhen asking questions:\n\n* Ask yes or no questions\n* Give clear choices for possible answers (but not too many)\n* Use visual cues when possible\n\nWhen giving instructions:\n\n* Break down into small and simple steps\n* Allow time for understanding (sometimes longer than expected)\n* Consider changing activities if frustrated\n\n---\n\n**Communicating with Someone Who Has Aphasia**\n\nAphasia is a condition that affects an individual's ability to understand or express spoken or written language. It often occurs after strokes, traumatic brain injuries, or degenerative diseases that impact the language areas of the brain.\n\n**Improving Communication**\n\nTo improve communication with someone who has aphasia:\n\n*   Keep distractions and noise down by turning off the radio and TV, and moving to a quieter room.\n*   Speak in adult language, avoiding condescending tone or pretending to understand when you don't.\n*   Make eye contact when talking to the person.\n\n**Asking Questions**\n\nWhen asking questions:\n\n*   Ask yes or no questions to facilitate clear responses.\n*   Provide visual cues when possible to aid understanding.\n*   Avoid overwhelming individuals with too many choices or complex instructions.\n\n**Visual Cues and Instructions**\n\nWhen giving instructions:\n\n*   Break down instructions into simple, manageable steps.\n*   Allow time for the individual to understand and process information.\n*   If frustration arises, consider changing activities or seeking additional support.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can enhance communication with individuals who have aphasia and promote more effective understanding.\n\n---\n\n**Communicating with Someone with Aphasia**\n\nWhen communicating with someone who has aphasia, it's essential to be clear and concise. Here are some tips:\n\n*   **Use yes or no questions**: This helps the person with aphasia understand what you're asking and respond more easily.\n*   **Give visual cues**: Visual aids like pictures or diagrams can help the person with aphasia understand better.\n*   **Break down instructions**: Divide complex tasks into smaller, simpler steps to avoid overwhelming the person with aphasia.\n*   **Allow time for understanding**: Don't rush the conversation. Give the person with aphasia enough time to process and respond.\n*   **Change activities if frustrated**: If the person becomes frustrated, consider switching to a different activity to prevent further frustration.\n\n**Alternative Ways of Communication**\n\nPeople with aphasia may need to use alternative methods to communicate effectively. Consider:\n\n*   **Pointing**\n*   **Hand gestures**\n*   **Drawings**\n*   **Writing out what they want to say**\n*   **Signing out what they want to say**\n\nThese methods can help the person with aphasia express themselves more easily.\n\n**Involving the Person with Aphasia**\n\nIt's crucial to keep the person with aphasia involved in conversations. Check with them regularly to ensure they understand what's being discussed. Don't push too hard, as this may cause more frustration.\n\n**ID Cards for People with Speech Problems**\n\nWhen leaving someone with speech problems alone, make sure they have an ID card that includes:\n\n*   **Information on how to contact family members or caregivers**\n*   **Explanation of the person's speech problem and how best to communicate**\n\nThis can help ensure the person with aphasia receives the necessary support.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nConsider joining support groups for people with aphasia and their families. This can provide a valuable network of understanding and guidance.\n\n**Improving Daily Communication**\n\nTo improve daily communication, try:\n\n*   **Keeping distractions and noise down**\n*   **Talking to people in adult language**\n*   **Making eye contact when communicating**\n*   **Avoiding shouting if the person cannot understand you**\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a more supportive and effective communication environment for individuals with aphasia.\n\n---\n\n**Communicating with Someone with Aphasia**\n\nAphasia is a condition that affects a person's ability to communicate effectively. It can be caused by stroke, brain injury, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. In this article, we will discuss how to communicate with someone who has aphasia.\n\n**Understanding Aphasia**\n\nAphasia is not the same as dysarthria, which is a speech disorder that affects the way words are spoken. People with aphasia may have difficulty finding the right words, understanding others, and expressing themselves through writing or speaking.\n\n**Tips for Communicating with Someone with Aphasia**\n\n1. **Be patient**: Communication with someone who has aphasia can be challenging. Be patient and don't get frustrated if they struggle to understand or express themselves.\n2. **Use simple language**: Use simple language and avoid complex sentences or jargon that may be difficult for them to understand.\n3. **Write it down**: Writing down important information, such as medication schedules or appointment times, can help ensure that the person with aphasia understands what is expected of them.\n4. **Encourage self-expression**: Encourage the person with aphasia to express themselves through writing, drawing, or other forms of communication that may be easier for them.\n5. **Seek support**: If you are caring for someone with aphasia, consider seeking support from a therapist or support group to help you navigate the challenges of communicating with them.\n\n**Resources**\n\nFor more information on aphasia and how to communicate with someone who has it, visit the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders website at <http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia>.",

    "content": "**Community-acquired Pneumonia in Adults**\n\nPneumonia is inflamed or swollen lung tissue due to infection with a germ. This article covers community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which affects people who have not recently been in the hospital or another healthcare facility.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.\n\nYou can get pneumonia through:\n\n* Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth spreading to your lungs\n* Breathing some of these germs directly into your lungs\n* Aspiration pneumonia from breathing in food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth\n\nPneumonia can be caused by many types of germs.\n\nThe most common type of bacteria is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).\nAtypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by other bacteria.\nA fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause pneumonia in people whose immune system is not working well, especially people with advanced HIV infection.\nViruses, such as the flu (influenza) virus, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), are also common causes of pneumonia.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nChronic lung disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis)\nCigarette smoking\nDementia, stroke, brain injury, cerebral palsy, or other brain disorders\nImmune system problem (during cancer treatment, or due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, or other diseases)\nOther serious illnesses, such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes\nRecent surgery or trauma\nSurgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat, or neck\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptoms of pneumonia are:\n\n* Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus)\n* Fever, which may be mild or high\n* Shaking chills\n* Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs or exert yourself)\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n* Confusion, especially in older people\n* Excess sweating and clammy skin\n* Headache\n* Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue\n* Malaise (not feeling well)\n* Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour healthcare provider will listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds when listening to your chest with a stethoscope. Tapping on your chest wall (percussion) helps your provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds in your chest.\n\nIf pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a chest x-ray.\n\nOther tests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Arterial blood gases to see if enough oxygen is getting into your blood from the lungs.\n* Blood and sputum cultures to look for the germ that may be causing the pneumonia.\n* CBC to check white blood cell count.\n* CT scan of the chest.\n* Bronchoscopy in which a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the end passed down to your lungs in selected cases.\n* Thoracentesis which involves removing fluid from the space between the outside lining of the lungs and the chest wall.\n* Nasopharyngeal swab to assess for viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider must first decide whether you need to be in the hospital. If you are treated in the hospital, you will receive:\n\nFluids and antibiotics (or antivirals) through your veins\nOxygen therapy\nBreathing treatments (possibly)\n\nIf you are diagnosed with a bacterial form of pneumonia, it is important that you are started on antibiotics very soon after you are admitted. If you have viral pneumonia, you will not receive antibiotics. This is because antibiotics do not kill viruses. You may receive other medicines, such as antivirals, if you have the flu or other type of viral pneumonia.\n\n**Home Treatment**\n\nMost people can be treated at home. If so, your provider may tell you to take medicines such as antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more.\n\nWhen taking antibiotics:\n\n* Do not miss any doses. Take the medicine until it is gone, even when you start to feel better.\n* Do not take cough medicine or cold medicine unless your provider says it is OK. Coughing helps your body get rid of mucus from your lungs.\n\nBreathing warm, moist (wet) air helps loosen the sticky mucus that may make you feel like you are choking. These things may help:\n\n* Place a warm, wet washcloth loosely over your nose and mouth.\n* Fill a humidifier with warm water and breathe in the warm mist.\n* Take a couple of deep breaths 2 or 3 times every hour. Deep breaths will help open up your lungs.\n* Tap your chest gently a few times a day while lying with your head lower than your chest. This helps bring up mucus from the lungs so that you can cough it out.\n\nDrink plenty of liquids, as long as your provider says it is OK.\n\nDrink water, juice, or weak tea\nDrink at least 6 to 10 cups (1.4 to 2.4 liters) a day\nDo not drink alcohol\n\nGet plenty of rest when you go home. If you have trouble sleeping at night, take naps during the day.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith treatment, most people improve rapidly and feel nearly back to normal within 2 weeks. Older adults or very sick people may need longer treatment.\n\nThose who may be more likely to have complicated pneumonia include:\n\nOlder adults\nPeople whose immune system does not work well\nPeople with other serious medical problems, such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, or cirrhosis of the liver\n\nIn all of the above conditions, pneumonia can lead to serious illness or even death, if it is severe.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can help prevent pneumonia by following the measures below.\n\nWash your hands often, especially:\n\nBefore preparing and eating food\nAfter blowing your nose\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter changing a baby's diaper\nAfter coming in contact with people who are sick\n\nAvoid coming into contact with people who are sick.\n\nDo not smoke. Tobacco damages your lung's ability to fight infection.\n\nVaccines may help prevent some types of pneumonia. Be sure to get the following vaccines:\n\nFlu vaccine can help prevent pneumonia caused by the flu virus.\nPneumococcal vaccine lowers your chances of getting pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nCOVID-19 vaccine can help prevent severe pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n---\n\n**Community-acquired Pneumonia in Adults**\n\nPneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States.

In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.\n\nWays you can get pneumonia include:\n\n*   Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs.\n*   You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs.\n*   You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia).\n\nPneumonia can be caused by many types of germs.\n\nThe most common type of bacteria is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).\nAtypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by other bacteria.\nA fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause pneumonia in people whose immune system is not working well, especially people with advanced HIV infection.\nViruses, such as the flu (influenza) virus, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), are also common causes of pneumonia.\n\nRisk factors that increase your chance of getting pneumonia include:\n\n*   Chronic lung disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis)\n*   Cigarette smoking\n*   Dementia, stroke, brain injury, cerebral palsy, or other brain disorders\n*   Immune system problem (during cancer treatment, or due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, or other diseases)\n*   Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes\n*   Recent surgery or trauma\n*   Surgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat, or neck\n\n---\n\n**Community-acquired pneumonia in adults**\n\nYou can get pneumonia from many types of germs.\n\n**Risk factors that increase your chance of getting pneumonia include:**\n\n*   Age: older people are more likely to get pneumonia\n*   Smoking: smoking damages your lungs and makes you more susceptible to pneumonia\n*   Weakened immune system: if your immune system is weakened, you're more likely to get pneumonia\n*   Chronic diseases: certain chronic diseases, such as heart disease or lung disease, can increase your risk of getting pneumonia\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptoms of pneumonia are:\n\n*   Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus)\n*   Fever, which may be mild or high\n*   Shaking chills\n*   Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs or exert yourself)\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n*   Confusion, especially in older people\n*   Excess sweating and clammy skin\n*   Headache\n*   Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue\n*   Malaise (not feeling well)\n*   Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough\n*   White nail syndrome, or leukonychia\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds when listening to your chest with a stethoscope. Tapping on your chest wall (percussion) helps your provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds in your chest.\n\nIf pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a chest x-ray.\n\nOther tests that may be ordered include:\n\n*   Arterial blood gases to see if enough oxygen is getting into your blood from the lungs.\n*   Blood and sputum cultures to look for the germ that may be causing the pneumonia.\n*   CBC to check white blood cell count.\n*   CT scan of the chest.\n*   Bronchoscopy in which a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the end passed down to your lungs in selected cases.\n*   Thoracentesis which involves removing fluid from the space between the outside lining of the lungs and the chest wall.\n*   Nasopharyngeal swab to assess for viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider must first decide whether you need to be in the hospital. If you are treated in the hospital, you will receive:\n\nFluids and antibiotics (or antivirals) through your veins\nOxygen therapy\nBreathing treatments (possibly)\n\nIf you are diagnosed with a bacterial form of pneumonia, it is important that you are started on antibiotics very soon after you are admitted. If you have viral pneumonia, you will not receive antibiotics. This is because antibiotics do not kill viruses. You may receive other medicines, such as antivirals, if you have the flu or other type of viral pneumonia.\n\nYou are more likely to need to be admitted to the hospital if you:\n\nHave another serious medical problem\nHave severe symptoms\nAre unable to care for yourself at home, or are unable to eat or drink\nAre 65 years or older\nHave been taking antibiotics at home and are not getting better\n\nMost people can be treated at home. If so, your provider may tell you to take medicines such as antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more.\n\nWhen taking antibiotics:\n\nDo not miss any doses. Take the medicine until it is gone, even when you start to feel better.\nDo not take cough medicine or cold medicine unless your provider says it is OK. Coughing helps your body get rid of mucus from your lungs.\n\nBreathing warm, moist (wet) air helps loosen the sticky mucus that may make you feel like you are choking. These things may help:\n\nPlace a warm, wet washcloth loosely over your nose and mouth.\nFill a humidifier with warm water and breathe in the warm mist.\nTake a couple of deep breaths 2 or 3 times every hour. Deep breaths will help open up your lungs.\nTap your chest gently a few times a day while lying with your head lower than your chest. This helps bring up mucus from the lungs so that you can cough it out.\n\nDrink plenty of liquids, as long as your provider says it is OK.\n\nDrink water, juice, or weak tea\nDrink at least 6 to 10 cups (1.4 to 2.4 liters) a day\nDo not drink alcohol\n\nGet plenty of rest when you go home. If you have trouble sleeping at night, take naps during the day.\n\n---\n\n**Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen you go home, get plenty of rest.

    "content": "**Compartment Syndrome**\n\n**What is Compartment Syndrome?**\n\nAcute compartment syndrome is a serious condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment. It can lead to problems with blood flow to the affected area leading to muscle and nerve damage.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThick layers of tissue, called fascia, separate groups of muscles in the arms and legs from each other. Inside each layer of fascia is a confined space, called a compartment. The compartment includes the muscle tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. Fascia surrounds these structures, similar to the way in which insulation covers wires.\n\nFascia do not expand. Any swelling in a compartment will lead to increased pressure in that area. This raised pressure, presses the muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. If this pressure is high enough, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked. This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves. If the pressure lasts long enough, the muscles may die and the arm or leg will no longer work. Surgery or even amputation may be needed to correct the problem.\n\nAcute compartment syndrome may be caused by:\n\n*   Trauma, such as a crush injury or surgery\n*   Broken bone\n*   Very bruised muscle\n*   Severe sprain\n*   A cast or bandage that is too tight\n*   Loss of blood supply due to the use of a tourniquet or positioning during surgery\n\n**Exertional Compartment Syndrome**\n\nExertional compartment syndrome can be caused by repetitive activities, such as running. The pressure in a compartment only increases during that activity and goes down after the activity is stopped. This condition is usually less limiting and does not lead to loss of function or limb. However, the pain can limit activity and endurance. There is usually no permanent injury to the limb.\n\n**Compartment Syndrome Locations**\n\nCompartment syndrome is most common in the lower leg and forearm. It can also occur in the hand, foot, thigh, buttocks, and upper arm.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of compartment syndrome are sometimes not easy to detect. With an acute injury, the symptoms can become severe within a few hours.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Pain that is much higher than expected with the injury\n*   Severe pain that doesn't go away after taking pain medicine or raising the affected area\n*   Decreased sensation, numbness, tingling, weakness of the affected area\n*   Paleness of the skin (pallor)\n*   Swelling or inability to move the affected part\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe aim of treatment is to prevent permanent damage. For acute compartment syndrome, surgery is needed right away. Delaying surgery can lead to permanent damage. The surgery is called fasciotomy and involves cutting the fascia to relieve pressure.\n\nFor chronic compartment syndrome:\n\n*   If a cast or bandage is too tight, it should be cut or loosened to relieve the pressure\n*   Stopping the repetitive activity or exercise, or changing the way it's done\n*   Raising the affected area above heart level to decrease swelling\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith prompt diagnosis and treatment, the outlook is excellent and the muscles and nerves inside the compartment will recover. However, the overall outlook is determined by the injury that led to the syndrome.\n\nIf the diagnosis is delayed, permanent nerve injury and loss of muscle function can result. This is more common when the injured person is unconscious or heavily sedated and cannot complain of pain. Permanent nerve injury can occur after less than 12 to 24 hours of compression. Muscle injuries can occur even faster.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include permanent injury to nerves and muscles that can dramatically impair function. This is called Volkmann ischemic contracture if it occurs in the forearm.\n\nIn more severe cases, amputation may be required.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have had an injury and have severe swelling or pain that does not improve with pain medicines.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is probably no way to prevent this condition. Early diagnosis and treatment helps prevent many of the complications. At times, fasciotomies are performed earlier to avoid compartment syndrome from occurring in the case of severe trauma.\n\nIf you wear a cast, see your provider or go to the emergency room if pain under the cast increases, even after you have taken pain medicines and raised the area.\n\n---\n\n**Compartment Syndrome**\n\n**What is Compartment Syndrome?**\n\nCompartment syndrome is a serious condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment, leading to problems with blood flow to the affected area, resulting in muscle and nerve damage.\n\n**Causes of Acute Compartment Syndrome**\n\nAcute compartment syndrome may be caused by:\n\n*   Trauma, such as a crush injury or surgery\n*   Broken bone\n*   Very bruised muscle\n*   Severe sprain\n*   A cast or bandage that is too tight\n*   Loss of blood supply due to the use of a tourniquet or positioning during surgery\n\n**Causes of Exertional Compartment Syndrome**\n\nExertional compartment syndrome can be caused by repetitive activities, such as running.

For acute compartment syndrome of the limb, the person is often unable to flex or extend the joint above or below the area.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, the provider may need to measure the pressure in the compartment. This is done using a needle placed into the affected body area. The needle is attached to a pressure meter.

    "content": "**Complement Blood Test**\n\n\\n\\nWhat is a complement blood test?\n\nA complement blood test measures the levels and/or activity of a group of proteins that are part of the complement system. This system \"complements\" or enhances your body's defenses against infections and other diseases. Your immune system makes antibodies, which are proteins to fight disease-causing substances like viruses and bacteria. The proteins in the complement system will also help fight the infection or disease. These proteins work together in a sequence, with one protein activating the next.\n\nThere are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. Complement proteins may be measured individually or together:\n\nC3 and C4 proteins are the most commonly tested individual complement proteins.\nA CH50 test (sometimes called CH100 or a total complement test) measures the total activity and levels of all the major complement proteins.\nIf the CH50 level is not normal, each of the nine complement levels can be measured individually to find out which one is abnormal.\n\nIf the test shows that your complement protein levels are not normal or that the proteins aren't working with the immune system as well as they should, it can be a sign of an autoimmune disease or other health condition. If you have an autoimmune disease your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.\n\nOther names: complement antigen, compliment activity C3, C4, CH50, CH100, C1 C1q, C2, total complement test\n\n\\n\\nWhat is it used for?\n\nA complement blood test is most often used to diagnose or monitor autoimmune diseases such as:\n\nLupus, a chronic (long-lasting) disease that affects many parts of the body, including the joints, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain\nRheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes pain and swelling of the joints, often in the wrist, hands, and feet\n\nIt may also be used to help diagnose certain bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.\n\n\\n\\nWhy do I need a complement blood test?\n\nYour health care provider may order complement blood test if you have an autoimmune disease such as lupus.

This article describes the test that measures C3.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nBlood is drawn from a vein, most often from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The procedure involves:\n\n*   Cleaning the site with an antiseptic\n*   Wrapping an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure and make the vein swell with blood\n*   Gently inserting a needle into the vein\n*   Collecting the blood into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle\n*   Removing the needle and covering the puncture site to stop any bleeding\n\nIn infants or young children, a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain, while others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nC3 and C4 are the most commonly measured complement components. A complement test may be used to monitor people with an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus erythematosus, to see if treatment is working. The test may also be done for conditions like fungal infections, gram negative septicemia, parasitic infections, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and shock.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range for C3 is 88 to 201 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 0.88 to 2.01 g/L. Note that normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, so it's best to discuss the meaning of your specific test results with your provider.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIncreased complement activity may be seen in cancer and ulcerative colitis. Decreased complement activity may be seen in bacterial infections (especially Neisseria), cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, hereditary angioedema, kidney transplant rejection, lupus nephritis, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rare inherited complement deficiencies.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection.\n\n---\n\n**Complement Component 3 (C3) Test**\n\n**What is Complement Component 3 (C3)?**\n\nComplement component 3 (C3) is a blood test that measures the activity of a certain protein. This protein is part of the complement system, which is a group of nearly 60 proteins that work with your immune system to protect the body from infections and remove dead cells and foreign material.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nBlood is drawn from a vein, most often from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with an antiseptic, and a needle is inserted into the vein to collect blood into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle.\n\n**How Long Does the Test Take?**\n\nThe test takes only a few minutes to perform.\n\n**Is There Any Special Preparation Needed?**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\n\n**What Does the Test Measure?**\n\nThe test measures the activity of complement component 3 (C3), which is an important part of the complement system.\n\n**Why Is the Test Performed?**\n\nThe test may be used to monitor people with autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, to see if treatment for their condition is working. It may also be done to diagnose or monitor other conditions, including fungal infections, gram-negative septicemia, parasitic infections, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and shock.\n\n**What Are the Risks Associated with Having Blood Drawn?**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken).\n\n**How Will I Feel During the Test?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nIncreased complement activity may be seen in cancer and ulcerative colitis. Decreased complement activity may be seen in bacterial infections (especially Neisseria), cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, hereditary angioedema, kidney transplant rejection, lupus nephritis, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rare inherited complement deficiencies.\n\n---\n\n**Complement Component 3 (C3)**\n\n**What is Complement Component 3 (C3)?**\n\nComplement component 3 (C3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It is part of the complement system, which helps to eliminate pathogens and damaged cells from the body.\n\n**How is C3 measured?**\n\nC3 levels are typically measured through blood tests. The test measures the amount of C3 present in the blood, usually expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or grams per liter (g/L).\n\n**What are the normal results for a C3 test?**\n\nThe normal range for C3 is 88 to 201 mg/dL (0.88 to 2.01 g/L). However, it's essential to note that normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n**When is a C3 test ordered?**\n\nA C3 test may be ordered to:\n\n* Diagnose or monitor conditions such as lupus erythematosus, fungal infections, gram-negative septicemia, parasitic infections (e.g., malaria), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), shock, and autoimmune disorders.\n* Identify rare inherited complement deficiencies.\n\n**What do abnormal C3 test results mean?**\n\nAbnormal C3 test results may indicate:\n\n* Increased complement activity: seen in conditions such as cancer and ulcerative colitis.\n* Decreased complement activity: seen in bacterial infections (especially Neisseria), cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, hereditary angioedema, kidney transplant rejection, lupus nephritis, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rare inherited complement deficiencies.\n\n**Risks associated with a C3 test**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn for a C3 test are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken).\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe complement cascade is a series of reactions that take place in the blood. The cascade activates the complement proteins, resulting in an attack unit that creates holes in the membrane of bacteria, killing them. C3 attaches to bacteria and kills them directly.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nC3\n\n**References**\n\nAtkinson JP. Complement system in disease. In: Goldman L, Schafer AI, eds.

The sample is sent to a laboratory where a method called complement fixation is used to check if the body has produced substances called antibodies to a specific foreign substance (antigen), in this case, C burnetii. Antibodies defend the body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. If the antibodies are present, they stick, or \"fix\" themselves, to the antigen. This is why the test is called \"fixation.\"\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.

This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to detect Q fever.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nAbsence of antibodies to C burnetii is normal. It means you do not have Q fever now or in the past.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal result means you may have a current infection with C burnetii, or that you have been exposed to the bacteria in the past. People with past exposure may have antibodies, even if they are not aware that they were exposed.

    "content": "**What is a Complete Blood Count?**\n\nA complete blood count, or CBC, is a group of blood tests that measure the number and size of the different cells in your blood. A CBC measures:\n\n* Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\n* White blood cells, which fight infections and other diseases. There are five major types of white blood cells. A CBC test measures the total number of white cells in your blood. A different test called a CBC with differential measures the number of each type of these white blood cells.\n* Platelets, which stop bleeding by helping your blood to clot.\n* Hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\n* Hematocrit, the amount of whole blood that is made up of red blood cells.\n* Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), the average size of your red blood cells.\n\nOther names for a complete blood count: CBC, full blood count, blood cell count\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA complete blood count is often part of a routine checkup. It is also used to monitor a condition or treatment that may affect your blood cell counts such as infections, anemia, immune system disorders, and blood cancers.\n\n**Why do I need a complete blood count?**\n\nYour health care provider may have ordered a complete blood count as part of your checkup or to monitor your overall health. The test may also be used to:\n\n* Help diagnose blood diseases, infections, immune system disorders, or other medical conditions\n* Check for changes in an existing blood disorder\n\n**What happens during a complete blood count?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nUsually, no special preparation is necessary for a complete blood count. But if your provider ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle went in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA CBC counts the cells in your blood. There are many reasons your levels may not be in the normal range. For example:\n\n* Abnormal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, or hematocrit may be a sign of dehydration, anemia, heart disease, or too little iron in your body.\n* A low white cell count may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder, bone marrow disorder, or cancer.\n* A high white cell count may be a sign of an infection or a reaction to a medicine.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**\n\nA complete blood count, also known as a CBC, is a test that measures the different components of your blood. It's used to diagnose and monitor various medical conditions, such as anemia, infections, and cancer.\n\n**What does a CBC measure?**\n\n* Red blood cells\n* White blood cells\n* Platelets\n\n**Abnormal results**\n\nIf any of your levels are abnormal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Diet, activity level, medicines, having a menstrual period, not drinking enough water, and other factors can affect the results.\n\n**What does a low white cell count indicate?**\n\nA low white cell count may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder, bone marrow disorder, or cancer.\n\n**What does a high white cell count indicate?**\n\nA high white cell count may be a sign of an infection or a reaction to a medicine.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a complete blood count?**\n\nA complete blood count is only one tool your provider uses to learn about your health. Your provider will consider your medical history, symptoms, and other factors to make a diagnosis. You may also need additional tests.\n\n**References**\n\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* El Brihi J, Pathak S.

    "content": "**Complex Regional Pain Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?**\n\nComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a long-term (chronic) pain condition that can affect any area of the body, but often affects an arm or a leg.\n\n**Causes of CRPS**\n\nHealth care providers are not sure what causes CRPS. In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.\n\nCRPS has two forms:\n\n*   **CRPS 1**: A chronic nerve disorder that occurs most often in the arms or legs after a minor injury.\n*   **CRPS 2**: Caused by an injury to a nerve.\n\nCRPS is thought to result from damage to the nervous system. This includes the nerves that control the blood vessels and sweat glands.\n\nThe damaged nerves are no longer able to properly control blood flow, feeling (sensation), and temperature to the affected area. This leads to problems in the:\n\n*   **Blood vessels**\n*   **Bones**\n*   **Muscles**\n*   **Nerves**\n*   **Skin**\n\nPossible causes of CRPS include:\n\n*   Injury directly to a nerve\n*   Injury or infection in an arm or leg\n\nIn rare cases, sudden illnesses such as a heart attack or stroke can cause CRPS. The condition can sometimes appear without obvious injury to the affected limb.\n\n**Symptoms of CRPS**\n\nThe key symptom is pain that:\n\nIs intense and often burning and is much stronger than would be expected for the type of injury that occurred.\nGets worse, rather than better over time.\nBegins at the point of injury, but may spread to the whole limb, or to the arm or leg on the opposite side of the body.\n\nIn most cases, CRPS has three stages. But, CRPS does not always follow this pattern. Some people develop severe symptoms right away. Others stay in the first stage.\n\n*   **Stage 1 (lasts 1 to 3 months)**:\n    Changes in skin temperature, switching between warm or cold\n    Faster growth of nails and hair\n    Muscle spasms and joint pain\n    Severe burning, aching pain that worsens with the slightest touch or breeze\n    Skin that slowly becomes blotchy, purple, pale, or red; thin and shiny; swollen; more sweaty\n*   **Stage 2 (lasts 3 to 6 months)**:\n    Continued changes in the skin\n    Nails that are cracked and break more easily\n    Pain that is becoming worse\n    Slower hair growth\n    Stiff joints and weak muscles\n*   **Stage 3 (irreversible changes can be seen)**:\n    Limited movement in limb because of tightened muscles and tendons (contracture)\n    Muscle wasting\n    Pain in the entire limb\n\nIf pain and other symptoms are severe or long-lasting, many people may experience depression or anxiety.\n\n**Exams and Tests for CRPS**\n\nDiagnosing CRPS can be difficult, but early diagnosis is very important.\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:\n\n*   A test to show temperature changes and lack of blood supply in the affected limb (thermography)\n*   Bone scans\n*   Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (usually done together)\n*   X-rays\n*   Autonomic nerve testing (measures sweating and blood pressure)\n\n**Treatment for CRPS**\n\nThere is no cure for CRPS, but the disease can be slowed. The main focus is on relieving the symptoms and helping people with this syndrome live as normal a life as possible.\n\nPhysical and occupational therapy should be started as early as possible. Starting an exercise program and learning to keep joints and muscles moving may prevent the disease from getting worse. It can also help you do everyday activities.\n\nMedicines may be used, including pain medicines, corticosteroids, certain blood pressure medicines, bone loss medicines and antidepressants.\n\nSome type of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy, can help teach the skills needed to live with long-term (chronic) pain.\n\nSurgical or invasive techniques that may be tried:\n\n*   Injected medicine that numbs the affected nerves or pain fibers around the spinal column (nerve block).\n*   Internal pain pump that directly delivers medicines to the spinal cord (intrathecal drug pump).\n*   Spinal cord stimulator, which involves placing electrodes (electrical leads) next to the spinal cord. A low-level electrical current is used to create a pleasant or tingling sensation in the painful area is the best way to reduce pain in some people.\n*   Surgery that cuts the nerves to destroy the pain (surgical sympathectomy), although it is unclear how many people this helps. It may also make symptoms worse in some people.\n\n**Outlook for CRPS**\n\nThe outlook is better with an early diagnosis. If your provider diagnoses the condition in the first stage, sometimes signs of the disease may disappear (remission) and normal movement is possible.\n\nIf the condition is not diagnosed quickly, changes to the bone and muscle may get worse and may not be reversible.\n\nIn some people, symptoms go away on their own. In other people, even with treatment the pain continues and the condition causes crippling, irreversible changes.\n\n**Possible Complications of CRPS**\n\nComplications that may result include:\n\n*   Problems with thinking and judgment\n*   Depression\n*   Loss of muscle size or strength in the affected limb\n*   Spread of the disease to another part of the body\n*   Worsening of the affected limb\n\nComplications can also occur with some of the nerve and surgical treatments.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop constant or burning pain in an arm, leg, hand, or foot.\n\n**Prevention of CRPS**\n\nThere is no known prevention at this time. Early treatment is the key to slowing the progression of the disease.\n\n**Alternative Names for CRPS**\n\nCRPS; RSDS; Causalgia - RSD; Shoulder-hand syndrome; Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome; Sudeck atrophy; Pain - CRPS\n\n---\n\n**Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)**\n\n**What is CRPS?**\n\nComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a long-term (chronic) pain condition that can affect any area of the body, but often affects an arm or a leg.\n\n**Causes of CRPS**\n\nHealth care providers are not sure what causes CRPS. In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.\n\nCRPS has two forms:\n\n*   **CRPS 1**: A chronic nerve disorder that occurs most often in the arms or legs after a minor injury.\n*   **CRPS 2**: Caused by an injury to a nerve.\n\n**Symptoms of CRPS**\n\nThe key symptom is pain that:\n\n*   Is intense and often burning\n*   Gets worse, rather than better over time\n*   Begins at the point of injury, but may spread to the whole limb, or to the arm or leg on the opposite side of the body\n\nIn most cases, CRPS has three stages. But, CRPS does not always follow this pattern. Some people develop severe symptoms right away. Others stay in the first stage.\n\n**Stage 1 (lasts 1 to 3 months)**\n\n*   Changes in skin temperature, switching between warm or cold\n*   Faster growth of nails and hair\n*   Muscle spasms and joint pain\n*   Severe burning, aching pain that worsens with the slightest touch or breeze\n*   Skin that slowly becomes blotchy, purple, pale, or red; thin and shiny; swollen; more sweaty\n\n**Stage 2 (lasts 3 to 6 months)**\n\n*   Continued changes in the skin\n*   Nails that are cracked and break more easily\n*   Pain that is becoming worse\n*   Slower hair growth\n*   Stiff joints and weak muscles\n\n**Stage 3 (irreversible changes can be seen)**\n\n*   Limited movement in limb because of tightened muscles and tendons (contracture)\n*   Muscle wasting\n*   Pain in the entire limb\n\nIf pain and other symptoms are severe or long-lasting, many people may experience depression or anxiety.\n\n**Diagnosing CRPS**\n\nDiagnosing CRPS can be difficult, but early diagnosis is very important. Your provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:\n\n*   A test to show temperature changes and lack of blood supply in the affected limb (thermography)\n*   Bone scans\n*   Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (usually done together)\n*   X-rays\n*   Autonomic nerve testing (measures sweating and blood pressure)\n\n**Treatment for CRPS**\n\nThere is no cure for CRPS, but the disease can be slowed. The main focus is on relieving the symptoms and helping people with this syndrome live as normal a life as possible.\n\nPhysical and occupational therapy should be started as early as possible. Starting an exercise program and learning to keep joints and muscles moving may prevent the disease from getting worse. It can also help you do everyday activities.\n\nMedicines may be used, including pain medicines, corticosteroids, certain blood pressure medicines, bone loss medicines and antidepressants.\n\nSome type of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy, can help teach the skills needed to live with long-term (chronic) pain.\n\nSurgical or invasive techniques that may be tried:\n\n*   Injected medicine that numbs the affected nerves or pain fibers around the spinal column (nerve block).\n*   Internal pain pump that directly delivers medicines to the spinal cord (intrathecal drug pump).\n*   Spinal cord stimulator, which involves placing electrodes (electrical leads) next to the spinal cord. A low-level electrical current is used to create a pleasant or tingling sensation in the painful area is the best way to reduce pain in some people.\n*   Surgery that cuts the nerves to destroy the pain (surgical sympathectomy), although it is unclear how many people this helps. It may also make symptoms worse in some people.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook is better with an early diagnosis. If your provider diagnoses the condition in the first stage, sometimes signs of the disease may disappear (remission) and normal movement is possible.\n\nIf the condition is not diagnosed quickly, changes to the bone and muscle may get worse and may not be reversible.\n\nIn some people, symptoms go away on their own. In other people, even with treatment the pain continues and the condition causes crippling, irreversible changes.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result include:\n\n*   Problems with thinking and judgment\n*   Depression\n*   Loss of muscle size or strength in the affected limb\n*   Spread of the disease to another part of the body\n*   Worsening of the affected limb\n\nComplications can also occur with some of the nerve and surgical treatments.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop constant or burning pain in an arm, leg, hand, or foot.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention at this time.

    "content": "**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**\n\n\\n\\nWhat is a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)?\n\nA comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a routine blood test that measures 14 different substances in a sample of your blood. It provides important information about your metabolism (how your body uses food and energy) and the balance of certain chemicals in your body.\n\n**What does a CMP include?**\n\nA CMP includes tests that measure your blood levels of:\n\n* Glucose, also called \"blood sugar.\" Glucose is your body's main source of energy.\n* Calcium. This is one of the most important minerals in your body. Most of it is stored in your bones and teeth. Having the right amount of calcium in your blood is necessary for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work properly.\n* Sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and chloride. These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluid in your body. They also help control the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body.\n* Albumin. This is the main protein in your blood. It's made in your liver.\n* Total protein. This is the total amount of protein in your blood. It includes albumin and globulins, which are mainly made in your liver.\n* ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are types of enzymes that are mainly made in your liver. Enzymes are proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body.\n* Bilirubin. This is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down old red blood cells. Your liver removes most of the bilirubin from your body.\n* BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine. These are waste products that your kidneys filter out of your blood and remove from your body through urine (pee).\n\n**What is a CMP used for?**\n\nA CMP is commonly used as part of a routine checkup. It can provide information about your overall health and help find certain conditions before you have symptoms. For example, a CMP can check your:\n\n* Liver and kidney health\n* Blood glucose\n* Protein levels\n* Fluid and electrolyte balance, which can affect the acid-base balance in your blood\n* Metabolism\n\nA CMP may also be used to help:\n\n* Diagnose the cause of certain symptoms you may have\n* Guide treatment for many diseases\n* Check to see if treatment is working and/or if it's causing certain side effects\n\n**Why do I need a CMP?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a CMP as part of a routine checkup. You may also need this test if you:\n\n* Have signs or symptoms that could be caused by liver or kidney disease, or metabolic disorders\n* Have a general symptom, such as fatigue, that could be caused by many different types of conditions\n* Had an abnormal CMP result in the past\n* Are being treated for certain medical conditions and your provider wants to find out if your treatment is working and/or affecting your liver or kidneys\n\n**What happens during a CMP?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of your CMP test will usually list the levels of each of the 14 substances that were measured. To understand what your results mean, your provider will compare all the results. Your provider will also consider your health history, any medicines you take, and other things that could affect your test results. Ask your provider to explain what your CMP results say about your health.\n\nIn general, if you have one or more results that aren't normal, it may be a sign of a health condition. For example, high blood glucose may be a sign of diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**\n\n**What is a CMP?**\n\nA Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, or CMP, is a blood test that measures the levels of various substances in your blood. It's used to help diagnose and monitor certain medical conditions.\n\n**When is a CMP ordered?**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order a CMP if you have signs or symptoms that could be caused by liver or kidney disease, or metabolic disorders. You may also need this test if you have a general symptom, such as fatigue, that could be caused by many different types of conditions.\n\n**How is a CMP performed?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

For example, high blood glucose may be a sign of diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CMP?**\n\nAnother test called a basic metabolic panel (BMP) is similar to a CMP. A BMP includes 8 of the 14 tests that are part of a CMP. A BMP does not include a measurement of:\n\n* Total protein\n* Albumin\n* Bilirubin\n* Liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, and AST)\n\nYour provider may choose a CMP or a BMP, depending on your health history and needs.\n\n**References**\n\nCleveland Clinic: Health Library [Internet].

After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of your CMP test will usually list the levels of each of the 14 substances that were measured. To understand what your results mean, your provider will compare all the results. Your provider will also consider your health history, any medicines you take, and other things that could affect your test results.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CMP?**\n\nAnother test called a basic metabolic panel (BMP) is similar to a CMP. A BMP includes 8 of the 14 tests that are part of a CMP. A BMP does not include a measurement of:\n\n* Total protein\n* Albumin\n* Bilirubin\n* Liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, and AST)\n\nYour provider may choose a CMP or a BMP, depending on your health history and needs.\n\n**References**\n\nCleveland Clinic: Health Library [Internet].

    "content": "**Compression Fractures of the Back**\n\nCompression fractures of the back are broken vertebrae. Vertebrae are the bones of the spine.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Osteoporosis is the most common cause of this type of fracture.\n* Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile due to loss of calcium and other minerals with age.\n* Other causes of compression fractures may include:\n\t+ Trauma to the back\n\t+ Tumors that spread to the bone from elsewhere\n\t+ Tumors that start in the spine, such as multiple myeloma\n\nHaving many fractures of the vertebrae can lead to kyphosis, a hump-like curvature of the spine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCompression fractures can occur suddenly and cause severe back pain. The pain is most commonly felt in the middle or lower spine and can also be felt on the sides or in the front of the spine. It's often sharp and \"knife-like,\" disabling, and takes weeks to months to go away.\n\nCompression fractures due to osteoporosis may cause no symptoms at first but over time may lead to:\n\n* Back pain that starts slowly and gets worse with walking\n* Loss of height, up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) over time\n* Stooped-over posture or kyphosis, also called a dowager's hump\n\nPressure on the spinal cord from hunched over posture can cause numbness, tingling, weakness, difficulty walking, and loss of control of the bowel or bladder in rare cases.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam that may show:\n\n* A humpback or kyphosis\n* Tenderness over the affected spinal bone or bones\n* Loss of height\n\nA spine x-ray may show at least 1 compressed vertebra that is shorter than the other vertebrae. Other tests that may be done include:\n\n---\n\n**Compression Fractures of the Back**\n\nCompression fractures of the back are broken vertebrae.

This may show:\n\n*   A humpback, or kyphosis\n*   Tenderness over the affected spinal bone or bones\n*   Loss of height\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n*   A bone density test to evaluate for osteoporosis\n*   A CT or MRI scan, if there is a concern that the fracture was caused by a tumor or severe trauma (such as a fall or car accident) or if there are symptoms of nerve damage\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost compression fractures are seen in older people with osteoporosis. These fractures often do not cause injury to the spinal cord. The condition is usually treated with medicines and calcium supplements to prevent further fractures.\n\nPain may be treated with:\n\n*   Pain medicine\n*   Bed rest\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n*   Back braces, but these may further weaken the bones and increase the risk for more fractures\n*   Physical therapy to improve movement and strength around the spine\n*   A medicine called calcitonin to help relieve bone pain\n\nSurgery may be done if you have severe and disabling pain for more than 2 months that does not get better with other treatments. Surgery can include:\n\n*   Balloon kyphoplasty\n*   Vertebroplasty\n*   Spinal fusion\n\nOther surgery may be done to remove bone if the fracture is due to a tumor.\n\nAfter surgery you may need:\n\n*   A brace for 6 to 10 weeks if the fracture was due to an injury.\n*   More surgery to join spine bones together or to relieve pressure on a nerve.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost compression fractures due to injury heal in 8 to 10 weeks with rest, wearing of a brace, and pain medicines. However, recovery can take much longer if surgery was done. You will lose some height and have a more bent back.\n\nFractures due to osteoporosis often become less painful with rest and pain medicines. Some fractures, though, can lead to long-term (chronic) pain and disability.\n\nMedicines to treat osteoporosis can help prevent future fractures. However, medicines cannot reverse damage that has already occurred.\n\nFor compression fractures caused by tumors, the outcome depends on the type of tumor involved. Tumors that involve the spine include:\n\n*   Breast cancer\n*   Lung cancer\n*   Lymphoma\n*   Prostate cancer\n*   Multiple myeloma\n*   Hemangioma\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Failure of the bones to fuse after surgery\n*   Humpback\n*   Spinal cord or nerve root compression\n\n---\n\n**Compression Fractures of the Back**\n\n**Prevention is Key**\n\nThe most effective way to prevent compression or insufficiency fractures is to take steps to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Getting regular load-bearing exercise, such as walking, can help you avoid bone loss.\n\n**Screening for Osteoporosis**\n\nWomen should have their bone density checked at age 65, or earlier if they are at increased risk for osteoporosis.\n\n**Understanding Compression Fractures**\n\nCompression fractures occur when a vertebra collapses due to osteoporotic changes. This type of fracture is common in people with osteoporosis and can cause back pain.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Back Injuries\n*   Osteoporosis\n*   Spine Injuries and Disorders",

    "content": "**Compulsive Gambling**\n\nCompulsive gambling is being unable to resist impulses to gamble. This can lead to severe money problems, job loss, crime or fraud, and damage to family relationships.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nCompulsive gambling most often begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women.\n\nPeople with compulsive gambling have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. The brain is reacting to this impulse in the same manner it reacts to a person addicted to alcohol or illegal drugs. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), compulsive gambling is likely a different condition.\n\nIn people who develop compulsive gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with compulsive gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem. The American Psychiatric Association defines gambling disorder as having 4 or more of the following symptoms:\n\n* Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back or quit gambling.\n* Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or anxiety.\n* Gambling larger amounts of money to try to make back past losses.\n* Losing a job, relationship, education, or career opportunity due to gambling.\n* Lying about the amount of time or money spent on gambling.\n* Making many unsuccessful attempts to cut back or quit gambling.\n* Needing to borrow money due to gambling losses.\n* Needing to gamble larger amounts of money in order to feel excitement.\n* Spending a lot of time thinking about gambling, such as remembering past experiences or ways to get more money with which to gamble.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA psychiatric evaluation and history can be used to diagnose compulsive gambling. Screening tools such as the Gamblers Anonymous 20 Questions at gamblersanonymous.org/20-questions/ can help with the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for people with compulsive gambling begins with recognizing the problem. Compulsive gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment.\n\nMost people with compulsive gambling only get treated when other people pressure them.\n\nTreatment options include:\n\n* Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n* Self-help support groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous.\n* Practices used to treat other types of addiction, such as substance use and alcohol use, can also be helpful in treating compulsive gambling.\n* A few studies have been done on medicines for treating compulsive gambling. Early results suggest that antidepressants and opioid antagonists (naltrexone) may help treat the symptoms of compulsive gambling.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nLike alcohol or substance use disorder, compulsive gambling is a long-term disorder that tends to get worse without treatment. Even with treatment, it's common to start gambling again (relapse). However, people with compulsive gambling can do very well with the right treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Alcohol and illegal drug use problems\n* Anxiety\n* Depression\n* Financial, social, and legal problems (including bankruptcy, divorce, job loss, time in prison)\n* Heart attacks (from the stress and excitement of gambling)\n* Suicide attempts\n\nGetting the right treatment can help prevent many of these problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider or mental health professional if you believe you have symptoms of compulsive gambling.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room.

DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nExposure to gambling may increase the risk of developing compulsive gambling.

    "content": "**Concizumab-mtci Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nConcizumab-mtci is used to reduce or prevent bleeding episodes in patients with certain types of hemophilia.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nConcizumab-mtci injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). It is given once a day. Use at the same time every day.\n\nUse concizumab-mtci injection exactly as directed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nConcizumab-mtci injection helps to control bleeding episodes, but it is not a cure. Continue to use concizumab-mtci injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using concizumab-mtci injection without talking to your doctor.\n\nYour first dose will be a bigger dose and then you will be given a smaller dose daily for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, your doctor will check your labs and then adjust your dose as needed. Your dose after this will be considered your maintenance dose.\n\nYour doctor will show you or your caregiver how to use concizumab-mtci injection. Also carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that come with the medication. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication.\n\nAlways look at the solution before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless (or slightly yellow), but may have some clear or white particles. Do not use concizumab-mtci if it is discolored or if the expiration date on the pen has passed.\n\nNever reuse needles and never share needles or pens. Always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Dispose of needles in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.\n\nYou can inject concizumab-mtci in your thigh or stomach area (at least 2 inches away from your belly button). Change the injection site for each injection every day. Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard, or areas where there are moles, scars, or stretch marks.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Concizumab-mtci Injection**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using concizumab-mtci, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n\nTell your doctor if you have a serious injury or infection or have or have ever had cancer or blood vessel disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. You may be required to have a pregnancy test prior to starting concizumab-mtci. You should use birth control during and for 7 weeks after ending treatment with concizumab-mtci. Talk to your doctor about what birth control is right for you. If you become pregnant while using concizumab-mtci, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using concizumab-mtci injection.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose in the first 4 weeks of treatment contact your doctor. They will tell you how much concizumab-mtci to use.\n\nIf you miss a maintenance dose, then follow these instructions:\n\n* If you miss one dose, continue your regular dosing schedule.\n* If you miss 2–6 doses, use 2 doses as soon as you remember and then continue your usual dose and schedule beginning the next day.\n* If you miss 7 or more maintence doses, contact your doctor right away for instructions about your next doses.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nConcizumab-mtci may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* redness, bruising, or bleeding at the site of injection\n* Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\t+ itching, redness, rash, hives on the skin; tightness of the chest; wheezing\n\t+ swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or hands; difficulty swallowing or breathing; fast heartbeat; dizziness\n\t+ swelling, warmth, pain, or redness of the skin; shortness of breath or chest pain\n\t+ headache, confusion, difficulty with speech or movement, numbness of the face, eye pain or swelling, or vision problems\n\t+ sudden pain in the stomach or back area\n\nConcizumab-mtci may cause other side effects.

Store it in the refrigerator in the original carton to protect from light. Do not freeze or allow it to be close to a refrigerator cooling element.\n\nOnce a concizumab-mtci pen is in use you can store it at room temperature (below 86°F [30°C]) or in the refrigerator. Make a note of the date you first use a concizumab-mtci pen, and dispose of the pen after 28 days, even if there is some solution left in the pen.

    "content": "**Concussion Tests**\n\n\\n\\nWhat are concussion tests?\n\nConcussion tests can help find out if an adult or child has had a concussion after a head injury. A concussion is also called a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).\n\n*   **Causes of Concussions**: A concussion happens when sudden movement causes the brain to bounce around or twist inside the skull. It can be caused by a bump or blow to the head. It may also happen if a hit to the body causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth.\n*   **Symptoms of Concussions**: Symptoms are different for each person, but often include headaches, problems with memory, and changes in how a person thinks, acts, feels, and sleeps.\n\n\\n\\nWhat do concussion tests check?\n\nConcussion tests check:\n\n*   How well your brain processes information. This includes testing memory, problem solving, and other brain functions.\n*   How well your nervous system is working. These tests check balance, muscle coordination, and other physical abilities.\n\n\\n\\nWhy do I need concussion testing?\n\nYou may need concussion testing if you have had a head injury or a blow to the body that jolts your head. Testing may be necessary even if you think the injury isn't serious. That's because it's possible to have a concussion and not even know it.\n\n\\n\\nWhat happens during concussion testing?\n\nTo do concussion testing, a provider will usually use one or more standard concussion tests to learn about the injury and how it's affecting the brain. During the testing, you'll usually:\n\n*   Answer questions about the injury\n*   Take a test to check for problems with learning, memory, thinking, and reasoning\n*   Have a physical exam that checks for problems with vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and reflexes\n\n\\n\\nAre there any risks to the tests?\n\nThere's little risk to having concussion testing. If you have a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly.\n\n\\n\\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nIf concussion testing shows that a head injury has caused a concussion, the treatment is physical and mental rest to help the brain heal. This often includes limiting time spent on electronic screens (televisions, computers, phones, and tablets). It may also be necessary to take two or three days off from school or work.\n\n\\n\\nIs there anything else I need to know about concussion testing?\n\nConcussions are common among children and young adults. Adults age 75 and up also have a higher-than-average risk of concussion because they have a higher risk for falls. But there are steps you can take to prevent concussions at any age, including:\n\n*   Wearing protective gear when playing sports\n*   Being careful when walking or climbing stairs\n*   Avoiding activities that could cause head injuries\n\n---\n\n**Concussion Tests**\n\n\\n\\nA concussion happens when sudden movement causes the brain to bounce around or twist inside the skull. It can be caused by a bump or blow to the head. It may also happen if a hit to the body causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This jolting movement can create chemical changes in the brain. And it can stretch and damage brain cells.\n\n\\n\\nEven though a concussion is a \"mild\" brain injury, it can seriously affect the brain. Most people don't lose consciousness when they have a concussion. But some signs and symptoms usually show up right away after the injury and others may appear hours or days later. Symptoms are different for each person, but often include headaches, problems with memory, and changes in how a person thinks, acts, feels, and sleeps.\n\n\\n\\nThe symptoms of a concussion are usually temporary. With treatment most people feel better in a couple weeks. The main treatment is physical and mental rest. Without proper rest, recovery from a concussion may take longer.\n\n**Types of Concussion Tests**\n\n\\n\\nThere are many types of concussion tests that health care providers use to help diagnose concussions. They usually include questionnaires that you fill out and tests of mental and physical abilities. Some tests have special versions for children. All concussion tests have scoring systems that help show how much an injury has affected the brain. The tests check:\n\n*   How well your brain processes information. This includes testing memory, problem solving, and other brain functions. These tests are often done on a computer or on paper.\n*   How well your nervous system is working. These tests check balance, muscle coordination, and other physical abilities. A provider often does these tests as part of a physical exam.\n\n\\n\\nA concussion will not show up on imaging tests that take pictures of the brain. So, these tests usually aren't needed to diagnose a concussion. But a CT or MRI scan of the brain may be done if there are signs of a more serious brain injury, such as bleeding in the brain.\n\n**What Are Concussion Tests Used For?**\n\n\\n\\nConcussion tests are used after a head injury to see if the injury is affecting brain function. The tests are also be used to monitor recovery after a concussion.\n\nAthletes, including student athletes, may have a routine concussion test at the start of the sports season even when they haven't had a brain injury. This is called a \"baseline test,\" and it's usually done by a trained health care professional.\n\nThe purpose of baseline testing is to have a record of the athlete's normal brain function. Later on, if the athlete has a head injury, a provider can compare the baseline test results with the results of a concussion test done after the injury. This helps to:\n\n*   Confirm or rule out a concussion\n*   Find out how severe a concussion is\n*   Know when an athlete is fully recovered and ready to return to normal activities\n\nBaseline concussion tests are mostly done on athletes who play contacts sports that have a high risk for concussion, such as football and hockey.\n\n**Why Do I Need Concussion Testing?**\n\n\\n\\nYou may need concussion testing if you have had a head injury or a blow to the body that jolts your head. Testing may be necessary even if you think the injury isn't serious. That's because it's possible to have a concussion and not even know it.\n\nConcussion symptoms usually show up soon after a head injury. But sometimes, they don't show up for hours or days. So, it's important to keep watching for signs and symptoms of a concussion for a day or two after a head injury. Signs and symptoms of a concussion include:\n\n*   Appearing dazed or stunned\n*   Clumsy movements\n*   Answering questions slowly\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Fatigue\n*   Confusion\n*   Dizziness\n*   Sensitivity to light and/or blurry or double vision\n*   Changes in sleep and/or mood\n*   Difficulty paying attention\n*   Memory problems\n\nIn rare cases, a dangerous blood clot can form on the brain a day or two after a head injury. This is a medical emergency. Call 911 or go to an emergency department right away if a child or adult has one or more of these symptoms:\n\n---\n\n**Concussion Tests**\n\n\\n\\nIf you or your child has had a head injury, you may need concussion testing. This is especially important if you think the injury isn't serious, because it's possible to have a concussion and not even know it.\n\n**Symptoms of a Concussion**\n\nSigns and symptoms of a concussion include:\n\n*   A headache that gets worse or doesn't go away\n*   Weakness, numbness, decreased coordination, or seizures\n*   Repeated vomiting\n*   Slurred speech and/or unusual behavior\n*   One pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye) that's larger than the other\n*   Confusion\n*   Not being able to wake up, a loss of consciousness, or looking very drowsy\n\nFor infants and toddlers, the symptoms of a concussion are the same as for adults and children, but also include:\n\n*   Crying that won't stop\n*   Not eating or nursing\n\n**What Happens During Concussion Testing?**\n\nTo do concussion testing, a provider will usually use one or more standard concussion tests to learn about the injury and how it's affecting the brain. During the testing, you'll usually:\n\n*   Answer questions about the injury, such as:\n    *   How the head injury happened\n    *   Whether the injured person was unconscious and for how long\n    *   Signs and symptoms after the injury\n*   Take a test, often on a computer, to check for problems with:\n    *   Learning\n    *   Memory\n    *   Thinking and reasoning\n    *   Ability to pay attention\n*   Have a physical exam that checks for problems with:\n    *   Vision and eye movement\n    *   Hearing\n    *   Balance\n    *   Coordination\n    *   Reflexes\n\nIn certain cases, your provider may order a blood test to help decide if a brain scan is needed to check for a more serious injury. The test checks a blood sample for certain proteins that may show up in the bloodstream after a mild concussion.\n\n**Preparing for Concussion Testing**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for concussion testing.\n\n**Risks of Concussion Testing**\n\nThere's little risk to having concussion testing. If you have a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly.\n\n**Interpreting Test Results**\n\nIf concussion testing shows that a head injury has caused a concussion, the treatment is physical and mental rest to help the brain heal. This often includes limiting time spent on electronic screens (televisions, computers, phones, and tablets). It may also be necessary to take two or three days off from school or work.\n\nAsk your provider about a recovery plan, including how to relieve symptoms. As symptoms improve, physical and mental activities can gradually be increased. But it's important to make sure that the concussion is fully healed before returning to all usual activities. That's because having a second concussion before the first has healed can cause serious brain damage.\n\n**Preventing Concussions**\n\nConcussions are common among children and young adults. Adults age 75 and up also have a higher-than-average risk of concussion because they have a higher risk for falls. But there are steps you can take to prevent concussions at any age, including:\n\n*   Wearing the correct helmet and making sure it fits when you or your child play sports such as biking, skiing, skating, hockey, football, and batting in baseball or softball\n*   Wearing seat belts\n*   Preventing falls by keeping your home well-lit, removing tripping hazards, and using nonslip mats and grab bars in the bathroom\n*   Making home and play areas safe for young children:\n    *   Making sure playgrounds have shock-absorbing material, such as mulch or sand\n    *   Installing window guards\n    *   Using safety gates on stairs\n\n---\n\n**Concussions: A Growing Concern**\n\nAs we've discussed in previous sections, concussions are a serious concern that affects people of all ages. In this section, we'll explore the importance of concussion tests and how they can help prevent long-term damage.\n\n**Who's at Risk?**\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that age 75 and up also have a higher-than-average risk of concussion because they have a higher risk for falls. But there are steps you can take to prevent concussions at any age, including:\n\n*   **Proper training**: Make sure you're properly trained in concussion prevention and response.\n*   **Equipment checks**: Regularly check your equipment to ensure it's in good condition and functioning properly.\n*   **Warm-up and cool-down routines**: Incorporate warm-up and cool-down routines into your practice or game schedule to help prevent injuries.\n*   **Concussion education**: Educate yourself and others on the signs and symptoms of concussions.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help reduce the risk of concussion and ensure a safer experience for everyone involved.\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).

Do not give aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Naproxen), or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*   **Diet and Rest**: Feed your child foods that are easy to digest. Light activity around the home is OK. Your child needs rest but does not need to stay in bed.\n*   **Preventing Further Injury**: It is very important that your child does not do anything that results in another, or similar, head injury. It is especially important to wear a seat belt to reduce risk of head trauma in event of an accident.\n\n**Monitoring Your Child's Condition**\n\nWhen you go home from the emergency room, it is OK for your child to sleep:\n\n*   For the first 12 hours, you may want to wake up your child briefly every 2 or 3 hours.\n*   Ask a simple question, such as your child's name, and look for any other changes in the way your child looks or acts.\n*   Make sure the pupils of your child's eyes are the same size and get smaller when you shine a light in them.\n\nAsk your provider for how long you need to do this.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to School**\n\nAs long as your child has symptoms, they should avoid sports, hard play at recess, being overly active, and physical education class. Ask your provider when your child can return to their normal activities.\n\nMake sure your child's teacher, physical education teacher, coaches, and school nurse are aware of the recent injury.\n\nTalk to teachers about helping your child catch up on school work. Also ask about timing of tests or major projects. Teachers should also understand that your child may be more tired, withdrawn, easily upset, or confused. Your child may also have a hard time with tasks that require remembering or concentrating. Your child may have mild headaches and be less tolerant of noise. If your child has symptoms in school, have them stay home until feeling better.\n\nTalk with teachers about:\n\n* Not having your child make up all of their missed work right away\n* Reducing the amount of homework or class work your child does for a while\n* Allowing rest times during the day\n* Allowing your child to turn assignments in late\n* Giving your child extra time to study and complete tests\n* Being patient with your child's behaviors as they recover\n\nBased on how bad the head injury was, your child may need to wait 1 to 3 months before doing the following activities. Ask your child's provider about:\n\n* Playing contact sports, such as football, hockey, and soccer\n* Riding a bicycle, motorcycle, or off-road vehicle\n* Driving a car (if they are old enough and licensed)\n* Skiing, snowboarding, skating, skateboarding, gymnastics, or martial arts\n* Participating in any activity where there is a risk of hitting the head or of a jolt to the head\n\nSome organizations recommend that your child stay away from sports activities that could produce a similar head injury, for the rest of the season.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf symptoms do not go away or are not improving a lot after 2 or 3 weeks, follow-up with your child's provider.\n\nContact your provider if your child has:\n\n* A stiff neck\n* Clear fluid or blood leaking from the nose or ears\n* Any change in awareness, a hard time waking up, or has become more sleepy\n* A headache that is getting worse, lasts a long time, or is not relieved by acetaminophen (Tylenol)\n* Fever\n* Vomiting more than 3 times\n* Problems moving arms, walking, or talking\n* Changes in speech (slurred, difficult to understand, does not make sense)\n* Problems thinking straight or feeling foggy\n* Seizures (jerking arms or legs without control)\n* Changes in behavior or unusual behavior\n* Double vision\n* Changes in nursing or eating patterns\n\n---\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf symptoms do not go away or are not improving a lot after 2 or 3 weeks, follow-up with your child's provider.\n\nContact your provider if your child has:\n\n* A stiff neck\n* Clear fluid or blood leaking from the nose or ears\n* Any change in awareness, a hard time waking up, or has become more sleepy\n* A headache that is getting worse, lasts a long time, or is not relieved by acetaminophen (Tylenol)\n* Fever\n* Vomiting more than 3 times\n* Problems moving arms, walking, or talking\n* Changes in speech (slurred, difficult to understand, does not make sense)\n* Problems thinking straight or feeling foggy\n* Seizures (jerking arms or legs without control)\n* Changes in behavior or unusual behavior\n* Double vision\n* Changes in nursing or eating patterns\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMild brain injury in children - discharge; Brain injury in children - discharge; Mild traumatic brain injury in children - discharge; Closed head injury in children - discharge; TBI in children - discharge\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Condoms - Male**\n\nA condom is a thin cover worn on the penis during intercourse. Using a condom will help prevent:\n\n* Female partners from becoming pregnant\n* Getting an infection spread through sexual contact, or from giving one to your partner. These infections include herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and warts.\n\n**Information**\n\nThe male condom is a thin cover that fits over a man's erect penis. Condoms are made of:\n\n* Animal skin (This type does not protect against the spread of infections.)\n* Latex rubber\n* Polyurethane\n\nCondoms are the only method of birth control for men that are not permanent. They can be purchased at most drugstores, in vending machines in some restrooms, by mail order, and at certain health care clinics. Condoms do not cost very much.\n\n**How Does a Condom Work to Prevent Pregnancy?**\n\nIf the sperm contained in a male's semen reach a woman's vagina, pregnancy may occur. Condoms work by preventing sperm from coming in contact with the inside of the vagina.\n\nIf condoms are used correctly every time intercourse occurs, the risk of pregnancy is around 3 out of every 100 times. However, there is a higher chance of pregnancy if a condom:\n\n* Is not used correctly during sexual contact\n* Breaks or tears during use\n\nCondoms do not work as well at preventing pregnancy as some other forms of birth control. However, using a condom is much better than not using birth control at all.\n\nSome condoms contain substances that kill sperm, called a spermicide. These may work slightly better to prevent pregnancy.\n\n**How to Use a Male Condom**\n\nThe condom must be put on before the penis comes into contact with the outside of the vagina or enters the vagina. If not:\n\n* The fluids that come out of the penis before climax carry sperm and may cause pregnancy.\n* Infections can be spread.\n\nThe condom must be put on when the penis is erect, but before contact is made between the penis and vagina.\n\nBe careful not to tear or poke a hole in it while opening the package and removing the condom. If the condom has a little tip (receptacle) on the end of it (to collect semen), place the condom against the top of the penis and carefully roll the sides down the shaft of the penis. If there is no tip, be sure to leave a little space between the condom and the end of the penis. Otherwise, the semen may push up the sides of the condom and come out at the bottom before the penis and condom are pulled out.\n\nBe sure there is not any air between the penis and the condom. This can cause the condom to break. Some people find it helpful to unroll the condom a little before putting it on the penis. This leaves plenty of room for semen to collect. It also prevents the condom from being stretched too tightly over the penis.\n\nAfter semen is released during climax, remove the condom from the vagina. The best way is to grasp the condom at the base of the penis and hold it as the penis is pulled out. Avoid having any semen spill into the vagina.\n\n**Important Tips**\n\n* Make sure you have condoms around when you need them. If no condoms are handy, you may be tempted to have intercourse without one.\n* Use each condom only once.\n* Store condoms in a cool, dry place away from sunlight and heat.\n* Do not carry condoms in your wallet for long periods of time. Replace them every once in a while.\n* Do not use a condom that is brittle, sticky, or discolored.\n* Do not use a lubricant with a petroleum base, such as Vaseline.\n\nIf you feel a condom break during intercourse, stop right away and put on a new one. If semen is released into the vagina when a condom breaks:\n\nInsert a spermicidal foam or jelly to help reduce the risk of pregnancy or passing an STD.\nContact your health care provider or pharmacy about emergency contraception (\"morning-after pills\").\n\n**Problems with Condom Use**\n\nSome complaints or problems with condom use include:\n\n* Allergic reactions to latex condoms are rare, but can occur. (Changing to condoms made of polyurethane or animal membranes may help.)\n* Friction of the condom may cut down on sexual enjoyment. (Lubricated condoms may reduce this problem.)\n* Intercourse also may be less pleasurable because the man must pull out his penis right after ejaculation.\n* Placing a condom may interrupt sexual activity.\n* The woman is not aware of warm fluid entering her body (important to some women, not to others).\n\n---\n\n**Condoms - Male**\n\nUsing a condom will help prevent female partners from becoming pregnant and getting an infection spread through sexual contact, or from giving one to your partner.

Problems may involve defiant or impulsive behavior, drug use, or criminal activity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Conduct Disorder**\n\nConduct disorder has been linked to:\n\n*   Child abuse\n*   Drug or alcohol use in the parents\n*   Family conflicts\n*   Gene disorders\n*   Poverty\n\nThe diagnosis is more common among boys.\n\nIt is hard to know how many children have the disorder. This is because many of the qualities for diagnosis, such as \"defiance\" and \"rule breaking,\" are hard to define. For a diagnosis of conduct disorder, the behavior must be much more extreme than is socially acceptable.\n\nConduct disorder is often linked to attention-deficit disorder. Conduct disorder also can be an early sign of depression or bipolar disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Conduct Disorder**\n\nChildren with conduct disorder tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and not concerned about the feelings of other people.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Breaking rules without clear reason\n*   Cruel or aggressive behavior toward people or animals (for example: bullying, fighting, using dangerous weapons, forcing sexual activity, and stealing)\n*   Not going to school (truancy, beginning before age 13)\n*   Heavy drinking or drug use\n*   Intentionally setting fires\n*   Lying to get a favor or avoid things they have to do\n*   Running away\n*   Vandalizing or destroying property\n\nThese children often make no effort to hide their aggressive behaviors. They may have a hard time making real friends.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Conduct Disorder**\n\nThere is no real test for diagnosing conduct disorder. The diagnosis is made when a child or teen has a history of conduct disorder behaviors.\n\nA physical examination and blood tests can help rule out medical conditions that are similar to conduct disorder. In rare cases, a brain scan helps check for other disorders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Conduct Disorder**\n\nFor treatment to be successful, it must be started early. The child's family also needs to be involved. Parents can learn techniques to help manage their child's problem behavior.\n\nIn cases of abuse, the child may need to be removed from the family and placed in a less chaotic home. Treatment with medicines or talk therapy may be used for depression and attention-deficit disorder.\n\nMany \"behavioral modification\" schools, \"wilderness programs,\" and \"boot camps\" are sold to parents as solutions for conduct disorder. There is no research to support these programs. Research does suggest that treating children at home, along with their families, is more effective.\n\nChildren who are diagnosed and treated early usually overcome their behavioral problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChildren who have severe or frequent symptoms and who are not able to complete treatment tend to have the poorest outlook.\n\nPossible Complications\n\nChildren with conduct disorder may go on to develop personality disorders as adults, particularly antisocial personality disorder. As their behaviors worsen, these individuals may also develop problems with drug abuse and the law.\n\nDepression and bipolar disorder may develop in the teen years and early adulthood. Suicide and violence toward others are also possible complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSee a health care provider if your child:\n\nRegularly gets in trouble\nHas mood swings\nIs bullying others or cruel to animals\nIs being victimized\nSeems to be overly aggressive\n\nEarly treatment may help.\n\n---\n\n**Conduct Disorder**\n\nConduct disorder is a set of ongoing emotional and behavioral problems that occurs in children and teens.

It is characterized by a pattern of disruptive, violating, or aggressive behavior.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of conduct disorder are not fully understood, but it is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Children with a family history of mental health problems, substance abuse, or violence may be at higher risk for developing conduct disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChildren with conduct disorder may exhibit a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   Aggressive behavior towards others\n*   Destruction of property\n*   Deceitfulness or theft\n*   Serious violations of rules\n*   Bullying or cruelty to animals\n*   Mood swings and irritability\n*   Difficulty following rules\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment for conduct disorder is to help the child develop adaptive behaviors and improve their relationships with family members, teachers, and peers. Treatment may involve:\n\n*   Medications to help manage symptoms such as depression or attention-deficit disorder\n*   Talk therapy to help the child understand and change their behavior\n*   Family therapy to help parents learn techniques for managing their child's problem behavior\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe sooner treatment is started, the more likely the child will learn adaptive behaviors and avoid potential complications. Early intervention can also help prevent the development of more serious mental health problems later in life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDisruptive behavior - child; Impulse control problem - child\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix is called cervical dysplasia.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is done in the hospital or in a surgery center. During the procedure:\n\n*   You will be given general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free), or medicines to help you relax and feel sleepy.\n*   You will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups to position your pelvis for exam. The health care provider will place an instrument (speculum) into your vagina to better see your cervix.\n*   A small cone-shaped sample of tissue is removed from your cervix. The procedure may be performed using a wire loop heated by electrical current (LEEP procedure), a scalpel (cold knife biopsy), or a laser beam.\n*   The cervical canal above the cone biopsy may also be scraped to remove cells for evaluation.

    "content": "**Congenital Heart Defects**\n\n**What are congenital heart defects?**\n\nCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. \"Congenital\" means that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.\n\n**Types of congenital heart defects**\n\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects, including:\n\n* Septal defects (\"hole in the heart\") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart\n* Heart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart\n* Defects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heart\n\n**What causes congenital heart defects?**\n\nResearchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.\n\n**Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect?**\n\nSeveral things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:\n\n* Your health before and during pregnancy, including:\n\t+ Having diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy\n\t+ Having phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods\n\t+ Having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy\n* Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including:\n\t+ Smoking or secondhand smoke\n\t+ Certain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne\n* Your family history and genetics\n\n**What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects?**\n\nCongenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.\n\nCommon signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:\n\n* Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails\n* Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings\n* Poor blood flow\n* Fast or difficult breathing\n* Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats\n\n**What other problems do congenital heart defects cause?**\n\nCongenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.\n\nChildren with congenital heart defects are more likely to:\n\n* Be smaller than other children\n* Have problems or delays in mental, emotional growth, and behavior, such as:\n\t+ Speech and language problems\n\t+ Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\nPeople with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:\n\n* Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valves\n* Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\n* Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the body\n* Pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungs\n* Kidney and liver disease\n\n**How are congenital heart defects diagnosed?**\n\nBefore a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.\n\nDuring the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.\n\nTo diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including:\n\n* A physical exam\n* Certain heart tests to see how the heart is working\n* Genetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect\n\n**What are the treatments for congenital heart defects?**\n\nTreatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:\n\n* Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart\n* Heart surgery may be needed to:\n\t+ Repair defects in the heart and blood vessels\n\t+ Repair or replace a heart valve\n\t+ Place a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood\n\t+ Do a heart transplant\n* Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nAll children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n**About Congenital Heart Defects**\n\n*   **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**: Congenital heart defects

the heart. \"Congenital\" means that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of congenital heart defects**\n\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are:\n\n* Septal defects (\"hole in the heart\") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart\n* Heart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart\n* Defects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heart\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What causes congenital heart defects?**\n\nResearchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect?**\n\nSeveral things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:\n\n* Your health before and during pregnancy, including:\n\t+ Having diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn't a major risk for heart defects)\n\t+ Having phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods\n\t+ Having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy\n* Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including:\n\t+ Smoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker)\n\t+ Certain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne\n* Your family history and genetics\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects?**\n\nCongenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.\n\nCommon signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:\n\n* Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails\n* Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings\n* Poor blood flow\n* Fast or difficult breathing\n* Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other problems do congenital heart defects cause?**\n\nCongenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.\n\nChildren with congenital heart defects are more likely to:\n\n* Be smaller than other children\n* Have problems or delays in mental, emotional growth, and behavior, such as:\n\t+ Speech and language problems\n\t+ Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\nPeople with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:\n\n* Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valves\n* Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\n* Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the body\n* Pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungs\n* Kidney and liver disease\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How are congenital heart defects diagnosed?**\n\nBefore a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.\n\nDuring the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.\n\nTo diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including:\n\n* A physical exam\n* Certain heart tests to see how the heart is working\n* Genetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for congenital heart defects?**\n\nTreatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:\n\n* Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart\n* Heart surgery may be needed to:\n\t+ Repair defects in the heart and blood vessels\n\t+ Repair or replace a heart valve\n\t+ Place a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood\n\t+ Do a heart transplant\n* Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus\n\nAll children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nCongenital heart defects are problems with the structure of the heart that are present at birth. They happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy.\n\n**Types of Congenital Heart Defects**\n\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects, including:\n\n* Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)\n* Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD)\n* Coarctation of the Aorta\n* dextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries (d-TGA)\n* Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)\n* Pulmonary Atresia\n* Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nResearchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects.

    "content": "**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is one of a group of disorders that affect the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of CAH Due to 11-Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\nThere are two types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency: the classic form and the non-classic form. The classic form is the more severe of the two types.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Classic Form**\n\nFemales with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (atypical genitalia). However, the internal reproductive organs develop normally. Males and females with the classic form of this condition have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics such as growth of facial and pubic hair, deepening of the voice, appearance of acne, and onset of a growth spurt. The early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. In addition, approximately two-thirds of individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have high blood pressure (hypertension). Hypertension typically develops within the first year of life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Non-Classic Form**\n\nFemales with the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) and irregular menstruation. Males with the non-classic form of this condition do not typically have any signs or symptoms except for short stature. Hypertension is not a feature of the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency\n* 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency\n* CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a disorder that affects the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys and produce various hormones that regulate essential functions in the body.\n\n**Types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency**\n\nThere are two types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency: the classic form and the non-classic form.

However, the internal reproductive organs develop normally. Males and females with the classic form of this condition have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics such as growth of facial and pubic hair, deepening of the voice, appearance of acne, and onset of a growth spurt. The early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. In addition, approximately two-thirds of individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have high blood pressure (hypertension). Hypertension typically develops within the first year of life.\n\n**Non-Classic Form**\n\nFemales with the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) and irregular menstruation. Males with the non-classic form of this condition do not typically have any signs or symptoms except for short stature. Hypertension is not a feature of the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 5 to 8 percent of all cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It is estimated that CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency occurs in 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns. This condition is more common in Moroccan Jews living in Israel, occurring in approximately 1 in 5,000 to 7,000 newborns. The classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency appears to be much more common than the non-classic form.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CYP11B1 gene cause CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Corticosterone gets converted to the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.\n\nCAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme. When 11-beta-hydroxylase is lacking, precursors that are used to form cortisol and corticosterone build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A buildup in the precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, leading to hypertension in individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\nThe amount of functional 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme that an individual produces typically determines the extent of abnormal sexual development. Individuals with the classic form of the condition usually have CYP11B1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with low levels of function or no function at all. Individuals with the non-classic form of the condition typically have CYP11B1 gene mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme with moderately reduced function. The severity of the signs and symptoms of sexual development do not appear to be related to the severity of the hypertension.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-beta-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-beta-hydroxylase Deficiency?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene. This enzyme plays a crucial role in producing hormones called cortisol and corticosterone in the adrenal glands.\n\n**How Does it Affect the Body?**\n\nThe condition leads to a shortage of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of precursors that are normally converted into cortisol and corticosterone. These precursors are then converted into androgens, leading to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females.\n\n**Hypertension**\n\nA buildup of precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, causing hypertension in individuals with the classic form of the condition.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms but carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency\n* 11b hydroxylase deficiency\n* Adrenal hyperplasia, hypertensive form\n* Deficiency of steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase\n* P450C11B1 deficiency\n* Steroid 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Deficiency of steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO STEROID 11-BETA-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands. One of the causes of CAH is a deficiency in the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the condition. They may include:\n\n*   **Ambiguous genitalia**: In females, this can manifest as clitoral enlargement or labial fusion.\n*   **Early puberty**: In males, this can lead to premature development of secondary sexual characteristics.\n*   **Hypokalemia**: Low levels of potassium in the blood.\n*   **Alkalosis**: A condition characterized by an excessive amount of base in the body.\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: To identify any physical abnormalities.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Such as blood tests to measure hormone levels and electrolyte balances.\n*   **Genetic testing**: To confirm the presence of mutations in the CYP11B1 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. This may involve:\n\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy**: To regulate hormone levels and promote normal development.\n*   **Electrolyte supplements**: To maintain proper electrolyte balances.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct physical abnormalities or prevent complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nWith proper treatment and management, individuals with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can lead normal lives. However, the prognosis depends on various factors, including:\n\n*   **Severity of the condition**: More severe forms may require more intensive treatment.\n*   **Promptness of diagnosis and treatment**: Early intervention can significantly impact outcomes.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nCAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that:\n\n*   **Carriers**: Individuals who carry one mutated allele may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the mutation to their offspring.\n*   **Inheritance**: The condition is typically passed down from parents to children.\n\nUnderstanding genetic principles and inheritance patterns is crucial for families affected by this condition.",

The classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency appears to be much more common than the non-classic form.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CYP11B1 gene cause CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Corticosterone gets converted to the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.\n\nCAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme. When 11-beta-hydroxylase is lacking, precursors that are used to form cortisol and corticosterone build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A buildup in the precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, leading to hypertension in individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\nThe amount of functional 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme that an individual produces typically determines the extent of abnormal sexual development. Individuals with the classic form of the condition usually have CYP11B1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with low levels of function or no function at all. Individuals with the non-classic form of the condition typically have CYP11B1 gene mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme with moderately reduced function. The severity of the signs and symptoms of sexual development do not appear to be related to the severity of the hypertension.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-beta-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-beta-hydroxylase Deficiency?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene. This enzyme plays a crucial role in producing hormones called cortisol and corticosterone in the adrenal glands.\n\n**How Does it Affect the Body?**\n\nThe condition leads to a shortage of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of precursors that are normally converted into cortisol and corticosterone. These precursors are then converted into androgens, leading to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females.\n\n**Hypertension**\n\nA buildup of precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, causing hypertension in individuals with the classic form of the condition.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms but carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency\n* 11b hydroxylase deficiency\n* Adrenal hyperplasia, hypertensive form\n* Deficiency of steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase\n* P450C11B1 deficiency\n* Steroid 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Deficiency of steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO STEROID 11-BETA-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Due to 11-Beta-Hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia?**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands. One of the causes of CAH is a deficiency in the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the condition. They may include:\n\n*   **Ambiguous genitalia**: In females, this can manifest as clitoral enlargement or labial fusion.\n*   **Early puberty**: In males, this can lead to premature development of secondary sexual characteristics.\n*   **Hypokalemia**: Low levels of potassium in the blood.\n*   **Alkalosis**: A condition characterized by an excessive amount of base in the body.\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: To identify any physical abnormalities.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Such as blood tests to measure hormone levels and electrolyte balances.\n*   **Genetic testing**: To confirm the presence of mutations in the CYP11B1 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. This may involve:\n\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy**: To regulate hormone levels and promote normal development.\n*   **Electrolyte supplements**: To maintain proper electrolyte balances.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct physical abnormalities or prevent complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nWith proper treatment and management, individuals with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can lead normal lives. However, the prognosis depends on various factors, including:\n\n*   **Severity of the condition**: More severe forms may require more intensive treatment.\n*   **Promptness of diagnosis and treatment**: Early intervention can significantly impact outcomes.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nCAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that:\n\n*   **Carriers**: Individuals who carry one mutated allele may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the mutation to their offspring.\n*   **Inheritance**: The condition is typically passed down from parents to children.\n\nUnderstanding genetic principles and inheritance patterns is crucial for families affected by this condition.",

It is often found at birth or early infancy. The body makes too little aldosterone and cortisol and too much androgen. There are two subtypes of classic CAH:\n\n* Salt-wasting CAH. This is the most serious form, and it can cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes too little aldosterone to regulate the sodium levels in the blood. This results in loss of sodium through the urine. It can be life-threatening without treatment.\n* Simple-virilizing CAH. This more moderate form of CAH does not cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes enough aldosterone to regulate sodium levels, but it still produces too little cortisol and too much androgen.\n\nNonclassic CAH is the mildest and most common form. The body produces enough aldosterone and cortisol, but too much androgen. It often is not diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood. The person may not have any or only mild symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms will vary, depending on the type of CAH someone has and their age when the disorder is diagnosed.\n\nFemales with classic CAH often have ambiguous genitalia at birth and may be diagnosed before symptoms appear.\nMales have typical male genitalia at birth, even if they have a more severe form.\n\nIn children classic, salt-wasting CAH, several adrenal symptoms often develop within 2 or 3 weeks after birth.

    "content": "**Congenital Afibrinogenemia**\n\n**What is Congenital Afibrinogenemia?**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia is a rare bleeding disorder caused by impairment of the blood clotting process. It affects approximately 1 in 1 million newborns.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nNewborns with this condition often experience prolonged bleeding from the umbilical cord stump after birth. Nosebleeds (epistaxis) and bleeding from the gums or tongue are common and can occur after minor trauma or in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Some affected individuals experience bleeding into the spaces between joints (hemarthrosis) or the muscles (hematoma). Rarely, bleeding in the brain or other internal organs occurs, which can be fatal. Women with congenital afibrinogenemia can have abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).\n\n**Causes**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia results from mutations in one of three genes: FGA, FGB, or FGG. Each gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of the fibrinogen protein. In response to injury, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin, which forms a stable network that makes up the blood clot. Most FGA, FGB, and FGG gene mutations that cause this condition result in a premature stop signal, leading to a complete absence of fibrinogen protein.\n\n**Description**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia is a bleeding disorder caused by impairment of the blood clotting process. Normally, blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. However, bleeding is uncontrolled in people with congenital afibrinogenemia.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia occurs in approximately 1 in 1 million newborns.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Afibrinogenemia**\n\nLearn more about the genes associated with Congenital afibrinogenemia:\n\n*   **FGA**\n*   **FGB**\n*   **FGG**\n\nCongenital afibrinogenemia results from mutations in one of three genes, FGA, FGB, or FGG.

Fibrinogen is a protein produced by the liver that plays a crucial role in blood clotting.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nCongenital fibrinogen deficiency is caused by mutations in the genes that code for fibrinogen, specifically the FGA, FGB, and FGG genes. These mutations can lead to a complete or partial absence of fibrinogen production, resulting in severe bleeding episodes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of congenital fibrinogen deficiency can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Severe bleeding episodes, often triggered by minor injuries or surgical procedures\n* Easy bruising and petechiae (small red spots on the skin)\n* Prolonged bleeding from cuts or other wounds\n* Joint and muscle pain\n* Fatigue\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing congenital fibrinogen deficiency typically involves a combination of:\n\n* Medical history and physical examination\n* Laboratory tests, such as:\n\t+ Fibrinogen blood test to measure the level of fibrinogen in the blood\n\t+ Genetic testing to identify mutations in the FGA, FGB, and FGG genes\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for congenital fibrinogen deficiency, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing bleeding episodes. This may include:\n\n* Replacement therapy with fibrinogen concentrates or cryoprecipitate\n* Antifibrinolytic agents to prevent excessive bleeding\n* Avoiding medications that can interfere with blood clotting\n* Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with congenital fibrinogen deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with this disorder can lead active and relatively normal lives.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nCongenital fibrinogen deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Carrier parents may experience mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. Genetic counseling can help families understand the risks and implications of this disorder.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Bleeding Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Congenital Antithrombin III Deficiency**\n\nCongenital antithrombin III deficiency is a genetic disorder that causes the blood to clot more than normal.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAntithrombin III is a protein in the blood that blocks abnormal blood clots from forming. It helps the body keep a healthy balance between bleeding and clotting. Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease. It occurs when a person receives one abnormal copy of the antithrombin III gene from a parent with the disease.\n\nThe abnormal gene leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein. This low level of antithrombin III can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs.\n\nPeople with this condition will often have blood clots at a young age. They are also likely to have family members who have had a blood clotting problem.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople will usually have symptoms of a blood clot. Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain. When a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body, it is called a thromboembolism. Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to. A common place is the lung, where the clot can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a stroke.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show:\n\n*   A swollen leg or arm\n*   Decreased breath sounds in the lungs\n*   A rapid heart rate\n\nThe health care provider can also order a blood test to check if you have a low level of antithrombin III.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA blood clot is treated with blood-thinning medicines (also called anticoagulants). How long you need to take these drugs depends on how serious the blood clot was and other factors.

This leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein in the blood, which can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCongenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease that occurs when a person receives one abnormal copy of the antithrombin III gene from a parent with the disease. The abnormal gene leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein in the blood, which can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with congenital antithrombin III deficiency will often have symptoms of a blood clot, including:\n\n*   Blood clots in the arms or legs, which can cause swelling, redness, and pain\n*   Thromboembolism, where a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body\n*   Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to, but common places include the lung, where it can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a stroke.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show:\n\n*   A swollen leg or arm\n*   Decreased breath sounds in the lungs\n*   A rapid heart rate\n\nThe health care provider can also order a blood test to check if you have a low level of antithrombin III.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA blood clot is treated with blood-thinning medicines (also called anticoagulants). How long you need to take these drugs depends on how serious the blood clot was and other factors.

People with this condition are prone to developing blood clots in their veins, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of congenital antithrombin III deficiency is unknown, but it is believed to result from a genetic mutation that affects the production of antithrombin III. This condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of congenital antithrombin III deficiency can vary widely depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   Blood clots in the veins\n*   Swelling or pain in the affected limb\n*   Shortness of breath (if a blood clot forms in the lungs)\n*   Coughing up blood (if a blood clot forms in the lungs)\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing congenital antithrombin III deficiency typically involves a combination of laboratory tests, including:\n\n*   Blood tests to measure the levels of antithrombin III\n*   Imaging studies (such as ultrasound or CT scans) to visualize the affected veins\n*   Genetic testing to identify the underlying mutation\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for congenital antithrombin III deficiency usually involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes, including:\n\n*   Anticoagulant medications to prevent further blood clots\n*   Antiplatelet medications to reduce the risk of clot formation\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet, to help manage the condition\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for people with congenital antithrombin III deficiency varies widely depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

    "content": "**Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens**\n\nThis condition occurs in males when the tubes that carry sperm out of the testes (the vas deferens) fail to develop properly.\n\n**Description**\n\n* Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens occurs in males when the tubes that carry sperm out of the testes (the vas deferens) fail to develop properly.\n* Although the testes usually develop and function normally, sperm cannot be transported through the vas deferens to become part of semen.\n* As a result, men with this condition are unable to father children (infertile) unless they use assisted reproductive technologies.\n* This condition has not been reported to affect sex drive or sexual performance.\n\n**This Condition Can Occur Alone or as a Sign of Cystic Fibrosis**\n\n* Cystic fibrosis causes progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems.\n* Many men with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens do not have the other characteristic features of cystic fibrosis; however, some men with this condition may experience mild respiratory or digestive problems.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* This condition is responsible for 1 percent to 2 percent of all infertility in men.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Mutations in the CFTR gene cause congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens.\n* More than half of all men with this condition have mutations in the CFTR gene.\n* Mutations in this gene also cause cystic fibrosis.\n* When congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens occurs with CFTR mutations and without other features of cystic fibrosis, the condition is considered a form of atypical cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* None\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n* American Society for Reproductive Medicine\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens**\n\n**What is Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens?**\n\nCongenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is a condition where men are born without both vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis. This condition can cause infertility in men.\n\n**Causes of CBAVD**\n\nMutations in the CFTR gene are responsible for more than half of all cases of CBAVD. The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a channel that transports chloride ions into and out of cells. Chloride ions help control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus.\n\nWhen the CFTR gene is mutated, it disrupts the function of the chloride channels, preventing them from regulating the flow of chloride ions and water across cell membranes. As a result, cells in the male genital tract produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the vas deferens as they are forming, causing them to deteriorate before birth.\n\nIn some cases, the cause of CBAVD is unknown, but it may be associated with other structural problems of the urinary tract.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nWhen CBAVD is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both copies of the gene in each cell have a mutation. Men with this condition who choose to father children through assisted reproduction have an increased risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Other Names for CBAVD**\n\nCBAVD has several other names, including:\n\n* Absence of vas deferens\n* Absent vasa\n* CAVD (Congenital absence of the vas deferens)\n* CBAVD (Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens)\n* Congenital aplasia of vas deferens\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on CBAVD, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital bilateral aplasia of vas deferens from CFTR mutation\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Bilateral Absence of Vas Deferens**\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   VAS DEFERENS, CONGENITAL BILATERAL APLASIA OF; CBAVD\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Information\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital bilateral aplasia of vas deferens from CFTR mutation\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n    *   Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n    *   VAS DEFERENS, CONGENITAL BILATERAL APLASIA OF; CBAVD\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The lens of the eye is normally clear, focusing light that comes into the eye onto the retina.\n\n**Causes**\n\nUnlike most cataracts, which occur with aging, congenital cataracts are present at birth. They are rare and in most people, no cause can be found. Congenital cataracts often occur as part of the following birth defects:\n\n* Chondrodysplasia syndrome\n* Congenital rubella\n* Conradi-Hünermann syndrome\n* Down syndrome (trisomy 21)\n* Ectodermal dysplasia syndrome\n* Familial congenital cataracts\n* Galactosemia\n* Hallermann-Streiff syndrome\n* Lowe syndrome\n* Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome\n* Pierre-Robin syndrome\n* Trisomy 13\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCongenital cataracts most often look different than other forms of cataract. Symptoms may include:\n\n* An infant does not seem to be visually aware of the world around them (if cataracts are in both eyes)\n* Gray or white cloudiness of the pupil (which is normally black)\n* The \"red eye\" glow (red reflex) of the pupil is missing in photos, or is different between the 2 eyes\n* Unusual rapid eye movements (nystagmus)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose congenital cataract, the infant should have a complete eye exam by an ophthalmologist. The infant may also need to be examined by a pediatrician who is experienced in treating inherited disorders. Blood tests or x-rays may also be needed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf congenital cataracts are mild and do not affect vision, they may not need to be treated, especially if they are in both eyes. Moderate to severe cataracts that affect vision, or a cataract that is in only 1 eye, will need to be treated with cataract removal surgery. In most (noncongenital) cataract surgeries, an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is inserted into the eye. The use of IOLs in infants is controversial. Without an IOL, the infant will need to wear a contact lens.\n\nPatching to force the child to use the weaker eye is often needed to prevent amblyopia. The infant may also need to be treated for the inherited disorder that has caused the cataracts.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nRemoving a congenital cataract is usually a safe, effective procedure. The child will need follow-up for vision rehabilitation. Most infants with congenital cataract in one eye have some level of \"lazy eye\" (amblyopia) and will need to use patching after the surgery in an attempt to reverse it.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nWith cataract surgery there is a very slight risk of:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n\nInfants who have surgery for congenital cataracts are likely to develop another type of cataract, which may need further surgery or laser treatment.

The condition is often associated with connective tissue disorders and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nResearch has identified mutations in the FBN2 gene as a cause of congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Studies have shown that individuals with this condition often have a combination of skeletal abnormalities, including arachnodactyly (spider-like fingers), contracture deformities, and other musculoskeletal features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis and Treatment**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with congenital contractural arachnodactyly varies depending on the severity of the condition. While there is no cure for the disorder, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include physical therapy, orthotics, and surgical interventions to correct deformities or improve mobility.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCongenital contractural arachnodactyly is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. This means that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Connective Tissue Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Muscle Disorders",

Congenital means the condition is present at birth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCongenital CMV occurs when an infected mother passes CMV to the fetus through the placenta. The mother may not have symptoms, so she may be unaware that she has CMV.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost children with congenital CMV do not have symptoms. Those who do have symptoms may have:\n\n* Inflammation of the retina\n* Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Large spleen and liver\n* Low birth weight\n* Mineral deposits in the brain\n* Rash at birth\n* Seizures\n* Small head size\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring the exam, the health care provider may find:\n\n* Abnormal breath sounds indicating pneumonia\n* Enlarged liver\n* Enlarged spleen\n* Delayed physical movements (psychomotor retardation)\n\nTests include:\n\n* Antibody titer against CMV for both the mother and infant\n* Bilirubin level and blood tests for liver function\n* CBC\n* CT scan or ultrasound of the head\n* Fundoscopy\n* TORCH screen\n* Urine culture for CMV virus in the first 2 to 3 weeks of life\n* X-ray of the chest\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for congenital CMV. Treatments focus on specific problems, such as physical therapy and appropriate education for children with delayed physical movements.\n\nTreatment with antiviral medicines is often used for infants with neurologic (nervous system) symptoms. This treatment may reduce hearing loss later in the child's life.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost infants who have symptoms of their infection at birth will have neurologic abnormalities later in life. Most infants without symptoms at birth will NOT have these problems.\n\nSome children may die while they are still an infant.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Difficulty with physical activities and movement\n* Vision problems or blindness\n* Deafness\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nHave your baby checked right away if a provider did not examine your baby shortly after birth, and you suspect your baby has:\n\n* A small head\n* Other symptoms of congenital CMV\n\nIf your baby has congenital CMV, it is important to follow your provider's recommendations for well-baby examinations. That way, any growth and development problems can be identified early and treated promptly.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nCytomegalovirus is almost everywhere in the environment. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the following steps to reduce the spread of CMV:\n\n* Wash hands with soap and water after touching diapers or saliva.\n* Avoid kissing children under the age of 6 on the mouth or cheek.\n* Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils with young children.\n* Pregnant women working in a day care center should work with children older than age 2½.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\n**What is Congenital Cytomegalovirus?**\n\nCongenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that can be passed from a mother to her unborn child during pregnancy. It is one of the most common congenital infections, affecting approximately 1 in every 200 births.\n\n**Symptoms of Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\nThe symptoms of congenital CMV can vary widely, but may include:\n\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Vision problems\n*   Microcephaly (a small head size)\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Seizures\n\nIn some cases, the infection may be asymptomatic, and the child may not show any symptoms until later in life.\n\n**Causes of Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\nThe exact cause of congenital CMV is still not fully understood. However, it is believed that the virus can infect a pregnant woman's uterus during early pregnancy, leading to the transmission of the virus to the developing fetus.\n\n**Risk Factors for Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\nCertain risk factors may increase the likelihood of transmitting the virus from mother to child, including:\n\n*   Advanced maternal age\n*   Multiple gestations (twins or other multiples)\n*   Previous history of congenital CMV\n\n**Diagnosis of Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\nDiagnosing congenital CMV can be challenging, as the symptoms may not appear until after birth. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   Physical examination\n*   Laboratory tests (such as PCR or culture)\n*   Imaging studies (such as ultrasound)\n\n**Treatment and Prevention of Congenital Cytomegalovirus**\n\nWhile there is no cure for congenital CMV, treatment may focus on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. In some cases, antiviral medication may be prescribed to help reduce the severity of the infection.\n\nTo prevent congenital CMV, pregnant women can take steps to reduce their risk of transmission, such as:\n\n*   Practicing good hygiene (handwashing, etc.)\n*   Avoiding close contact with individuals who have active CMV infections\n*   Getting regular prenatal care\n\n**References**\n\nBeckham JD, Solbrig MV, Tyler KL.
