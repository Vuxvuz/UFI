    "content": "**Elbow Replacement**\n\nElbow replacement is surgery to replace the elbow joint with artificial joint parts (prosthetics).\n\n**Description**\n\nThe elbow joint connects three bones:\n\n* The humerus in the upper arm\n* The ulna and radius in the lower arm (forearm)\n\nThe artificial elbow joint has two or three stems made of high-quality metal. A metal and plastic hinge joins the stems together and allows the artificial joint to bend. Artificial joints come in different sizes to fit people of different sizes.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nYou'll receive general anesthesia. This means you'll be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you'll receive regional anesthesia (spinal and epidural) to numb your arm.\n\nA cut (incision) is made on the back of your elbow so that the surgeon can view your elbow joint.\n\nThe damaged tissue and parts of the arm bones that make up the elbow joint are removed.\n\nA tool is used to make a hole in the center of the arm bones to anchor the artificial joint in place.\n\nThe ends of the artificial joint are usually glued in place into each bone. They can be connected with a hinge.\n\nThe tissue around the new joint is repaired.\n\nThe wound is closed with stitches, and a bandage is applied. Your arm may be placed in a splint to keep it stable.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nElbow replacement surgery is usually done if the elbow joint is badly damaged and you have pain or cannot use your arm. Some causes of damage are:\n\n* Osteoarthritis\n* Poor outcome from past elbow surgery\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Badly broken bone in the upper or lower arm near the elbow\n* Badly damaged or torn tissues in the elbow\n* Tumor in or around the elbow\n* Stiff elbow\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines, breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of this procedure include:\n\n* Blood vessel damage during surgery\n* Bone break during surgery\n* Dislocation of the artificial joint\n* Loosening of the artificial joint over time\n* Nerve damage during surgery\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n* Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n---\n\n**Elbow Replacement Surgery**\n\n**What is Elbow Replacement Surgery?**\n\nElbow replacement surgery is a procedure to replace the elbow joint with artificial joint parts (prosthetics).\n\n**Description**\n\nThe elbow joint connects three bones:\n\n* The humerus in the upper arm\n* The ulna and radius in the lower arm (forearm)\n\nThe artificial elbow joint has two or three stems made of high-quality metal.

Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may need to stay in the hospital for up to 1 to 2 days. After you go home, follow instructions on how to care for your wound and elbow.\n\nPhysical therapy will be needed to help you gain strength and use of your arm. It will start with gentle flexing exercises. People who have a splint usually start therapy a few weeks later than those who do not have a splint.\n\nSome people can start to use their new elbow as soon as 12 weeks after surgery. Complete recovery can take up to a year. There will be limits to how much weight you can lift. Lifting too heavy of a load can break the replacement elbow or loosen the parts. Talk to your surgeon about your limitations.

    "content": "**Elbow Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nA sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint. A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. The ligaments in your elbow help connect the bones of your upper and lower arm around your elbow joint. When you sprain your elbow, you have pulled or torn one or more of the ligaments in your elbow joint.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nAn elbow sprain can occur when your arm is quickly bent or twisted in an unnatural position. It can also happen when the ligaments are overloaded during regular movement. Elbow sprains can happen when:\n\n* You fall with your arm stretched out, such as when playing sports\n* Your elbow is hit very hard, such as during a car accident\n* When you are doing sports and overusing your elbow\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYou may notice:\n\n* Elbow pain and swelling\n* Bruising, redness, or warmth around your elbow\n* Pain when you move your elbow\n* Your elbow is unstable with particular movement\n\nTell your health care provider if you heard a \"pop\" when you injured your elbow. This could be a sign that a ligament was torn.\n\nAfter examining your elbow, your provider may order an x-ray to see if there are any breaks (fractures) to the bones in your elbow. You may also have an MRI of the elbow. The MRI pictures will show whether tissues around your elbow have been stretched or torn.\n\nIf you have an elbow sprain, you may need:\n\n* A sling to keep your arm and elbow from moving\n* A cast or splint if you have a severe sprain\n* Surgery to repair torn ligaments\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nYour provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling:\n\n* Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so.\n* Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Cold from the ice can damage your skin.\n* Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap.\n* Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart. You can prop it up with pillows.\n\nYou can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYou may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast for about 2 to 3 weeks while your elbow heals. If your provider recommends it, you should move your elbow to avoid stiffness. Depending on how badly it is sprained, you may need to work with a physical therapist who will show you stretching and strengthening exercises.\n\nMost people recover completely from a simple elbow sprain in about 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your provider if:\n\n* You have increased swelling or pain\n* Self-care does not seem to help\n* You have instability in your elbow and you feel that it is slipping out of place\n\n---\n\n**Elbow Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nA sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint.

Do not use a wet or metal object. If possible, stand on something dry that doesn't conduct electricity, such as a rubber mat or folded newspapers.\n\nOnce the person is away from the source of electricity, check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, start first aid.\n\nCPR should be started if the person is unconscious and you can't feel a pulse. Perform rescue breathing on a person who is unconscious and not breathing or is breathing ineffectively.\n\nIf the person has a burn, remove any clothing that comes off easily and rinse the burned area with cool, running water until the pain subsides. Give first aid for burns.\n\nIf the person is faint, pale, or shows other signs of shock, lay them down, with the head slightly lower than the trunk of the body and the legs elevated, and cover them with a warm blanket or a coat.\n\nStay with the person until medical help arrives.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoid electrical hazards at home and at work. Always follow the manufacturer's safety instructions when using electrical appliances.\n\nAvoid using electrical appliances while showering or wet.\n\nKeep children away from electrical devices, especially those that are plugged in to an electrical outlet.\n\nKeep electrical cords out of children's reach.\n\nNever touch electrical appliances while touching faucets or cold water pipes.\n\nTeach children about the dangers of electricity.\n\nUse child safety plugs in all electrical outlets.\n\n---\n\n**Electrical Injury**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of Electrical Injury**\n    *   Lightning strike\n    *   Contact with electrical wires or appliances\n*   **Symptoms of Electrical Injury**\n    *   Cardiac arrest\n    *   Respiratory failure\n    *   Burns to the skin and underlying tissues\n    *   Neurological damage\n*   **Treatment of Electrical Injury**\n    *   Emergency medical care\n    *   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\n    *   Administration of oxygen\n    *   Treatment of burns and neurological damage\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Electrical Injury**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Safety Precautions**\n    *   Avoid contact with electrical wires or appliances during thunderstorms\n    *   Use insulated tools when working with electrical systems\n    *   Install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in homes and workplaces\n    *   Post warning signs near electrical equipment",

    "content": "**Electrocardiogram**\n\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will be asked to lie down. A technician will clean several areas on your arms, legs, and chest, and then will attach small patches called electrodes to those areas. It may be necessary to shave or clip some hair so the patches stick to the skin. The number of patches used may vary.\n\nThe patches are connected by wires to a machine that turns the heart's electrical signals into wavy lines, which are often printed on paper. The health care provider reviews the test results.\n\nYou will need to remain still during the procedure. The technician may also ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as the test is being done.\n\nIt is important to be relaxed and warm during an ECG recording because any movement, including shivering, can alter the results.\n\nSometimes this test is done while you are exercising or under light stress to look for changes in the heart. This type of ECG is often called a stress test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some medicines can interfere with test results.\n\nDo not exercise or drink cold water immediately before an ECG because these actions may cause false results.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nAn ECG is painless.

A technician will clean several areas on your arms, legs, and chest, and then will attach small patches called electrodes to those areas. It may be necessary to shave or clip some hair so the patches stick to the skin. The number of patches used may vary.\n\nThe patches are connected by wires to a machine that turns the heart's electrical signals into wavy lines, which are often printed on paper. The health care provider reviews the test results.\n\nYou will need to remain still during the procedure. The technician may also ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as the test is being done.\n\nIt is important to be relaxed and warm during an ECG recording because any movement, including shivering, can alter the results.\n\nSometimes this test is done while you are exercising or under light stress to look for changes in the heart. This type of ECG is often called a stress test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some medicines can interfere with test results.\n\nDo not exercise or drink cold water immediately before an ECG because these actions may cause false results.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nAn ECG is painless.

You may feel a little discomfort or skin irritation after the electrodes are removed. The EKG doesn't send any electricity to your body. It only records electrical signals from your heart, so there's no risk of electric shock.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour provider will check your EKG results for a steady heartbeat and rhythm. If your results are not normal, it may be a sign of a heart condition. The specific condition depends on which part of your EKG wasn't normal.\n\nYou may need to have other heart health tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. Your provider can explain what your test results mean for your heart health and treatment.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About an EKG?**\n\nAn EKG is a \"snapshot\" of your heart's activity over a very short time. If you have heart symptoms that come and go, a regular EKG may not catch the problem. In that case, your provider may recommend that you wear a small portable EKG monitor that can record your heart for days or longer while you do your normal activities.\n\nThere are many types of long-term EKG monitors, including Holter monitors and event monitors. A Holter monitor is about the size of a small camera and records your heart's electrical signals the whole time you're wearing it. You may be asked to keep a diary of your symptoms during the test period.

Doctors believe that the seizure activity may help the brain \"rewire\" itself, which helps relieve symptoms. ECT is generally safe and effective._\n\n_ECT is most often done in a hospital while you are asleep and pain free (general anesthesia):_\n\n*   _You receive medicine to relax you (muscle relaxant). You also receive another medicine (short-acting anesthetic) to put you briefly to sleep and prevent you from feeling pain._\n*   _Electrodes are placed on your scalp. Two electrodes monitor your brain activity. Another two electrodes are used to deliver the electric current._\n*   _When you are asleep, a small amount of electric current is delivered to your head to cause seizure activity in the brain. It lasts for about 40 seconds. You receive medicine to prevent the seizure from spreading throughout your body. As a result, your hands or feet move only slightly during the procedure._\n*   _ECT is usually given once every 2 to 5 days for a total of 6 to 12 sessions. Sometimes more sessions are needed._\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\n_ECT is a highly effective treatment for depression, most commonly severe depression. It can be very helpful for treating depression in people who:_\n\n*   _Are having delusions or other psychotic symptoms with their depression_\n*   _Are pregnant and severely depressed_\n*   _Are suicidal_\n*   _Can't take antidepressant medicines_\n*   _Haven't responded fully to antidepressant medicines_\n\n_Less often, ECT is used for conditions such as mania, catatonia, and psychosis that do not improve enough with other treatments._\n\n**Risks**\n\n_ECT has received bad press, in part because of its potential for causing memory problems. Since ECT was introduced in the 1930s, the dose of electricity used in the procedure has been decreased significantly. Also, it may be given with the electrode placed on only one side of the skull (unilateral ECT). These changes have greatly reduced the side effects of this procedure, including memory loss._\n\n_However, ECT can still cause some side effects, including:_\n\n*   _Confusion that generally lasts for only a short period of time_\n*   _Headache_\n*   _Low blood pressure (hypotension) or high blood pressure (hypertension)_\n*   _Memory loss (permanent memory loss beyond the time of the procedure is uncommon and is much less common than it was in the past)_\n*   _Muscle soreness_\n*   _Nausea_\n*   _Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) or other heart problems_\n\n_Some medical conditions put people at greater risk for side effects from ECT.

You have electrolytes in your blood, urine, tissues, and other body fluids.\n\nThey are important because they help:\n\n* Balance the amount of water in your body\n* Balance your body's acid-base (pH) level\n* Move nutrients into your cells\n* Move waste out of your cells\n* Support your muscle and nerve function\n* Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady\n* Keep your blood pressure stable\n* Keep your bones and teeth healthy\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nAn electrolyte panel is often part of a routine blood screening or a comprehensive metabolic panel. The test may also be used to find out if your body has a fluid imbalance or an imbalance in acid and base levels.\n\nWhy do I need an electrolyte panel?\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms indicating that your body's electrolytes may be out of balance. These include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Confusion and irritability\n* Weakness\n* Irregular or fast heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n* Diarrhea or constipation\n* Fatigue\n* Headaches\n* Muscle weakness, cramps, or spasms\n* Numbness or tingling in your arms, legs, fingers, and toes\n\nWhat happens during an electrolyte panel?\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nNo special preparations are needed for an electrolyte panel.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nYour results will include measurements for each electrolyte. Abnormal electrolyte levels can be caused by many different conditions, including:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Kidney disease\n* Heart disease\n* Diabetes\n* Lung infection (such as tuberculosis)\n* Malabsorption, a condition in which your body is not getting enough nutrients from the foods you eat.\n* Liver disease\n* Acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n* Alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes.\n\nAn electrolyte imbalance can also happen if you take certain medicines, such as:\n\n* Antibiotics\n* Antacids, especially if you take large amounts\n* Chemotherapy medicines\n* Diuretics (\"water pills\"), which are used to treat high blood pressure and other conditions\n* Steroid medicines\n\nYour specific results will depend on which electrolyte or electrolytes are affected and whether levels are too low or too high. If your electrolyte levels were not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical problem needing treatment. Many factors can affect electrolyte levels. These include taking in too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines such as antacids and blood pressure medicines may cause abnormal results.\n\nAn electrolyte imbalance means that the level of an electrolyte is too low or too high. The names of the imbalances are:\n\nElectrolyte\tToo low\tToo high\nBicarbonate\tAcidosis\tAlkalosis\nCalcium\tHypocalcemia\tHypercalcemia\nChloride\tHypochloremia\tHyperchloremia\nMagnesium\tHypomagnesemia\tHypermagnesemia\nPhosphate\tHypophosphatemia\tHyperphosphatemia\nPotassium\tHypokalemia\tHyperkalemia\nSodium\tHyponatremia\tHypernatremia\n\n---\n\n**Electrolyte Panel**\n\nAn electrolyte panel is a blood test that measures levels of the body's main electrolytes: sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), carbon dioxide (CO2), calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and bicarbonate. These electrolytes are essential for various bodily functions, including:\n\n* Regulating fluid balance and blood pressure\n* Maintaining proper muscle and nerve function\n* Supporting strong bones and teeth\n* Controlling blood sugar levels\n\n**What is an Electrolyte Panel Used For?**\n\nAn electrolyte panel is often part of a routine blood screening or a comprehensive metabolic panel. The test may also be used to find out if your body has a fluid imbalance or an imbalance in acid and base levels.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Electrolyte Panel?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms indicating that your body's electrolytes may be out of balance, such as:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Confusion and irritability\n* Weakness\n* Irregular or fast heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n* Diarrhea or constipation\n* Fatigue\n* Headaches\n* Muscle weakness, cramps, or spasms\n* Numbness or tingling in your arms, legs, fingers, and toes\n\n**What Happens During an Electrolyte Panel?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nNo special preparations are needed for an electrolyte panel.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour results will include measurements for each electrolyte. Abnormal electrolyte levels can be caused by many different conditions, including dehydration, kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, lung infection, malabsorption, liver disease, acidosis, and alkalosis. An electrolyte imbalance can also happen if you take certain medicines, such as antibiotics, antacids, chemotherapy medicines, diuretics, and steroid medicines.\n\n**What Do the Names of the Imbalances Mean?**\n\nThe names of the imbalances are:\n\n* Bicarbonate: Acidosis (too low) or Alkalosis (too high)\n* Calcium: Hypocalcemia (too low) or Hypercalcemia (too high)\n* Chloride: Hypochloremia (too low) or Hyperchloremia (too high)\n* Magnesium: Hypomagnesemia (too low) or Hypermagnesemia (too high)\n* Phosphate: Hypophosphatemia (too low) or Hyperphosphatemia (too high)\n* Potassium: Hypokalemia (too low) or Hyperkalemia (too high)\n* Sodium: Hyponatremia (too low) or Hypernatremia (too high)\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Electrolyte Panel**\n\nYou've just received your electrolyte panel results, and you're wondering what they mean. Don't worry, we're here to help!\n\n**What's an Electrolyte Panel?**\n\nAn electrolyte panel is a blood test that measures the levels of various electrolytes in your body. These electrolytes are essential for maintaining proper fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour provider will interpret your results based on the reference ranges provided below.

    "content": "**Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies**\n\nWhat are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies?\n\n* Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are tests that check how well your muscles and the nerves that control them are working.\n* These nerves control your muscles by sending out electrical signals to make your muscles move. As your muscles react by tightening (contracting), they give off electrical activity, which can then be measured.\n\nAn EMG test looks at the electrical signals your muscles make when they are at rest and when used. A healthy muscle should not give off any electrical signals when you aren't moving it. If your muscle is damaged, it may show electrical activity while at rest or activity that is not normal while using it.\nA nerve conduction study measures how fast and how well your body's electrical signals move along your nerves. A damaged nerve has a slower and weaker signal. This test can help check for nerve damage.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\n* EMG and nerve conduction studies are used to help check for many kinds of muscle and nerve disorders.\n* An EMG test helps find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals. Nerve conduction studies help to check for nerve damage or disease.\n* When EMG tests and nerve conduction studies are done together, it helps providers tell if your symptoms are caused by a muscle or a nerve disorder.\n\n**Why do I need an EMG test and a nerve conduction study?**\n\nYou may need these tests if you have symptoms of a muscle or nerve disorder. These symptoms include:\n\n* Muscle weakness\n* Tingling or numbness in arms, legs, hands, feet, and/or face\n* Muscle cramps, spasms, and/or twitching\n* Paralysis of any muscles\n\n**What happens during an EMG test and nerve conduction study?**\n\nFor an EMG test:\n\n* You will sit or lie on a table or bed.\n* Your provider will clean the skin over the muscle being tested.\n* Your provider will place a small needle with an electrode into the muscle. This is connected to a machine used to record your muscle's electrical activity when you move and relax it. You may have slight pain or discomfort when the electrode is inserted.\n* You will stay still while the machine records your muscle activity at rest.\n* You will tighten (contract) the muscle slowly while the machine records this muscle activity.\n* The electrode may be moved to record activity in different muscles.\n* The electrical activity is recorded and shown on a video screen. It looks like wavy and spiky lines. The activity may also be recorded and sent to an audio speaker. The audio may make popping sounds when you're contracting your muscles.\n\nFor a nerve conduction study:\n\n* You will sit or lie on a table or bed.\n* Your provider will stick electrodes to your skin above a nerve they're checking. The electrodes, called stimulating electrodes, deliver a mild electrical pulse.\n* Your provider will attach recording electrodes to the muscles controlled by those nerves. These electrodes will record the muscles' response to the electrical stimulation from the nerve.\n* Your provider will send a small pulse of electricity through the stimulating electrodes. This stimulates the nerve to send a signal to the muscle.\n* This may cause a mild tingling feeling.\n* Your provider will write down how long it takes for your muscle to respond to the nerve signal.\n* The speed of the muscle response is called the conduction velocity.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests?**\n\nTell your provider if you have a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator. Special steps will need to be taken before the test if you have one of these devices.\n\nTell your provider if you take blood thinner medicines. If you're taking blood thinners, you may need to watch for more bleeding from the needle.\n\nWear loose, comfortable clothing for easy access to the test area. It can be easily removed if you need to change into a hospital gown.\n\nMake sure your skin is clean. Don't use lotions, creams, or perfumes for a day or two before the test. They can change the results of the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the tests?**\n\nYou may feel mild pain during an EMG test. Let your provider know if your pain becomes very uncomfortable because this may change your test results. You may have a tingly feeling, like mild static electricity, during a nerve conduction study.\n\nThe muscles that were tested may be sore for a few days after the test. You may also have some bruises on your skin where the needles were placed.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results are not normal, it can be a sign of many different conditions. Depending on which muscles or nerves are affected, it could mean one of the following:\n\n* Carpal tunnel syndrome, a common condition that affects nerves in the hand and arm. It causes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand.\n* Herniated disk, a condition that happens when a part of your spine, called a disk, is damaged. Part of the disk bulges or pushes out, putting pressure on the spine which causes pain and numbness.\n* Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your nerves. It can lead to numbness, tingling, and paralysis.\n* Myasthenia gravis, a rare disease that causes weakness in the muscles you can control. They may include your muscles for eye movement, facial expressions, or other muscles.\n* Muscular dystrophy (MD), a group of genetic diseases that cause muscle weakness. This weakness can lead to trouble walking and the ability to care for yourself.\n* Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of nerve disorders that are inherited (passed down through families). CMT causes nerve damage and muscle weakness, mostly in the arms and legs.\n* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a disorder that attacks nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. It affects all the muscles you use to move, speak, eat, and breathe. There is no cure for ALS, and it gets worse over time.\n\nTo understand the results of an EMG test or nerve conduction study, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies**\n\n**What are they?**\n\n*   Electromyography (EMG) tests check how well your muscles are working by measuring the electrical activity of your muscles when you move and relax them.\n*   Nerve conduction studies measure how fast and how well your body's electrical signals move along your nerves.\n\n**Why do I need an EMG test and a nerve conduction study?**\n\nYou may need these tests if you have symptoms of a muscle or nerve disorder, such as:\n\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Tingling or numbness in arms, legs, hands, feet, and/or face\n*   Muscle cramps, spasms, and/or twitching\n*   Paralysis of any muscles\n\n**What happens during an EMG test?**\n\n1.

The electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by your muscles. This activity appears on a nearby monitor and may be heard through a speaker.\n\nAfter placement of the electrodes, you may be asked to contract the muscle. For example, by bending your arm. The electrical activity seen on the monitor provides information about your muscle's ability to respond when the nerves to your muscles are stimulated.\n\nA nerve conduction velocity test is almost always performed during the same visit as an EMG. The velocity test is done to see how fast and strong electrical signals move through a nerve.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is usually necessary. Avoid using any creams or lotions on the day of the test.\n\nBody temperature can affect the results of this test. If it is extremely cold outside, you may be told to wait in a warm room for a while before the test is performed.\n\nIf you are taking blood thinners or anticoagulants, inform the provider performing the test before it is done.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel some pain or discomfort when the needles are inserted. But most people are able to complete the test without problems.\n\nAfterward, the muscle may feel tender or bruised for a few days.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nEMG is most often used when a person has symptoms of weakness, pain, or abnormal sensation. It can help tell the difference between muscle weakness caused by the injury of a nerve attached to a muscle, and weakness due to a muscle or other nervous system disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThere is normally very little electrical activity in a muscle while at rest. Inserting the needles can cause some electrical activity, but once the muscles quiet down, there should be little electrical activity detected.\n\nWhen you flex a muscle, activity begins to appear. As you contract your muscle more, the electrical activity increases and a pattern can be seen. This pattern helps your provider determine if the muscle is responding as it should.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn EMG can detect problems with your muscles during rest or activity. Disorders or conditions that cause abnormal results include:\n\n* Alcoholic neuropathy (damage to nerves from drinking too much alcohol)\n* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement)\n* Axillary nerve dysfunction (damage of the nerve that controls shoulder movement and sensation)\n* Becker muscular dystrophy (muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis)\n* Brachial plexopathy (problem affecting the set of nerves that leave the neck and enter the arm)\n* Carpal tunnel syndrome (problem affecting the median nerve in the wrist and hand)\n* Cubital tunnel syndrome (problem affecting the ulnar nerve in the elbow)\n* Cervical spondylosis (neck pain from wear on the disks and bones of the neck)\n* Common peroneal nerve dysfunction (damage of the peroneal nerve leading to loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg)\n* Denervation (reduced nerve stimulation of a muscle)\n* Dermatomyositis (muscle disease that involves inflammation and a skin rash)\n* Distal median nerve dysfunction (problem affecting the median nerve in the arm)\n* Duchenne muscular dystrophy (inherited disease that involves muscle weakness)\n* Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (Landouzy-Dejerine; disease of muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue)\n* Familial periodic paralysis (disorder that causes muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood)\n* Femoral nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in parts of the legs due to damage to the femoral nerve)\n* Friedreich ataxia (inherited disease that affects areas in the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions)\n* Guillain-Barré syndrome (autoimmune disorder of the nerves that leads to muscle weakness or paralysis)\n* Lambert-Eaton syndrome (autoimmune disorder of the nerves that causes muscle weakness)\n* Multiple mononeuropathy (a nervous system disorder that involves damage to at least 2 separate nerve areas)\n* Mononeuropathy (damage to a single nerve that results in loss of movement, sensation, or other function of that nerve)\n* Myopathy (muscle degeneration caused by a number of disorders, including muscular dystrophy)\n* Myasthenia gravis (autoimmune disorder of the nerves that causes weakness of the voluntary muscles)\n* Peripheral neuropathy (damage of nerves away from the brain and spinal cord)\n* Polymyositis (muscle weakness, swelling, tenderness, and tissue damage of the skeletal muscles)\n* Radial nerve dysfunction (damage of the radial nerve causing loss of movement or sensation in the back of the arm or hand)\n* Radiculopathy (injury to nerve roots as they exit the spine most often in the neck or lower back)\n* Sciatic nerve dysfunction (injury to or pressure on the sciatic nerve that causes weakness, numbness, or tingling in the leg)\n* Sensorimotor polyneuropathy (condition that causes a decreased ability to move or feel because of nerve damage)\n* Shy-Drager syndrome (nervous system disease that causes body-wide symptoms)\n* Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (muscle weakness from high levels of thyroid hormone)\n* Tibial nerve dysfunction (damage of the tibial nerve causing loss of movement or sensation in the foot)\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of this test include:\n\n* Bleeding (minimal)\n* Infection at the electrode sites (rare)\n\n---\n\n**Electromyography (EMG)**\n\nA test that checks the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   Your healthcare provider inserts a very thin needle electrode through your skin into one of your muscles.\n*   The electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by your muscles.

    "content": "**Electroretinography**\n\n_Electroretinography is a test to measure the electrical response of the eye's light-sensitive cells, called rods and cones. These cells are part of the retina (the back part of the eye)._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nWhile you are in a sitting position, the health care provider places numbing drops into your eyes, so you will not have any discomfort during the test. Your eyes are held open with a small device called a speculum. An electrical sensor (electrode) is placed on each eye.\n\nThe electrode measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. A light flashes, and the electrical response travels from the electrode to a TV-like screen, where it can be viewed and recorded. The normal response pattern has waves called A and B.\n\nThe provider will take the readings in normal room light and then again in the dark, after allowing 20 minutes for your eyes to adjust.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe probes that rest on your eye may feel a little scratchy. The test takes about 1 hour to perform.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to detect disorders of the retina. It is also useful for determining if retinal surgery is recommended.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal test results will show a normal A and B pattern in response to each flash.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe following conditions may cause abnormal results:\n\n* Arteriosclerosis with damage to the retina\n* Congenital night blindness\n* Congenital retinoschisis (splitting of the retinal layers)\n* Giant cell arteritis\n* Medicines (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine)\n* Mucopolysaccharidosis\n* Retinal detachment\n* Rod-cone dystrophy (retinitis pigmentosa)\n* Trauma\n* Vitamin A deficiency\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe cornea may get a temporary scratch on the surface from the electrode. Otherwise, there are no risks with this procedure.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nYou should not rub your eyes for an hour after the test, as this could injure the cornea.

It does not stop migraine attacks from coming or reduce the number of headaches you have.\n\n**How Should I Take Eletriptan?**\n\nTake eletriptan exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed. If your symptoms improve after taking eletriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take eletriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking eletriptan, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Do not take eletriptan if you have taken any of the following medications in the past 24 hours: other selective serotonin receptor agonists such as almotriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan; or ergot-type medications such as bromocriptine, cabergoline, dihydroergotamine, ergoloid mesylates, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, methysergide, and pergolide. Do not take eletriptan within 72 hours of clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and troleandomycin.\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\nThis medication may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, and muscle pain. If you experience any of these side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n**How Should I Store and Dispose of Eletriptan?**\n\nStore eletriptan at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

    "content": "**Eleuthero**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nEleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is a woody shrub sometimes called Siberian ginseng. It is not a true ginseng. It is sometimes used as an adaptogen.\n\nEleuthero is often considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are a class of substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. Eleuthero contains many chemicals that affect the brain, immune system, and certain hormones.\n\nPeople use eleuthero for genital herpes, diabetes, athletic performance, memory and thinking skills, the common cold, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\nDon't confuse eleuthero with other herbs called \"ginseng,\" including American Ginseng, Blue Cohosh, Canaigre, Codonopsis, Panax Ginseng, and Panax Notoginseng. These are not the same.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for ELEUTHERO are as follows:\n\nPossibly effective for...\n\n* Genital herpes. Taking a specific eleuthero extract (Elagen) by mouth might help reduce genital herpes outbreaks.\n* There is interest in using eleuthero for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Eleuthero is likely safe when used for up to 3 months. Eleuthero is usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include diarrhea, stomach upset, and headache. There isn't enough reliable information to know if eleuthero is safe to use for longer than 3 months.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if eleuthero is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: Eleuthero is possibly safe in teenagers (ages 12-17 years) when taken by mouth for up to 6 weeks. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use long-term or in young children.\n* Heart conditions: Eleuthero might cause a pounding heart, irregular heartbeat, or high blood pressure in people who have heart disorders. If you have a heart condition, only use eleuthero under the supervision of a healthcare provider.\n* Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Eleuthero might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use eleuthero.\n\n---\n\n**Eleuthero: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Content:**\n\n* Use eleuthero with caution if you have a pounding heart, irregular heartbeat, or high blood pressure in people who have heart disorders. If you have a heart condition, only use eleuthero under the supervision of a healthcare provider.\n* Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Eleuthero might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use eleuthero.\n\n**Interactions with Medications:**\n\n* **Moderate:** Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Digoxin (Lanoxin): There is some concern that eleuthero might increase levels of digoxin. This could increase the effects and side effects of digoxin. If you are taking digoxin, speak with a healthcare provider before taking eleuthero.\n\t+ Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates): Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eleuthero might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\t+ Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates): Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eleuthero might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\t+ Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs): Eleuthero might lower blood sugar levels. Taking eleuthero along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n\t+ Medications moved by pumps in cells (Organic anion-transporting polypeptide substrates): Some medications are moved in and out of cells by pumps. Eleuthero might change how these pumps work and change how much medication stays in the body. In some cases, this might change the effects and side effects of a medication.\n\t+ Medications moved by pumps in cells (P-glycoprotein substrates): Some medications are moved in and out of cells by pumps. Eleuthero might change how these pumps work and change how much medication stays in the body. In some cases, this might change the effects and side effects of a medication.\n\t+ Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants): Eleuthero can increase the activity of the immune system. Some medications, such as those used after a transplant, decrease the activity of the immune system. Taking eleuthero along with these medications might decrease the effects of these medications.\n\t+ Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs): Eleuthero might slow blood clotting. Taking eleuthero along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements:**\n\n* **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar:** Eleuthero might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n* **Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting:** Eleuthero might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n\n**Interactions with Foods:**\n\n* There are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\n* There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of eleuthero might be.\n\n---\n\n**Eleuthero: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**There are no known interactions with foods.**\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nThere isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of eleuthero might be. It's often used in combination with other herbs such as Andrographis and Echinacea. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.\n\n**Other names**\n\n* Acanthopanax Obovatus\n* Acanthopanax Obovatus Hoo\n* Acanthopanax senticosus\n* Buisson du Diable\n* Ci Wu Jia\n* Ciwujia\n* Ciwujia Root\n* Ciwujia Root Extract\n* Devil's Bush\n* Devil's Shrub\n* Éleuthéro\n* Eleuthero Extract\n* Eleuthero Ginseng\n* Eleuthero Root\n* Eleutherococci Radix\n* Eleutherococcus senticosus\n* Éleuthérocoque\n* Ginseng de Sibérie\n* Ginseng des Russes\n* Ginseng Root\n* Ginseng Siberiano\n* Ginseng Sibérien\n* Hedera senticosa\n* North Wu Jia Pi\n* Phytoestrogen\n* Plante Secrète des Russes\n* Poivre Sauvage\n* Prickly Eleutherococcus\n* Racine d'Eleuthérocoque\n* Racine de Ginseng\n* Racine Russe\n* Russian Root\n* Shigoka\n* Siberian Eleuthero\n* Siberian Ginseng\n* Taiga Ginseng\n* Thorny Bearer of Free Berries\n* Touch-Me-Not\n* Untouchable\n* Ussuri\n* Ussurian Thorny Pepperbrush\n* Wild Pepper\n* Wu Jia Pi\n* Wu-jia\n* Wuchaseng\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\nRossi GCM, Scudeller L, Bettio F, Milano G.

Eliglustat is in a class of medications called enzyme inhibitors. It works by preventing the body from producing the fatty substance so that less of it will build up in the body and cause symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEliglustat comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily with or without food. Take eliglustat at around the same time(s) every day.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a622071.html",
    "content": "**Elivaldogene Autotemcel Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection is used to slow the progression of brain damage and slow the decline of nerve function in males 4–17 years of age with early, active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD; an inherited condition in which fatty acids build up in the brain, resulting in nerve and brain damage). It works by helping your body to break down the fatty acids and slow the progression of nerve and brain damage.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. It is given as a one-time dose, which is contained in 1 or 2 infusion bags. Each infusion bag is usually given over no more than 60 minutes.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection is in a class of medications called autologous cellular immunotherapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYour blood will be monitored at least every 6 months for at least 15 years after your treatment with elivaldogene autotemcel injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: unusual bruising or bleeding; nose bleed; severe headache; blood in urine, stool, or vomit; coughing up blood; or unusual abdominal or back pain.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection may cause nausea and vomiting during treatment with the medication. Your doctor may give you other medications to help prevent nausea and vomiting.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any severe symptoms, call your doctor immediately.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to elivaldogene autotemcel injection.\n\n---\n\n**Elivaldogene Autotemcel Injection**\n\nYou will have to stay in the hospital for about 2 months after you receive your elivaldogene autotemcel dose to monitor you for any side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for mobilization and apheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. Elivaldogene autotemcel injection is given as a one-time dose, which is contained in 1 or 2 infusion bags. Each infusion bag is usually given over no more than 60 minutes. Before you receive your elivaldogene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for elivaldogene autotemcel.\n\nBefore your dose of elivaldogene autotemcel injection is to be given, a sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated. The sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of elivaldogene autotemcel injection. It will take about 51–65 days from the time that your blood stem cells are collected before they are ready to be given to you. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you.\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection may cause nausea and vomiting during treatment with the medication. Your doctor may give you other medications to help prevent nausea and vomiting.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore receiving elivaldogene autotemcel injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to elivaldogene autotemcel, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in elivaldogene autotemcel injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or kidney or liver problems.\n\nYou should know that elivaldogene autotemcel injection is only for use in males. If you are male, you and your female partner should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment and for at least 6 months after you receive elivaldogene autotemcel injection. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If your partner becomes pregnant while you are receiving elivaldogene autotemcel injection, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that elivaldogene autotemcel injection may decrease fertility in men. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving elivaldogene autotemcel injection.\n\nDo not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation after you receive elivaldogene autotemcel injection.\n\nCheck with your doctor to see if you need to receive any vaccinations. Do not have any vaccinations without talking to your doctor for at least 6 weeks before starting chemotherapy, during your elivaldogene autotemcel treatment, and until your doctor tells you that your immune system has recovered.\n\n---\n\n**Elivaldogene Autotemcel Injection**\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* stomach pain\n* decreased appetite\n* mouth sores\n* blurred vision\n* headache\n* hair loss\n* darkening of the skin\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* rash; itching; hives; swelling of your face, mouth, tongue, or throat; chest pain; fast heartbeat; or difficulty swallowing or breathing\n* unusual bruising or bleeding; nose bleed; severe headache; blood in urine, stool, or vomit; coughing up blood; or unusual abdominal or back pain\n* fever, sore throat, swollen glands, ongoing cough and congestion, or other signs of infection\n* weakness, feeling tired, or shortness of breath\n* seizure\n\nElivaldogene autotemcel injection may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

You should know that you may have a false-positive test for HIV after you receive elivaldogene autotemcel injection.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking.

    "content": "**Eltrombopag**\n\n*pronounced as (el trom' boe pag)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets (cells that help the blood clot) to decrease the risk of bleeding in adults and children 1 year of age and older who have chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; an ongoing condition that may cause unusual bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood) and who have not been helped or cannot be treated with other treatments, including medications or surgery to remove the spleen.\n\nEltrombopag is also used to increase the number of platelets in people who have hepatitis C (a viral infection that may damage the liver) so that they can begin and continue treatment with interferon (Peginterferon, Pegintron, others) and ribavirin (Rebetol).\n\nEltrombopag is also used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia (condition in which the body does not make enough new blood cells) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is also used to treat aplastic anemia in adults who have not been helped with other medications.\n\nEltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets enough to decrease the risk of bleeding in people with ITP or aplastic anemia, or to allow treatment with interferon and ribavirin in people with hepatitis C. However it is not used to increase the number of platelets to a normal level.\n\nEltrombopag should not be used to treat people who have low numbers of platelets due to conditions other than ITP, hepatitis C, or aplastic anemia.\n\nEltrombopag is in a class of medications called thrombopoietin receptor agonists. It works by causing the cells in the bone marrow to produce more platelets.\n\n---\n\n**Eltrombopag: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What is Eltrombopag?**\n\nEltrombopag is a medication used to treat people with low platelet counts due to conditions other than immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hepatitis C, or aplastic anemia.\n\n**How Does Eltrombopag Work?**\n\nEltrombopag works by causing the cells in the bone marrow to produce more platelets. It is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which means it stimulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow.\n\n**Who Can Take Eltrombopag?**\n\nEltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets in adults and children 1 year of age and older who have chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It is also used to increase the number of platelets in people with hepatitis C so that they can begin and continue treatment with interferon and ribavirin. Additionally, it is used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia in adults and children 2 years of age and older.\n\n**How Should I Take Eltrombopag?**\n\nEltrombopag comes as a tablet and as a powder for oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It should be taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not split, chew, or crushed.\n\n**Special Instructions**\n\n* Take eltrombopag at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after eating foods that contain a lot of calcium.\n* If you are taking the powder for oral suspension, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use. Mix the powder with cool or cold water and do not mix it with hot water.\n* Do not allow the powder to touch your skin.\n\n**Monitoring Your Treatment**\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of eltrombopag and adjust your dose depending on your response to the medication. Your platelet level will be checked once a week at the beginning of your treatment, and your doctor may increase or decrease your dose based on the results.\n\n---\n\n**Eltrombopag: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\nIf you have chronic ITP, you may receive other medications to treat your condition along with eltrombopag.

The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. Elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat helps to keep elvitegravir in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect. Although the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer.

It is done to treat life-threatening choking.\n\n**Description**\n\nEmergency airway puncture is done in an emergency situation, when someone is choking and all other efforts to assist with breathing have failed.\n\nA hollow needle or tube can be inserted into the throat, just below the Adam's apple (thyroid cartilage), into the airway. The needle passes through the skin between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage.\n\nIn a hospital, before inserting the needle, a small cut may be made in the skin and the membrane between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA needle cricothyrotomy is an emergency procedure to relieve an airway obstruction until surgery can be done to place a breathing tube (tracheostomy or surgical cricothyrotomy).\n\nIf the airway blockage occurs with trauma to the head, neck, or spine, care must be taken to avoid further injury to the person.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for this procedure include:\n\n* Injury to the voice box (larynx), thyroid gland, or esophagus\n* Risks for any surgery are:\n\t+ Bleeding\n\t+ Infection\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the person does depends on the cause of the airway blockage and how quickly the person receives proper breathing support.

    "content": "**Emicizumab-kxwh Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEmicizumab-kxwh injection is used to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding in adults, children, and infants with hemophilia A (condition in which the blood does not clot normally because of a missing or faulty blood clotting factor). Emicizumab-kxwh is in a class of medications called hemostatic antibodies. It works by acting as a bridge between clotting factors to help your blood clot.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEmicizumab-kxwh comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Initially, it is given once a week for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, it may be injected subcutaneously once every week, once every 2 weeks, or once every 4 weeks. Your doctor will tell you how often to inject emicizumab-kxwh. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use emicizumab-kxwh injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may allow you or a caregiver to perform the injections at home. Your healthcare provider will teach you or a caregiver how to perform the injections at home. Before you use emicizumab-kxwh injection yourself for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's instructions for use information for the patient. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to inject the medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nEmicizumab-kxwh may cause thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA; a condition involving blood clots and injury to blood vessels that damages the kidneys, brain, and other organs) and blood clots in your arms, leg, lung, or head, especially if you use activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) to treat breakthrough bleeds. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: confusion; weakness; swelling, pain, or redness in arms or legs; yellowing of eyes or skin; stomach, chest, or back pain; nausea or vomiting; feeling faint; decreased urination; eye pain, swelling, or trouble seeing; fast heartbeat; numbness in your face; headache; shortness of breath; or coughing up blood.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how and when you should treat breakthrough bleeds. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to emicizumab-kxwh injection.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with emicizumab-kxwh injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of using emicizumab-kxwh injection.\n\n---\n\n**Emicizumab-kxwh Injection**\n\n**How to Use Emicizumab-kxwh Injection**\n\n*   Allow the vial to warm to room temperature for 15 minutes away from direct sunlight before injecting the medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method.\n*   Dispose of used syringes, needles, and vials in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\n**Checking the Vial**\n\n*   Check the expiration date printed on the vial to ensure it has not passed.\n*   Look closely at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow, without any cloudy or discolored appearance or large particles.

    "content": "**Emphysema**\n\n**What is Emphysema?**\n\nEmphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\n\n**How Does Emphysema Affect the Lungs?**\n\nEmphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.\n\nIn emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.\n\n**What Causes Emphysema?**\n\nThe cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them.\n\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\n\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema.\n\n**Who is at Risk for Emphysema?**\n\nThe risk factors for emphysema include:\n\n*   Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke.\n*   Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.\n*   Age. Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\n*   Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Emphysema?**\n\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\n\n*   Frequent coughing or wheezing\n*   A cough that produces a lot mucus\n*   Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity\n*   A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\n*   Tightness in your chest\n\nSome people with emphysema get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, emphysema can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.\n\n**How is Emphysema Diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n*   A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   A family history\n*   Other tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\n\n**What are the Treatments for Emphysema?**\n\nThere is no cure for emphysema. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\n\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as\n    *   Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema.\n    *   Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\n    *   Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\n*   Medicines, such as\n    *   Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.\n    *   Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with emphysema are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases\n    *   Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection\n    *   Oxygen therapy, if you have severe emphysema and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.\n*   Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\n    *   An exercise program\n    *   Disease management training\n    *   Nutritional counseling\n    *   Psychological counseling\n*   Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to\n    *   Remove damaged lung tissue\n    *   Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.\n    *   Do a lung transplant. This is might be an option if you have very severe emphysema.\n\n**Can Emphysema be Prevented?**\n\nSince smoking causes most cases of emphysema, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.\n\n---\n\n**Emphysema**\n\n**What is Emphysema?**\n\nEmphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

    "content": "**Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\n**What is Empty Sella Syndrome?**\n\nEmpty sella syndrome is a condition in which the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe pituitary is a small gland located just underneath the brain. It is attached to the bottom of the brain by the pituitary stalk. The pituitary sits protected inside a saddle-like bony compartment in the base of the skull. This compartment is called the sella turcica, but often just called the sella.\n\nWhen the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on an MRI scan. This makes the area of the pituitary gland look like an \"empty sella.\" But the sella is not actually empty. It is often filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. With empty sella syndrome, CSF has leaked into the sella turcica, putting pressure on the pituitary. This causes the gland to shrink or flatten.\n\n**Types of Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\n*   **Primary Empty Sella Syndrome**: occurs when one of the layers (arachnoid) covering the outside of the brain bulges down into the sella and presses on the pituitary.\n*   **Secondary Empty Sella Syndrome**: occurs when the sella is empty because the pituitary gland has been damaged by:\n    *   A tumor\n    *   Radiation therapy\n    *   Surgery\n    *   Trauma\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nOften, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function. If there are symptoms, they may include:\n\n*   Erection problems\n*   Headaches\n*   Irregular or absent menstruation\n*   Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido)\n*   Fatigue, low energy\n*   Nipple discharge\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPrimary empty sella syndrome is most often discovered during an MRI or CT scan of the head and brain. Pituitary function is usually normal.\n\nYour health care provider may order tests to check if the pituitary gland is working normally. Sometimes, tests for high pressure in the brain will be done, such as:\n\n*   Examination of the retina by an ophthalmologist\n*   Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nFor primary empty sella syndrome:\n\n*   No treatment is needed if pituitary function is normal.\n*   Medicines may be prescribed to treat any abnormal hormone levels.\n\nFor secondary empty sella syndrome, treatment involves replacing the hormones that are missing. In some cases, surgery is needed to repair the sella to prevent CSF from leaking into the nose and sinuses.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPrimary empty sella syndrome does not cause health problems, and it does not affect life expectancy.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of primary empty sella syndrome include a slightly higher than normal level of prolactin. This is a hormone made by the pituitary gland. Prolactin stimulates breast development and milk production in women.\n\nComplications of secondary empty sella syndrome are related to the cause of pituitary gland disease or to the effects of too little pituitary hormone (hypopituitarism).\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of abnormal pituitary function, such as menstrual cycle problems or impotence.\n\n---\n\n**Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\nEmpty sella syndrome is a condition in which the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened. **The Pituitary Gland: A Small but Mighty Gland**\n\nLocated just underneath the brain, the pituitary gland is attached to the bottom of the brain by the pituitary stalk. It sits protected inside a saddle-like bony compartment in the base of the skull, called the sella turcica or simply the sella.\n\n**Causes of Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\nThere are two main types of empty sella syndrome:\n\n*   **Primary Empty Sella Syndrome**: This occurs when one of the layers covering the outside of the brain bulges down into the sella and presses on the pituitary.\n*   **Secondary Empty Sella Syndrome**: This happens when the pituitary gland is damaged by a tumor, radiation therapy, surgery, or trauma.\n\n**Symptoms of Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\nOften, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function. However, if symptoms do occur, they may include:\n\n*   Erection problems\n*   Headaches\n*   Irregular or absent menstruation\n*   Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido)\n*   Fatigue, low energy\n*   Nipple discharge\n\n**Diagnosing Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\nPrimary empty sella syndrome is usually discovered during an MRI or CT scan of the head and brain. Pituitary function is typically normal.\n\nYour healthcare provider may order tests to check if the pituitary gland is working normally. Sometimes, tests for high pressure in the brain will be done, such as examining the retina by an ophthalmologist or a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n\n---\n\n**Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nEmpty sella syndrome is a condition where the pituitary gland is compressed or flattened, resulting in an empty appearance on imaging tests.\n\n**Types of Empty Sella Syndrome**\n\nThere are two types:\n\n*   **Primary empty sella syndrome**: This type occurs without any underlying cause and is often discovered during an MRI or CT scan of the head and brain.\n*   **Secondary empty sella syndrome**: This type is caused by another condition, such as a tumor or infection, that affects the pituitary gland.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn most cases, there are no symptoms. However, some people may experience:\n\n*   **Abnormal hormone levels**: The pituitary gland produces hormones that regulate various bodily functions.\n*   **Menstrual cycle problems**: Women may experience irregular periods or infertility due to hormonal imbalances.\n*   **Impotence**: Men may experience erectile dysfunction due to hormonal imbalances.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose empty sella syndrome, your healthcare provider may:\n\n*   Order imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, to visualize the pituitary gland.\n*   Check hormone levels to determine if the pituitary gland is functioning normally.\n*   Perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for high pressure in the brain.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for empty sella syndrome depends on the underlying cause:\n\n*   **No treatment needed**: If the pituitary function is normal, no treatment is required.\n*   **Medicines may be prescribed**: To treat any abnormal hormone levels.\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy**: For secondary empty sella syndrome, hormone replacement therapy may be necessary to replace missing hormones.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be needed to repair the sella and prevent CSF from leaking into the nose and sinuses.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nPrimary empty sella syndrome does not cause health problems and does not affect life expectancy. However, complications can arise if left untreated, such as a slightly higher than normal level of prolactin, which can lead to breast development and milk production in women.",

Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir. If you have HBV and you take emtricitabine and tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to see if your HBV has worsened.\n\nIf you are taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to help prevent you from getting HIV, your doctor will test you to see if you have HIV before you begin your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have had any of the following symptoms in the last month or if you have any of the following symptoms while taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to help prevent you from getting HIV: fever, tiredness, joint or muscle pain, rash, night sweats, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, swollen neck or groin area. Tell your doctor if you think you may have been exposed to HIV. Emtricitabine and tenofovir does not always prevent HIV. Your doctor will order HIV tests at least every 3 months while you are taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to see if you have become infected with HIV. Emtricitabine and tenofovir should only be used in combination with other medications to treat HIV. If emtricitabine and tenofovir are used alone to treat HIV, your condition may become more difficult to treat.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory.

    "content": "**Emtricitabine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEmtricitabine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Emtricitabine is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although emtricitabine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEmtricitabine comes as a capsule and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take emtricitabine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take emtricitabine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nEmtricitabine controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take emtricitabine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking emtricitabine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of emtricitabine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking emtricitabine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nEmtricitabine should not be used to treat hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with emtricitabine. If you have HBV and you take emtricitabine, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking emtricitabine. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking emtricitabine to see if your HBV has worsened.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to emtricitabine.

    "content": "**Enalapril and Hydrochlorothiazide**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Enalapril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once or twice a day. To help you remember to take enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time(s) every day.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking valsartan and sacubitril (Entresto) or if you have stopped taking it within the last 36 hours. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide, if you are also taking valsartan and sacubitril. Also, tell your doctor if you have diabetes and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT).

The two main types are:\n\n*   **Infectious Encephalitis**: usually caused by a virus.\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Get Encephalitis?**\n\nYou are more likely to get encephalitis if you:\n\n*   Have a weakened immune system, for example from having HIV or taking certain medicines.\n*   Are a young child or older adult.\n*   Live in areas where there are ticks and mosquitoes that carry viruses that can cause encephalitis.\n\n**Symptoms of Encephalitis**\n\nThe symptoms of encephalitis can vary a lot, depending on how severe it is. Many people do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, or body aches. If encephalitis becomes more serious, it can cause:\n\n*   Severe headache\n*   Stiff neck\n*   Vomiting\n*   Seizures\n*   Behavior changes\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Partial paralysis in your arms and legs\n*   Coma\n\n**Diagnosis of Encephalitis**\n\nTo find out if you have encephalitis, your health care provider:\n\n*   Will do a physical exam\n*   Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   May do a neurologic exam\n*   May order imaging tests, such as a brain CT scan or MRI\n*   May order an EEG (electroencephalography), which use small electric sensors to measure your brain activity\n*   May order blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests\n\n**Treatments for Encephalitis**\n\nMost people with encephalitis will need treatment in the hospital. Depending on the cause, treatments may include antiviral medicines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and other medicines.\n\nFor some types of encephalitis, there is no medicine to treat it. But rest, nutrition, and fluids can help your body fight the infection and relieve symptoms.\n\nSome people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control.\n\n**Prevention of Encephalitis**\n\nThere are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis that is caused by infections:\n\n*   Use good hygiene, including washing your hands often with soap and water.\n*   Don't share food, drinks, utensils, and glasses with other people.\n*   Get vaccines for viruses that can cause encephalitis.\n*   Avoid mosquito and tick bites, for example by:\n    *   Wearing insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Make sure to follow the instructions for using the repellant.\n    *   Wearing clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet.\n    *   Treating your clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin before you go in grassy or woody areas.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   **Encephalitis (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)**: Learn more about encephalitis from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n*   **Inflamed Brain: Recognizing Encephalitis and Meningitis (National Institutes of Health)**: Read about recognizing encephalitis and meningitis from the National Institutes of Health.\n\n---\n\n**Encephalitis**\n\nInflammation (swelling) of the brain can happen when an infection or medical condition that affects the brain activates your immune system. The inflammation can cause a wide range of symptoms. In extreme cases, it can lead to brain damage, stroke, or even death.\n\n**What causes encephalitis?**\n\nThere are different types of encephalitis, based on what the cause is. The two main types are infectious encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n* **Infectious Encephalitis**: Usually caused by a virus. In fact, viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis.\n\t+ Herpes viruses (HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus)\n\t+ Viruses transmitted through tick bites (TBE virus, Powassan virus)\n\t+ Viruses transmitted through mosquito bites (eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, La Crosse virus)\n\t+ Enteroviruses\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells. It can be triggered by conditions such as certain cancers, benign tumors, and infections.\n\n**Who is more likely to get encephalitis?**\n\nAnyone can get encephalitis, but you are more likely to get it if you:\n\n* Have a weakened immune system (e.g., HIV, certain medicines)\n* Are a young child or older adult\n* Live in areas where there are ticks and mosquitoes that carry viruses that can cause encephalitis\n\n**What are the symptoms of encephalitis?**\n\nThe symptoms of encephalitis can vary a lot, depending on how severe it is. Many people do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, or body aches. If encephalitis becomes more serious, it can cause:\n\n* Severe headache\n* Stiff neck\n* Vomiting\n* Seizures\n* Behavior changes\n* Drowsiness\n* Muscle weakness\n* Partial paralysis in your arms and legs\n* Coma\n\nEncephalitis can be dangerous in infants. Their symptoms may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Lethargy (weakness or drowsiness)\n* Poor feeding\n* Vomiting\n* Body stiffness\n* Unusual irritability or crying\n* A full or bulging fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head)\n\n**How is encephalitis diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have encephalitis, your health care provider:\n\n* Will do a physical exam\n* Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n* May do a neurologic exam\n* May order imaging tests (e.g., brain CT scan or MRI)\n* May order an EEG (electroencephalography)\n* May order blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests\n\n**What are the treatments for encephalitis?**\n\nMost people with encephalitis will need treatment in the hospital.

But rest, nutrition, and fluids can help your body fight the infection and relieve symptoms.\n\nSome people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control.\n\n**Can encephalitis be prevented?**\n\nThere are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis that is caused by infections:\n\n* Use good hygiene (e.g., washing your hands often with soap and water)\n* Don't share food, drinks, utensils, and glasses with other people\n* Get vaccines for viruses that can cause encephalitis\n* Avoid mosquito and tick bites (e.g., wearing insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent)\n\n---\n\n**Encephalitis**\n\nEncephalitis is a serious inflammation of the brain caused by a viral or bacterial infection, or sometimes an autoimmune response. The symptoms can vary depending on the cause, but they often include fever, headache, confusion, seizures, and in severe cases, coma.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThere are several causes of encephalitis, including:\n\n*   **Viral infections**: Such as herpes simplex virus, rabies, and West Nile virus\n*   **Bacterial infections**: Such as Lyme disease and tuberculosis\n*   **Autoimmune responses**: Where the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of encephalitis can vary depending on the cause, but they often include:\n\n*   **Fever**\n*   **Headache**\n*   **Confusion**\n*   **Seizures**\n*   **Coma** in severe cases\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose encephalitis, doctors may use various tests, including:\n\n*   **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis**: To check for signs of infection or inflammation\n*   **EEG (electroencephalogram)**: To measure the electrical activity of the brain\n*   **Functional MRI (fMRI)**: To visualize the brain's structure and function\n*   **Head CT scan**: To rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for encephalitis depends on the underlying cause, but it often involves:\n\n*   **Antiviral medicines**: For viral infections\n*   **Antibiotics**: For bacterial infections\n*   **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation and swelling\n*   **Rest**, **nutrition**, and **fluids**: To help the body fight off the infection\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis caused by infections, such as:\n\n*   **Vaccination**: Against viral and bacterial infections\n*   **Avoiding mosquito bites**: To prevent West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses\n*   **Practicing good hygiene**: To prevent the spread of infection\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are approximately 2,500 cases of encephalitis reported in the United States each year. The CDC also reports that the mortality rate for encephalitis is around 20-30%.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nThere are ongoing clinical trials investigating new treatments for encephalitis, including:\n\n*   **Antiviral medicines**: To improve treatment outcomes for viral infections\n*   **Immunomodulatory therapies**: To reduce inflammation and promote recovery\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent journal articles on encephalitis include:\n\n*   **\"Approach and overview of autoimmune encephalitis: A review.\"**\n*   **\"Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein Reflects Disease Activity in Autoimmune Encephalitis.\"**\n*   **\"Assessing Commercial Tissue-Based Assays for Autoimmune Neurologic Disorders (II): Antibodies to...\"**\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nIf you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of encephalitis, it's essential to seek medical attention immediately. You can find a specialist by visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website or contacting your local health department.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nFor patients and caregivers, here are some helpful resources:\n\n*   **Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection**: A guide on how to collect CSF samples\n*   **CSF analysis**: Information on interpreting CSF test results\n*   **Encephalitis**: A comprehensive overview of the condition\n\n**Topic Image**\n\n[Insert image description]\n\nThis topic image highlights the importance of recognizing and treating encephalitis promptly.",
