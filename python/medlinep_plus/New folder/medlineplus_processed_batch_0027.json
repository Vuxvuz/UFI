All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n---\n\n**Boric Acid Poisoning**\n\n**What is Boric Acid?**\n\nBoric acid is a caustic chemical that can cause injury if it contacts tissues.\n\n**Types of Poisoning**\n\nThere are two types of boric acid poisoning:\n\n*   **Acute poisoning**: This usually occurs when someone swallows powdered roach-killing products that contain the chemical.\n*   **Chronic poisoning**: This occurs in those who are repeatedly exposed to boric acid. For example, in the past, boric acid was used to disinfect and treat wounds.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptoms of boric acid poisoning are:\n\n*   Blue-green vomit\n*   Diarrhea\n*   A bright red rash on the skin\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n*   Blisters\n*   Collapse\n*   Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n*   Seizures\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Lack of desire to do anything (lethargy)\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Restlessness\n*   Significantly decreased urine output (or none)\n*   Sloughing of skin\n*   Twitching of facial muscles, arms, hands, legs, and feet\n*   Weakness\n\n**Where is Boric Acid Found?**\n\nBoric acid is found in:\n\n*   Antiseptics and astringents\n*   Enamels and glazes\n*   Glass fiber manufacturing\n*   Medicated powders\n*   Skin lotions\n*   Some paints\n*   Some rodent and ant pesticides\n*   Photography chemicals\n*   Powders to kill roaches\n*   Some eye wash products\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin, remove it by washing the area thoroughly.\n\nIf the chemical was swallowed, seek medical treatment immediately.\n\nIf the chemical contacted the eyes, wash the eyes with cool water for 15 minutes.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nDetermine the following information:\n\n*   The person's age, weight, and condition\n*   The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n*   The time it was swallowed\n*   The amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Boric Acid Poisoning**\n\n**What to Do If You Have Been Exposed**\n\nIf you suspect boric acid poisoning, call the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning who will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Treatment depends on the individual symptoms. The person may receive:\n\n*   Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Camera down the throat (endoscopy) to see burns in the esophagus and stomach\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   CT (computerized axial tomography) scan\n\n    ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n*   Fluids through a vein (IV)\n*   Medicines to treat symptoms\n\nNote: Activated charcoal does not effectively treat poisoning by acids.\n\nFor skin exposure, treatment may include:\n\n*   Surgical removal of burned skin (debridement)\n*   Transfer to a hospital that specializes in burn care\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation), possibly every few hours for several days\n\nThe person may need to be admitted to a hospital for more treatment. Surgery may be needed if the esophagus, stomach, or intestine has a hole (perforation) from the acid.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe infant death rate from boric acid poisonings is high. However, boric acid poisoning is considerably rarer than in the past because the substance is no longer used as a disinfectant in nurseries. It is also no longer commonly used in medical preparations. Boric acid is an ingredient in some vaginal suppositories used for yeast infections, although this is NOT a standard treatment.\n\nSwallowing a large amount of boric acid can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the boric acid was swallowed. Death from complications may occur as long as several months later. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may result in serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBorax poisoning\n\n---\n\n**Boric Acid Poisoning**\n\n\\n\\n* **Caustics**: Boric acid is a caustic substance that can cause severe burns and damage to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Ingestion of boric acid can lead to gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n* **Symptoms**: Symptoms of boric acid poisoning may include abdominal pain, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures, coma, and even death.\n\n**References**\n\n* Aronson JK.

    "content": "**Boron**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBoron is an element that has been consumed for menstrual cramps and boric acid has been used vaginally for yeast infections, but evidence is limited.\n\nBoron seems to affect the way the body handles other minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. It also seems to increase estrogen levels post-menopause. Boric acid, a common form of boron, can kill yeast that cause vaginal infections. Boron may have antioxidant effects.\n\nPeople commonly use boron for boron deficiency and vaginal yeast infections. It is also used for athletic performance, menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BORON are as follows:\n\n* Likely effective for:\n\t+ Boron deficiency. Taking boron by mouth treats and prevents boron deficiency.\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Skin damage caused by radiation therapy (radiation dermatitis). Applying boron gel to the skin might help prevent skin damage caused by radiation therapy.\n\t+ Vaginal yeast infections. Applying boric acid inside the vagina can help treat yeast infections (candidiasis), including infections that do not seem to get better with other medications and treatments.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Athletic performance. Taking boron by mouth doesn't seem to improve body mass, muscle mass, or testosterone levels in male bodybuilders.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Boron is likely safe when used in doses that don't exceed 20 mg daily. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken in higher doses. Doses over 20 mg daily might cause male fertility problems. Large doses can also cause poisoning. Signs of poisoning include irritability, tremors, weakness, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate gel, which contains boron, is likely safe when applied to the skin for up to 5 weeks.\n\nWhen applied into the vagina: Boric acid, a common form of boron, is likely safe when used for up to 6 months. It can cause vaginal burning.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Boron is likely safe when taken by mouth during pregnancy or breast-feeding. For those 19-50 years old, do not take more than 20 mg daily; for those 14-18 years old, do not take more than 17 mg daily. Taking boron by mouth in higher doses is possibly unsafe and has been linked to lower birth weights and birth defects. Applying boric acid into the vagina during the first 4 months of pregnancy has also been linked to birth defects.\n* Children: Boron is likely safe when used appropriately. The amount that is safe depends on the child's age. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in higher doses. Large quantities of boron can cause poisoning. Boric acid powder, a common form of boron, is possibly unsafe when applied in large amounts to prevent diaper rash.\n* Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Boron might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, avoid supplemental boron or high amounts of boron from foods.\n* Kidney disease: Do not take boron supplements if you have kidney problems. The kidneys have to work hard to flush out boron.\n\n---\n\n**Boron: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Precautions**\n\n* Cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Boron might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, avoid supplemental boron or high amounts of boron from foods.\n* Kidney disease: Do not take boron supplements if you have kidney problems. The kidneys have to work hard to flush out boron.\n\n**Interactions**\n\n* Medications: It is not known if this product interacts with any medicines. Before taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\n* Herbs and Supplements: Magnesium - Boron supplements can increase how much magnesium stays in the body. This can increase blood levels of magnesium. But it's not clear if this is a big concern.\n\n**Usage**\n\n* Dietary Recommendations: Boron is naturally found in water and foods such as nuts and vegetables. There aren't any specific dietary recommendations for boron, but it's estimated that most adults consume about 1-1.5 mg daily.\n* Supplements: Adults shouldn't consume more than 20 mg daily. For children, the amount that is safe depends on age. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* Acide Borique\n* Anhydride Borique\n* Atomic number 5\n* B (chemical symbol)\n* B (symbole chimique)\n* Borate\n* Borate de Sodium\n* Borates\n* Bore\n* Bore Chélaté\n* Boric Acid\n* Boric Anhydride\n* Boric Tartrate\n* Boro\n* Boro Quelado\n* Boron Ascorbate\n* Boron Chelate\n* Calcium Fructoborate\n* Chélate de Bore\n* Chelated Boron\n* Numéro Atomique 5\n* Quelato de Boro\n* Sodium Borate\n* Sodium Pentaborate Pentahydrate\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n* Şahin F, Pirouzpanah MB, Farshbaf-Khalili A, et al.

Bosentan is only available at certain pharmacies that are registered with Tracleer REMS.\n\n\\n\\n**You Will Receive the Manufacturer's Patient Information Sheet (Medication Guide) When You Begin Treatment With Bosentan and Each Time You Refill the Prescription**\n\n*   Read the information carefully each time and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n*   You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm.\n\n\\n\\n**Why Is This Medication Prescribed?**\n\nBosentan is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, high blood pressure in the vessels that carry blood to the lungs) in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Bosentan may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH. Bosentan is in a class of medications called endothelin receptor antagonists. It works by stopping the action of endothelin, a natural substance that causes blood vessels to narrow and prevents normal blood flow in people who have PAH.\n\n\\n\\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nBosentan comes as a tablet and as a dispersible tablet (tablet that can be dissolved in liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day in the morning and evening. To help you remember to take bosentan, take it at around the same times every day.\n\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   Take bosentan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking the dispersible tablet, place the tablet in a small amount of liquid right before you take it. If your doctor has told you to take a half tablet, break the dispersible tablet carefully on the line. Take the half tablet as directed, and put the other half back in the opened blister in the package. Use the other half tablet within 7 days. Do not break the dispersible tablet into quarters.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of bosentan and increase your dose after 4 weeks.\n\nBosentan controls the symptoms of PAH but does not cure it. It may take 1 to 2 months or longer before you feel the full benefit of bosentan. Continue to take bosentan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bosentan without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking bosentan, your symptoms may get worse. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually.\n\n---\n\n**Bosentan: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Take Bosentan**\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of bosentan and increase your dose after 4 weeks.\n\n*   To help you remember to take bosentan, take it at around the same times every day.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   Take bosentan exactly as directed.

    "content": "**Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nBosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is a rare condition characterized by abnormalities of the nose and eyes and problems with puberty.\n\nThe key feature of BAMS is arhinia, which is the absence of an external nose. While most people with BAMS are born without a nose, some affected individuals have a severely underdeveloped (hypoplastic) nose. Affected individuals may also be missing the brain structure involved in the sense of smell (olfactory bulb). Because of these abnormalities, people with BAMS have an impaired ability to smell and, consequently, to taste.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Abnormally small or absent eyeballs (microphthalmia or anophthalmia)\n* Additional eye abnormalities:\n\t+ Gap or hole in one of several structures of the eye (coloboma)\n\t+ Clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts)\n* Head and face abnormalities:\n\t+ High arch or opening in the roof of the mouth (high-arched or cleft palate)\n\t+ Absence of the sinuses behind the nose (paranasal sinuses)\n\t+ Blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia)\n\t+ Narrowing of the tear ducts (nasolacrimal duct stenosis)\n\t+ Small upper jaw (hypoplastic maxilla)\n* Abnormal external ears\n* Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, leading to delayed puberty in affected individuals\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Genetic mutation affecting development of the nose and eyes\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome\n* BAMS\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nNote: The cleaned output is a rewritten version of the original text, formatted to be easy to read and understand. The structure and content have been preserved, with bold headings added to highlight important information.\n\n---\n\n**Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome**\n\n**What is Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome?**\n\nBosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is a rare condition characterized by abnormalities of the nose and eyes and problems with puberty.\n\n**Key Features of BAMS**\n\n*   Absence or severe underdevelopment of the external nose (arhinia)\n*   Impaired sense of smell and taste\n*   Abnormally small or absent eyeballs (microphthalmia or anophthalmia)\n*   Severe vision impairment or blindness\n*   Additional eye abnormalities, such as a gap or hole in one of several structures of the eye (coloboma) and clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts)\n\n**Other Head and Face Abnormalities**\n\n*   High arch or opening in the roof of the mouth (high-arched or cleft palate)\n*   Absence of the sinuses behind the nose (paranasal sinuses)\n*   Blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia)\n*   Narrowing of the tear ducts (nasolacrimal duct stenosis)\n*   Small upper jaw (hypoplastic maxilla)\n\n**Difficulty Breathing**\n\nMany of these abnormalities contribute to difficulty breathing, particularly in affected babies.\n\n**Abnormal External Ears**\n\nSome affected individuals have abnormal external ears.\n\n**Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism**\n\nIndividuals with BAMS also have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development. Without treatment, these hormone problems often result in delayed puberty. Affected males may also have underdeveloped reproductive tissues and undescended testes (cryptorchidism).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBAMS is a very rare condition with an unknown prevalence. Fewer than 100 cases of the condition have been described in the medical literature. BAMS has been found in several different populations.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBAMS is usually caused by mutations in the SMCHD1 gene. Other, unknown genes may be rare causes of the condition.\n\n**SMCHD1 Gene**\n\nThe SMCHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in regulating gene activity by altering the structure of DNA. Specifically, the SMCHD1 protein plays a role in turning off (silencing) certain genes. Among other functions, the SMCHD1 protein appears to be important for development of the nose, eyes, and other structures of the head and face.\n\n**How SMCHD1 Gene Mutations Affect Development**\n\nResearchers are unsure how SMCHD1 gene mutations affect the protein's function and lead to the development problems characteristic of BAMS. Changes in this gene may lead to abnormal silencing of genes involved in development of the head and face, which could underlie arhinia, microphthalmia, and other characteristic facial abnormalities of BAMS.\n\n**Additional Genetic Factors**\n\nSome people with an SMCHD1 gene mutation have arhinia without other features of BAMS (isolated arhinia) or less severe abnormalities of the nose, leading researchers to suspect that additional genetic factors contribute to the severity of the symptoms. These additional factors are not yet known.\n\n---\n\n**Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome**\n\nWithout other features of BAMS (isolated arhinia) or less severe abnormalities of the nose, leading researchers to suspect that additional genetic factors contribute to the severity of the symptoms. These additional factors are not yet known.\n\n**Learn More About the Gene Associated with Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome**\n\n*   **SMCHD1**: This gene is associated with Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SMCHD1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The parent often has milder symptoms, such as a reduced sense of smell (anosmia), arhinia without other features of BAMS, or less severe abnormalities of the nose.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **Arhinia Choanal Atresia Microphthalmia**\n*   **Bosma Syndrome**\n*   **Gifford-Bosma Syndrome**\n*   **Hyposmia-Nasal and Ocular Hypoplasia-Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism Syndrome**\n*   **Ruprecht Majewski Syndrome**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**: Genetic testing can help diagnose Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: This center provides information on rare diseases, including Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: Organizations such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) provide support and resources for individuals with rare disorders.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: This catalog provides information on genes and diseases, including Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: Scientific articles on PubMed provide information on the genetic basis of Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Brasseur B, Martin CM, Cayci Z, Burmeister L, Schimmenti LA.

    "content": "**Botulinum Toxin Injection - Larynx**\n\n**What is Botulinum Toxin?**\n\nBotulinum toxin (BTX) is a type of nerve blocker that blocks nerve signals to muscles, causing them to relax.\n\n**Is BTX Safe?**\n\nYes, BTX is safe when used in very small doses. It's the same toxin that causes botulism, a rare but serious illness.\n\n**How Does BTX Help with Laryngeal Dystonia?**\n\nBTX is injected into the muscles around the vocal cords to weaken them and improve voice quality. It's not a cure for laryngeal dystonia, but it can help ease symptoms.\n\n**What Happens During the Procedure?**\n\nIn most cases, you'll have the BTX injections in your healthcare provider's office. There are two common ways to inject BTX into the larynx:\n\n*   **Through the Neck:**\n    *   You may have local anesthesia to numb the area.\n    *   You may lie down on your back or remain sitting up, depending on your comfort and your provider's preference.\n    *   Your provider may use an EMG (electromyography) machine to guide the needle to the correct area.\n    *   Another method involves using a flexible laryngoscope inserted through the nose to help guide the needle.\n*   **Through the Mouth:**\n    *   You may have general anesthesia so you're asleep during this procedure.\n    *   Your provider will use a long, curved needle to inject directly into the vocal cord muscles.\n    *   They may place a small camera (endoscope) into your mouth to guide the needle.\n\n**Why Is This Procedure Performed?**\n\nYou would have this procedure if you've been diagnosed with laryngeal dystonia. BTX injections are the most common treatment for this condition.\n\n**What Are the Side Effects of BTX Injections?**\n\nSome side effects include:\n\n*   A breathy sound to your voice\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Weak cough\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pain where the BTX was injected\n*   Flu-like symptoms\n\nThese side effects usually only last a few days.\n\n**What's the Outlook (Prognosis) for BTX Injections?**\n\nIn most cases, BTX injections should improve your voice quality for about 3 to 4 months. To maintain your voice, you may need injections every few months. Your provider may ask you to keep a diary of your symptoms to see how well and how long the injection is working.\n\n---\n\n**Botulinum Toxin Injection - Larynx**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBotulinum toxin injection (BTX) into the larynx is a treatment for laryngeal dystonia, a condition that affects the voice box. BTX injections weaken the muscles around the vocal cords, improving voice quality.\n\n**How is it performed?**\n\nIn most cases, you will have the BTX injections in your healthcare provider's office. There are two common ways to inject BTX into the larynx:\n\n*   **Through the neck:**\n    *   You may have local anesthesia to numb the area.\n    *   You may lie down on your back or remain sitting up, depending on your comfort and your provider's preference.\n    *   Your provider may use an EMG (electromyography) machine to guide the needle to the correct area.\n    *   Another method involves using a flexible laryngoscope inserted through the nose to help guide the needle.\n*   **Through the mouth:**\n    *   You may have general anesthesia so you are asleep during this procedure.\n    *   You may also have numbing medicine sprayed into your nose, throat, and larynx.\n    *   Your provider will use a long, curved needle to inject directly into the vocal cord muscles.\n    *   Your provider may place a small camera (endoscope) into your mouth to guide the needle.\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\nBTX injections can improve voice quality for about 3 to 4 months. To maintain your voice, you may need injections every few months.\n\n**What are the side effects?**\n\nYou may not be able to talk for about an hour after the injections. BTX can cause some side effects, which in most cases only last a few days. Some of the side effects include:\n\n*   A breathy sound to your voice\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Weak cough\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pain where the BTX was injected\n*   Flu-like symptoms\n\n**What is the prognosis?**\n\nIn most cases, BTX injections should improve your voice quality for about 3 to 4 months. To maintain your voice, you may need injections every few months.\n\nYour provider may ask you to keep a diary of your symptoms to see how well and how long the injection is working. This will help you and your provider find the right dose for you and to decide how often you need treatment.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nInjection laryngoplasty; Botox - larynx: spasmodic dysphonia - BTX; Essential voice tremor (EVT) - btx; Glottic insufficiency; Percutaneous electromyography-guided botulinum toxin treatment; Percutaneous indirect laryngoscopy-guided botulinum toxin treatment; Adductor dysphonia - BTX; OnabotulinumtoxinA - larynx; AbobotulinumtoxinA\n\n---\n\n**Botulinum Toxin Injection - Larynx**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is botulinum toxin injection?**\n\nBotulinum toxin injection is a treatment for certain laryngeal disorders. It involves injecting a small amount of botulinum toxin into the affected area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe botulinum toxin works by temporarily paralyzing the muscles in the larynx, which can help to reduce symptoms such as hoarseness or voice strain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of botulinum toxin injection?**\n\nBotulinum toxin injection has been shown to be effective in treating certain laryngeal disorders, including dystonia and voice disorders. It is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed in a doctor's office.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Dystonia\n*   Voice Disorders",

It is part of a continuous spectrum of neurological conditions, known as PNPLA6-related disorders, that share a genetic cause and have a combination of overlapping features.\n\n**Key Features**\n\nThe three specific features of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome are:\n\n* **Ataxia**: difficulty with coordination and balance, arising from a loss of cells (atrophy) in the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum).\n* **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development, leading to delayed puberty.\n* **Chorioretinal dystrophy**: problems with the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina) and a nearby tissue layer called the choroid.\n\n**Additional Medical Problems**\n\nPeople with Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome can have additional medical problems, including:\n\n* Muscle stiffness (spasticity)\n* Impaired speech (dysarthria)\n* Difficulty processing, learning, or remembering information (cognitive impairment)\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBoucher-Neuhäuser syndrome is a rare condition. Its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost cases of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome are caused by mutations in the PNPLA6 gene. Such mutations are the only known cause of the condition. Researchers speculate that as-yet-unidentified mutations in the PNPLA6 gene or changes in other genes are involved in the remainder of cases.\n\n**How do PNPLA6 gene mutations lead to Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome?**\n\nPNPLA6 gene mutations are thought to impair NTE's function. However, it is unclear how these mutations cause Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome. Researchers speculate that impairment of lysophosphatidylcholine metabolism alters the balance of lipids in the cell membrane. This imbalance may damage neurons, leading to the movement and vision problems that characterize Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome.\n\n**When do the key features of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome begin?**\n\nThe key features of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome can begin anytime from infancy to adulthood, although at least one feature usually occurs by adolescence.\n\n---\n\n**Boucher-Neuhäuser Syndrome**\n\n**What is Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome?**\n\nBoucher-Neuhäuser syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by delayed puberty, movement problems, and vision issues.\n\n**Causes of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome**\n\nMost cases of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome are caused by mutations in the PNPLA6 gene. These mutations impair the function of the neuropathy target esterase (NTE) protein, which regulates the amount of certain fats in cell membranes.\n\n**Symptoms of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome include:\n\n* Delayed puberty\n* Movement problems\n* Vision issues\n\n**Inheritance pattern of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**Bowel Movement**\n\nA bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus. Another name for stool is feces. It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.\n\nSometimes a bowel movement isn't normal.

    "content": "**Bowel Obstruction | Intestinal Obstruction | MedlinePlus**\n\n**What is an intestinal obstruction?**\n\nAn intestinal obstruction occurs when food or stool cannot move through the intestines. The obstruction can be complete or partial. There are many causes, including adhesions, hernias, cancers, and certain medicines.\n\n**Symptoms of intestinal obstruction**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n*   Severe abdominal pain or cramping\n*   Vomiting\n*   Bloating\n*   Loud bowel sounds\n*   Swelling of the abdomen\n*   Inability to pass gas\n*   Constipation\n\n**When is an intestinal obstruction a medical emergency?**\n\nA complete intestinal obstruction is a medical emergency. It often requires surgery.\n\n**NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose an intestinal obstruction, your doctor may use the following tests:\n\n*   CT Enterography (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n*   Radiographic Tests in GI (American College of Gastroenterology)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nTreatment for an intestinal obstruction depends on the cause and severity of the blockage.

This can be caused by various factors such as adhesions, hernias, or tumors.\n\n**Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (Merck & Co., Inc.)**\n\nAcute mesenteric ischemia is a medical emergency that occurs when there is a sudden blockage of the blood supply to the intestines. This can lead to severe abdominal pain and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.\n\n**Bowel Obstruction and Cancer Treatment  (National Cancer Institute)**\n\nCancer treatment, particularly chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can increase the risk of bowel obstruction due to the damage caused to the lining of the small intestine.\n\n**Disorders of the Large Intestine (International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders)**\n\nThe large intestine is prone to various disorders such as constipation, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer. These conditions can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and rectal bleeding.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nCertain genetic conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia and Feingold syndrome can increase the risk of intestinal obstruction due to abnormalities in the development of the digestive system.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are actively exploring new treatments for intestinal obstruction through clinical trials. Some ongoing studies include:\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Fecal Impaction\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Intestinal Obstruction\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Intestinal Volvulus\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Intussusception\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the predictive value of albumin-based nutritional indices for intestinal ischemia, prevalence and pooled risk factors of stoma outlet obstruction after colorectal surgery, and pathogenetic characteristics and related risk factors of incisional infection after surgery.\n\n**Children**\n\nPediatric patients are susceptible to conditions like Hirschsprung disease, intestinal malrotation, and intussusception, which can cause intestinal obstruction. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preventing complications.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nFor patients experiencing intestinal obstruction, it is essential to understand the condition and its treatment options. Some key points include:\n\n*   Intestinal obstruction and ileus\n*   Intestinal obstruction repair\n*   Intestinal or bowel obstruction - discharge\n*   Intussusception - children\n*   Small bowel resection\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nAdhesions, colonic diseases, and small intestine disorders are related health topics that may be of interest to those affected by intestinal obstruction.\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is the primary NIH organization for research on intestinal obstruction.",

    "content": "**Bowel Incontinence**\n\nBowel incontinence is the loss of bowel control, causing you to unexpectedly pass stool. This can range from sometimes leaking a small amount of stool and passing gas, to not being able to control bowel movements.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIn adults age 65 and older, women tend to have problems with bowel control more often than men.\n\nChildren who have problems with leakage due to toilet training problems or constipation may have encopresis.\n\nThe rectum, anus, pelvic muscles, and nervous system must work together to control bowel movements. If there is a problem with any of these, it can cause incontinence. You must also be able to recognize and respond to the urge to have a bowel movement.\n\nMany people feel embarrassed about bowel incontinence and may not tell their health care provider. But incontinence can be treated. So you should tell your provider if you are having problems. Proper treatment can help most people gain control of their bowels. Exercises to make the anal and pelvic muscles stronger can help the bowels work properly.\n\n**Causes**\n\nReasons people have bowel incontinence include:\n\n* Ongoing (chronic) constipation. This causes the anal muscles and intestines to stretch and weaken, leading to diarrhea and stool leakage.\n* Fecal impaction. It is most often caused by chronic constipation. This leads to a lump of stool that partly blocks the large intestine.\n* Long-term laxative use.\n* Colectomy or bowel surgery.\n* Not sensing that it's time to have a bowel movement.\n* Emotional problems.\n* Gynecological, prostate, or rectal surgery.\n* Injury to the anal muscles due to childbirth (in women).\n* Nerve or muscle damage (from injury, tumor, or radiation).\n* Severe diarrhea that causes leakage.\n* Severe hemorrhoids or rectal prolapse.\n* Stress of being in an unfamiliar environment.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nOften, simple changes may help reduce bowel incontinence. Your provider may suggest one or more of these treatments:\n\n* Diet -- Track the foods you eat to see if any types of foods cause problems. Foods that may lead to incontinence in some people include:\n\t+ Alcohol\n\t+ Caffeine\n\t+ Dairy products (in people who are unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in most dairy products)\n\t+ Fatty, fried, or greasy foods\n\t+ Spicy foods\n\t+ Cured or smoked meats\n\t+ Sweeteners such as fructose, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol\n* Fiber -- Adding bulk to your diet may thicken loose stool. To increase fiber:\n\t+ Eat more whole grains. Aim for 30 grams of fiber a day.\n\t+ Use products such as Metamucil that have a type of fiber called psyllium, which adds bulk to stools.\n* Bowel retraining and pelvic floor exercises -- These methods can help you control your anal sphincter muscle when you have a bowel movement. Your provider can show you exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and anal muscles.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nIf treatment does not work, surgery may help correct the problem. There are several types of procedures. The choice of surgery is based on the cause of the incontinence and the person's general health.\n\n* Anal sphincter repair -- This surgery may help people whose anal muscle ring (sphincter) isn't working well due to injury or aging.\n* Gracilis muscle transplant -- In people who have lost nerve function in the anal sphincter, gracilis muscle transplants may help.\n* Artificial bowel sphincter -- The artificial sphincter consists of 3 parts: a cuff that fits around the anus, a pressure-regulating balloon, and a pump that inflates the cuff.\n* Sacral nerve stimulator -- A device can be put inside the body to stimulate the nerves that maintain continence.\n* Fecal diversion -- Sometimes, this procedure is performed in people who are not helped by other therapies.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nReport any problems with incontinence to your provider.

This can range from sometimes leaking a small amount of stool and passing gas, to not being able to control bowel movements.\n* Severe constipation.\n\nThese problems may be caused by:\n\n* Brain and nerve problems (such as from multiple sclerosis)\n* Emotional problems\n* Spinal cord damage\n* Previous surgery\n* Childbirth\n* Overuse of laxatives\n\n**The Bowel Program**\n\nMost people are able to have regular bowel movements within a few weeks. Some people will need to use fiber supplements and laxatives along with bowel retraining. Your health care provider can tell you if you need to take laxatives and which ones are safe for you.\n\nYou will need a physical exam before you start a bowel training program. This will allow your provider to find the cause of the fecal incontinence or constipation. Disorders that can be corrected such as fecal impaction or infectious diarrhea can be treated at that time. The provider will use your history of bowel habits and lifestyle as a guide for setting new bowel movement patterns.\n\n**DIET**\n\nMaking the following changes to your diet will help you have regular, soft, bulky stools:\n\n* Eat high-fiber foods such as whole-wheat grains, fresh vegetables, and beans.\n* Use products containing psyllium, such as Metamucil, to add bulk to the stools.\n* Try to drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day (unless you have a medical condition that requires you to restrict your fluid intake).\n\n**Bowel Training**\n\nYou can use digital stimulation to trigger a bowel movement:\n\n* Insert a lubricated finger into the anus. Move it in a circle until the sphincter muscle relaxes. This may take a few minutes.\n* After you have done the stimulation, sit in a normal position for a bowel movement. If you are able to walk, sit on the toilet or bedside commode. If you are confined to the bed, use a bedpan. Get into as close to a sitting position as possible. If you are unable to sit, lie on your left side.\n* Try to get as much privacy as you can. Some people find that reading while sitting on the toilet helps them relax.\n* If you do not have a bowel movement within 20 minutes, repeat the process.\n\n**Keeping to a Regular Pattern**\n\nMost people are able to establish a regular routine of bowel movements within a few weeks. Set a regular time for daily bowel movements. Choose a time that is convenient for you. Keep in mind your daily schedule. The best time for a bowel movement is 20 to 40 minutes after a meal, because eating stimulates bowel activity.\n\n**KEGEL EXERCISES**\n\nExercises to strengthen the pelvic and rectal muscles may help with bowel control in people who have incompetent anal sphincters. Kegel exercises that increase pelvic and rectal muscle tone can be used for this. These exercises were first developed to control incontinence in women after childbirth.\n\n**BIOFEEDBACK**\n\nBiofeedback gives you sound or visual feedback about a bodily function. In people with fecal incontinence, biofeedback is used to strengthen the anal sphincters.\n\nA rectal probe is used to detect the strength of the rectal muscles. A monitoring electrode is placed on the abdomen. The rectal probe is then attached to a computer monitor. A graph displaying rectal muscle contractions and abdominal contractions will show up on the screen.\n\nTo use this method, you will be taught how to squeeze the rectal muscle around the rectal plug. The computer display guides you to make sure you are doing it correctly. Your symptoms should begin to improve after 3 sessions.\n\n---\n\n**Bowel Retraining**\n\nA program of bowel retraining, Kegel exercises, or biofeedback therapy may be used by people to help improve their bowel movements.\n\n**Problems that May Benefit from Bowel Retraining**\n\nFecal incontinence, which is the loss of bowel control, causing you to pass stool unexpectedly and involuntarily.

Insert a lubricated finger into the anus. Move it in a circle until the sphincter muscle relaxes. This may take a few minutes.\n2.  After you have done the stimulation, sit in a normal position for a bowel movement. If you are able to walk, sit on the toilet or bedside commode. If you are confined to the bed, use a bedpan. Get into as close to a sitting position as possible. If you are unable to sit, lie on your left side.\n3.  Try to get as much privacy as you can. Some people find that reading while sitting on the toilet helps them relax.\n4.  If you do not have a bowel movement within 20 minutes, repeat the process.\n5.  Try to contract the muscles of the abdomen and bear down while releasing the stool. You may find it helpful to bend forward while bearing down. This increases the pressure within the abdomen and helps empty the bowel. Many people find it helpful to put a foot stool in front of the toilet to rest their feet.\n\n**Keeping to a Regular Pattern**\n\nSet a regular time for daily bowel movements.

A graph displaying rectal muscle contractions and abdominal contractions will show up on the screen.\n\nTo use this method, you will be taught how to squeeze the rectal muscle around the rectal plug. The computer display guides you to make sure you are doing it correctly. Your symptoms should begin to improve after 3 sessions.\n\n---\n\n**Bowel Retraining**\n\nTo start a bowel retraining program, you'll need a physical exam to determine the cause of your fecal incontinence or constipation. Your provider may treat any underlying disorders, such as fecal impaction or infectious diarrhea.\n\nOnce you've started the program, make the following changes to your diet:\n\n*   Eat high-fiber foods like whole-wheat grains, fresh vegetables, and beans.\n*   Use products containing psyllium, such as Metamucil, to add bulk to your stools.\n*   Drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day (unless you have a medical condition that requires fluid restriction).\n\n**Bowel Training**\n\nYou can use digital stimulation to trigger a bowel movement:\n\n1.  Insert a lubricated finger into the anus and move it in a circle until the sphincter muscle relaxes.\n2.  Sit in a normal position for a bowel movement, or use a bedpan if you're confined to the bed.\n3.  Try to get as much privacy as possible and relax while sitting on the toilet (reading can help).\n4.  If you don't have a bowel movement within 20 minutes, repeat the process.\n\nTo contract the muscles of the abdomen and bear down while releasing stool, try bending forward while bearing down. This increases pressure in the abdomen and helps empty the bowel. Putting a footstool in front of the toilet can also help.\n\nPerform digital stimulation every day until you start to have a regular pattern of bowel movements. Your provider or physical therapist will explain this process if recommended.\n\nYou can also stimulate bowel movements by using:\n\n*   A suppository (glycerin or bisacodyl)\n*   A small enema\n*   Warm prune juice or fruit nectar\n\n**Keeping a Regular Pattern**\n\nIt's crucial to set a regular time for daily bowel movements. Choose a convenient time that fits your schedule, keeping in mind that the best time is 20 to 40 minutes after a meal.\n\nMost people can establish a regular routine of bowel movements within a few weeks.\n\n**Kegel Exercises**\n\nExercises to strengthen the pelvic and rectal muscles may help with bowel control in people with incompetent anal sphincters. Kegel exercises increase pelvic and rectal muscle tone, which can be used for this purpose.\n\nTo be successful with Kegel exercises, use the proper technique and stick to a regular exercise program. Talk with your provider for instructions on how to do these exercises.\n\n**Biofeedback**\n\nBiofeedback gives you sound or visual feedback about a bodily function. In people with fecal incontinence, biofeedback is used to strengthen the anal sphincters.\n\nA rectal probe detects the strength of the rectal muscles, and a monitoring electrode is placed on the abdomen. The rectal probe is then attached to a computer monitor displaying a graph of rectal muscle contractions and abdominal contractions.\n\nTo use this method, you'll be taught how to squeeze the rectal muscle around the rectal plug. The computer display guides you to ensure correct technique. Your symptoms should begin to improve after 3 sessions.\n\n---\n\n**Bowel Retraining**\n\nBowel retraining is a program designed to help you establish regular bowel movements. It involves making changes to your diet and lifestyle, as well as using specific exercises and techniques to strengthen your pelvic and rectal muscles.\n\n**DIET**\n\nMaking the following changes to your diet will help you have regular, soft, bulky stools:\n\n* Increase fiber intake through foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\n* Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water\n\n**BOWEL TRAINING**\n\nYou can use digital stimulation to trigger a bowel movement:\n\n* Use a rectal probe or other device to stimulate your rectal muscles\n* Practice regular bowel movements at the same time each day\n\nKeeping to a regular pattern is very important for a bowel retraining program to succeed. Set a regular time for daily bowel movements, and choose a time that is convenient for you.\n\n**KEGEL EXERCISES**\n\nExercises to strengthen the pelvic and rectal muscles may help with bowel control in people who have incompetent anal sphincters. Kegel exercises that increase pelvic and rectal muscle tone can be used for this.\n\nTo be successful with Kegel exercises, use the proper technique and stick to a regular exercise program. Talk with your provider for instructions about how to do these exercises.\n\n**BIOFEEDBACK**\n\nBiofeedback gives you sound or visual feedback about a bodily function.

The computer display guides you to make sure you are doing it correctly. Your symptoms should begin to improve after 3 sessions.\n\n**PROBLEMS THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM BOWEL RETRAINING**\n\nThese problems may be caused by:\n\n* Fecal impaction\n* Infectious diarrhea\n\nThe bowel program includes several steps to help you have regular bowel movements. Most people are able to have regular bowel movements within a few weeks. Some people will need to use fiber supplements and laxatives along with bowel retraining. Your health care provider can tell you if you need to take laxatives and which ones are safe for you.\n\nYou will need a physical exam before you start a bowel training program. This will allow your provider to find the cause of the fecal incontinence or constipation. Disorders that can be corrected such as fecal impaction or infectious diarrhea can be treated at that time. The provider will use your history of bowel habits and lifestyle as a guide for setting new bowel movement patterns.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nCamilleri M. Disorders of gastrointestinal motility.

    "content": "**Brachial Plexus Injury in Newborns**\n\nThe brachial plexus is a group of nerves around the shoulder that can be damaged during birth, leading to loss of movement or weakness of the arm. This injury is called neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP).\n\n**Causes**\n\nCompression inside the mother's womb or during a difficult delivery can damage the nerves of the brachial plexus. Injury may occur due to:\n\n*   The infant's head and neck pulling toward the side as the shoulders pass through the birth canal or surgical incision\n*   The infant's shoulders stretching or arm being pulled during a head-first delivery\n*   Pressure on the baby's raised arms during a breech (feet-first) delivery\n\nThere are different forms of NBPP, depending on the amount of arm paralysis:\n\n*   **Brachial plexus palsy**: most often affects only the upper arm and is also called Duchenne-Erb or Erb-Duchenne paralysis.\n*   **Klumpke paralysis**: affects the lower arm and hand and is less common.\n\nThe following factors increase the risk of NBPP:\n\n*   Breech delivery\n*   Maternal obesity\n*   Larger-than-average newborn (such as an infant of a diabetic mother)\n*   Difficulty delivering the baby's shoulder after the head has already come out (called shoulder dystocia)\n\nNBPP is less common than in the past, and Cesarean delivery is used more often when there are concerns about a difficult delivery. Although a C-section reduces the risk of injury, it does not prevent it.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can be seen right away or soon after birth and may include:\n\n*   No movement in the newborn's upper or lower arm or hand\n*   Absent Moro reflex on the affected side\n*   Arm extended (straight) at elbow and held against body\n*   Decreased grip on the affected side (depending on the site of injury)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam most often shows that the infant is not moving the upper or lower arm or hand. The affected arm may flop when the infant is rolled from side to side.\n\nThe Moro reflex is absent on the side of injury, and the health care provider will examine the clavicle to look for a fracture. The infant may need to have an x-ray taken.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn mild cases, the provider will suggest:\n\n*   Gentle massage of the arm\n*   Range-of-motion exercises\n\nPediatric physical therapists can help with these. The infant may need to be seen by specialists if the damage is severe or the condition does not improve in the first few weeks.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost babies will fully recover within 3 to 4 months. Those who do not recover during this time have a poor outlook for full recovery. In these cases, there may have been a separation of the nerve root from the spinal cord (avulsion).\n\nIt is not clear whether surgery to fix the nerve problem can help. Surgery may involve nerve grafts or nerve transfers. It may take many years for healing to occur.\n\nIn cases of pseudoparalysis, the child will begin to use the affected arm as the fracture heals. Fractures in infants heal quickly and easily in most cases.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include:\n\n*   Abnormal muscle contractions (contractures) or tightening of the muscles. These may be permanent.\n*   Permanent, partial, or total loss of function of the affected nerves, causing paralysis of the arm or arm weakness.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your newborn is not moving an arm.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIt is difficult to prevent NBPP. Taking steps to avoid a difficult delivery, whenever possible, reduces the risk.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nKlumpke paralysis; Erb-Duchenne paralysis; Erb's palsy; Brachial palsy; Brachial plexopathy; Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; Birth-related brachial plexus palsy; Neonatal brachial plexus palsy; NBPP\n\n---\n\n**Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP)**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCompression inside the mother's womb or during a difficult delivery can affect the nerves of the brachial plexus, leading to injury.

It occurs when the nerves are stretched or damaged during delivery.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of NBPP include:\n\n* The affected arm may not move or may flop when the baby is rolled from side to side.\n* The Moro reflex, which is a normal reflex in newborns, may be absent on the side of injury.\n* The health care provider will examine the clavicle to look for a fracture. An x-ray may be taken if there is suspicion of a fracture.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn mild cases, the provider may suggest:\n\n* Gentle massage of the arm\n* Range-of-motion exercises\n\nPediatric physical therapists can help with these exercises. The infant may need to be seen by specialists if the damage is severe or the condition does not improve in the first few weeks.\n\nSurgery may be considered if strength does not improve by 3 to 9 months of age.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost babies will fully recover within 3 to 4 months. Those who do not recover during this time have a poor outlook for full recovery. In these cases, there may have been a separation of the nerve root from the spinal cord (avulsion).\n\nIt is not clear whether surgery to fix the nerve problem can help. Surgery may involve nerve grafts or nerve transfers. It may take many years for healing to occur.\n\nIn cases of pseudoparalysis, the child will begin to use the affected arm as the fracture heals. Fractures in infants heal quickly and easily in most cases.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include:\n\n* Abnormal muscle contractions (contractures) or tightening of the muscles. These may be permanent.\n* Permanent, partial, or total loss of function of the affected nerves, causing paralysis of the arm or arm weakness.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your newborn is not moving an arm.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIt is difficult to prevent NBPP. Taking steps to avoid a difficult delivery, whenever possible, reduces the risk.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nKlumpke paralysis; Erb-Duchenne paralysis; Erb's palsy; Brachial palsy; Brachial plexopathy; Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; Birth-related brachial plexus palsy; Neonatal brachial plexus palsy; NBPP\n\n**References**\n\nExecutive summary: neonatal brachial plexus palsy.

    "content": "**Brain Diseases**\n\nYour brain is the control center of your body. It controls your thoughts, memory, speech, and movement. It regulates the function of many organs. It's part of your nervous system, which also includes your spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The nervous system sends signals between your brain and the rest of the body. Your nerves take in information from your senses and send it to the brain to be processed. Your brain and nerves also communicate to help you move and to control your body's functions.\n\nWhen the brain is healthy, it works quickly and automatically. But when you have a brain disease, it may affect how well you can function and do your daily activities. Some common brain diseases include:\n\n* Brain tumors, which can press on nerves and affect brain function.\n* Degenerative nerve diseases, which can affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Types include Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\n* Encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), which can lead to problems such as vision loss, weakness, and paralysis.\n* Genetic brain disorders, which are caused by changes in genes (also called variants or mutations). These disorders can affect the development and function of the brain.\n* Strokes, which can cause a loss of brain cells and can affect your ability to think clearly.\n* Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can affect brain function. They may range from mild to severe. The effects of a TBI may be temporary or permanent.\n\nThe symptoms of brain diseases vary widely, depending on the specific problem. In some cases, damage is permanent. In other cases, treatments such as surgery, medicines, or therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies, may cure the disease or improve the symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\n* Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis\n* Functional MRI (fMRI)\n* Head CT\n* Neurological Exam\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* About Neurointerventions\n* Intracranial Hypertension: Medication and Surgery\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Birth Disorders of the Brain and Spinal Cord\n* Hepatic Encephalopathy\n* Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy\n* Kluver-Bucy Syndrome\n* Periventricular Leukomalacia\n* Pseudotumor Cerebri\n* Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Familial porencephaly: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Primary familial brain calcification: MedlinePlus Genetics\n\n---\n\n**Brain Diseases**\n\nWhen you have a brain disease, it may affect how well you can function and do your daily activities.\n\n**Common Brain Diseases**\n\n*   Brain tumors, which can press on nerves and affect brain function.\n*   Degenerative nerve diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\n*   Encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), which can lead to problems such as vision loss, weakness, and paralysis.\n*   Genetic brain disorders, which are caused by changes in genes (also called variants or mutations).\n*   Strokes, which can cause a loss of brain cells and can affect your ability to think clearly.\n*   Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can affect brain function.\n\n**Symptoms of Brain Diseases**\n\nThe symptoms of brain diseases vary widely, depending on the specific problem.

    "content": "**Brain PET Scan**\n\nA brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain. It uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease or injury in the brain.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A small amount of radioactive material (tracer) is given through a vein (IV), usually on the inside of your elbow, or breathed in as a gas.\n*   The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues, helping your healthcare provider see certain areas or diseases more clearly.\n*   You wait nearby for about 1 hour while the tracer is absorbed by your body.\n*   Then, you lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer, and a computer changes the results into 3-D pictures displayed on a monitor for your provider to read.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   You may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n*   Tell your provider if you:\n    *   Are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia) and may need medication to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\n    *   Are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\n    *   Have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\n    *   Have taken insulin for diabetes, requiring special preparation.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n*   You may feel a sharp sting when the needle containing the tracer is placed into your vein.\n*   A PET scan causes no pain. The table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\n*   An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA PET scan can show the size, shape, and function of the brain, helping your doctor ensure it's working as well as it should. It's most often used when other tests, such as MRI scans or CT scans, don't provide enough information.\n\nThis test can be used to:\n\n*   Diagnose cancer\n*   Prepare for epilepsy surgery\n*   Help diagnose dementia if other tests and exams don't provide enough information\n*   Tell the difference between Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders\n\nSeveral PET scans may be taken to determine how well you're responding to treatment for cancer or another illness.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThere are no problems detected in the size, shape, or function of the brain. There are no areas where the tracer has abnormally collected.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may indicate:\n\n*   Alzheimer's disease or dementia due to other health conditions\n*   Brain tumor or spread of cancer from another body area to the brain\n*   Epilepsy, and may identify where the seizures start in your brain\n*   Movement disorders (such as Parkinson's disease)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe amount of radiation used in a PET scan is low, about the same as in most CT scans. It doesn't last long in your body.\n\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should inform their provider before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\n\nIt's possible, though very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance. Some people may experience pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt's possible to have false results on a PET scan.

It can be benign or malignant, and it can occur at any age.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Brain Tumors**\n\nThere are two main types of brain tumors:\n\n*   **Primary brain tumors**: These tumors start in the brain and do not spread from other parts of the body.\n*   **Metastatic brain tumors**: These tumors start in another part of the body, such as the lung or breast, and then spread to the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of brain tumors is still unknown, but there are some risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing a brain tumor. These include:\n\n*   **Family history**: Some people may be born with a genetic predisposition to develop brain tumors.\n*   **Radiation exposure**: People who have been exposed to high levels of radiation, such as those who have had radiation therapy for cancer, may be at increased risk of developing a brain tumor.\n*   **Infections**: Certain infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can increase the risk of developing a brain tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a brain tumor can vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Headaches**: Headaches are one of the most common symptoms of a brain tumor.\n*   **Seizures**: Seizures can occur if the tumor is affecting the electrical activity of the brain.\n*   **Vision problems**: Tumors that occur in the visual pathway can cause vision problems, such as blurred vision or loss of vision.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of a brain tumor typically involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Imaging tests**: Such as MRI or CT scans to visualize the tumor.\n*   **Biopsy**: A biopsy may be performed to confirm the presence of cancer cells in the tumor.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Such as blood tests to check for tumor markers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of a brain tumor depends on the type and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery may be performed to remove the tumor.\n*   **Radiation therapy**: Radiation therapy may be used to shrink the tumor or relieve symptoms.\n*   **Chemotherapy**: Chemotherapy may be used to treat malignant brain tumors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for a patient with a brain tumor depends on various factors, including:\n\n*   **Type of tumor**: The type of tumor and its location in the brain can affect the prognosis.\n*   **Size and location of the tumor**: The size and location of the tumor can impact the effectiveness of treatment.\n*   **Patient's overall health**: The patient's overall health can also influence the prognosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nSome related health topics include:\n\n*   **Brain diseases**\n*   **Childhood brain tumors**\n*   **Pituitary tumors**\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Brain Abscess**\n\nA brain abscess is a collection of pus, immune cells, and other material in the brain, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBrain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess.\n\nThe germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses.\n\nThe source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nA weakened immune system (such as in people with HIV/AIDS)\nChronic disease, such as cancer\nMedicines that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy)\nCongenital heart disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChanges in mental status, such as confusion, slow response or thinking, unable to focus, or sleepiness\nDecreased ability to feel touch or pain (sensory loss)\nFever and chills\nHeadache, seizures, or stiff neck\nLanguage problems\nLoss of muscle function, typically on one side\nVision changes\nVomiting\nWeakness in a limb (such as an arm or leg)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will usually show signs of increased pressure inside the skull and problems with brain function.\n\nTests to diagnose a brain abscess may include:\n\nBlood cultures\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nHead CT scan\nElectroencephalogram (EEG)\nMRI of head\nTesting for the presence of antibodies to certain germs\n\nA needle biopsy is usually performed to identify the cause of the infection.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA brain abscess is a medical emergency. Pressure inside the skull may become high enough to be life threatening. You will need to stay in the hospital until the condition is stable. Some people may need life support.\n\nMedicine such as an antibiotic, rather than surgery, is recommended if you have:\n\n*   A small abscess less than 0.79 inches (in) or 2 centimeters (cm)\n*   An abscess deep in the brain\n*   An abscess and meningitis\n*   Several abscesses (rare)\n*   Shunts in the brain for hydrocephalus (in some cases, the shunt may need to be removed temporarily or replaced)\n*   An infection called toxoplasmosis in a person with HIV/AIDS\n\nYou may be prescribed several different types of antibiotics to make sure treatment works.\n\nAntifungal medicines may also be prescribed if the infection is likely caused by a fungus.\n\nSurgery is needed if:\n\nIncreased pressure in the brain continues or gets worse\nThe brain abscess does not get smaller after medicine\nThe brain abscess contains gas (produced by some types of bacteria)\nThe brain abscess might break open (rupture)\nThe brain abscess is large (more than 0.79 in or 2 cm)\n\nSurgery consists of opening the skull, exposing the brain, and draining the abscess.

With treatment, the death rate is about 10% to 30%. The earlier treatment is received, the better.\n\nSome people may have long-term brain or nerve damage after a brain abscess or surgery.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\nBrain damage\nMeningitis that can be severe and life threatening\nReturn (recurrence) of the infection\nSeizures\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to a hospital emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of a brain abscess.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can reduce the risk of developing a brain abscess by getting treated for infections or health problems that can cause them.\n\nSome people, including those with certain heart disorders, may receive antibiotics before dental or other procedures to help reduce the risk of infection.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Abscess**\n\nA brain abscess is a collection of pus, immune cells, and other material in the brain, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBrain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess.\n\nThe germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses.\n\nThe source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.\n\nThe following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess:\n\n* A weakened immune system (such as in people with HIV/AIDS)\n* Chronic disease, such as cancer\n* Medicines that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy)\n* Congenital heart disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may develop slowly, over a period of several weeks, or they may develop suddenly. They may include:\n\n* Changes in mental status, such as confusion, slow response or thinking, unable to focus, or sleepiness\n* Decreased ability to feel touch or pain (sensory loss)\n* Fever and chills\n* Headache, seizures, or stiff neck\n* Language problems\n* Loss of muscle function, typically on one side\n* Vision changes\n* Vomiting\n* Weakness in a limb (such as an arm or leg)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will usually show signs of increased pressure inside the skull and problems with brain function.\n\nTests to diagnose a brain abscess may include:\n\n* Blood cultures\n* Chest x-ray\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Head CT scan\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* MRI of head\n* Testing for the presence of antibodies to certain germs\n\nA needle biopsy is usually performed to identify the cause of the infection.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Abscess**\n\nA brain abscess is a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention. It's a collection of pus in the brain, typically caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n*   A brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will usually show signs of increased pressure inside the skull and problems with brain function.\n*   Tests to diagnose a brain abscess may include:\n    *   Blood cultures\n    *   Chest x-ray\n    *   Complete blood count (CBC)\n    *   Head CT scan\n    *   Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n    *   MRI of head\n    *   Testing for the presence of antibodies to certain germs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA brain abscess is a medical emergency. Pressure inside the skull may become high enough to be life-threatening. You will need to stay in the hospital until the condition is stable. Some people may need life support.\n\nMedicine such as an antibiotic, rather than surgery, is recommended if you have:\n\n*   A small abscess less than 0.79 inches (in) or 2 centimeters (cm)\n*   An abscess deep in the brain\n*   An abscess and meningitis\n*   Several abscesses (rare)\n*   Shunts in the brain for hydrocephalus (in some cases, the shunt may need to be removed temporarily or replaced)\n*   An infection called toxoplasmosis in a person with HIV/AIDS\n\nYou may be prescribed several different types of antibiotics to make sure treatment works.\n\nAntifungal medicines may also be prescribed if the infection is likely caused by a fungus.\n\nSurgery is needed if:\n\n*   Increased pressure in the brain continues or gets worse\n*   The brain abscess does not get smaller after medicine\n*   The brain abscess contains gas (produced by some types of bacteria)\n*   The brain abscess might break open (rupture)\n*   The brain abscess is large (more than 0.79 in or 2 cm)\n\nSurgery consists of opening the skull, exposing the brain, and draining the abscess. Lab tests are often done to examine the fluid. This helps identify the cause of the infection, so that the right antibiotics or antifungal medicine can be prescribed.\n\nNeedle aspiration guided by CT or MRI scan may be needed for a deep abscess. During this procedure, medicines may be injected directly into the mass.\n\nCertain diuretics (medicines that reduce fluid in the body) and steroids may be used to reduce brain swelling.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf untreated, a brain abscess is almost always deadly.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000123.htm",
    "content": "**Brain Aneurysm Repair - Discharge**\n\nYou had a brain aneurysm, which is a weak area in the wall of an artery that bulges or balloons out. If it reaches a certain size, it has a high chance of bursting, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage (leaking blood along the surface of the brain) or intracerebral bleeding (bleeding inside the brain).\n\nYou had surgery to prevent the aneurysm from bleeding or bleeding again. Now that you're going home, follow your surgeon's instructions on how to care for yourself.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou likely had one of two types of surgery:\n\n*   **Open Craniotomy**: The surgeon makes an opening in your skull to place a clip on the neck of the aneurysm.\n*   **Endovascular Repair**: The surgeon, neurologist, or radiologist treats the aneurysm by going through blood vessels rather than opening the skull.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nIf you had bleeding from your aneurysm before, during, or after surgery, you might have some short- or long-term problems. These may be mild or severe and can get better over time.\n\nIn this situation, you may:\n\n*   Feel sad, angry, or very nervous.\n*   Have had a seizure and will take medicine to prevent another one.\n*   Have headaches that may continue for a while.\n\n**What to Expect After Craniotomy and Placement of an Aneurysm Clip**\n\nIt will take 3 to 6 weeks to fully recover. If you had bleeding from your aneurysm, this may take longer. You may feel tired for up to 12 or more weeks.\n\nIf you had a stroke or brain injury from the bleeding, you may have permanent problems such as:\n\n*   Trouble with speech or thinking.\n*   Muscle weakness or numbness.\n*   Problems with memory that may improve over time.\n\nYou may also experience:\n\n*   Dizziness or confusion.\n*   Speech difficulties.\n\n**What to Expect After Endovascular Repair**\n\nYou may have pain in your groin area and some bruising around and below the incision site.\n\nYou may be able to start daily activities, such as driving a car, within 1 or 2 weeks if you did not have any bleeding. Ask your surgeon which daily activities are safe for you to do.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nMake plans to have help at home while you recover.\n\nFollow a healthy lifestyle:\n\n*   If you have high blood pressure, keep it under control.\n*   Do not smoke.\n*   Ask your surgeon if it is OK for you to drink alcohol.\n*   Ask your surgeon when it is OK to start sexual activity.\n\nTake your seizure medicine if any was prescribed for you. You may be referred to a speech, physical, or occupational therapist to help you recover from any brain damage.\n\nIf your surgeon had to put a catheter in through your groin (endovascular surgery), it is OK to walk short distances on a flat surface.

Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou likely had one of two types of surgery:\n\n* **Open Craniotomy**: The surgeon makes an opening in your skull to place a clip on the neck of the aneurysm.\n* **Endovascular Repair**: The surgeon, neurologist, or radiologist treats the aneurysm by going through blood vessels rather than opening the skull.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nIf you had bleeding from your aneurysm before, during, or after surgery, you might have some short- or long-term problems. These may be mild or severe. For many people, these problems get better over time.\n\nIn this situation, you may:\n\n* Feel sad, angry, or very nervous. This is normal.\n* Have had a seizure and will take medicine to prevent another one.\n* Have headaches that may continue for a while. This is common.\n\n**What to Expect After Craniotomy and Placement of an Aneurysm Clip**\n\nIt will take 3 to 6 weeks to fully recover. If you had bleeding from your aneurysm, this may take longer. You may feel tired for up to 12 or more weeks.\n\nIf you had a stroke or brain injury from the bleeding, you may have permanent problems such as:\n\n* Trouble with speech or thinking\n* Muscle weakness\n* Numbness\n\nProblems with your memory are common but may improve.\n\nYou may feel dizzy or confused, or your speech may not be normal after the surgery. If you did not have any bleeding, these problems should get better.\n\n**What to Expect After Endovascular Repair**\n\nYou may have pain in your groin area.\n\nYou may have some bruising around and below the groin incision.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nMake plans to have help at home while you recover.\n\nFollow a healthy lifestyle:\n\n* If you have high blood pressure, keep it under control.\n* Do not smoke.\n* Ask your surgeon if it is OK for you to drink alcohol.\n* Ask your surgeon when it is OK to start sexual activity.\n\nTake your seizure medicine if any was prescribed for you.

    "content": "**Brain Aneurysm Repair**\n\n**What is Brain Aneurysm Repair?**\n\nBrain aneurysm repair is surgery to correct a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes burst (rupture). This type of surgery is usually performed as an emergency when an aneurysm breaks open, causing bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain or bleeding into the brain that forms a collection of blood.\n\n**Methods Used to Repair an Aneurysm**\n\nThere are two common methods used to repair an aneurysm:\n\n*   **Clipping**: This method involves opening the skull and placing a metal clip at the base (neck) of the aneurysm to prevent it from breaking open.\n*   **Endovascular Repair (Surgery)**: This method is less invasive and more common. It involves guiding a catheter through a small cut in the groin into and through the femoral artery, then injecting contrast material to view the arteries and the aneurysm on a monitor. Thin metal wires are then put into the aneurysm, which coil into a mesh ball, preventing the aneurysm from breaking open.\n\n**Risks of Brain Surgery**\n\nThe risks of brain surgery include:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infections\n*   Blood clot or bleeding in or around the brain\n*   Brain swelling\n*   Infection in the brain or parts around the brain, such as the skull or scalp\n*   Seizures\n*   Stroke\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nIf it is not an emergency, tell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n*   You are or could be pregnant\n*   You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nA hospital stay for endovascular repair of an aneurysm may be as short as 1 to 2 days if there was no bleeding before surgery. The hospital stay after craniotomy and aneurysm clipping is usually 4 to 6 days. If there is bleeding or other problems, such as narrowed blood vessels (vasospasm) in the brain or a buildup of fluid in the brain, the hospital stay can be 2 weeks, or longer.\n\nYou will probably have imaging tests of the blood vessels (angiogram) in the brain before you are sent home, and possibly once a year for a few years. Follow instructions on caring for yourself at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter successful surgery for a bleeding aneurysm, it is uncommon for it to bleed again. The outlook also depends on whether brain damage occurred from bleeding before, during, or after surgery. Most of the time, surgery can prevent a brain aneurysm that has not caused symptoms from becoming larger and breaking open.\n\nYou may have more than one aneurysm or the aneurysm that was coiled might grow back. After coiling repair, you will need to be seen by your surgeon every year.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Aneurysm Repair**\n\n**What is a brain aneurysm?**\n\nA brain aneurysm is a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes burst (rupture). It may cause bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain, bleeding into the brain that forms a collection of blood, or mass effect on nerves.\n\n**Methods of Repair**\n\nThere are two common methods used to repair an aneurysm:\n\n*   **Clipping**: This is done during an open craniotomy. A metal clip is placed at the base (neck) of the aneurysm to prevent it from breaking open.\n*   **Endovascular Repair (Surgery)**: This is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms. A catheter is guided through a small cut in the groin into and through the femoral artery and then guided through the arteries until it reaches the artery in the brain where the aneurysm is located. Contrast material is injected through the catheter, allowing the surgeon to view the arteries and the aneurysm on a monitor. Thin metal wires are put into the aneurysm, which coil into a mesh ball. Blood clots that form around this coil prevent the aneurysm from breaking open and bleeding.\n\n**Why is the Procedure Performed?**\n\nIf an aneurysm in the brain breaks open (ruptures), it is an emergency that needs medical treatment in a hospital. A person may have an unruptured aneurysm without any symptoms, which may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infections\n\nRisks of brain surgery are:\n\n*   Blood clot or bleeding in or around the brain\n*   Brain swelling\n*   Infection in the brain or parts around the brain, such as the skull or scalp\n*   Seizures\n*   Stroke\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nThis procedure is often done as an emergency. If it is not an emergency, tell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n*   You are or could be pregnant\n*   You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n*   Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n*   Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nA hospital stay for endovascular repair of an aneurysm may be as short as 1 to 2 days if there was no bleeding before surgery. The hospital stay after craniotomy and aneurysm clipping is usually 4 to 6 days. If there is bleeding or other problems, such as narrowed blood vessels (vasospasm) in the brain or a buildup of fluid in the brain, the hospital stay can be 2 weeks, or longer.\n\nYou will probably have imaging tests of the blood vessels (angiogram) in the brain before you are sent home, and possibly once a year for a few years. Follow instructions on caring for yourself at home. Ask your surgeon if it will be safe for you to have imaging tests such as angiogram, CT angiogram, or MRI scans of the head in the future.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter successful surgery for a bleeding aneurysm, it is uncommon for it to bleed again. The outlook also depends on whether brain damage occurred from bleeding before, during, or after surgery. Most of the time, surgery can prevent a brain aneurysm that has not caused symptoms from becoming larger and breaking open.\n\nYou may have more than one aneurysm or the aneurysm that was coiled might grow back. After coiling repair, you will need to be seen by your surgeon every year.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Aneurysm Repair**\n\nBrain aneurysm repair is surgery to correct an aneurysm in or near the brain. An aneurysm is a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes burst (rupture).\n\n**Causes of Brain Aneurysm Repair**\n\nThere are two common methods used to repair an aneurysm:\n\n*   **Clipping**: Done during an open craniotomy.\n*   **Endovascular Repair (Surgery)**: Most often using a coil or coiling and stenting (mesh tubes). This is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms.\n\n**Description of Clipping**\n\nDuring aneurysm clipping:\n\n    *   You are given general anesthesia and a breathing tube.\n    *   Your scalp, skull, and the coverings of the brain are opened.\n    *   Your brain is gently retracted to reach the aneurysm.\n    *   A metal clip is placed at the base (neck) of the aneurysm to prevent it from breaking open (bursting).\n\n**Description of Endovascular Repair**\n\nDuring endovascular repair (surgery) of an aneurysm:\n\n    *   You may have general anesthesia and a breathing tube. Or, you may be given medicine to relax you, but not enough to put you to sleep.\n    *   A catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin into and through the femoral artery and then guided through your arteries until it reaches the artery in your brain where the aneurysm is located.\n    *   Contrast material is injected through the catheter. This allows the surgeon to view the arteries and the aneurysm on a monitor in the operating room.\n    *   Thin metal wires are put into the aneurysm. They then coil into a mesh ball. For this reason, the procedure is also called coiling. Blood clots that form around this coil prevent the aneurysm from breaking open and bleeding. Sometimes stents (mesh tubes) are also put in to hold the coils in place and make sure the blood vessel stays open.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nIf an aneurysm in the brain breaks open (ruptures), it is an emergency that needs medical treatment in a hospital. Often a rupture is treated with surgery, especially endovascular surgery.\n\nA person may have an unruptured aneurysm without any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.\n\nNot all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Aneurysms that have never bled, especially if they are very small (less than 3 millimeters or 0.12 inch at their largest point), do not need to be treated right away. These very small aneurysms are less likely to rupture.\n\nYour surgeon will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open or to monitor the aneurysm with repeated imaging until surgery becomes necessary. Some small aneurysms will never need surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Aneurysm Repair**\n\n**What is Brain Aneurysm Repair?**\n\nBrain aneurysm repair is a surgical procedure to treat a brain aneurysm, which is a bulge in the blood vessel that can rupture and cause bleeding in the brain.\n\n**Why is Brain Aneurysm Repair Necessary?**\n\nA person may have an unruptured aneurysm without any symptoms.

    "content": "**Brain Components**\n\nThe brain is composed of more than a thousand billion neurons. Specific groups of them, working in concert, provide us with the capacity to reason, to experience feelings, and to understand the world. They also give us the capacity to remember numerous pieces of information.\n\nThere are three major components of the brain: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem.\n\n*   **Cerebrum**: The largest component, extending across the top of the head down to ear level.\n*   **Cerebellum**: Smaller than the cerebrum, located underneath it, behind the ears toward the back of the head.\n*   **Brain Stem**: The smallest and is located under the cerebellum, extending downward and back toward the neck.\n\n**The Cerebral Cortex**\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the outside portion of the cerebrum, also called the “gray matter”. It generates the most complex intellectual thoughts and controls body movement. The cerebrum is divided into left and right sides, which communicate with each other through a thin stalk of nerve fibers.\n\n*   **Left Side**: Controls the muscles on the right side of the body.\n*   **Right Side**: Controls the muscles on the left side of the body.\n\n**The Frontal Lobe**\n\nVoluntary body movements are controlled by a region of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is also where we shape emotional reactions and expressions.\n\n**The Parietal Lobes**\n\nThere are two parietal lobes, one on each side of the brain. The parietal lobes are located behind the frontal lobe towards the back of the head and above the ears. The taste center is located in the parietal lobes.\n\n**The Temporal Lobe**\n\nAll sounds are processed in the temporal lobe. They are also important for learning, memory, and emotion.\n\n**The Occipital Lobe**\n\nThe occipital lobe analyzes visual information from the retina and then processes that information. If the occipital lobe becomes damaged, a person could become blind, even if his or her eyes continue to function normally\n\n**The Cerebellum**\n\nThe cerebellum creates automatic programs so we can make complex movements without thinking.\n\n**The Brain Stem**\n\nThe brain stem is located underneath the temporal lobes and extended down to the spinal cord. It is critical for survival because it connects the brain with the spinal cord. The top portion of the brainstem is called the midbrain. The midbrain is a small portion of the brain stem located at the top of the brain stem. Just below the midbrain is the pons, and below the pons is the medulla. The medulla is the part of the brain stem closest to the spinal cord.\n\nThe medulla, with its critical functions, lies deep within the head, where it is well-protected from injuries by an extra-thick section of overlying skull. When we are asleep or unconscious, our heart rate, breathing and blood pressure continue to function because they’re regulated by the medulla.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Components**\n\nThe brain is composed of more than a thousand billion neurons. Specific groups of them, working in concert, provide us with the capacity to reason, to experience feelings, and to understand the world. They also give us the capacity to remember numerous pieces of information.\n\nThere are three major components of the brain:\n\n*   **Cerebrum**: The largest component, extending across the top of the head down to ear level.\n*   **Cerebellum**: Smaller than the cerebrum and located underneath it, behind the ears toward the back of the head.\n*   **Brain Stem**: The smallest and is located under the cerebellum, extending downward and back toward the neck.\n\n**The Cerebral Cortex**\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the outside portion of the cerebrum, also called the “gray matter”. It generates the most complex intellectual thoughts and controls body movement. The cerebrum is divided into left and right sides, which communicate with each other through a thin stalk of nerve fibers. The grooves and folds increase the cerebrum’s surface area, allowing us to have a tremendous amount of gray matter inside of the skull.\n\n**The Left and Right Sides of the Brain**\n\nThe left side of the brain controls the muscles on the right side of the body and vice versa. Here, the left side of the brain is highlighted to show the control over right arm and leg movement, and the right side of the brain is highlighted to show the control over left arm and leg movement.\n\n**Voluntary Body Movements**\n\nVoluntary body movements are controlled by a region of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is also where we shape emotional reactions and expressions\n\n**The Parietal Lobes**\n\nThere are two parietal lobes, one on each side of the brain. The parietal lobes are located behind the frontal lobe towards the back of the head and above the ears. The taste center is located in the parietal lobes.\n\n**The Temporal Lobe**\n\nAll sounds are processed in the temporal lobe. They are also important for learning, memory, and emotion.\n\n**The Occipital Lobe**\n\nThe occipital lobe analyzes visual information from the retina and then processes that information. If the occipital lobe becomes damaged, a person could become blind, even if his or her eyes continue to function normally\n\n**The Cerebellum**\n\nThe cerebellum is located at the back of the head underneath the occipital and temporal lobes. The cerebellum creates automatic programs so we can make complex movements without thinking.\n\n**The Brain Stem**\n\nThe brain stem is located underneath the temporal lobes and extended down to the spinal cord.

The cerebrum is the largest component, extending across the top of the head down to ear level.\n2.  The cerebellum is smaller than the cerebrum and located underneath it, behind the ears toward the back of the head.\n3.  The brain stem is the smallest and is located under the cerebellum, extending downward and back toward the neck.\n\n**Cerebral Cortex**\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the outside portion of the cerebrum, also called the “gray matter”.

They may already have a low chance of recovery due to the injury that caused the herniation. When herniation occurs, it further lowers the chance of recovery.\n\nThe outlook varies, depending on where in the brain the herniation occurs. Without treatment, death is likely.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Brain death\n* Permanent and significant neurologic problems\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number or take the person to a hospital emergency room if they develop decreased alertness or other symptoms, especially if there has been a head injury or if the person has a brain tumor or blood vessel problem.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrompt treatment of increased intracranial pressure and related disorders may reduce the risk for brain herniation.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Herniation**\n\n**What is brain herniation?**\n\nBrain herniation, also known as transtentorial herniation, is a life-threatening condition that occurs when part of the brain is squeezed out of its normal position and becomes trapped in a space between the skull and the brain.\n\n**Causes of brain herniation**\n\nThe most common cause of brain herniation is a severe head injury, such as a car accident or a fall. Other causes include:\n\n*   **Brain tumors**: Tumors can put pressure on the brain and cause it to herniate.\n*   **Hydrocephalus**: A buildup of fluid in the brain can cause pressure and lead to herniation.\n*   **Stroke**: A stroke can cause damage to the brain and lead to herniation.\n\n**Symptoms of brain herniation**\n\nThe symptoms of brain herniation can vary depending on the severity of the condition, but may include:\n\n*   **Severe headache**: A severe headache is often one of the first symptoms of brain herniation.\n*   **Confusion**: As the brain becomes compressed, a person may become confused and disoriented.\n*   **Loss of consciousness**: In severe cases, brain herniation can cause a person to lose consciousness.\n\n**Treatment of brain herniation**\n\nThe treatment of brain herniation depends on the underlying cause of the condition. Treatment may include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the brain and prevent further damage.\n*   **Medications**: Medications may be used to reduce swelling and control symptoms.\n*   **Supportive care**: Supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and monitoring of vital signs, may also be necessary.\n\n**Prevention of brain herniation**\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent brain herniation, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing this condition. These include:\n\n*   **Wearing a seatbelt**: Wearing a seatbelt can help prevent head injuries in car accidents.\n*   **Using protective gear**: Using protective gear, such as helmets and knee pads, can help prevent head injuries in sports and other activities.\n*   **Seeking medical attention**: If you or someone you know has experienced a severe head injury, seek medical attention immediately.",

This article describes what to expect during their recovery and how to help them at home.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nFirst, health care providers provided treatment to prevent any further damage to the brain, and to help the heart, lungs, and other important parts of the body.\n\nAfter the person became stable, treatment was done to help them recover from the brain injury. The person may have stayed in a special unit that helps people with brain injuries.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nPeople with a serious brain injury improve at their own pace. Some skills, such as movement or speech, may go back and forth between getting better and then worse. But usually there is improvement over time.\n\n**Behavior and Social Interaction**\n\nPeople may display inappropriate behavior after a brain injury. It is OK to point out when behavior is not appropriate. Explain the reason and suggest a different behavior. Offer praise when the person calms down or changes their behavior.\n\nSometimes suggesting a new activity or a new place to go is the best option.\n\nIt is important for family members and others to stay calm.\n\nTry to ignore angry behavior. Do not make a face or show anger or judgment.\nThe providers will teach you how and when to decide to step in and when to ignore certain behavior.\n\n**Muscles, Joints, and Movement**\n\nAt home, the person who had the brain injury may need to practice everyday activities. It may help to create a routine. This means certain activities are done at the same time each day.\n\nTheir providers will help you decide how independent the person can be and when you can leave them alone. Make sure your home is safe so injuries do not happen. This includes making the bathroom safe, for either a child or an adult, and protecting against falls.\n\nFamily and caregivers may need to help the person with the following:\n\n* Exercising the elbows, shoulders, and other joints, to keep them loose\n* Watching for joint tightening (contractures)\n* Making sure splints are used in the correct way\n* Making sure arms and legs are in a good position when sitting or lying\n* Caring for muscle spasticity or spasms\n\nIf the person is using a wheelchair, they will need follow-up visits with their provider to make sure it fits well.

If so, help them learn to add extra calories. Talk with their provider if the person is a child. Children need to get enough calories and nutrition to grow. Ask their provider if you need the advice of a dietitian.\n\nIf the person with the brain injury has problems with swallowing, help them follow any special diet that makes eating safer. Ask their provider what the signs of swallowing problems are. Learn tips to make feeding and swallowing easier and safer.\n\n**Tips for Daily Life**\n\n* Do not give the person too many choices.\n* Velcro is much easier than buttons and zippers. If the clothing has buttons or zippers, they should be in the front.\n* Use pullover clothes when possible and slip on shoes.\n\n**Bladder, Bowels, and Bathing**\n\nHave a routine. Once the person finds a bowel routine that works, help them stick with it. Pick a regular time, such as after a meal or a warm bath.\n\nBe patient. It may take 15 to 45 minutes for the person to have bowel movements.\nTry having the person gently rub their stomach to help stool move through their colon.\n\nThe person may have problems starting to urinate or emptying all of the urine out of their bladder. Their bladder may empty too often or at the wrong time. Their bladder may become too full, and they may leak urine out of the overfilled bladder.\n\nSome men and women may need to use a urinary catheter. This is a thin tube that is inserted into the bladder. Learn how to care for the catheter.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact the person's provider if they have:\n\n* Problems taking medicines for muscle spasms\n* Problems moving their joints (joint contracture)\n* Problems moving around or it is getting harder for them to transfer out of a bed or chair\n* Skin sores or redness\n* Pain that is becoming worse\n* Choking or coughing when eating\n* Signs of a bladder infection (fever, burning with urination, or frequent urination)\n* Behavior issues that are hard to manage\n\n---\n\n**Brain Injury - Discharge**\n\nSomeone you know was in the hospital for a serious brain injury.

    "content": "**Brain Natriuretic Peptide Test**\n\nThe brain natriuretic peptide test, also known as BNP test, is a blood test that measures levels of the protein BNP made by your heart and blood vessels. BNP levels are higher than normal when you have heart failure.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed for this test. The blood is taken from a vein using venipuncture.\n\nThis test is most often done in the emergency room or hospital. Results take up to 15 minutes. In some hospitals, a finger prick test with rapid results is available.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel a little pain. Most people feel only a prick or a stinging sensation. Afterward there may be some throbbing or bruising.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may need this test if you have signs of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and swelling of your legs or abdomen. The test helps make sure your symptoms are due to your heart and not your lungs, kidneys, or liver.\n\nIt is unclear if repeated BNP tests are helpful in guiding treatment in those already diagnosed with heart failure.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIn general, results of less than 100 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) suggest a person does not have heart failure. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nBNP levels go up when the heart cannot pump the way it should. A result greater than 100 pg/mL is abnormal, and the higher the number, the more likely heart failure is present and the more severe it is. Sometimes other conditions can cause high BNP levels, including:\n\n* Kidney failure\n* Pulmonary embolism\n* Pulmonary hypertension\n* Severe infection (sepsis)\n* Lung problems\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nA related test, called the N-terminal pro-BNP test, is done in the same way.

    "content": "**Brain Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery on your brain, and now it's time to go home. Follow your surgeon's instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nSurgery was performed for one of the following reasons:\n\n* Correcting a problem with a blood vessel\n* Removing a tumor, blood clot, abscess, or other abnormality along the surface of the brain or in the brain tissue itself\n* Treating hydrocephalus (enlarged cerebral ventricles) or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure\n* Creating more space for the brain due to swelling or Chiari syndrome\n\nYou may have spent time in the ICU and a regular hospital room, and you might be taking new medications.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou'll likely experience:\n\n* Itchiness, pain, burning, and numbness along your skin incision\n* A clicking sound where the bone is slowly reattaching (complete healing may take 6-12 months)\n* A small amount of fluid under the skin near your incision\n* Swelling that may be worse in the morning when you wake up\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTake only the pain relievers recommended by your surgeon. Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, and other over-the-counter medications that may cause bleeding.\n\nEat a normal diet unless instructed otherwise by your surgeon.\n\nGradually increase your activity level, starting with walking. Use handrails when climbing stairs, and avoid lifting heavy objects (less than 20 pounds) for the first two months after surgery.\n\nDo not bend over from the waist; instead, keep your back straight and bend at the knees.\n\nAsk your surgeon when you can begin driving and resume sexual activity.\n\nGet enough rest: sleep more at night and take naps during the day. Take short breaks throughout the day to relax.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nKeep the incision clean and dry:\n\n* Wear a shower cap when showering or bathing until your surgeon removes any stitches or staples\n* Gently wash the incision, rinse well, and pat dry\n* Change the bandage if it gets wet or dirty\n\nDo not use hair products with harsh chemicals for 3-4 weeks.\n\nYou may place ice wrapped in a towel on the incision to reduce swelling or pain. Never sleep on an ice pack.\n\nSleep with your head raised on several pillows to minimize swelling.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you experience:\n\n* Fever above 101°F (38.3°C) or chills\n* Redness, swelling, discharge, pain, or bleeding from the incision\n* Headache that persists and is not relieved by medication\n* Vision changes (double vision, blind spots)\n* Problems thinking straight, confusion, or excessive sleepiness\n* Weakness in your arms or legs\n* New problems walking or maintaining balance\n* Difficulty waking up\n* Seizure\n* Fluid or blood dripping into your throat\n* New or worsening problem speaking\n* Shortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing up more mucus\n* Swelling around the wound or under the scalp that persists beyond two weeks or worsens\n\nDo not stop taking prescribed medications without consulting your surgeon first.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery on your brain. During surgery, your surgeon made a surgical cut (incision) on your scalp. A small hole was then drilled into your skull bone, or a piece of your skull bone was removed. This was done so that your surgeon could operate on your brain. If a piece of skull bone was removed at the end of the surgery, it was likely put back in place and attached with small metal plates and screws.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nSurgery was done for one of the following reasons:\n\n* Correct a problem with a blood vessel.\n* Remove a tumor, a blood clot, an abscess, or other abnormality along the surface of the brain or in the brain tissue itself.\n* Treat hydrocephalus (enlarged cerebral ventricles) or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.\n* Create more space for the brain because of swelling or Chiari syndrome.\n\nYou may have spent some time in the intensive care unit (ICU) and some more time in a regular hospital room. You may be taking new medicines.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou'll probably notice itchiness, pain, burning, and numbness along your skin incision. You may hear a clicking sound where the bone is slowly reattaching. Complete healing of the bone may take 6 to 12 months.\n\nYou may have a small amount of fluid under the skin near your incision. The swelling may be worse in the morning when you wake up.\n\nYou may have headaches. You may notice this more with deep breathing, coughing, or being active. You may have less energy when you get home. This may last for several months.\n\nYour surgeon may have prescribed medicines for you to take at home. These may include antibiotics, steroids, and medicines to prevent seizures. Ask your surgeon how long you should expect to take these medicines. Follow instructions on how to take these medicines.\n\nIf you had a brain aneurysm, you may also have other symptoms or problems.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTake only the pain relievers your surgeon recommends. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and some other medicines you may buy at the store may cause bleeding. If you were on blood thinners previously, do not restart them without getting the okay from your surgeon.\n\nEat the foods you normally do unless your surgeon tells you to follow a special diet.\n\nSlowly increase your activity. It will take time to get all your energy back.\n\nStart with walking.\nUse hand railings when you are on stairways.\nDo not lift more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) for the first 2 months after surgery.\nTry not to bend over from your waist. It puts pressure on your head. Instead, keep your back straight and bend at the knees.\n\nAsk your surgeon when you can begin driving and return to having sex.\n\nGet enough rest. Sleep more at night and take naps during the day. Also, take short rest periods during the day.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nKeep the incision clean and dry:\n\nWear a shower cap when you shower or bathe until your surgeon takes out any stitches or staples.\nAfterward, gently wash your incision, rinse well, and pat dry.\nAlways change the bandage if it gets wet or dirty.\n\nYou may wear a loose hat or turban on your head. Do not use a wig for 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nDo not put any creams or lotions on or around your incision. Do not use hair products with harsh chemicals (coloring, bleach, perms, or straighteners) for 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nYou may place ice wrapped in a towel on the incision to help reduce swelling or pain. Never sleep on an ice pack.\n\nSleep with your head raised on several pillows. This helps reduce swelling.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have:\n\nFever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher, or chills\nRedness, swelling, discharge, pain, or bleeding from the incision or if the incision comes open\nHeadache that does not go away and is not relieved by medicines the surgeon gave you\nVision changes (double vision, blind spots in your vision)\nProblems thinking straight, confusion, or more sleepiness than usual\nWeakness in your arms or legs that you did not have before\nNew problems walking or keeping your balance\nA hard time waking up\nA seizure\nFluid or blood dripping into your throat\nNew or worsening problem speaking\nShortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing up more mucus\nSwelling around your wound or underneath your scalp that does not go away within 2 weeks or is getting worse\nSide effects from a medicine (do not stop taking a medicine without talking to your surgeon first)\n\n---\n\n**Brain Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou may notice some unusual sensations along your skin incision, such as itchiness, pain, burning, and numbness. You might also hear a clicking sound where the bone is slowly reattaching. Complete healing of the bone may take 6 to 12 months.\n\nYou may have a small amount of fluid under the skin near your incision, which can cause swelling that's worse in the morning when you wake up.\n\nHeadaches are common after brain surgery.

    "content": "**Brain Tumor in Children**\n\nA brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that grow in the brain.\n\nThis article focuses on primary brain tumors in children.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is often unknown. Some primary brain tumors are related to other syndromes or can run in a family. They can be:\n\n* Not cancerous (benign)\n* Invasive (spread to nearby areas)\n* Cancerous (malignant)\n\nBrain tumors are classified based on:\n\n* The exact site of the tumor\n* The type of tissue involved\n* Whether it is cancerous\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly.\n\nHeadaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include:\n\n* Headaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours\n* Headaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position\n* Headaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion\n\nSometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include:\n\n* Changes in personality and behavior\n* Unable to concentrate\n* Increased sleep\n* Memory loss\n* Problems with reasoning\n\nOther possible symptoms are:\n\n* Seizures\n* Unexplained frequent vomiting\n* Gradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg\n* Hearing loss with or without dizziness\n* Speech difficulty\n* Unexpected vision problem (if it occurs with a headache), including vision loss (peripheral vision) in one or both eyes, or double vision\n* Problems with balance\n* Weakness or numbness\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. Infants may have the following physical signs:\n\n* Bulging fontanelle\n* Enlarged eyes\n* No red reflex in the eye\n* Positive Babinski reflex\n* Separated sutures of the skull bones\n\nOlder children with brain tumors may have the following physical signs or symptoms:\n\n* Headache\n* Vomiting\n* Vision changes\n* Change how the child walks (gait)\n* Weakness of a specific body part\n* Head tilt\n\nThe following tests may be used to detect a brain tumor and identify its location:\n\n* CT scan of the head\n* MRI of the brain\n* Examination of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the size and type of tumor and the child's general health. The goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or the child's comfort.\n\nSurgery is needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. In cases where the tumor can't be removed, surgery may help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used for certain tumors.\n\nThe following are treatments for specific types of tumors:\n\n* Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be needed.\n* Brainstem gliomas: Surgery may not be possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life. Sometimes targeted chemotherapy can be used.\n* Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary.\n* Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery.\n\nMedicines used to treat children with primary brain tumors include:\n\n* Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling\n* Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure\n* Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures\n* Pain medicines\n* Chemotherapy to help shrink the tumor or prevent the tumor from growing back\n\nComfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you and your child feel less alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a child does depends on many things, including the type of tumor. In general, about 3 out of 4 children survive at least 5 years after being diagnosed.\n\nLong-term brain and nervous system problems may result from the tumor itself or from treatment. Children may have problems with attention, focus, or memory. They may also have problems processing information, planning, insight, or initiative or desire to do things.\n\nChildren younger than age 7, especially younger than age 3, seem to be at greatest risk of these complications.\n\nParents need to make sure that children receive support services at home and at school.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact a provider if a child develops headaches that do not go away or other symptoms of a brain tumor.\n\nGo to the emergency room if a child develops any of the following:\n\n* Physical weakness\n* Change in behavior\n* Severe headache of unknown cause\n* Seizure of unknown cause\n* Vision changes\n* Speech changes\n\n---\n\n**Brain Tumor in Children**\n\nA brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that grow in the brain.

They can also damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.\n\n**Age and Rarity**\n\nTumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.\n\n**Common Tumor Types**\n\n*   Astrocytomas: usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors that most often develop in children ages 5 to 8.\n*   Medulloblastomas: the most common type of childhood brain cancer, occurring before age 10.\n*   Ependymomas: a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign or malignant.\n*   Brainstem gliomas: very rare tumors that occur almost only in children, with an average age of about 6.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly.

If you notice any of the following symptoms in your child, contact a healthcare provider immediately:\n\n*   Headaches that don't go away\n*   Vision problems or blindness\n*   Hearing loss or difficulty speaking\n*   Weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg\n*   Seizures or convulsions\n*   Personality changes or mood swings\n\nIf your child experiences any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical attention. A brain tumor can be a life-threatening condition if left untreated.\n\n**Types of Brain Tumors**\n\nThere are several types of brain tumors that can affect children. Some common types include:\n\n*   Glioblastoma multiforme\n*   Ependymoma\n*   Glioma\n*   Astrocytoma\n*   Medulloblastoma\n*   Neuroglioma\n*   Oligodendroglioma\n*   Meningioma\n\nEach type of tumor has its own unique characteristics and treatment options. A healthcare provider can help determine the best course of action for your child's specific condition.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for a brain tumor in children may involve one or more of the following:\n\n*   **Brain Radiation**: This involves using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\n*   **Brain Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor.\n*   **Chemotherapy**: This is a type of treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells.\n*   **Radiation Therapy**: This involves using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\n\nThe specific treatment plan will depend on the type and location of the tumor, as well as your child's overall health. A healthcare provider can help determine the best course of action for your child's condition.\n\n**References**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about brain tumors in children, there are several resources available:\n\n*   Kieran MW, Chi SN, Manley PE, et al.

    "content": "**Brain Tumor - Primary - Adults**\n\nA primary brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that start in the brain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPrimary brain tumors include any tumor that starts in the brain. Primary brain tumors can start from brain cells, the membranes around the brain (meninges), nerves, or glands.\n\nTumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also damage cells by producing inflammation, placing pressure on other parts of the brain, and increasing pressure within the skull.\n\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. There are many risk factors that could play a role:\n\n* Radiation therapy used to treat brain cancers increases the risk of brain tumors up to 20 or 30 years later.\n* Some inherited conditions increase the risk of brain tumors, including neurofibromatosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome.\n* Lymphomas that begin in the brain in people with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV) are sometimes linked to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus.\n\nThese have not proven to be risk factors:\n\n* Exposure to radiation at work, or to power lines, cell phones, cordless phones, or wireless devices\n* Head injuries\n* Smoking\n* Hormone therapy\n\n**Specific Tumor Types**\n\nBrain tumors are classified depending on:\n\n* Location of the tumor\n* Type of tissue involved\n* Whether they are noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant)\n* Other factors\n\nSometimes, tumors that start out less aggressive can change their biologic behavior and become more aggressive.\n\nTumors can occur at any age, but many types are most common in a certain age group. In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are the most common.\n\nGliomas come from glial cells around the nerve cells of the brain such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. Gliomas are divided into three types:\n\n* Astrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (can be noncancerous), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas.\n* Oligodendroglial tumors. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors. These are called mixed gliomas.\n* Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor.\n\nMeningiomas and schwannomas are two other types of brain tumors. These tumors:\n\n* Occur most often between ages 40 and 70.\n* Are usually noncancerous, but can still cause serious complications and death from their size or location. Some are cancerous and aggressive.\n\nOther primary brain tumors in adults are rare. These include:\n\n* Ependymomas\n* Craniopharyngiomas\n* Pituitary tumors\n* Primary (central nervous system - CNS) lymphoma\n* Pineal gland tumors\n* Primary germ cell tumors of the brain\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome tumors do not cause symptoms until they are very large. Other tumors have symptoms that develop slowly.\n\nSymptoms depend on the tumor's size, location, how far it has spread, and whether there is brain swelling. The most common symptoms are:\n\n* Changes in the person's mental function\n* Headaches\n* Seizures (especially in older adults)\n* Weakness in one part of the body\n\nHeadaches caused by brain tumors may:\n\n* Be worse when the person wakes up in the morning, and clear up in a few hours\n* Occur during sleep\n* Occur with vomiting, confusion, double vision, weakness, or numbness\n* Get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\n* Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma)\n* Changes in hearing, taste, or smell\n* Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, different temperatures, or other stimuli\n* Confusion or memory loss\n* Difficulty swallowing\n* Difficulty writing or reading\n* Dizziness or abnormal sensation of movement (vertigo)\n* Eye problems such as eyelid drooping, pupils of different sizes, uncontrollable eye movement, vision difficulties (including decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision)\n* Hand tremor\n* Lack of control over the bladder or bowels\n* Loss of balance or coordination, clumsiness, trouble walking\n* Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually on just one side)\n* Numbness or tingling on one side of the body\n* Personality, mood, behavior, or emotional changes\n* Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests may confirm the presence of a brain tumor and find its location:\n\n* CT scan of the head\n* EEG (to measure the electrical activity of the brain)\n* Examination of tissue removed from the tumor during surgery or CT-guided biopsy (may confirm the type of tumor)\n* Examination of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (may show cancerous cells)\n* MRI of the head\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment can involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Brain tumors are best treated by a team that includes:\n\n* Neuro-oncologist\n* Neurosurgeon\n* Medical oncologist\n* Radiation oncologist\n* Other health care providers, such as neurologists and social workers\n\nEarly treatment often improves the chance of a good outcome. Treatment depends on the size and type of tumor and your general health. Goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or comfort.\n\nSurgery is often needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. Those that are deep inside the brain or that enter brain tissue may be debulked instead of removed. Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor's size.\n\nTumors can be hard to remove completely by surgery alone. This is because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil. When the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may still help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms.\n\nRadiation therapy is used for certain tumors.\n\nChemotherapy may be used with surgery or radiation treatment.\n\nOther medicines used to treat primary brain tumors may include:\n\n* Medicines to reduce brain swelling and pressure\n* Anticonvulsants to reduce seizures\n* Pain medicines\n\nComfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, and occupational therapy may be needed to improve quality of life. Counseling, support groups, and similar measures can help people cope with the disorder.\n\nYou may consider enrolling in a clinical trial after talking with your treatment team.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result from brain tumors include:\n\n* Brain herniation (often fatal)\n* Loss of ability to interact or function\n* Permanent, worsening, and severe loss of brain function\n* Return of tumor growth\n* Side effects of medicines, including chemotherapy\n* Side effects of radiation treatments\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop any new, persistent headaches or other symptoms of a brain tumor.\n\nContact your provider or go to the emergency room if you start having seizures, or suddenly develop stupor (reduced alertness), vision changes, or speech changes.\n\n---\n\n**Brain Tumor - Primary - Adults**\n\nA primary brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that start in the brain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPrimary brain tumors include any tumor that starts in the brain.

    "content": "**Break the Bonds of Emotional Eating**\n\nEmotional eating is when you eat food to cope with difficult emotions. Because emotional eating has nothing to do with hunger, it is typical to eat a lot more calories than your body needs or will use.\n\n**The Food-Feeling Connection**\n\nFood can put a damper on stressful feelings, though the effect is temporary. Foods high in fat, sugar, and salt can become more appealing when you are under stress, are in a bad mood, or feel bad about yourself. Emotional eating often becomes a habit. If you have used food to soothe yourself in the past, you may crave candy or potato chips anytime you feel bad.\n\n**What Causes Emotional Eating**\n\nEveryone has bad days, but not everyone uses food to get through them. Some behaviors and thought patterns can increase your chance of becoming an emotional eater. If you have trouble managing your emotions, you may be more likely to use food for that purpose. Being unhappy with your body may make you more prone to emotional eating. This goes for both men and women.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nObserve yourself. Pay attention to your eating patterns and the people or events that make you want to overeat.\n\n*   Do you eat when you feel angry, depressed, hurt, or otherwise upset?\n*   Do you eat in response to certain people or situations?\n*   Do certain places or times of day trigger food cravings?\n\nDevelop new coping skills. The next time you want to use food for therapy, think about how else you might deal with the feelings that triggered that urge.\n\n*   Take a class or read a book on managing stress.\n*   Talk about your feelings with a close friend.\n*   Go for a walk to clear your head. Your emotions might lose their force with time and space.\n*   Give yourself something else to think about, like a hobby, puzzle, or good book.\n\nValue yourself. Getting in touch with your values and strengths can help you manage bad times without overeating.\n\n*   Write about things you care deeply about and why they matter to you. This may include your family, a social cause, religion, or a sports team.\n*   Write about things you have done that make you proud.\n*   Spend time doing things you are good at.\n\nEat slowly. Emotional eating often means you eat mindlessly and lose track of how much you've taken in. Make yourself slow down and pay attention to the food you are eating.\n\n*   Put down your fork between bites.\n*   Take a moment to taste your food before swallowing.\n*   If you indulge in something like cookies or fried chicken, limit the portion size.\n*   Do not eat in front of the TV or computer. It is too easy to overeat when you are distracted by what is on the screen in front of you.\n\nPlan ahead. If you know a difficult or stressful time is coming up, set yourself up for healthy eating in advance. Plan healthy meals. Chop vegetables for salad or make a pot of broth-based soup ahead of time so you have hassle-free, filling meals waiting for you. Do not go hungry. When you are both hungry and stressed, pizza and other fast foods become much more tempting.\n\nMake comfort food healthier. Look for ways to prepare your favorite dishes with fewer calories.\n\n*   Use fat-free half-and-half or evaporated skim milk instead of whole milk or cream.\n*   Use 2 egg whites in place of 1 whole egg.\n*   Replace half the butter with applesauce when baking.\n*   Use cooking spray instead of oil or butter for cooking.\n*   Use brown or wild rice instead of white rice.\n\n---\n\n**Break the Bonds of Emotional Eating**\n\nAre you using food as a coping mechanism for difficult emotions? If so, you're not alone. Emotional eating is a common habit that can lead to overeating and weight gain.\n\n**The Food-Feeling Connection**\n\nFood can provide temporary relief from stressful feelings, but it's not a sustainable solution. In fact, foods high in fat, sugar, and salt can become more appealing when we're under stress or feeling bad about ourselves. Emotional eating often becomes a habit, making it harder to resist unhealthy food options.\n\n**What Causes Emotional Eating**\n\nSome behaviors and thought patterns increase our chances of becoming emotional eaters:\n\n*   Trouble managing emotions\n*   Unhappiness with our bodies\n*   Dieting, which can lead to feelings of deprivation and frustration\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nTo break the bonds of emotional eating:\n\n1.  **Observe yourself**: Pay attention to your eating patterns and the triggers that make you want to overeat.\n2.  **Develop new coping skills**: Think about alternative ways to deal with difficult emotions, such as taking a class, talking to a friend, or engaging in a hobby.\n3.  **Value yourself**: Connect with your strengths and values to help you manage bad times without overeating.\n4.  **Eat slowly**: Make an effort to slow down and pay attention to the food you're eating.\n\nBy becoming more aware of our emotional eating habits and developing healthier coping mechanisms, we can break free from the cycle of overeating and develop a more positive relationship with food.\n\n---\n\n**Break the Bonds of Emotional Eating**\n\nAre you using food as a way to cope with your emotions? Do you find yourself eating when you're stressed, angry, or depressed? You're not alone. Many people turn to food as a way to deal with their feelings, but it's not an effective solution.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the ways in which emotional eating can lead to weight gain and other health problems. We'll also discuss some strategies for breaking the bond between food and emotions.\n\n**The Cycle of Emotional Eating**\n\nWhen you eat emotionally, you're often unaware of your hunger cues. You might be stressed at work and reach for a bag of chips as a way to cope. But this behavior can lead to a cycle of overeating and guilt.\n\n*   You eat when you're not hungry, often out of habit or emotion.\n*   You feel guilty about your eating choices.\n*   You try to restrict your food intake, leading to feelings of deprivation.\n*   You eventually give in to your cravings, starting the cycle again.\n\n**Breaking the Bond**\n\nSo, how can you break the bond between food and emotions? Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n*   **Observe yourself**: Pay attention to your eating patterns and the people or events that trigger emotional eating. Do you eat when you're stressed at work? Do you reach for comfort foods when you're feeling down?\n*   **Develop new coping skills**: Instead of turning to food, try other ways to deal with your emotions. Take a walk, practice deep breathing, or talk to a friend.\n*   **Value yourself**: Getting in touch with your values and strengths can help you manage difficult times without resorting to emotional eating.\n*   **Eat slowly**: Mindless eating is often a hallmark of emotional eating. Make an effort to slow down and savor your food.\n\n**Planning Ahead**\n\nIf you know a stressful time is coming up, plan healthy meals in advance. Chop vegetables for salad or make a pot of broth-based soup that can be reheated later. This way, you'll have hassle-free, filling meals waiting for you when you need them most.\n\nDon't go hungry, as this can lead to overeating and poor food choices. Stock your kitchen with healthy snacks like hummus and carrot sticks. Make comfort food healthier by using fat-free half-and-half or evaporated skim milk instead of whole milk or cream.\n\n**When to Seek Help**\n\nIf you're struggling with binge eating disorder, talk to your healthcare provider about the following symptoms:\n\n*   You often lose control of your eating.\n*   You often eat to the point of discomfort.\n*   You have intense feelings of shame about your body or your eating.\n*   You make yourself vomit after eating.\n\nDon't hesitate to seek help if you're struggling with emotional eating. With the right strategies and support, you can break the bond between food and emotions and develop a healthier relationship with food.\n\n---\n\n**Break the bonds of emotional eating**\n\nAre you tired of feeling trapped by your emotions and turning to food for comfort? You're not alone. Emotional eating is a common struggle that can lead to weight gain, low self-esteem, and a never-ending cycle of guilt and shame.\n\nBut there is hope. By understanding the root causes of emotional eating and developing healthy coping mechanisms, you can break free from the bonds of food addiction and develop a positive relationship with your body.\n\n**The dangers of emotional eating**\n\nEmotional eating can have serious consequences on both physical and mental health. Some of the risks include:\n\n*   Weight gain and obesity\n*   Low self-esteem and body image issues\n*   Guilt and shame associated with food choices\n*   Negative impact on relationships and overall well-being\n\n**Breaking free from emotional eating**\n\nSo, how do you break free from the cycle of emotional eating? Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n*   **Identify your triggers**: Take notice of when and why you tend to eat emotionally. Is it stress, boredom, or sadness?\n*   **Develop healthy coping mechanisms**: Find alternative ways to manage your emotions, such as exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend.\n*   **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional needs by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious food, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n\nBy understanding the root causes of emotional eating and developing healthy coping mechanisms, you can break free from the bonds of food addiction and develop a positive relationship with your body.",

    "content": "**Breast Biopsy**\n\nA breast biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of breast tissue so that it can be checked for signs of disease. A doctor called a pathologist looks at the tissue under a microscope to diagnose breast cancer and other breast diseases.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA breast biopsy is the only way to find out whether a suspicious change in your breast is cancer. You may have a biopsy after other breast tests, such as a physical breast exam or a mammogram, show signs that could be breast cancer.\n\n**Why do I need a breast biopsy?**\n\nYou may need a breast biopsy if:\n\n* You or your health care provider felt a lump, thickening, or other change in your breast.\n* A mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI test shows a lump, calcium deposits, or other signs that might mean cancer.\n* The skin on your breast or nipple is red, scaly, or swollen, or your nipple is pulled inward.\n* You have a discharge of abnormal fluid coming from your nipple.\n\n**What happens during a breast biopsy?**\n\nThere are three main types of breast biopsy procedures. They are usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you go home the same day:\n\n* Fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid. The biopsy takes about 15 minutes.\n* Core needle biopsy uses a wide needle to remove one or more small tissue samples about the size of a grain of rice. Sometimes a small vacuum probe is used instead of a needle. The device gently suctions some tissue and removes it with a small rotating blade. A core needle biopsy takes between 15 minutes and an hour, depending on how it's done.\n* Surgical biopsy (or open biopsy) is surgery to remove all or part of a lump. The biopsy usually takes about an hour.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for your biopsy. If you take any blood thinners, including aspirin, you may need to stop taking them before your biopsy. Tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Don't stop or start taking anything without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nIt's common to have some bruising and temporary discomfort after a breast biopsy. Possible risks include:\n\n* Infection, which can be treated with antibiotics\n* Bleeding\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to care for biopsy area and manage any discomfort. If you're having general anesthesia, talk with your provider about how it may affect you.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIt may take several days to a week to get your biopsy results. The results are called a pathology report. The report is written for your provider and will include a lot of medical terms. Your provider can explain what your report means.\n\nThe most important part of your report will be the diagnosis. In general, your results will be one of these categories:\n\n* Normal. No cancer or abnormal cells were found.\n* Abnormal breast changes that aren't cancer and don't increase your risk for breast cancer. Some of these conditions often get better on their own and others may need treatment.\n* Abnormal breast changes that increase your risk for breast cancer. These cells are not cancer, but if you have them, you are more likely to develop cancer.\n* Breast cancer. If your biopsy finds cancer cells, your report will include details about how fast the cancer cells are growing, how much they look like normal cells, and other information to help plan the most effective treatment for your type of cancer.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\nShow references\n\n---\n\n**Breast Biopsy**\n\nA breast biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of breast tissue so that it can be checked for signs of disease.\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is cancer that forms in the milk ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and the lobules (the small lobes of breast tissue that make milk). Breast cancer is much more common in women, but men can get it, too.\n\n**Types of Breast Biopsy Procedures**\n\nThere are three main types of breast biopsy procedures. They are usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you go home the same day:\n\n*   Fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid.\n*   Core needle biopsy uses a wide needle to remove one or more small tissue samples about the size of a grain of rice.\n*   Surgical biopsy (or open biopsy) is surgery to remove all or part of a lump.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Breast Biopsy?**\n\nYou may need a breast biopsy if:\n\n*   You or your health care provider felt a lump, thickening, or other change in your breast.\n*   A mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI test shows a lump, calcium deposits, or other signs that might mean cancer.\n*   The skin on your breast or nipple is red, scaly, or swollen, or your nipple is pulled inward.\n*   You have a discharge of abnormal fluid coming from your nipple.\n\n**What Happens During a Breast Biopsy?**\n\nFor a fine needle aspiration biopsy or a core needle biopsy:\n\n*   Your provider will clean the skin on your breast and give you a shot of medicine to numb the area, so you won't feel any pain.\n*   You may be sitting or lying down. If images are used to guide the biopsy, you may lie on your side, back, or belly with your breast over an opening on the table.\n*   For a fine needle aspiration biopsy, your provider will insert the needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of cells or fluid. For a core biopsy, a tiny cut may be made to insert a wide needle or a vacuum device.\n\nFor a surgical biopsy:\n\n*   You'll lie on an operating table. You may have an IV (intravenous line) in your arm or hand that may be used to give you medicine to relax.\n*   The surgeon will make a small cut in your breast tissue to remove part or all of the lump.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for your biopsy. If you take any blood thinners, including aspirin, you may need to stop taking them before your biopsy. Tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Don't stop or start taking anything without talking with your provider first.\n\nIf you're having general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. If you have general anesthesia or medicine to relax, you may be groggy after the procedure, so plan to have someone take you home.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nIt's common to have some bruising and temporary discomfort after a breast biopsy.

    "content": "**Breast Cancer**\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast tissue. It occurs when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.\n\nSometimes the cancer does not spread any further, which is called \"in situ.\" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, it's called \"invasive.\" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes or metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.\n\n**Types of Breast Cancer**\n\nThere are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The main types include:\n\n* **Ductal carcinoma**, which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type.\n* **Lobular carcinoma**, which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer.\n* **Inflammatory breast cancer**, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type.\n* **Paget's disease of the breast**, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare.\n\n**What Causes Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer.\n\nThere are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These two changes also raise your risk of ovarian and other cancers.\n\nBesides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Who is at Risk for Breast Cancer?**\n\nThe factors that raise your risk of breast cancer include:\n\n* Older age\n* History of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease\n* Inherited risk of breast cancer, including having BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changes\n* Dense breast tissue\n* A reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including:\n\t+ Menstruating at an early age\n\t+ Being at an older age when you first gave birth or never having given birth\n\t+ Starting menopause at a later age\n\t+ Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause\n* Radiation therapy to the breast or chest\n* Obesity\n* Drinking alcohol\n\n**What are the Signs and Symptoms of Breast Cancer?**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of breast cancer include:\n\n* A new lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the armpit.\n* A change in the size or shape of the breast.\n* A dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. It may look like the skin of an orange.\n* A nipple turned inward into the breast.\n* Nipple discharge other than breast milk. The discharge might happen suddenly, be bloody, or happen in only one breast.\n* Scaly, red, or swollen skin in the nipple area or the breast.\n* Pain in any area of the breast.\n\n**How is Breast Cancer Diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have:\n\n* A physical exam, including a clinical breast exam (CBE). This involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits.\n* A medical history.\n* Imaging tests, such as a mammogram, an ultrasound, or an MRI.\n* Breast biopsy.\n* Blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and an electrolyte panel.\n\nIf these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests that study the cancer cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include:\n\n* Genetic tests for genetic changes such in the BRCA and TP53 genes.\n* HER2 test. HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all breast cells. If your breast cancer cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body.\n* An estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly.\n\nAnother step is staging the cancer. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\n**What are the Treatments for Breast Cancer?**\n\nTreatments for breast cancer include:\n\n* Surgery such as\n\t+ A mastectomy, which removes the whole breast\n\t+ A lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself\n* Radiation therapy\n* Chemotherapy\n* Hormone therapy, which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow\n* Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\n* Immunotherapy\n\n**Can Breast Cancer be Prevented?**\n\nYou may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as:\n\n* Staying at a healthy weight\n* Limiting alcohol use\n* Getting enough exercise\n* Limiting your exposure to estrogen by\n\t+ Breastfeeding your babies if you can\n\t+ Limiting hormone therapy\n\nIf you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk. Some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy (of their healthy breasts) to prevent breast cancer.\n\nIt's also important to get regular mammograms. They may be able to identify breast cancer in the early stages, when it is easier to treat.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**What Is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is a type of cancer that affects women, although it can also occur in men.

It happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.\n\nSometimes the cancer does not spread any further. This is called \"in situ.\" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called \"invasive.\" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States. Rarely, it can also affect men.\n\n**Types of Breast Cancer**\n\nThere are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The types include:\n\n* Ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type.\n* Lobular carcinoma, which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer.\n* Inflammatory breast cancer, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type.\n* Paget's disease of the breast, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare.\n\n**Causes of Breast Cancer**\n\nBreast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\n\nBut sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them.

Your age, hormone levels, and medicines you take may cause lumps, bumps, and discharges of fluids that are not breast milk.\n\nAlthough many women fear cancer, most breast changes are benign, meaning they are not cancer. These breast changes are known as benign breast disease. See your health care provider if you have a breast lump, pain, discharge, or skin irritation. Minor and serious breast problems often have similar symptoms and may need treatment.\n\n**Common breast changes and conditions**\n\n* Fibrocystic breast changes can include lumpiness, thickening, and swelling, often just before your period. Your breasts may feel painful, swollen, or tender.\n* Cysts are fluid-filled lumps that may be tender.\n* Fibroadenomas are solid, round, rubbery lumps that easily move when pushed, occurring most in younger women.\n* Intraductal papillomas are wart-like benign tumors that grow in the milk duct of the breast.\n* Blocked milk ducts.\n* Milk production when you're not breastfeeding.\n\n**Symptoms of breast disease**\n\nSymptoms depend on the type of breast disease. Benign breast diseases may not have any symptoms, or they could include:\n\n* A lump or firm feeling in your breast or under your arm\n* A change in the size or shape of your breast\n* Nipple discharge\n* Skin changes such as itching, redness or darkening, dimples, scaling, or puckering on your breast or nipple\n* Painful, swollen, or tender breasts\n\n**Diagnosis and treatment**\n\nSome breast changes may be felt or seen. You may notice a change in your breast, or your provider may notice it during a clinical breast exam. Other breast changes may only be found during a screening mammogram or other imaging tests such as an MRI or ultrasound.

Benign breast diseases may not have any symptoms, or they could include:\n\n* A lump or firm feeling in your breast or under your arm\n* A change in the size or shape of your breast\n* Nipple discharge\n* Skin changes such as itching, redness or darkening, dimples, scaling, or puckering on your breast or nipple\n* Painful, swollen, or tender breasts\n\nSee your provider if you're noticing any of these symptoms or other unusual changes. Some symptoms may be warning signs or symptoms of breast cancer.\n\n**Diagnosis of Breast Diseases**\n\nSome breast changes may be felt or seen. You may notice a change in your breast, or your provider may notice it during a clinical breast exam. Other breast changes may only be found during a screening mammogram or other imaging tests such as an MRI or ultrasound. Your provider may also recommend a breast biopsy to check a suspicious change in your breast.\n\n**Treatment of Breast Diseases**\n\nSome benign breast changes may increase your risk of breast cancer in the future and may need treatment now. Treatment depends on the type of breast disease that you have. Some breast changes may go away without treatment, while others may require monitoring, biopsy, or surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Diseases**\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Breast Diseases (National Institutes of Health)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Gynecomastia (National Institutes of Health)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Mastitis (National Institutes of Health)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Mastodynia (National Institutes of Health)\n\nJournal Articles:\n\n*   Article: Clinical effect of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in the treatment of 60 patients with breast cancer\n*   Article: Efficacy of red ointment in wound cavity repair following non-puerperal mastitis\n*   Article: Breast tenderness and swelling experiences related to menstrual cycles and ovulation\n\nFind an Expert:\n\n*   American Cancer Society\n*   Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health\n*   National Cancer Institute",

    "content": "**Breast MRI Scan**\n\nA breast MRI scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the breast and surrounding tissue. It does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   You will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal snaps or a zipper (sweatpants and a t-shirt).\n*   You will lie on your stomach on a narrow table with your breasts hanging down into cushioned openings.\n*   Some exams require a special dye (contrast) that you will get through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   You likely won't need to do anything to prepare for the test, but ask your health care provider about eating and drinking before the test.\n*   Tell your provider if you are afraid of tight spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\n\n**Before the Test**\n\n*   Tell your provider if you have:\n    *   Brain aneurysm clips\n    *   Certain types of artificial heart valves\n    *   Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n    *   Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n    *   Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive the IV contrast)\n    *   Recently placed artificial joints\n    *   Certain types of vascular stents\n    *   Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n*   An MRI exam causes no pain.

It does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal snaps or a zipper (sweatpants and a t-shirt). Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\n\nYou will lie on your stomach on a narrow table with your breasts hanging down into cushioned openings. The table slides into a large tunnel-like tube.\n\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). You will get the dye through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiology specialist (radiologist) see some areas more clearly.\n\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nYou likely won't need to do anything to prepare for the test. Ask your health care provider about eating and drinking before the test.\n\nTell your provider if you are afraid of tight spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Also, your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI. The machine is not as close to the body in this type of test.\n\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\n\n* Brain aneurysm clips\n* Certain types of artificial heart valves\n* Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n* Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive the IV contrast)\n* Recently placed artificial joints\n* Certain types of vascular stents\n* Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\n\nIf you are very anxious, you may be given medicine to calm your nerves.\n\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You will likely be given ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\n\nAn intercom in the room lets you speak to someone at any time. Most MRI centers have special headphones for music to help the time pass.\n\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines unless your radiologist tells you otherwise.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nMRI provides detailed pictures of the breast. It also provides clear pictures of parts of the breast that are hard to see or evaluate clearly on an ultrasound or mammogram.\n\nBreast MRI may also be performed to:\n\n* Check for more cancer in the same breast or the other breast after breast cancer has been diagnosed\n* Distinguish between scar tissue and tumors in the breast\n* Evaluate an abnormal result on a mammogram or breast ultrasound\n* Evaluate for possible rupture of breast implants\n* Find any cancer that remains after surgery or chemotherapy\n\nAn MRI of the breast may also be done after a mammogram to screen for breast cancer in women who:\n\n* Are at very high risk for breast cancer (those with a strong family history or genetic markers for breast cancer)\n* Have very dense breast tissue\n\n---\n\n**Breast MRI Scan**\n\nYou will lie on your stomach on a narrow table with your breasts hanging down into cushioned openings.

It also provides clear pictures of parts of the breast that are hard to see or evaluate clearly on an ultrasound or mammogram.\n\nBreast MRI may also be performed to:\n\n* Check for more cancer in the same breast or the other breast after breast cancer has been diagnosed\n* Distinguish between scar tissue and tumors in the breast\n* Evaluate an abnormal result on a mammogram or breast ultrasound\n* Evaluate for possible rupture of breast implants\n* Find any cancer that remains after surgery or chemotherapy\n* Guide a biopsy\n\nAn MRI of the breast may also be done after a mammogram to screen for breast cancer in women who:\n\n* Are at very high risk for breast cancer (those with a strong family history or genetic markers for breast cancer)\n* Have very dense breast tissue\n\n---\n\n**Breast MRI Scan**\n\n**Detailed Pictures of the Breast**\n\nA breast MRI scan provides detailed pictures of the breast. It also provides clear pictures of parts of the breast that are hard to see or evaluate clearly on an ultrasound or mammogram.\n\n**When is a Breast MRI Performed?**\n\nA breast MRI may be performed to:\n\n* Check for more cancer in the same breast or the other breast after breast cancer has been diagnosed\n* Distinguish between scar tissue and tumors in the breast\n* Evaluate an abnormal result on a mammogram or breast ultrasound\n* Evaluate for possible rupture of breast implants\n* Find any cancer that remains after surgery or chemotherapy\n* Guide a biopsy\n\n**Who Should Get a Breast MRI?**\n\nAn MRI of the breast may also be done after a mammogram to screen for breast cancer in women who:\n\n* Are at very high risk for breast cancer (those with a strong family history or genetic markers for breast cancer)\n* Have very dense breast tissue\n\n**Before Having a Breast MRI**\n\nBefore having a breast MRI, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having the test. Ask about:\n\n* Your risk for breast cancer\n* Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from breast cancer\n* Whether there is any harm from breast cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Breast cancer\n* Cysts\n* Leaking or ruptured breast implants\n* Abnormal breast tissue that is not cancer\n* Scar tissue\n\nConsult your provider if you have any questions and concerns.\n\n**Risks**\n\nMRI contains no radiation. No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\n\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to this dye are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, tell your provider before the test.\n\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can make heart pacemakers and other implants not work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nA breast MRI is more sensitive than a mammogram, especially when it is performed using contrast dye. However, breast MRI may not always be able to distinguish breast cancer from noncancerous breast growths. This can lead to a false-positive result.\n\nMRI also cannot pick up tiny pieces of calcium (microcalcifications), which a mammogram can detect. Certain types of calcifications can be an indication of breast cancer.\n\nA biopsy is needed to confirm the results of a finding suspicious for cancer on a breast MRI.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* MRI - breast\n* Magnetic resonance imaging - breast\n* Breast cancer - MRI\n* Breast cancer screening - MRI\n\n**References**\n\n* American Cancer Society website.
