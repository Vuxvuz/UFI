    "content": "**Fontanelles - Bulging**\n\nA bulging fontanelle is an outward curving of an infant's soft spot (fontanelle).\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe skull is made up of many bones. There are 8 bones in the skull itself and 14 bones in the face area. They join together to form a solid, bony cavity that protects and supports the brain. The areas where the bones join together are called the sutures.\n\nThe bones are not joined together firmly at birth. This allows the head to change shape to help it pass through the birth canal. The sutures get minerals added to them over time and harden, firmly joining the skull bones together.\n\nIn an infant, the space where 2 sutures join forms a membrane-covered \"soft spot\" called a fontanelle (fontanel). The fontanelles allow for growth of the brain and skull during an infant's first year.\n\nThere are normally several fontanelles on a newborn's skull. They are located mainly at the top, back, and sides of the head. Like the sutures, fontanelles harden over time and become closed, solid bony areas.\n\nThe fontanelle in the back of the head (posterior fontanelle) most often closes by age 1 to 2 months.\nThe fontanelle at the top of the head (anterior fontanelle) most often closes within 7 to 19 months.\n\nThe fontanelles should feel firm and very slightly curved inward to the touch. A tense or bulging fontanelle occurs when fluid builds up in the brain or the brain swells, causing increased pressure inside the skull.\n\nWhen the infant is crying, lying down, or vomiting, the fontanelles may look like they are bulging. However, they should return to normal when the infant is in a calm, head-up position.\n\n**Causes**\n\nReasons a child may have bulging fontanelles include:\n\n* Encephalitis. Swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections.\n* Hydrocephalus. A buildup of fluid inside the skull.\n* Increased intracranial pressure.\n* Meningitis. Infection of the membranes covering the brain.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf the fontanelle returns to normal appearance when the child is calm and head-up, it is not a truly bulging fontanelle.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nImmediate, emergency care is needed for any infant who has a truly bulging fontanelle, especially if it occurs along with fever or excess drowsiness.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about the child's medical history, such as:\n\n* Does the \"soft spot\" return to normal appearance when the infant is calm or head-up?\n* Does it bulge all the time or does it come and go?\n* When did you first notice this?\n* Which fontanelles bulge (top of the head, back of the head, or other)?\n* Are all the fontanelles bulging?\n* What other symptoms are present (such as fever, irritability, or lethargy)?\n\n**Diagnostic Tests**\n\nCT scan of the head\nMRI scan of the head\nSpinal tap (lumbar puncture)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSoft spot - bulging; Bulging fontanelles\n\n---\n\n**Fontanelles - Bulging**\n\nA bulging fontanelle is an outward curving of an infant's soft spot (fontanelle).\n\n**Causes**\n\nReasons a child may have bulging fontanelles include:\n\n*   Encephalitis.

If you have symptoms after eating certain foods, food allergy testing can help find out if your symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction to those foods.\n\nMost food allergy symptoms are mild and include skin rashes and abdominal pain. But sometimes, symptoms quickly develop into a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may affect your whole body, including your breathing.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, eating even tiny amounts of a certain food or ingredient can quickly trigger your immune system to react. Most food allergies are caused by:\n\n*   Milk\n*   Eggs\n*   Peanuts\n*   Tree nuts (including almonds, walnuts, pecans, and cashews)\n*   Soy\n*   Wheat\n*   Fish\n*   Shellfish\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nFood allergy testing is used to help find out if you or your child has an allergy to a specific food. It is mainly used for people who have had symptoms that could be a food allergy. Testing may also be used to see if allergies have gone away over time.\n\nFood allergy testing can help tell whether you have a true food allergy or a food intolerance or food sensitivity, which may cause similar symptoms. The key difference is that food allergies involve your immune system and can affect your whole body and become life-threatening. But food intolerance and sensitivity don't become life-threatening and generally affect only your digestion.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why Do I Need Food Allergy Testing?**\n\nYou or your child may need food allergy testing if either of you:\n\n*   Have symptoms within minutes to hours after exposure to certain foods. Symptoms may affect your digestion, skin, and/or breathing, and may include:\n    *   Nausea and vomiting\n    *   Stomach pain\n    *   Diarrhea\n    *   Tingling in the mouth\n    *   Skin reactions, such as hives or itching.\n    *   Red, itchy skin or a rash\n    *   Coughing\n    *   Stuffy, itchy, or runny nose\n*   Have had symptoms of anaphylaxis. Symptoms of this life-threatening reaction may appear within minutes to hours after exposure to certain foods. Symptoms include:\n    *   Trouble breathing\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Fainting\n    *   Swelling of the tongue, lips, and/or throat\n    *   Rapid heart rate\n    *   Cold, clammy, skin that may appear grayish, bluish, or pale\n\nIf someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis, call 911 to get medical help right away.\n\nYou may also have food allergy testing if you or your child has been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Testing is done to find out which foods may make this condition worse.\n\nYour child's provider may recommend food allergy testing if your infant or child has been diagnosed with:\n\n*   Moderate to severe eczema\n*   Enterocolitis, inflammation of the colon and small intestine\n*   Enteropathy, a disease of the intestine\n*   Allergic proctocolitis, a disorder that involves streaks of blood and mucus in stool (poop)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During Food Allergy Testing?**\n\nAn allergist will ask about your or your child's symptoms, family health history, and medical history, including other allergies. A physical exam is usually done before allergy testing.\n\nNext, your allergist or another provider will do one or more allergy tests. There are many types of allergy tests, and they have different risks. So, ask your provider which tests are best for you or your child. These are the most common tests:\n\n*   A skin prick test is the most commonly used test. A provider will place a drop of liquid on the skin of your arm or back. The liquid contains a protein from a specific food that may trigger an immune reaction. The provider will prick the skin under the drop so the liquid gets below the surface. Then you'll wait for 15 to 30 minutes. If a red, itchy bump forms, you may have an allergy to that food. More than one food protein may be tested.\n*   An allergy blood test measures immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood. Your immune system makes specific types of IgE in response to different foods. If you have a food allergy, your levels of IgE related to that food may be higher than normal. But the amount of IgE in your blood can't confirm a food allergy or tell you how serious an allergy may be. A blood test may be done with other tests to confirm a food allergy.\n*   To take blood sample, a health care professional will insert a small needle into a vein in your arm. A small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.\n*   An oral food challenge test is the most accurate food allergy test. It can be used alone to diagnose food allergies. During this test, you will slowly eat increasing amounts of a food that's suspected of causing your symptoms. You'll be closely watched for an allergic reaction. If your body doesn't react to the food, you aren't allergic to it.\n*   A food elimination diet is a test you do at home following instructions from your allergist. You'll start by removing all suspected foods from your diet for about two weeks. Then you'll slowly start adding the foods back to your diet, one at a time. If you have symptoms when you start eating a food again, you may be allergic to that food. Your symptoms could also be caused by a food intolerance, so other tests may be needed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nIf you are having any type of allergy test, you may need to stop taking certain medicines and/or supplements before the test. Your provider will let you know what to avoid and for how long. Don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. Your test may require other preparation, so be sure to follow all your provider's instructions for getting ready.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nA skin prick test can cause itchy or irritated skin. Your allergist may recommend medicine to relieve the symptoms. The test is generally safe, but a severe reaction is possible.\n\nA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nAn oral challenge test can cause a severe allergic reaction. That's why this test is done with close supervision by an allergist who can treat you if there is an emergency.\n\nAn elimination diet may cause a serious allergic reaction. Ask your allergist what to do if you develop symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Food Allergy Testing**\n\n\\n\\nA food challenge test is the only food allergy test that can confirm a diagnosis of a food allergy. If you have other tests, your or your child's allergist will use your test results along with your symptoms and medical history to make a diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nIf the allergist diagnoses a food allergy, the treatment is to avoid the food that trigger your symptoms. There is no cure for food allergies. Avoiding trigger foods involves carefully reading food labels. You'll also need to explain the allergy to anyone who may prepare or serve food to you or your child, including friends, waiters, babysitters, and teachers.\n\nYour allergist will tell you how to manage a mild allergic reaction. In case you or your child has a severe allergic reaction, your allergist may prescribe an autoinjector. An autoinjector is a small device that you use to inject an emergency allergy medicine, called epinephrine. If you need to use the device, it's still very important to get medical help right away even if you feel better. Your allergist will explain when and how to use an autoinjector.\n\n**Understanding Food Allergies**\n\nA food allergy happens when your immune system - your body's defense against germs - overreacts to a certain food as if it was harmful. If you have symptoms after eating certain foods, food allergy testing can help find out if your symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction to those foods.\n\n**Common Food Allergens**\n\nMost food allergies are caused by:\n\n*   Milk\n*   Eggs\n*   Peanuts\n*   Tree nuts (including almonds, walnuts, pecans, and cashews)\n*   Soy\n*   Wheat\n*   Fish\n*   Shellfish\n\nFood allergies are more common in children than adults. Most children will grow out of allergies to milk, egg, soy, and wheat. But if a food allergy begins in adulthood, it's likely to continue through life.\n\n**When to Get Tested**\n\nIf you or your child has symptoms that could be from a food allergy, your or your child's health care provider will probably refer you to an allergist for testing. An allergist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating allergies and asthma.\n\nThe allergist will pick the type of food allergy test that's right for you or your child. Tests include skin tests, blood tests, and a test where you eat small amounts of a suspected food while a provider watches for signs of allergy.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nOther names for food allergy testing include:\n\n*   IgE test\n*   sIgE test\n*   Allergen-specific IgE in serum\n*   Skin prick test (SPT)\n*   Oral challenge test\n\n---\n\n**Food Allergy Testing**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When Is Food Allergy Testing Recommended?**\n\nYour child's provider may recommend food allergy testing if your infant or child has been diagnosed with:\n\n*   **Moderate to severe eczema**\n*   **Enterocolitis**, inflammation of the colon and small intestine\n*   **Enteropathy**, a disease of the intestine\n*   **Allergic proctocolitis**, a disorder that involves streaks of blood and mucus in stool (poop)\n\nYou or your child may need food allergy testing if either of you:\n\n*   Have symptoms of anaphylaxis, call 911 to get medical help right away.\n*   Have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

This test can cause a severe allergic reaction, so it's crucial to have medical attention readily available.\n*   **Elimination Diet**: An elimination diet involves removing common allergenic foods from your diet for a period and then reintroducing them one at a time to assess your reaction. This test may cause a serious allergic reaction, so it's essential to consult with an allergist before starting the process.\n*   **Skin Prick Test**: A skin prick test involves pricking your skin with a small amount of the suspected allergenic food and observing for a reaction. This test can cause itchy or irritated skin, but it's generally safe with proper supervision.\n*   **Blood Test**: A blood test involves drawing a sample of your blood to check for signs of an allergic reaction. This test has very little risk, with slight pain or bruising at the injection site being the most common side effects.\n\n**Interpreting Results**\n\nA food challenge test is the only test that can confirm a diagnosis of a food allergy. If you've undergone other tests, your allergist will use the results in conjunction with your symptoms and medical history to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\nIf diagnosed with a food allergy, treatment involves avoiding the trigger foods altogether. This requires carefully reading food labels and explaining your allergy to anyone who may prepare or serve food to you, including friends, waiters, babysitters, and teachers.\n\nYour allergist will provide guidance on managing mild allergic reactions and may prescribe an autoinjector in case of a severe reaction. It's essential to understand when and how to use the device properly.\n\nIf you have questions about test results or managing allergic reactions, consult with your allergist for personalized advice.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Aceves SS.

    "content": "**Food Allergy**\n\nA food allergy is an abnormal immune system reaction to certain foods. Your immune system normally protects you from germs. But if you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods as if they were harmful. This reaction is usually mild. But in some cases, it can be serious or even life-threatening.\n\n**What Causes Food Allergies?**\n\nMost food allergies are caused by:\n\n*   Cow's milk\n*   Chicken eggs\n*   Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish\n*   Fish\n*   Peanuts\n*   Sesame\n*   Soy\n*   Tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans\n*   Wheat\n\nPeople with a food allergy may be allergic to more than one type of food.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop a Food Allergy?**\n\nBoth children and adults can have food allergies. Some children will outgrow their food allergies. And sometimes people can develop food allergies as adult.\n\nCertain factors can make you more likely to have a food allergy. They include:\n\n*   Having eczema, a disease that causes inflammation, redness, and irritation of the skin. Your immune system also plays a role in eczema.\n*   Having asthma or other allergies, such as hay fever.\n*   Your genes. Certain genes may influence the development of food allergies. And you are more likely to have food allergies if someone in your family has allergies, asthma, or eczema.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Food Allergies?**\n\nIf you are allergic to a food you have eaten, you may have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms are not always the same for every person. And the symptoms that you get each time you eat the food may not always be the same. For example, your symptoms may sometimes depend on how much of the food you ate.\n\nFood allergy symptoms usually start within a few minutes to two hours after you eat that food. They may include:\n\n*   Hives\n*   Flushed skin or rash\n*   Tingling or itchy sensation in the mouth\n*   Face, tongue, or lip swelling\n*   Vomiting and/or diarrhea\n*   Abdominal (belly) cramps\n*   Coughing or wheezing\n*   Dizziness and/or lightheadedness\n*   Swelling of the throat and vocal cords\n*   Trouble breathing\n\nIn rare cases, a food allergy can cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. It may start out with some milder symptoms, but then it becomes more serious. It can lead to:\n\n*   Narrowed airways in the lungs\n*   Severe trouble breathing because of swelling in the throat\n*   Severe lowering of blood pressure and shock (\"anaphylactic shock\")\n*   Loss of consciousness\n\nThis is a medical emergency. Call 911 if someone is having the symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n\n**How Are Food Allergies Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have a food allergy, your health care provider will:\n\n*   Ask about your symptoms, family health history, and medical history, including other allergies.\n*   Likely do a physical exam.\n*   Do food allergy testing. This could involve skin testing, blood testing, a food elimination diet, and/or an oral food challenge test. An oral food challenge test is the most accurate food allergy test.\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Food Allergies?**\n\nThere is no cure for food allergies. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid eating the food that you are allergic to.\n\nThere are medicines for people with food allergies. They include:\n\n*   Medicines to reduce food allergy symptoms, including antihistamines and corticosteroids.\n*   Medicines to reduce allergic reactions, including severe reactions.\n*   Epinephrine, a medicine to treat anaphylaxis. Your provider may give you a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector. It is a device used to inject epinephrine when someone is having symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you have been prescribed one, it's important to learn how to use it and to carry it with you at all times.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, it's a good idea to have a medical alert bracelet that says what your allergy is.\n\n---\n\n**Food Allergies**\n\nA food allergy is an abnormal immune system reaction to certain foods.

You should also:\n\n* Avoid eating the food that you are allergic to\n* Read food labels carefully\n* Be aware of cross-contamination in food preparation\n* Carry an epinephrine injector with you at all times\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a condition where the immune system reacts to food particles in the esophagus. Food intolerance, on the other hand, is different from a food allergy.

They usually include:\n\n* Upset stomach\n* Abdominal cramps\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Fever\n* Dehydration\n\n**Prevention of Foodborne Illness**\n\nContamination can happen during any of the following steps:\n\n* Raw meat during slaughter\n* Fruits and vegetables when they are growing or when they are processed\n* Refrigerated foods when they are left on a loading dock in warm weather\n\nIt can also happen in your kitchen if you leave food out for more than 2 hours at room temperature. Handling food safely can help prevent foodborne illnesses.\n\n**Treatment of Foodborne Illness**\n\nMost people with foodborne illness get better on their own. It is important to replace lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. If your health care provider can diagnose the specific cause, you may get medicines such as antibiotics to treat it. For more serious illness, you may need treatment at a hospital.\n\n**Resources**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Food and Drug Administration\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\n---\n\n**Food Poisoning | Foodborne Illness**\n\nEach year, around 48 million people in the United States get sick from contaminated food. Common causes include bacteria and viruses. Less often, the cause may be a parasite or a harmful chemical, such as a high amount of pesticides.\n\n**Symptoms of Foodborne Illness**\n\nSymptoms of foodborne illness depend on the cause. They can be mild or serious. They usually include:\n\n* Most foodborne illnesses are acute. This means that they happen suddenly and last a short time.\n* But it can also happen in your kitchen if you leave food out for more than 2 hours at room temperature.\n\n**Preventing Food Poisoning**\n\nHandling food safely can help prevent foodborne illnesses. Most people with foodborne illness get better on their own. It is important to replace lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. If your health care provider can diagnose the specific cause, you may get medicines such as antibiotics to treat it. For more serious illness, you may need treatment at a hospital.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose foodborne illness, your healthcare provider may order tests such as:\n\n* Bacteria Culture Test\n* Ova and Parasite Test\n* Stool Tests\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nFood safety is crucial to prevent foodborne illnesses. People at risk of foodborne illness include those with weakened immune systems.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nSome specific types of foodborne illness include:\n\n* Norovirus\n* Trichinellosis\n* Vibrio Infection\n* Chicken and Food Poisoning\n* Parasites and Foodborne Illness\n* Shigellosis\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nThe burden of foodborne illness in the United States is significant, with around 48 million cases reported each year.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are working to develop new treatments and prevention strategies for foodborne illnesses. You can find information on clinical trials related to foodborne diseases on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nYou can find references and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed on various topics related to foodborne illness, including methods of controlling microbial contamination of food and the determination of aflatoxins in cheese.\n\n---\n\n**Food Poisoning**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**2 Concentrations in Cheese...**\n\nIf you're wondering why some cheeses are more prone to food poisoning than others, it's because of the way they're made. You see, cheese is essentially a concentrated form of milk, and when bacteria like E. coli or Salmonella multiply rapidly in that concentrated environment, it can lead to some serious health issues.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Food Poisoning**\n\nSo, how do you prevent food poisoning? Well, for starters, make sure your cheese is made from pasteurized milk. That way, you'll be reducing the risk of bacterial contamination. Also, always handle and store cheese safely - keep it refrigerated at a temperature below 40°F (4°C), and avoid cross-contamination with other foods.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Foodborne Illness-Causing Organisms in the U.S.: What You Need to Know**\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are several foodborne illness-causing organisms that you should be aware of. These include:\n\n*   **Salmonella**: a type of bacteria that can cause salmonellosis, a serious foodborne illness.\n*   **E. coli**: another type of bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning.\n*   **Campylobacter**: a bacterium that can cause campylobacteriosis, a common yet often underreported foodborne illness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Food Poisoning Prevention Tips**\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you prevent food poisoning:\n\n*   Always wash your hands before and after handling food.\n*   Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods.\n*   Cook your food to the recommended internal temperature to ensure that any bacteria present are killed.\n*   Refrigerate perishable foods promptly and within two hours of cooking.\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of getting food poisoning. So go ahead, enjoy your cheese - but do it safely!",

    "content": "**Food Allergy**\n\nA food allergy is a type of immune response triggered by eggs, peanuts, milk, shellfish or some other specific food.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany people have a food intolerance. This term usually refers to heartburn, cramps, belly pain, or diarrhea that can occur after they eat foods such as:\n\n* Corn products\n* Cow's milk and dairy products (usually due to lactose intolerance)\n* Wheat and other grains that contain gluten (gluten intolerance or celiac disease)\n\nA true food allergy is much less common.\n\n**The Immune Response**\n\nIn a person with a food allergy, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**Common Food Allergies**\n\nAny food can cause an allergic reaction. The most common food allergies are to:\n\n* Eggs (mostly in children)\n* Fish (older children and adults)\n* Milk (people of all ages)\n* Peanuts (people of all ages)\n* Shellfish such as shrimp, crab, and lobster (people of all ages)\n* Soy (mostly in children)\n* Tree nuts (people of all ages)\n* Wheat (people of all ages)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually begin within 2 hours after eating. Sometimes, the symptoms begin a longer time after eating the food.\n\nKey symptoms of a food allergy include:\n\n* Hives\n* A hoarse voice\n* Wheezing\n\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\n\n* Swelling (angioedema), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue\n* Trouble swallowing or breathing due to swelling in the throat\n* Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area\n* Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or feelings of impending doom\n* Nasal congestion, runny nose\n* Stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting\n\n**Symptoms of Oral Allergy Syndrome**\n\nItchy lips, tongue, and throat\nSwollen lips (sometimes)\n\n**Severe Allergic Reactions**\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction that is life threatening. People at risk for anaphylaxis should carry epinephrine with them at all times.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child has a food allergy, see an allergy specialist (allergist).\n\nTreatment may involve any of the following:\n\n* Avoiding the food (this is the most effective treatment).\n* Desensitization, during which you eat a small amount of the food each day. This must be done under an allergist's guidance.\n* Omalizumab (Xolair), an injection every 2 or 4 weeks to decrease sensitivity to food allergies.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent food allergies.\n\nAvoiding peanuts in early childhood does not appear to prevent, and may even enhance, the development of peanut allergy. Providers now suggest introducing peanut-containing foods to infants, which may prevent peanut allergy. There is also evidence that introducing eggs by 12 months of age can prevent egg allergy.\n\nOnce an allergy has developed, carefully avoiding the offending food usually prevents further problems.\n\n---\n\n**Food Allergy**\n\nA food allergy is a type of immune response triggered by eggs, peanuts, milk, shellfish, or some other specific food.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany people have a food intolerance.

It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens. These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem.\n\nIn a person with a food allergy, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\nAny food can cause an allergic reaction. The most common food allergies are to:\n\n* Eggs (mostly in children)\n* Fish (older children and adults)\n* Milk (people of all ages)\n* Peanuts (people of all ages)\n* Shellfish such as shrimp, crab, and lobster (people of all ages)\n* Soy (mostly in children)\n* Tree nuts (people of all ages)\n* Wheat (people of all ages)\n\nIn rare cases, food additives, such as dyes, thickeners, or preservatives can cause a food allergy or intolerance reaction.\n\nSome people have an oral allergy. This is an allergy type syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue after they eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables:\n\n* Melons, apples, peaches, pineapple, and other foods contain proteins that are similar to certain pollen proteins.\n* The reaction most often occurs when you eat the raw form of the foods. How severe the reaction is depends on how much of the food you eat. If the food is cooked, there is no reaction.\n* Unlike true food allergies, people with the oral allergy syndrome rarely develop severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually begin within 2 hours after eating. Sometimes, the symptoms begin a longer time after eating the food.\n\nKey symptoms of a food allergy include hives, a hoarse voice, and wheezing.\n\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\n\n* Swelling (angioedema), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue\n* Trouble swallowing or breathing due to swelling in the throat\n* Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area\n* Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or feelings of impending doom\n* Nasal congestion, runny nose\n* Stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting\n\nSymptoms of mouth (oral) allergy syndrome:\n\n* Itchy lips, tongue, and throat\n* Swollen lips (sometimes)\n\nSevere allergic reactions can happen immediately or within two hours after eating. This is called anaphylaxis and can be life threatening. In addition to the above symptoms, you may have low blood pressure and shortness of breath due to narrowed airways.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBlood or skin tests are sometimes used to confirm that you have an allergy. A double-blind food challenge is one way to diagnose true food allergies. During this test, you and your health care provider will not know what you are eating. This is not commonly done.\n\nWith elimination diets, you avoid the suspected food until your symptoms disappear. Then you start eating the foods again to see if you develop a reaction. This is only done for food sensitivities or mild reactions. If a food has caused severe symptoms in the past, this should not be attempted.\n\nIn provocation (challenge) testing, you eat a small amount of the suspected food under medical supervision. This type of test may cause severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a trained provider. Typically, this test is done when there is a question about whether there is a food allergy or not.\n\nNever try to cause a reaction or reintroduce a food on your own. These tests should only be done under the guidance of a provider, especially if your first reaction was severe.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child has a food allergy, see an allergy specialist (allergist).\n\nTreatment may involve any of the following:\n\n* Avoiding the food (this is the most effective treatment).\n* Desensitization, during which you eat a small amount of the food each day. This must be done under an allergist's guidance.\n* Omalizumab (Xolair), an injection every 2 or 4 weeks to decrease sensitivity to food allergies.\n\nOther treatments, including allergy shots and probiotics, have not been proven to help with food allergies. However, some people find that their oral allergy symptoms improve after taking allergy shots.\n\nIf your child has a problem with cow's milk formula, your provider may suggest trying a soy-based formula or something called an elemental formula, if it is available.\n\nIf you have symptoms on only one area of your body, for example, a hive on your chin after eating the food, you may not need any treatment. The symptoms will likely go away in a brief time. Antihistamines may relieve the discomfort. Soothing skin creams may also provide some relief.\n\nIf you develop any type of serious or whole-body reaction (even hives) after eating a food, you should learn how to use injectable or intranasal epinephrine. You should have two epinephrine devices with you at all times.\n\nUse the epinephrine.\nThen go to the nearest hospital or emergency facility right away, preferably by ambulance.\nIf you develop severe allergy symptoms or anaphylaxis, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe following groups can provide more information about food allergies:\n\n* American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology -- www.aaaai.org/Conditions-Treatments/Allergies/Food-Allergy\n* Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) -- www.foodallergy.org/\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/food-allergy\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAllergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish tend to last a lifetime.\n\nAvoiding the problem foods may be easy if the food is uncommon or easy to identify. When eating away from home, ask detailed questions about the food you are served. When buying food, read package ingredients carefully.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction that is life threatening. People at risk for anaphylaxis should carry epinephrine with them at all times.\n\nAlthough people with oral allergy syndrome may have an anaphylactic reaction in rare cases, they should ask their provider if they need to carry epinephrine.\n\nFood allergies can trigger or worsen asthma, eczema, or other disorders.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSteps to take when a food allergy reaction occurs:\n\n* Call 911 or the local emergency number.\n* Use injectable or intranasal epinephrine.\n* Go to the nearest hospital or emergency facility right away, preferably by ambulance.\n\n---\n\n**Food Allergy**\n\nA food allergy is a type of immune response triggered by eggs, peanuts, milk, shellfish or some other specific food.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany people have a food intolerance.

    "content": "**Food Guide Plate**\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture's food guide, called MyPlate, is a great tool for making healthier food choices. By following the guide, you can learn what type of food to eat and how much to eat. You'll also discover why and how much you should exercise.\n\n**Information**\n\nUsing MyPlate\n\nThere are 5 major food groups that make up a healthy diet:\n\n* **Grains**\n* **Vegetables**\n* **Fruits**\n* **Dairy**\n* **Protein**\n\nYou should eat foods from each group every day. How much food you should eat from each group depends on your age, sex, and how active you are.\n\n**MyPlate Recommendations**\n\nHere's what MyPlate recommends for each type of food group:\n\n* **GRAINS**: Make at least half of your grains whole grains.\n\t+ Examples of whole grains: breads and pastas made with whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, bulgur, faro, or cornmeal.\n\t+ Most children and adults should eat about 5 to 8 servings of grains a day (also called \"ounce equivalents\").\n* **VEGETABLES**: Make half of your plate fruits and vegetables.\n\t+ Vegetables can be raw, fresh, cooked, canned, frozen, dried, or dehydrated.\n\t+ Most children and adults should eat between 2 and 3 cups (200 to 300 grams) of vegetables a day.\n* **FRUITS**: Make half of your plate fruits and vegetables.\n\t+ Fruits can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.\n\t+ Most adults need 1 1/2 to 2 cups (200 to 250 grams) of fruit a day.\n* **PROTEIN FOODS**: Choose lean proteins.\n\t+ Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts and nut butters, and seeds.\n\t+ Most adults need 5 to 6 1/2 servings of protein a day (also called \"ounce equivalents\").\n* **DAIRY**: Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy foods.\n\t+ Most children and adults should get about 3 cups (720 milliliters) of dairy a day.\n\n**Benefits of Eating Healthy**\n\nEating healthy can help improve your health in many ways, including:\n\n* Reducing the risk for many long-term (chronic) diseases\n* Helping you lose weight\n* Promoting regular bowel movements\n\n**Ways to Eat More Whole Grains**\n\nHere are some ways to eat more whole grains:\n\n* Eat brown rice instead of white rice.\n* Use whole-grain pasta instead of regular pasta.\n* Replace part of white flour with wheat flour in recipes.\n* Replace white bread with whole-wheat bread.\n\n**Ways to Eat More Vegetables**\n\nHere are some ways to eat more vegetables:\n\n* Keep plenty of frozen vegetables handy in your freezer.\n* Buy pre-washed salad and pre-chopped veggies to cut down on prep time.\n* Add veggies to soups and stews.\n* Try veggie stir-fries.\n\n**Ways to Eat More Fruits**\n\nHere are some ways to eat more fruits:\n\n* Put out a fruit bowl and keep it full of fruit.\n* Stock up on dried, frozen, or canned fruit, so you always have it available.\n* Buy pre-cut fruit in packages to cut down on prep time.\n\n**Ways to Include More Lean Protein in Your Diet**\n\nHere are some ways to include more lean protein in your diet:\n\n* Choose lean cuts of beef, which include sirloin, tenderloin, round, chuck, and shoulder or arm roasts and steaks.\n* Choose lean pork, which includes tenderloin, loin, ham, and Canadian bacon.\n* Buy skinless chicken or turkey or take the skin off before cooking.\n\n**Ways to Eat More Dairy**\n\nHere are some ways to eat more dairy:\n\n* Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy foods.\n* Most children and adults should get about 3 cups (720 milliliters) of dairy a day.\n\n---\n\n**Food Guide Plate: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/7)**\n\n**Category:** General\n\n**Consuming Dairy Foods**\n\nDairy foods are important for improving bone health, especially during childhood and adolescence when bone mass is being built. Dairy foods have vital nutrients including calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein.\n\n**Benefits of Dairy Foods**\n\nThe intake of dairy products is linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and lower blood pressure in adults. Low-fat or fat-free milk products provide little or no saturated fat.\n\n**Alternatives to Dairy Foods**\n\nFortified soy beverages (\"soy milk\" and soy yogurt) are good alternatives.\n\n**Ways to Include Low-Fat Foods from the Dairy Group**\n\n*   Include milk or calcium-fortified soy milk as a beverage at meals. Choose fat-free or low-fat milk.\n*   Add fat-free or low-fat milk instead of water to oatmeal and hot cereals.\n*   Include plain yogurt or cottage cheese in smoothies.\n*   Top casseroles, soups, stews, or vegetables with shredded reduced-fat or low-fat cheese.\n*   Use lactose-free or lower lactose products if you have trouble digesting dairy products.\n\n**Oils: Eat Small Amounts of Heart-Healthy Oils**\n\nOils are not a food group. However, they provide important nutrients and should be part of a healthy diet. Saturated fats such as butter and shortening are solid at room temperature. Butter, margarine, and oils that are solid at room temperature (such as coconut oil) contain high levels of saturated fats or trans fats.\n\n**Benefits of Oils**\n\nOils are liquid at room temperature. They contain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These types of fats are generally good for your heart. Children and adults should get about 5 to 7 teaspoons (25 to 35 milliliters) of oil a day. Children age 8 and younger need only about 3 to 4 teaspoons (15 to 20 milliliters) a day.\n\n**Choosing Healthy Oils**\n\nChoose oils such as olive, canola, sunflower, safflower, soybean, and corn oils. Some foods are also high in healthy oils. They include avocados, some fish, olives, and nuts.\n\n**Weight Management and Physical Activity**\n\nMyPlate also provides information about how to lose excess weight:\n\n*   You can use the Daily Food Plan to learn what to eat and drink.

    "content": "**Food Jags**\n\nA food jag is when a child will only eat one food item, or a very small group of food items, meal after meal. Some other common childhood eating behaviors that can concern parents include fear of new foods and refusal to eat what is served.\n\n**Function**\n\nChildren's eating habits can be a way for them to feel independent. This is part of normal development in children.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAs a parent or caregiver, it is your role to provide healthy food and drink choices. You can also help your child develop good eating habits by setting regular meal and snack times, making mealtimes positive, and modeling healthy choices for yourself. Let your child decide how much to eat at each meal. **Do not encourage the \"clean plate club.\"** Instead, encourage children to eat when they are hungry and stop when they are full.\n\nChildren should be allowed to choose foods based on their likes and dislikes and their caloric needs. Forcing your child to eat or rewarding your child with food does not promote better eating habits. In fact, these actions can cause long-lasting behavioral problems.\n\nIf the type of food your child is requesting is nutritious and easy to prepare, continue to offer it along with a variety of other foods at each meal. In most cases, children will start eating other foods before long. Once a child is focused on a particular food, it can be very hard to substitute an alternative. **Do not worry if your child goes without eating much at one meal.** Your child will make up for it at another meal or snack. Simply keep providing nutritious foods at meals and snack times.\n\n* Have yourself and other family members help set a good example by eating a variety of healthy foods.\n* Prepare meals with different colors and textures that are pleasing to the eye.\n* Start introducing new tastes, especially green vegetables, beginning at 6 months, in the form of baby food.\n* Keep offering rejected foods. It can take multiple exposures before the new food is accepted.\n* Never try to force a child to eat. Mealtime should not be a time of fighting. Children will eat when hungry.\n* Avoid high-sugar and empty calorie snacks in between meals to allow children to build up an appetite for healthy foods.\n* Make sure children are seated comfortably at mealtimes and are not distracted.\n* Involving your child in cooking and food prep at an age-appropriate level may be helpful.\n\n**FEAR OF NEW FOODS**\n\nFear of new foods is common in children, and new foods should not be forced on a child. A child may need to be offered a new food 8 to 10 times before accepting it. Continuing to offer new foods will help increase the likelihood that your child will eventually taste and maybe even like a new food.\n\nThe taste rule --\"You have to at least taste each food on your plate\"-- may work for some children and families. However, this approach may make a child more resistant. Children mimic adult behavior. If another family member will not eat new foods, you cannot expect your child to experiment.\n\nTry not to label your child's eating habits. Food preferences change with time, so a child may grow to like a food previously rejected. It may seem like a waste of food at first, but over the long run, a child who accepts a large variety of food makes meal planning and preparation easier.\n\n**REFUSING TO EAT WHAT IS SERVED**\n\nRefusing to eat what is served can be a powerful way for children to control the actions of other family members. Some parents go to great lengths to ensure that food intake is adequate. Healthy children will eat enough if offered a variety of nutritious foods. Your child may eat very little at one meal and make up for it at another meal or snack.\n\n**SNACKS**\n\nProviding scheduled meals and snack times is important for children. Kids need a lot of energy, which makes snacks an important part of their daily food intake. However, snacks do not mean treats. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products should be at the top of your snack list. Some snack ideas include frozen fruit pops, milk, vegetable sticks, fruit wedges, mixed dry cereal, pretzels, melted cheese on a whole-wheat tortilla, or a small sandwich.\n\nAllowing your child to be in control of food intake may seem hard at first. However, it will help promote healthy eating habits for a lifetime.\n\n---\n\n**Food Jags: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Common Childhood Eating Behaviors**\n\nA food jag is when a child will only eat one food item, or a very small group of food items, meal after meal. Some other common childhood eating behaviors that can concern parents include fear of new foods and refusal to eat what is served.\n\n**Function**\n\nChildren's eating habits can be a way for them to feel independent. This is part of normal development in children.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAs a parent or caregiver, it is your role to provide healthy food and drink choices. You can also help your child develop good eating habits by setting regular meal and snack times, making mealtimes positive, and modeling healthy choices for yourself. Let your child decide how much to eat at each meal. **DO NOT** encourage the \"clean plate club.\" Instead, encourage children to eat when they are hungry and stop when they are full.\n\nChildren should be allowed to choose foods based on their likes and dislikes and their caloric needs. Forcing your child to eat or rewarding your child with food does not promote better eating habits. In fact, these actions can cause long-lasting behavioral problems.\n\nIf the type of food your child is requesting is nutritious and easy to prepare, continue to offer it along with a variety of other foods at each meal. In most cases, children will start eating other foods before long. Once a child is focused on a particular food, it can be very hard to substitute an alternative. **DO NOT** worry if your child goes without eating much at one meal. Your child will make up for it at another meal or snack. Simply keep providing nutritious foods at meals and snack times.\n\nThings you can do to help your child try new foods include:\n\n*   Have yourself and other family members help set a good example by eating a variety of healthy foods.\n*   Prepare meals with different colors and textures that are pleasing to the eye.\n*   Start introducing new tastes, especially green vegetables, beginning at 6 months, in the form of baby food.\n*   Keep offering rejected foods. It can take multiple exposures before the new food is accepted.\n*   Never try to force a child to eat. Mealtime should not be a time of fighting. Children will eat when hungry.\n*   Avoid high-sugar and empty calorie snacks in between meals to allow children to build up an appetite for healthy foods.\n*   Make sure children are seated comfortably at mealtimes and are not distracted.\n*   Involving your child in cooking and food prep at an age-appropriate level may be helpful.\n\n**FEAR OF NEW FOODS**\n\nFear of new foods is common in children, and new foods should not be forced on a child. A child may need to be offered a new food 8 to 10 times before accepting it. Continuing to offer new foods will help increase the likelihood that your child will eventually taste and maybe even like a new food.\n\nThe taste rule --\"You have to at least taste each food on your plate\"-- may work for some children and families. However, this approach may make a child more resistant. Children mimic adult behavior.

    "content": "**Food Labeling**\n\nThe United States government requires food labels on most packaged foods. The label offers complete, useful, and accurate nutrition information. The government encourages food manufacturers to improve the quality of their products to help people make healthier food choices. The consistent format of the label helps you directly compare the nutritional content of various foods.\n\n**Serving Size**\n\nThe serving size on the label is based on an average amount of food that people typically eat. Similar food products have similar serving sizes to make comparing products easier.\n\nKeep in mind that the serving size on the label does not always equal a healthy serving size. It reflects the amount that people typically eat. It is not a recommendation for how much of that food to eat.\n\nMost of the time, the serving size on a label does not match the serving size on the diabetic exchange list. For packages that contain more than one serving, sometimes the label will include information based on serving size and total package size.\n\n**Amounts Per Serving**\n\nThe total number of calories per serving is indicated in large type. This helps consumers clearly see the number of calories per serving. The list of nutrients includes:\n\n* Total fat\n* Trans fat\n* Saturated fat\n* Cholesterol\n* Sodium\n* Total carbohydrate\n* Dietary fiber\n* Total sugars\n* Added sugars\n* Protein\n\nThese nutrients are important to our health. Their amounts are shown in grams (g) or milligrams (mg) per serving to the right of the nutrient.\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals**\n\nVitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are the only micronutrients required to be on the food label. Food companies can voluntarily list other vitamins and minerals in the food.\n\n**Percent Daily Value (% Daily Value)**\n\nMany nutrients include a percent daily value (%DV).\n\nThis shows how much one serving contributes to the recommended total daily intake for each nutrient. Percent daily values make it easy for you to compare foods and see how a certain food fits into your diet.\nFor example, a food that has 13 grams of fat with a %DV of 20% means that 13 grams of fat provides 20%, or one-fifth of your recommended total daily fat intake.\n\nPercent daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet. You can use these numbers as a general guide, but bear in mind that your calorie needs may be higher or lower depending on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. Note that protein, trans fats, and total sugars do not have percent daily values listed.\n\n**Nutrient Content Claims**\n\nA nutrient content claim is a word or phrase on a food package that makes a comment about the level of a particular nutrient in the food. The claim will mean the same for every product. The following are some approved nutrient claims.\n\n* Calorie terms:\n\t+ Calorie-free: less than 5 calories per serving.\n\t+ Low-calorie: 40 calories or less per serving (serving size greater than 30 grams).\n\t+ Reduced-calorie: At least 25% fewer calories per serving when compared to the regular-calorie food.\n\t+ Light or Lite: One-third fewer total calories or 50% less fat per serving compared to the regular food. If more than half the calories are from fat, the fat content must be reduced by 50% or more.\n* Sugar terms:\n\t+ Sugar-free: Less than 0.5 gram of sugar per serving\n\t+ Reduced sugar: At least 25% less sugar per serving when compared to the non-reduced food\n* Fat terms:\n\t+ Fat-free or 100% fat-free: Less than 0.5 gram of fat per serving\n\t+ Low-fat: 3 grams of fat or less per serving\n\t+ Reduced-fat: At least 25% less fat when compared to the regular-fat food\n* Cholesterol terms:\n\t+ Cholesterol free: Less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving\n\t+ Low cholesterol: 20 milligrams or less of cholesterol per serving and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving\n\t+ Reduced-cholesterol: At least 25% less cholesterol per serving compared to the regular food\n* Sodium terms:\n\t+ Sodium free: Less than 5 milligrams of sodium per serving\n\t+ Low-sodium: 140 mg or less of sodium per serving\n\t+ Very low sodium: 35 mg or less of sodium per serving\n\t+ Reduced sodium: At least 25% less sodium per serving than regular food\n* Other nutrient content claims:\n\t+ \"High,\" \"Rich In,\" or \"Excellent Source Of\": contains 20% or more of the daily value per serving\n\t+ \"Good source,\" \"Contains,\" or \"Provides\": contains 10 to 19% of the daily value per serving\n\n**Health Claims**\n\nA health claim is a food label message that describes the relationship between a food or a food component (such as fat, calcium, or fiber) and a disease or health-related condition. The FDA is in charge of approving and regulating these claims.\n\nThe government has authorized health claims for these 7 diet and health relationships that are backed by extensive scientific evidence:\n\n* Calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis\n* Dietary fat and cancer\n* Fiber in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and cancer\n* Fiber in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and coronary heart disease\n* Fruits and vegetables and cancer\n* Saturated fat and cholesterol and coronary heart disease\n* Sodium and high blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nAn example of a valid health claim you may see on a high-fiber cereal food label would be: \"Many factors affect cancer risk; eating a diet low in fat and high in fiber may lower the risk of this disease.\"\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nFood manufacturers are required to list ingredients in descending order by weight (from the most to the least). People with food sensitivities or allergies can obtain useful information from the ingredient list on the label.\n\nThe ingredient list will include, when appropriate:\n\n* Caseinate as a milk derivative in foods that claim to be nondairy (such as coffee creamers)\n* FDA-approved color additives\n* Sources of protein hydrolysates\n\nMost manufacturers offer a toll-free number to answer questions about specific food products and their ingredients.\n\n**Foods Exempt from Food Labeling**\n\nMany foods are not required to have information on them. They are exempt from food labeling. These include:\n\n* Airline foods\n* Bulk food that is not resold\n* Food service vendors (such as mall cookie vendors, sidewalk vendors, and vending machines)\n* Hospital cafeterias\n* Medical foods\n* Flavor extracts\n* Food colors\n* Food produced by small businesses\n* Other foods that contain no significant amounts of any nutrients\n* Plain coffee and tea\n* Ready-to-eat food prepared mostly on the site\n* Restaurant foods\n* Spices\n\nStores may voluntarily list nutrients for many raw foods. They may also display the nutrition information for the 20 most commonly eaten raw fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Nutrition labeling for single-ingredient raw products, such as ground beef and chicken breasts, is also voluntary.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nNutrition labeling; Nutrition facts\n\n---\n\n**Food Labeling**\n\nLearn how to read food labels and make informed decisions about the foods you eat.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Food Labeling\n*   Images\n*   Food label guide for candy\n*   Food label guide for whole wheat bread\n*   Read food labels\n*   Food labeling\n\nThe United States government requires food labels on most packaged foods.

People with food sensitivities or allergies can obtain useful information from the ingredient list on the label.\n\nThe ingredient list will include, when appropriate:\n\n* Caseinate as a milk derivative in foods that claim to be nondairy (such as coffee creamers)\n* FDA-approved color additives\n* Sources of protein hydrolysates\n\nMost manufacturers offer a toll-free number to answer questions about specific food products and their ingredients.\n\n**Foods Exempt from Food Labeling**\n\nMany foods are not required to have information on them. They are exempt from food labeling. These include:\n\n* Airline foods\n* Bulk food that is not resold\n* Food service vendors (such as mall cookie vendors, sidewalk vendors, and vending machines)\n* Hospital cafeterias\n* Medical foods\n* Flavor extracts\n* Food colors\n* Food produced by small businesses\n* Other foods that contain no significant amounts of any nutrients\n* Plain coffee and tea\n* Ready-to-eat food prepared mostly on the site\n* Restaurant foods\n* Spices\n\n---\n\n**Food Labeling: A Guide to Understanding Nutrition Information**\n\nThe United States government requires food labels on most packaged foods. The label offers complete, useful, and accurate nutrition information. The government encourages food manufacturers to improve the quality of their products to help people make healthier food choices.\n\n**Serving Size**\n\nThe serving size on the label is based on an average amount of food that people typically eat. Similar food products have similar serving sizes to make comparing products easier.\n\nKeep in mind that the serving size on the label does not always equal a healthy serving size. It reflects the amount that people typically eat. It is not a recommendation for how much of that food to eat.\n\nMost of the time, the serving size on a label does not match the serving size on the diabetic exchange list. For packages that contain more than one serving, sometimes the label will include information based on serving size and total package size.\n\n**Amounts Per Serving**\n\nThe total number of calories per serving is indicated in large type. This helps consumers clearly see the number of calories per serving. The list of nutrients includes:\n\n* Total fat\n* Trans fat\n* Saturated fat\n* Cholesterol\n* Sodium\n* Total carbohydrate\n* Dietary fiber\n* Total sugars\n* Added sugars\n* Protein\n\nThese nutrients are important to our health. Their amounts are shown in grams (g) or milligrams (mg) per serving to the right of the nutrient.\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals**\n\nVitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are the only micronutrients required to be on the food label. Food companies can voluntarily list other vitamins and minerals in the food.\n\n**Percent Daily Value (% Daily Value)**\n\nMany nutrients include a percent daily value (%DV).\n\nThis shows how much one serving contributes to the recommended total daily intake for each nutrient. Percent daily values make it easy for you to compare foods and see how a certain food fits into your diet.\n\nFor example, a food that has 13 grams of fat with a %DV of 20% means that 13 grams of fat provides 20%, or one-fifth of your recommended total daily fat intake.\n\nPercent daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet. You can use these numbers as a general guide, but bear in mind that your calorie needs may be higher or lower depending on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. Note that protein, trans fats, and total sugars do not have percent daily values listed.\n\n**Nutrient Content Claims**\n\nA nutrient content claim is a word or phrase on a food package that makes a comment about the level of a particular nutrient in the food. The claim will mean the same for every product. The following are some approved nutrient claims:\n\n* Calorie terms:\n\t+ Calorie-free: less than 5 calories per serving.\n\t+ Low-calorie: 40 calories or less per serving (serving size greater than 30 grams).\n\t+ Reduced-calorie: At least 25% fewer calories per serving when compared to the regular-calorie food.\n\t+ Light or Lite: One-third fewer total calories or 50% less fat per serving compared to the regular food. If more than half the calories are from fat, the fat content must be reduced by 50% or more.\n* Sugar terms:\n\t+ Sugar-free: Less than 0.5 gram of sugar per serving\n\t+ Reduced sugar: At least 25% less sugar per serving when compared to the non-reduced food\n* Fat terms:\n\t+ Fat-free or 100% fat-free: Less than 0.5 gram of fat per serving\n\t+ Low-fat: 3 grams of fat or less per serving\n\t+ Reduced-fat: At least 25% less fat when compared to the regular-fat food\n* Cholesterol terms:\n\t+ Cholesterol free: Less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving\n\t+ Low cholesterol: 20 milligrams or less of cholesterol per serving and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving\n\t+ Reduced-cholesterol: At least 25% less cholesterol per serving compared to the regular food\n* Sodium terms:\n\t+ Sodium free: Less than 5 milligrams of sodium per serving\n\t+ Low-sodium: 140 mg or less of sodium per serving\n\t+ Very low sodium: 35 mg or less of sodium per serving\n\t+ Reduced sodium: At least 25% less sodium per serving than regular food\n\n**Health Claims**\n\nA health claim is a food label message that describes the relationship between a food or a food component (such as fat, calcium, or fiber) and a disease or health-related condition.

These may include pain in the stomach and signs your body has too little fluid (dehydration).\n*   Tests may be done on your stools or the food you have eaten to find out what type of germ is causing your symptoms.\n*   In more serious cases, your provider may order a sigmoidoscopy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Most of the time, you will get better in a couple of days. The goal is to ease symptoms and make sure your body has the proper amount of fluids.\n*   Getting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you comfortable.\n*   You may need to:\n    *   Manage the diarrhea\n    *   Control nausea and vomiting\n    *   Get plenty of rest\n\n---\n\n**Food Poisoning: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Getting Comfortable**\n\nhas the proper amount of fluids.\n\nGetting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you comfortable. You may need to:\n\n* Manage the diarrhea\n* Control nausea and vomiting\n* Get plenty of rest\n\nYou can drink oral rehydration mixtures to replace fluids and minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n**Oral Rehydration Mixtures**\n\nOral rehydration powder can be purchased from a pharmacy. Be sure to mix the powder in safe water.\n\nYou can make your own mixture by dissolving ½ teaspoon (tsp) or 3 grams (g) salt and ½ tsp (2.3 grams) baking soda and 4 tablespoon (tbsp) or 50 grams of sugar in 4¼ cups (1 liter) water.\n\nIf you have diarrhea and are unable to drink or keep down fluids, you may need fluids given through a vein (by IV). This may be more common in young children.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nIf you take diuretics (\"water pills\"), or ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure, contact your provider to see if you need to stop taking the medicine while you have diarrhea. Never stop or change medicines before talking to your provider.\n\nFor the most common causes of food poisoning, your provider will NOT prescribe antibiotics.\n\nYou can buy medicines at the drugstore that help slow diarrhea.\n\nDO NOT use these medicines without talking to your provider if you have bloody diarrhea, a fever, or the diarrhea is severe.\nDO NOT give these medicines to children.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost of the time, you will get better in a couple of days. The goal is to ease symptoms and make sure your body has the proper amount of fluids.\n\nGetting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you comfortable. You may need to:\n\n* Manage the diarrhea\n* Control nausea and vomiting\n* Get plenty of rest\n\nYou can drink oral rehydration mixtures to replace fluids and minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people fully recover from the most common types of food poisoning within 12 to 48 hours. Some types of food poisoning can cause serious complications.\n\nDeath from food poisoning in people who are otherwise healthy is rare in the United States.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nDehydration is the most common complication. This can occur from any causes of food poisoning.\n\nLess common, but much more serious complications depend on the bacteria that are causing the food poisoning. These may include:\n\n* Arthritis\n* Bleeding problems\n* Damage to the nervous system\n* Kidney problems\n* Swelling or irritation in the tissue around the heart\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Blood or pus in your stools\n* Diarrhea and are unable to drink fluids due to nausea and vomiting\n* A fever above 101°F (38.3°C), or your child has a fever above 100.4°F (38°C) along with diarrhea\n* Signs of dehydration (thirst, dizziness, lightheadedness)\n* Recently traveled to a foreign country and developed diarrhea\n* Diarrhea that has not gotten better in 5 days (2 days for an infant or child), or has gotten worse\n* A child who has been vomiting for more than 12 hours (in a newborn under 3 months you should call as soon as vomiting or diarrhea begins)\n* Food poisoning that is from mushrooms (potentially fatal), fish or other seafood, or botulism (also potentially fatal)\n\n---\n\n**Food Poisoning**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n*   Food poisoning that is from mushrooms (potentially fatal), fish or other seafood, or botulism (also potentially fatal)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are many steps that may be taken to prevent food poisoning.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n*   Clear liquid diet\n*   Full liquid diet\n*   When you have nausea and vomiting\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Food poisoning\n*   Antibodies",

    "content": "**Food Safety**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Function**\n\nFood can be contaminated in many different ways. Some food products may already contain bacteria or parasites. These germs can be spread during the packaging process if the food products are not handled properly. Improperly cooking, preparing, or storing food can also cause contamination.\n\nProperly handling, storing, and preparing food greatly reduces the risk for getting foodborne illnesses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nAll foods can become contaminated. Higher risk foods include red meats, poultry, eggs, cheese, dairy products, raw sprouts, and raw fish or shellfish.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nPoor food safety practices can lead to foodborne illness. Symptoms of foodborne illnesses vary. They usually include stomach problems or stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Foodborne illnesses may be severe and fatal. Young children, older adults, pregnant women, and people who have a weakened immune system are especially at risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nIf your hands have any cuts or sores, wear gloves suitable for handling food or avoid preparing food. To reduce your risk for foodborne illness, you should wash your hands thoroughly:\n\n* Before and after handling any food\n* After using the toilet or changing diapers\n* After touching animals\n\nTo avoid cross-contaminating food items you should:\n\n* Wash all cutting boards and utensils with hot water and soap after preparing each food item.\n* Separate meat, poultry, and seafood from other foods during preparation.\n\nTo reduce chances of food poisoning, you should:\n\n* Cook food to the correct temperature. Check the temperature with an internal thermometer at the thickest point, never on the surface. Poultry, all ground meats, and all stuffed meats should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Seafood and steaks or chops or roasts of red meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). Reheat leftovers to an internal temperature of least 165°F (74°C).\n* Refrigerate or freeze food promptly. Store food at the right temperature as quickly as possible after it is purchased.\n* Label leftovers clearly with the date they were prepared and stored.\n* Never cut mold off of any food and attempt to eat the parts that look \"safe\". The mold can extend farther into the food than you can see.\n* Food can also be contaminated before it is purchased. Watch for and DO NOT buy or use outdated food, packaged food with a broken seal, or cans that have a bulge or dent. DO NOT use foods that have an unusual odor or appearance, or a spoiled taste.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFood - hygiene and sanitation\n\n---\n\n**Food Safety: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Proper Food Handling**\n\nTo reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses, it's essential to handle food properly. This includes:\n\n*   Washing your hands thoroughly before and after handling any food\n*   Avoiding cross-contamination by separating meat, poultry, and seafood from other foods during preparation\n*   Cleaning all cutting boards and utensils with hot water and soap after preparing each food item\n\n\\n\\n**Cooking Food to the Correct Temperature**\n\nCooking food to the correct temperature is crucial in preventing foodborne illnesses. Here are some guidelines:\n\n*   Poultry, all ground meats, and all stuffed meats should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C)\n*   Seafood and steaks or chops or roasts of red meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C)\n*   Reheat leftovers to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C)\n\n\\n\\n**Refrigerating or Freezing Food Promptly**\n\nRefrigerating or freezing food promptly is vital in preventing bacterial growth. Here are some tips:\n\n*   Store food at the right temperature as quickly as possible after it's purchased\n*   Buy groceries at the end of your errands rather than the beginning\n*   Leftovers should be refrigerated within 2 hours of serving\n*   Move hot foods into wide, flat containers to cool down more quickly\n\n\\n\\n**Labeling Leftovers**\n\nLabeling leftovers clearly with the date they were prepared and stored is essential in preventing foodborne illnesses. This helps ensure that you use or discard food items within a safe timeframe.\n\n\\n\\n**Avoiding Contaminated Food**\n\nWhen purchasing food, watch for signs of contamination such as:\n\n*   Outdated food\n*   Packaged food with a broken seal\n*   Cans with a bulge or dent\n*   Foods with an unusual odor or appearance\n\n\\n\\n**Preparing Home-Canned Foods**\n\nIf you plan to prepare home-canned foods, be sure to do so in clean conditions.

    "content": "**Foods - Fresh vs. Frozen or Canned**\n\nVegetables are an important part of a well-balanced diet. Many people wonder if frozen and canned vegetables are as healthy for you as fresh vegetables.\n\nOverall, vegetables fresh from the farm or just picked are healthier than frozen or canned ones. But frozen and canned vegetables can still be a good choice. They need to be canned or frozen right after being harvested, when they still have all of their healthy nutrients.\n\nAlso, keep in mind how much salt is added to canned vegetables. Try to buy those without added salt and don't overcook any vegetable, whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Instead of boiling them in water for longer periods of time, they should be lightly steamed.\n\n*   **Alternative Names**\n    *   Frozen foods vs. fresh or canned\n    *   Fresh foods vs. frozen or canned\n    *   Frozen vegetables versus fresh\n\n**References**\n\n*   Thompson M, Noel MB.

    "content": "**Foot Amputation - Discharge**\n\nYou were in the hospital because your foot was removed. Your recovery time may vary depending on your overall health and any complications that may have occurred. This article gives you information on what to expect and how to care for yourself during your recovery.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou have had a foot amputation. You may have had an accident, or your foot may have had an infection or disease and doctors could not save it.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may feel sad, angry, frustrated, or depressed. All of these feelings are normal and may arise in the hospital or when you get home. Be sure you talk with your health care provider about the feelings you're having.\n\nIt will take time for you to learn to use a walker and a wheelchair. It will also take time to learn to get in and out of the wheelchair.\n\nYou may be getting a prosthesis, a man-made part to replace your limb that was removed. You will have to wait for the prosthesis to be made. When you have it, getting used to it will take time.\n\nYou may have pain in your limb for several days after the surgery. You may also have a feeling that your limb is still there. This is called phantom sensation.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nFamily and friends can help. Talking with them about your feelings may make you feel better. They can also help you do things around your house and when you go out.\n\nIf you feel sad or depressed, ask your provider about seeing a mental health counselor for help with your feelings about your amputation.\n\nIf you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under control.\n\nIf you have poor blood flow to your foot, follow your provider's instructions for diet and medicines.\n\nYou may eat your normal foods when you get home.\n\nIf you smoke, stop before your surgery if you can. Smoking can affect blood flow and slow down healing. Ask your provider for help on how to quit.\n\n**Wound and Foot Care**\n\nDo not use your limb until your surgeon tells you it is OK. This will be at least 2 weeks or longer after your surgery. Do not put any weight at all on your wound. Do not even touch it to the ground, unless your surgeon says so. Do not drive.\n\nKeep the wound clean and dry. Do not take a bath, soak your wound, or swim. If your surgeon says you can, clean the wound gently with mild soap. Do not rub the wound. Only allow water to flow gently over it.\n\nAfter your wound heals, keep it open to the air unless your surgeon tells you something different. After dressings have been removed, wash your stump with mild soap and water every day. Do not soak it. Dry it well.\n\nInspect your limb every day. Use a mirror if it is hard for you to see all around it. Look for any red areas or dirt.\n\nWear your elastic bandage or shrinker sock on the stump all the time. If you are using an elastic bandage, rewrap it every 2 to 4 hours. Make sure there are no creases in it. Wear your stump protector whenever you are out of bed.\n\nAsk your surgeon for help with pain. Two things that may help include:\n\nTapping along the scar and in small circles along the stump, if it is not painful\nRubbing the scar and stump gently with linen or soft cotton\n\n**Practice Transfers**\n\nGo from your bed to your wheelchair, a chair, or the toilet.\nGo from a chair to your wheelchair.\nGo from your wheelchair to the toilet.\n\nIf you can use a walker, stay as active as you can with it.\n\nKeep your stump at or above the level of your heart when you are lying down. When you are sitting, do not cross your legs. It can stop the blood flow to your stump.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\nYour stump looks redder, or there are red streaks on your skin going up your leg\nYour skin feels warmer to touch\nThere is swelling or bulging around the wound\nThere is new drainage or bleeding from the wound\nThere are new openings in the wound, or the skin around the wound is pulling away\nYour temperature is above 101.5°F (38.6°C) more than once\nYour skin around the stump or wound is dark or is turning black\nYour pain is worse and your pain medicines are not controlling it\nYour wound has gotten larger\nA foul smell is coming from the wound\n\n---\n\n**Foot Amputation - Discharge**\n\nYou have had a foot amputation.

    "content": "**Foot Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nThere are many bones and ligaments in your foot. A ligament is a strong flexible tissue that holds bones together.\n\nWhen the foot lands awkwardly, some ligaments can stretch and tear. This is called a sprain.\n\nWhen the injury occurs to the middle part of the foot, this is called a mid-foot sprain.\n\n**More about Your Injury**\n\nMost foot sprains happen due to sports or activities in which your body twists and pivots but your feet stay in place. Some of these sports include football, snowboarding, and dance.\n\nThere are three levels of foot sprains.\n\n* **Grade I, minor**: You have small tears in the ligaments.\n* **Grade II, moderate**: You have large tears in the ligaments.\n* **Grade III, severe**: The ligaments are completely disrupted or detached from the bone.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nSymptoms of a foot sprain include:\n\n* Pain and tenderness near the arch of the foot. This can be felt on the bottom, top, or sides of the foot.\n* Bruising and swelling of the foot.\n* Pain when walking or during activity.\n* Difficulty with push off or standing on your toes.\n* Not being able to put weight on your foot. This most often occurs with more severe injuries.\n\nYour health care provider may order a picture of your foot, called an x-ray, to see how severe the injury is.\n\nIf it is painful to put weight on your foot, your provider may give you a splint or crutches to use while your foot heals.\n\n**Healing Time**\n\nMost minor-to-moderate injuries will heal within 2 to 4 weeks. More severe injuries, such as injuries that need a cast or a boot, will need a longer time to heal, up to 6 to 8 weeks. The most serious injuries will need surgery to align the bones and allow the ligaments to heal. The healing process can be 6 to 8 months.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nFollow these steps for the first few days or weeks after your injury:\n\n* Rest. Stop any physical activity that causes pain, and keep your foot still when possible.\n* Ice your foot for 20 minutes 2 to 3 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Always wrap it in a cloth or towel.\n* Keep your foot raised to help keep swelling down.\n* Take pain medicine if you need it.\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYou can begin light activity once the pain has decreased and the swelling has gone down. Slowly increase the amount of walking or activity each day.\n\nThere may be some soreness and stiffness when you walk. This will go away once the muscles and ligaments in your foot begin to stretch and strengthen.\n\nYour provider or physical therapist can give you exercises to help strengthen the muscles and ligaments in your foot. These exercises can also help prevent future injury.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* During activity, you should wear a stable and protective shoe. A higher-top shoe can protect your ankle while a stiffer sole shoe can protect your foot.\n* If you feel any sharp pain, stop the activity.\n* Ice your foot after activity if you have any discomfort.\n* Wear a boot if your provider suggests it. This can protect your foot and allow your ligaments to heal better.\n* Talk to your provider before returning to any high impact activity or sport.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nYou may not need to see your provider again if your injury is healing as expected. You will need additional follow up visits if the injury is severe.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have sudden numbness or tingling.\n* You have sudden increase in pain or swelling.\n* The injury does not seem to be healing as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Foot Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nWhen the foot lands awkwardly, some ligaments can stretch and tear.

You can buy these over-the-counter.\n\n**Activity**\n\nOnce the pain has decreased and swelling has gone down, you can begin light activity. Start with small amounts of walking or activity each day and gradually increase as your foot heals.\n\nYou may experience some soreness and stiffness when walking, but this will subside once the muscles and ligaments in your foot stretch and strengthen. Your provider or physical therapist can give you exercises to help strengthen these areas, which can also prevent future injuries.\n\n**Tips**\n\n*   Wear a stable and protective shoe during activity. A higher-top shoe can protect your ankle, while a stiffer sole shoe can safeguard your foot.\n*   Avoid walking barefoot or in flip flops, as this can exacerbate the injury.\n*   If you feel sharp pain, stop the activity immediately.\n*   Ice your foot after exercise if you experience discomfort.\n*   Your provider may recommend wearing a boot to protect your foot and facilitate better ligament healing.\n\nBefore returning to high-impact activities or sports, consult with your provider for personalized guidance.",

    "content": "**Foot, Leg, and Ankle Swelling**\n\nPainless swelling of the feet and ankles is a common problem, especially among older people.\n\n**Causes of Foot, Leg, and Ankle Swelling**\n\n*   **Overweight**: Excess weight can put pressure on the legs and lead to swelling.\n*   **Blood Clot in the Leg**: A blood clot in the leg can cause swelling due to the blockage of blood flow.\n*   **Age**: As people age, their veins may become less effective at pumping blood back to the heart, leading to swelling.\n*   **Leg Infection**: An infection in the leg can cause swelling as the body tries to fight off the infection.\n*   **Venous Insufficiency**: Veins that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart can lead to swelling due to poor circulation.\n*   **Injury or Surgery**: Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can cause swelling due to trauma or inflammation.\n*   **Long Airplane Flights or Car Rides**: Prolonged sitting can cause fluid buildup in the legs and feet.\n*   **Standing for Long Periods of Time**: Standing for extended periods can also lead to swelling in the feet and ankles.\n*   **Estrogen Use**: Women who take estrogen may experience swelling due to hormonal changes.\n*   **Pregnancy**: Many women experience some swelling during pregnancy, and more severe swelling may be a sign of preeclampsia.\n*   **Heart Failure, Kidney Failure, or Liver Failure**: Swollen legs can be a sign of these conditions, where there is too much fluid in the body collecting in the legs.\n*   **Certain Medicines**: Antidepressants, blood pressure medicines, hormones, steroids, and other medications can cause leg swelling.\n\n**Home Care Tips to Reduce Swelling**\n\n1.  **Raise Your Legs**: Put your legs on pillows to raise them above your heart while lying down.\n2.  **Exercise Your Legs**: Regular exercise helps pump fluid from your legs back to your heart.\n3.  **Follow a Low-Salt Diet**: Reducing salt intake may help decrease fluid buildup and swelling.\n4.  **Wear Support Stockings**: Support stockings can help reduce swelling by improving circulation.\n5.  **Take Breaks When Traveling**: Take breaks often to stand up and move around when traveling.\n6.  **Avoid Tight Clothing or Garters**: Avoid wearing tight clothing or garters around your thighs, as they can constrict blood flow and worsen swelling.\n7.  **Lose Weight if Needed**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce swelling.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   If you experience severe swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain\n*   If you have heart disease or kidney disease and the swelling gets worse\n*   If you have a history of liver disease and now have swelling in your legs or abdomen\n*   If your swollen foot or leg is red or warm to the touch\n*   If you have a fever\n*   If you are pregnant and have more than just mild swelling or a sudden increase in swelling\n*   If self-care measures do not help or swelling gets worse\n\n---\n\n**Foot, Leg, and Ankle Swelling**\n\nPainless swelling of the feet and ankles is a common problem, especially among older people.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Is overweight\n*   Has a blood clot in the leg\n*   Is older\n*   Has a leg infection\n*   Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart (called venous insufficiency, most often due to varicose veins)\n\nInjury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.\n\nLong airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.\n\nSwelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and significant swelling.\n\nSwollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body, and it collects in the legs.\n\nCertain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:\n\n*   Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics\n*   Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers\n*   Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone\n*   Steroids\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSome tips that may help reduce swelling:\n\n*   Elevate your legs above the level of your heart to reduce swelling.\n*   Avoid standing for long periods of time.\n*   Take regular breaks during long car rides or airplane flights.\n*   Wear compression stockings to help improve blood flow and reduce swelling.\n*   Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n*   Limit your salt intake to reduce fluid retention.\n*   Engage in regular exercise, such as walking or swimming, to improve circulation and reduce swelling.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:\n\n*   Sudden increase in swelling\n*   Redness or warmth in the affected area\n*   Fever\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest pain\n\nConsult with your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program or making significant changes to your lifestyle.\n\n---\n\n**Foot, leg, and ankle swelling: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSome tips that may help reduce swelling:\n\n*   Put your legs on pillows to raise them above your heart while lying down.\n*   Exercise your legs.

You may have a narrowing of the nerve opening (foraminal stenosis).\n\n**Description**\n\nForaminotomy takes pressure off the nerve coming out of your spinal column. This reduces any pain you were having. Foraminotomy can be performed on any level of the spine.\n\nYou will be asleep and feel no pain (general anesthesia).\n\nDuring surgery:\n\n*   You usually lie on your belly or sit up on the operating table.\n*   A cut (incision) is made in the middle of the back of your spine. The length of the incision depends on how much of your spinal column will be operated on.\n*   Skin, muscles, and ligaments are moved to the side. Your surgeon may use a surgical microscope to see inside your back.\n*   Some bone is cut or shaved away to open the nerve root opening (foramen). Any disk fragments are removed.\n*   Other bone may also be removed at the back of the vertebrae to make more room (laminotomy or laminectomy).\n*   The surgeon may do a spinal fusion to make sure your spinal column is stable after surgery.\n*   The muscles and other tissues are put back in place. The skin is sewn together.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA bundle of nerves (nerve root) leaves your spinal cord through openings in your spinal column. These openings are called the neural foramens. When the openings for the nerve root become narrow, it can put pressure on your nerve. This condition is called foraminal spinal stenosis.\n\nThis surgery may be considered if you have severe symptoms that interfere with your daily life. Symptoms include:\n\n*   Pain that may be felt in your thigh, calf, lower back, shoulder, arms or hands.

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days before the surgery:\n\n* Prepare your home for when you leave the hospital after surgery.\n* If you are a smoker, you need to stop. Your recovery will be slower and possibly not as good if you continue to smoke. Ask your provider for help.\n* For one week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking blood thinners. Some of these drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.\n* If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will ask you to see your regular provider to ensure these problems are under control.\n* Talk with your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n* Let your surgeon know right away if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses.\n* You may want to visit a physical therapist to learn exercises to do before surgery and to practice using crutches.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will likely wear a soft neck collar afterward if the surgery was on your neck. Most people are able to get out of bed and sit up within 2 hours after surgery. You will need to move your neck carefully.\n\nYou should be able to leave the hospital the day after the surgery.

If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will ask you to see your regular provider to ensure these problems are under control.\nTalk with your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\nLet your surgeon know right away if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses.\nYou may want to visit a physical therapist to learn exercises to do before surgery and to practice using crutches.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\nYou will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nBring your cane, walker, or wheelchair if you have one already. Also bring shoes with flat, nonskid soles.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will likely wear a soft neck collar afterward if the surgery was on your neck. Most people are able to get out of bed and sit up within 2 hours after surgery. You will need to move your neck carefully.\n\nYou should be able to leave the hospital the day after the surgery.

    "content": "**Forehead Lift**\n\nA forehead lift is a surgical procedure to correct sagging of the forehead skin, eyebrows, and upper eyelids. It may also improve the look of wrinkles in the forehead and between the eyes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nA forehead lift removes or changes the muscles and skin that cause signs of aging as drooping eyebrows, \"hooding\" eyelids, forehead furrows, and frown lines.\n\nThe surgery may be done alone or with other procedures such as a facelift, eyelid surgery, or nose reshaping. The surgery can be done in a surgeon's office, an outpatient surgery center, or a hospital. It is usually done on an outpatient basis, without an overnight stay.\n\nYou will be given local anesthesia so that you will not feel pain. You might also get medicine to relax you. In some cases, general anesthesia will be used. During the procedure, you will feel some stretching of the forehead skin and possibly some discomfort. During the surgery:\n\n*   Sections of hair will be held away from the surgery area.\n*   Hair right in front of the cut line may need to be trimmed, but large areas of hair will not be shaved.\n*   The surgeon will make a surgical cut (incision) at ear level. That cut will continue across the top of the forehead at the hairline so that the forehead does not look too high.\n*   If you are bald or balding, the surgeon may use a cut in the middle of the scalp to avoid a visible scar.\n*   Some surgeons will use several small cuts and perform the surgery using an endoscope (a long thin instrument that has a small camera on the end). Dissolvable implants may be used to hold the lifted skin in place.\n\nAfter removing excess tissue, skin, and muscle, the surgeon will close the cut with stitches or staples. Before dressings are applied, your hair and face will be washed so the scalp skin does not get irritated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is most often done on people in their 40s to 60s to slow the effects of aging. It can also help people with inherited conditions, such as furrowed lines above the nose or a droopy eyebrow.\n\nIn younger people, a forehead lift can raise low eyebrows that give the face a sad look. The procedure can also be done in people whose brows are so low that they block the upper part of their field of vision.\n\nA good candidate for a forehead lift has one or more of the following:\n\n*   Deep furrows between the eyes\n*   Horizontal wrinkles on the forehead\n*   Sagging brows\n*   Tissue that hangs down at the outer part of the eyelids\n*   Problem seeing because of the hanging tissue\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reaction to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of forehead lift surgery include:\n\n*   A pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgically\n*   Damage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)\n*   Wounds that do not heal well\n*   Pain that does not go away\n*   Asymmetry of the eyebrow\n*   Numbness or other changes in skin sensation\n\nOccasionally, forehead lifts will make it hard to raise the eyebrows or wrinkle the forehead on one or both sides. If this happens, you might need more surgery to make both sides even. If you have already had plastic surgery to lift your upper eyelids, a forehead lift may not be recommended because it could affect your ability to close your eyelids.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore your surgery, you will have a consultation. This will include a history, physical exam, and a psychological evaluation. You may want to bring someone (such as your spouse) with you during the visit.\n\nFeel free to ask questions. Be sure you understand the answers to your questions. You must understand fully the preoperative preparations, the procedure itself, and the care after surgery.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n*   You are or could be pregnant\n*   You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**During the Week Before Your Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\nBe sure to follow any other specific instructions from your surgeon.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe area is wrapped with a sterile padding and an elastic bandage to prevent bleeding and swelling (edema). You will feel numbness and temporary discomfort in the surgical site, which you can control with medicine.\n\nYou'll need to keep your head raised for 2 to 3 days after surgery to prevent swelling. Bruising and swelling will occur around the eyes and cheeks, but should begin to disappear in a few days or a week.\n\nAs nerves regrow, numbness of the forehead and scalp will be replaced with itching or tingling. It may take up to 6 months for these sensations to fully disappear. The bandages will be removed a day or two after surgery. Within 10 to14 days, the stitches or clips will be removed in two stages.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou will be able to walk around in 1 to 2 days, but you will not be able to work for at least 7 days after surgery. You can shampoo and shower 2 days after surgery, or as soon as the bandages are removed.\n\nWithin 10 days, you should be able to go back to work or school. You should limit vigorous physical activity (jogging, bending, heavy housework, sex, or any activity that increases your blood pressure) for several weeks. Avoid contact sports for 6 to 8 weeks. Limit exposure to heat or sun for several months.\n\nHair shafts will be a bit thinner around the cut for a few weeks or months, but the hair should start to grow normally again. Hair will not grow in the line of the actual scar. Wearing your hair down on your forehead will hide most scars.\n\nMost signs of the surgery should fade completely within 2 to 3 months. Makeup can cover minor swelling and bruising. At first, you'll probably feel tired and let down, but that will pass as you begin to look and feel better.\n\nMost people are pleased with the results of a forehead lift. They appear much younger and more rested than they did before. The procedure reduces the look of aging for years. Even if you do not have the surgery repeated in later years, you will probably look better than if you had never had a forehead lift.\n\n---\n\n**Forehead Lift**\n\nA forehead lift is a surgical procedure to correct sagging of the forehead skin, eyebrows, and upper eyelids.

    "content": "**Foreign Body in the Nose**\n\nThis article discusses first aid for a foreign object placed into the nose.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nCurious young children may insert small objects into their nose in a normal attempt to explore their own bodies. Objects placed in the nose may include food, seeds, dried beans, small toys (such as marbles), crayon pieces, erasers, paper wads, cotton, beads, button batteries, and disc magnets.\n\nA foreign body in a child's nose can be there for a while without a parent being aware of the problem. The object may only be discovered when visiting your health care provider to find the cause of irritation, bleeding, infection, or difficulty breathing.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Difficulty breathing through the affected nostril\n* Feeling of something in the nose\n* Foul-smelling or bloody nasal discharge\n* Irritability, particularly in infants\n* Irritation or pain in the nose\n\n**First Aid**\n\nFirst aid steps include:\n\n* Have the person breathe through the mouth.

This can include a wide range of items, such as food, seeds, dried beans, small toys (such as marbles), crayon pieces, erasers, paper wads, cotton, beads, button batteries, and disc magnets.\n\n**Why do children insert foreign bodies into their noses?**\n\nChildren may insert small objects into their nose in a normal attempt to explore their own bodies. This behavior is often seen in young children who are curious about the world around them.\n\n**Symptoms of a foreign body in the nose**\n\nSymptoms that your child may have a foreign body in his or her nose include:\n\n* Difficulty breathing through the affected nostril\n* Feeling of something in the nose\n* Foul-smelling or bloody nasal discharge\n* Irritability, particularly in infants\n* Irritation or pain in the nose\n\n**First Aid**\n\nFirst aid steps include:\n\n* Have the person breathe through the mouth. The person should not breathe in sharply. This may force the object in further.\n* Gently press and close the nostril that does not have the object in it. Ask the person to blow gently. This may help push the object out. Avoid blowing the nose too hard or repeatedly.\n* If this method fails, get medical help.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nDo not search the nose with cotton swabs or other tools.

    "content": "**Formoterol Oral Inhalation**\n\n*pronounced as (for moh' te rol)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFormoterol oral inhalation is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Formoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFormoterol oral inhalation comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day in the morning and the evening about 12 hours after you inhaled your last dose. Inhale formoterol at about the same times every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use formoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not use formoterol to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with formoterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly, but to continue to use it to treat attacks.\n\nFormoterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\n\nFormoterol inhalation may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Do not stop using formoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using formoterol, your symptoms may worsen.\n\n**To inhale the solution using a nebulizer:**\n\n1. Remove one vial of formoterol inhalation solution from the foil pouch.\n2. Look at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if the liquid is cloudy or discolored.\n3. Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with formoterol in the reservoir.\n4. Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.\n5. Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.\n6. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.\n7. Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 9 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.\n8. Dispose of the empty vial and its top safely, so that they are out of the reach of children.\n\nClean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.\n\nDo not mix the formoterol solution with other inhalation solutions in your nebulizer.\n\n---\n\n**Formoterol Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Directions for Use**\n\nDo not mix the formoterol solution with other inhalation solutions in your nebulizer.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\nUse formoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nFormoterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\n\nFormoterol inhalation may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Do not stop using formoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using formoterol, your symptoms may worsen.\n\n**Precautions**\n\nBefore using formoterol oral inhalation:\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to formoterol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in formoterol nebulizer solution.\n*   Tell your doctor if you use another LABA such as arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta), olodaterol (Striverdi Respimat, in Stiolto Respimat), salmeterol (Serevent, in Advair), or vilanterol (in Anoro Ellipta, Breo Ellipta, Trelegy Ellipta).\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using formoterol oral inhalation.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nTell your doctor if you have asthma. Your doctor will tell you not to use formoterol inhalation unless you are using it along with an inhaled steroid medication.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat; QT prolongation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to fainting, loss of consciousness, seizures, or sudden death); high blood pressure; seizures; diabetes; or heart, liver, or thyroid disease.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Forget a Dose?**\n\nClean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.\n\n---\n\n**Formoterol Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nSkip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n* nervousness\n* headache\n* uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body\n* dry mouth\n* muscle cramps\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* diarrhea\n* extreme tiredness\n* dizziness\n* difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* stuffed or runny nose\n* sore throat\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using formoterol inhalation and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, or eyes\n* difficulty swallowing or breathing\n* hives\n* rash\n* itching\n* fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat\n* chest pain\n* fainting\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep formoterol vials of nebulizer solution sealed in their foil pouches and away from light and excess heat until you are ready to use them. Store the nebulizer solution in the refrigerator. You can also store it at room temperature for up to 3 months. Keep this medication out of reach of children.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community.

Fosamprenavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although fosamprenavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFosamprenavir comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. The tablets can be taken with or without food. In patients at least 18 years old, the suspension should be taken without food. In patients younger than 18 years old, the suspension should be taken with food. To help you remember to take fosamprenavir, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fosamprenavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking the suspension, shake it well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nIf you vomit less than 30 minutes after you take fosamprenavir, you should take another full dose of fosamprenavir.\n\nFosamprenavir controls HIV infection but does not cure it.

    "content": "**Fosinopril: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFosinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is also used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Fosinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFosinopril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. To help you remember to take fosinopril, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fosinopril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of fosinopril and gradually increase your dose.\n\nFosinopril controls high blood pressure and heart failure but does not cure them.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking valsartan and sacubitril (Entresto) or if you have stopped taking it within the last 36 hours. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fosinopril, if you are also taking valsartan and sacubitril. Also, tell your doctor if you have diabetes and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fosinopril if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with fosinopril. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with fosinopril. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting fosinopril with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking fosinopril, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you are taking antacids (Maalox, Mylanta), take them 2 hours before or after fosinopril.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with fosinopril: aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve); potassium supplements.

    "content": "**Fostemsavir: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFostemsavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults whose HIV could not be successfully treated with other medications, including their current therapy. Fostemsavir is in a class of medications called HIV attachment inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although fostemsavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFostemsavir comes as a tablet to take by mouth with or without food. It is usually taken twice a day. Take fostemsavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fostemsavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nFostemsavir controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take fostemsavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fostemsavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses or stop using fostemsavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking fostemsavir,\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fostemsavir, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fostemsavir tablets. \n\nsome medications should not be taken with fostemsavir.

    "content": "**Fracture**\n\nA fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are usually caused by injuries. Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture.\n\n**Types of Fractures**\n\nThere are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on:\n\n* Whether the bone is partially or completely broken.\n* Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture.\n* The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern.\n* The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse.\n* Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures.\n\n**Causes of Fractures**\n\nFractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures.\n\nLow bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone.\n\n**Symptoms of a Fracture**\n\nThe symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include:\n\n* Intense pain\n* Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place\n* Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury\n* Trouble moving the injured part\n\nIf you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken.\n\n**Treatments for Fractures**\n\nThe most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.\n\nIn some cases, you may need surgery to put in plates, pins, or screws to keep the bone in place.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are steps you can take to lower your risk of fractures:\n\n* Keeping your bones strong by:\n\t+ Getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet\n\t+ Getting regular physical activity, including weight bearing exercises such as walking, tennis, and dancing\n\t+ Getting treatment for low bone density or osteoporosis (if needed)\n* Wearing protective equipment when you do sports\n* Preventing falls by:\n\t+ Getting rid of any tripping hazards in your home\n\t+ Being careful when walking on wet or icy surfaces\n\t+ Choosing the right footwear\n\n---\n\n**Fracture | MedlinePlus (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is a fracture?**\n\nA fracture, also known as a broken bone, is a break in a bone.

Fractures can occur due to various reasons such as falls, sports injuries, or osteoporosis.\n\n**Types of fractures**\n\nThere are several types of fractures, including:\n\n* **Stress fracture**: A small crack in the bone caused by repetitive stress and strain.\n* **Comminuted fracture**: A break where the bone is shattered into multiple pieces.\n* **Greenstick fracture**: A partial break that occurs when a bone bends and partially breaks.\n* **Open fracture**: A break where the skin is pierced, allowing bacteria to enter the wound.\n\n**Causes of fractures**\n\nFractures can be caused by various factors such as:\n\n* **Falls**: The most common cause of fractures, especially in older adults.\n* **Sports injuries**: Fractures can occur due to overuse or direct blows to the bone.\n* **Osteoporosis**: A condition that weakens bones, making them more susceptible to fractures.\n\n**Symptoms of fractures**\n\nThe symptoms of a fracture may include:\n\n* **Pain**: Severe pain in the affected area.\n* **Swelling**: Swelling and bruising around the break.\n* **Limited mobility**: Difficulty moving the affected limb.\n\n**Treatment of fractures**\n\nThe treatment of a fracture depends on the severity and location of the break. Treatment options may include:\n\n* **Cast or splint**: A device used to immobilize the affected area.\n* **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the bone.\n* **Physical therapy**: Exercises to help restore strength and mobility.\n\n**Prevention of fractures**\n\nFractures can be prevented by taking certain precautions such as:\n\n* **Exercising regularly**: Regular exercise can help maintain strong bones.\n* **Eating a healthy diet**: A balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D can help prevent osteoporosis.\n* **Avoiding falls**: Taking steps to prevent falls, such as installing handrails or using a walker.\n\n**Related health topics**\n\nFractures are related to other health topics such as:\n\n* **Osteoporosis**\n* **Bone diseases**\n* **Joint injuries and disorders**\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on fractures is the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",

Instead, the baby will hold it still against the side of the body.\n* Lifting the baby under the arms causes the child pain.\n* Sometimes, the fracture can be felt with the fingers, but the problem often can't be seen or felt.\n* Within a few weeks, a hard lump may develop where the bone is healing. This lump may be the only sign that the newborn had a broken collar bone.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* A chest x-ray will show whether or not there is a broken bone.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* In general, there is no treatment other than lifting the child gently to prevent discomfort.\n* If needed, the arm on the affected side may be kept still by simply pinning the sleeve to the clothes.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n* Full recovery occurs without treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n* Most often, there are no complications. Because infants heal well, it may be impossible (even by x-ray) to tell that a fracture occurred.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n* Contact your health care provider if your baby acts uncomfortable when you lift them.\n\n---\n\n**Fractured Clavicle in the Newborn**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf your baby acts uncomfortable when you lift them, contact your health care provider.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Fractured collar bone - newborn\n* Broken collar bone - newborn\n\n**Images**\n\n[Image: Fractured clavicle (infant)]\n\n**References**\n\n* Baldwin KD, Shah AS, Wells L, Arkader A.

A small part of the gene code is repeated several times in one area of the X chromosome. The more repeats (also called gene expansion), the more likely the condition will occur.\n\nThe FMR1 gene makes a protein needed for your brain to function properly. A defect in the gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all.\n\nBoys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X expansion is likely to affect them more severely. You can have fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBehavior problems associated with fragile X syndrome include:\n\n* Autism spectrum disorder\n* Delay in crawling, walking, or twisting\n* Hand flapping or hand biting\n* Hyperactive or impulsive behavior\n* Intellectual disability\n* Speech and language delay\n* Tendency to avoid eye contact\n\nPhysical signs may include:\n\n* Flat feet\n* Flexible joints and low muscle tone\n* Large body size\n* Large forehead or ears with a prominent jaw\n* Long face\n* Soft skin\n\nSome of these problems are present at birth, while others may not develop until after puberty.\n\nFamily members who have fewer repeats in the FMR1 gene may not have intellectual disability. Women may have premature menopause or difficulty becoming pregnant. Both men and women may have problems with tremors and poor coordination.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThere are very few outward signs of fragile X syndrome in babies. Some things that your health care provider may look for include:\n\n* Large head circumference in babies\n* Intellectual disability\n* Large testicles after the start of puberty\n* Subtle differences in face features\n\nIn females, excess shyness may be the only sign of the disorder.\n\nGenetic testing can diagnose this disease.\n\n---\n\n**Fragile X Syndrome**\n\n**What is Fragile X syndrome?**\n\nFragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males more frequently than females. It is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome, which leads to intellectual disability and other physical and behavioral problems.\n\n**Symptoms in Males**\n\nIn males, symptoms of fragile X syndrome may include:\n\n* Intellectual disability\n* Delayed speech development\n* Behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\n* Physical characteristics such as a long face, prominent jaw, and large ears\n\n**Symptoms in Females**\n\nIn females, symptoms of fragile X syndrome may be less severe and may include:\n\n* Mild intellectual disability\n* Shyness or social anxiety\n* Behavioral problems such as ADHD and ASD\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nFragile X syndrome can be diagnosed through genetic testing, which involves analyzing the DNA of an individual to detect the mutation on the X chromosome.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for fragile X syndrome. Instead, training and education have been developed to help affected children function at the highest possible level. Clinical trials are ongoing and looking at several possible medicines for treating fragile X syndrome.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with Fragile X condition and their families can be found at:\n\n* National Fragile X Foundation -- fragilex.org\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the person does depends on the amount of intellectual disability.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications vary, depending on the type and severity of symptoms. They may include:\n\n* Recurrent ear infections in children\n* Seizure disorder\n* Fragile X syndrome can be a cause of autism or related disorders, although not all children with fragile X syndrome have these conditions.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling may be helpful if you have a family history of this syndrome.
