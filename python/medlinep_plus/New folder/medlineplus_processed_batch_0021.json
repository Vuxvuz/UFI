    "content": "**Back Pain and Sports**\n\nGetting plenty of exercise and playing sports is good for overall health. It also adds pleasure and a sense of well-being.\n\nAlmost any sport places some stress on your spine. That is why it's important to keep the muscles and ligaments that support your spine flexible and strong. A healthy spine can help prevent many sports injuries.\n\n**Strengthening Exercises**\n\nGetting these muscles to the point where they support your spine well is called core strengthening. Ask your health care provider or physical therapist about these strengthening exercises.\n\nIf you had a back injury, talk with your provider about keeping your back safe when you return to sports.\n\n**Bicycling and Back Pain**\n\nAlthough bicycling strengthens the muscles of your legs, it does not do much for the muscles around your spine. Bending your lower spine forward while arching your upper back for long periods can strain your back and neck muscles. Mountain biking on uneven surfaces can cause jarring and sudden compressions (squeezing) on the spine.\n\nTips to help make bicycling easier on your back include:\n\n* Avoid mountain biking.\n* Ride a bike that fits you properly. Staff at a good bike shop can help you get fitted.\n* Remember not only to push down on the pedals, but also to pull up on them.\n* Wear biking gloves and use a handlebar cover to reduce jarring in your upper body.\n* Put shock absorbers on the bike to absorb shock from the wheels.\n* A more upright bike can have less pressure on your lower back and neck.\n* Recumbent bikes place less stress on your back and neck.\n\n**Weightlifting and Back Pain**\n\nWeightlifting can put a lot of stress on the spine. This is particularly true for people who are middle-aged and older because their spinal disks may dry out and become thinner and more brittle with age. Disks are the \"cushions\" between the bones (vertebrae) of your spine.\n\nAlong with muscle and ligament injuries, weightlifters are also at risk for a type of stress fracture in the back called spondylolysis.\n\nTo prevent injuries when weightlifting:\n\n* Do some aerobic exercise and stretch well before lifting to warm up your muscles.\n* Use training machines rather than free weights. These machines place less stress on your spine and do not require a spotter. Training machines are also easier to learn how to use compared to free weights.\n* Do more repetitions instead of adding more weight when you are trying to build strength.\n* Lift only as much as you can safely lift. Don't add too much weight.\n* Learn the proper lifting techniques from someone who is well trained. Technique is important.\n* Avoid certain weightlifting exercises that are more stressful on your spine. Some of these are squats, clean-and-jerks, snatches, and deadlifts.\n* Ask your provider or trainer whether a weightlifting belt would be helpful for you.\n\n**Golf and Back Pain**\n\nThe golf swing requires forceful rotation of your spine, and this puts stress on your spinal muscles, ligaments, joints, and disks.\n\nTips to take the stress off your back include:\n\n* Ask your physical therapist about the best posture and technique for your swing.\n* Warm up and stretch the muscles in your back and upper legs before starting a round.\n* Bend with your knees when picking up the golf ball.\n* Use a push cart (trolley) to wheel your golf bag on the course. You can also drive a golf cart.\n\n**Running and Back Pain**\n\nThe disks and the small joints in the back are called facet joints. Running causes repeated jarring and compression on these areas of your lumbar spine.\n\nTips to help reduce the stress on your spine include:\n\n* Avoid running on concrete and uneven surfaces. Instead run on a padded track or soft, even grassy surfaces.\n* Wear high-quality running shoes with good cushioning. Replace them when they become worn.\n* Ask your physical therapist about the best running form and motion. Most experts suggest a forward motion, leading with your chest and keeping your head balanced over your chest.\n\n**Tennis and Back Pain**\n\nMotions that place stress on your spine while playing tennis include overextending (arching) your back when serving, constant stopping and starting motions, and forceful twisting of your spine when taking shots.\n\nA tennis coach or your physical therapist can show you different techniques that can help reduce the stress on your back. For example:\n\n* Bending your knees.\n* Keeping your abdominal muscles tighter will reduce stress on your spine. Ask about the best ways to serve to avoid overextending your lower back.\n\n**Skiing and Back Pain**\n\nBefore skiing again after a back injury, learn exercises that strengthen the core muscles deep inside your spine and pelvis. A physical therapist may also help you to build strength and flexibility in the muscles that you use when you twist and turn while skiing.\n\nBefore you start skiing, warm up and stretch the muscles in your legs and lower back. Make sure you only ski down slopes that match your skill level.\n\n**Swimming and Back Pain**\n\nAlthough swimming can strengthen the muscles and ligaments in your spine and legs, it can also stress your spine by:\n\n* Keeping your lower back extended (arched) when doing strokes on your stomach, such as the crawl or the breaststroke\n* Turning your neck back every time you take a breath\n\nSwimming on your side or back can avoid these movements. Using a snorkel and mask may help decrease the neck turning when you breathe.\n\nProper technique when swimming is also important. This includes keeping your body level in the water, tightening your abdominal muscles somewhat, and keeping your head on the surface of the water and not holding it in a lifted position.\n\n---\n\n**Back Pain and Sports**\n\nPlaying sports can be great for overall health, but it also adds stress on our spines. That's why keeping the muscles and ligaments that support our spine flexible and strong is crucial in preventing many sports injuries.\n\n**Core Strengthening**\n\nGetting these muscles to the point where they support our spine well is called core strengthening. It's essential to ask your health care provider or physical therapist about these strengthening exercises.\n\n**Bicycling**\n\nAlthough bicycling strengthens the muscles of our legs, it doesn't do much for the muscles around our spine.

    "content": "**Bacteria Culture Test**\n\nA bacteria culture test can determine if you have a bacterial infection and, if so, which type of bacteria is causing it. To do a bacterial culture test, you will need to give a sample of your blood, urine, skin, or other tissue. The type of sample depends on where the infection is located.\n\n**What are Bacteria?**\n\nBacteria are one-celled organisms that live just about everywhere in your body and on your skin. There are many different kinds of bacteria, some of which are harmless or even helpful, while others can cause infections and disease.\n\n**How Does a Bacteria Culture Test Work?**\n\nYour sample will be sent to a lab where the bacteria cells will be put in a dish with a special substance that allows bacteria to grow. It normally takes one to two days to grow enough bacteria for the test, but some types of bacteria may take several days or longer.\n\n**Types of Bacteria Culture Tests**\n\n*   **Throat Culture**: Used to diagnose or rule out strep throat.\n*   **Urine Culture**: Used to diagnose a urinary tract infection and identify the bacteria causing the infection.\n*   **Sputum Culture**: Used to help diagnose bacterial or fungal infections in your respiratory tract, such as bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and histoplasmosis.\n*   **Blood Culture**: Used to look for bacterial or fungal infections in your blood.\n*   **Stool Culture**: Used to detect bacterial infections in your digestive system, including food poisoning.\n*   **Wound Culture**: Used to find infections in open wounds or on burn injuries.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nYour provider may order a bacteria culture test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. The symptoms vary depending on the type of infection.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf harmful bacteria are found in your sample, it usually means you have a bacterial infection. The test should also identify what type of bacteria is causing the infection. Your provider may order more tests to confirm the diagnosis or to see how serious the infection is.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Should Know About a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nIf your results show you don't have a bacterial infection, you should not take antibiotic medicines. Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics when you don't need them won't help you feel better and may lead to a serious problem known as antibiotic resistance.\n\n---\n\n**Bacteria Culture Test**\n\nA bacteria culture test is used to help diagnose certain types of infections.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\n* To diagnose or rule out strep throat\n* To diagnose a urinary tract infection and identify the bacteria causing the infection\n* To help diagnose bacterial or fungal infections in your respiratory tract, such as bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and histoplasmosis\n* To look for bacterial or fungal infections in your blood\n* To detect bacterial infections in your digestive system, including food poisoning\n\n**Test Procedures:**\n\n* Throat Culture:\n\t+ Your provider uses a special swab to take a sample from the back of your throat and tonsils.\n* Urine Culture:\n\t+ You provide a sterile urine sample in a container, following special instructions.\n* Sputum Culture:\n\t+ You provide a sputum sample, usually by coughing it up into a special cup. In certain cases, you may need to have a bronchoscopy to get a sample.\n* Blood Culture:\n\t+ A health care professional takes a blood sample, usually from a vein in your arm.\n* Stool Culture:\n\t+ You provide a sample of your feces in a clean container.\n* Wound Culture:\n\t+ A health care professional uses a special swab to collect a sample of cells or pus from your wound.\n\n**Why do I need a bacteria culture test?**\n\nYour provider may order a bacteria culture test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. The symptoms vary depending on the type of infection.\n\n**Why do I have to wait so long for my results?**\n\nBacteria culture tests require a large number of cells to accurately identify what type of bacteria may be causing an infection. Most test samples don't include enough cells for that. So, your sample is sent to a lab and put in a dish with a special substance that allows bacteria cells to grow until there are enough to test.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are many different types of bacteria culture tests. Ask your provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere are no known risks to having a swab or blood test or to providing a urine, sputum, wound, or stool sample.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf harmful bacteria are found in your sample, it usually means you have a bacterial infection. The test should also identify what type of bacteria is causing the infection. Your provider may order more tests to confirm the diagnosis or to see how serious the infection is.\n\nYour provider may also order a test to determine which medicine will best treat the type of bacteria causing your infection. This test is called an antibiotic sensitivity test or a susceptibility test.\n\n**Is there anything else I should know about a bacteria culture test?**\n\nIf your results show you don't have a bacterial infection, you should not take antibiotic medicines. Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics when you don't need them won't help you feel better and may lead to a serious problem known as antibiotic resistance.\n\nAntibiotic resistance allows harmful bacteria to change in a way that makes antibiotics less effective or not effective at all. Resistant bacteria may continue to grow and multiply, making infections difficult and sometimes impossible to treat. These infections can spread to other people.\n\n---\n\n**Bacteria Culture Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nA bacteria culture test, also known as a bacterial culture test, is a laboratory test used to diagnose bacterial infections by growing the bacteria in a controlled environment. This type of test is essential for identifying the specific type of bacteria causing an infection and determining the most effective treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does a Bacteria Culture Test Work?**\n\nDuring a bacteria culture test, a healthcare provider collects a sample from the infected area, such as a wound or respiratory tract, and sends it to a laboratory for analysis. The laboratory then uses specialized media to grow the bacteria, which can take anywhere from 24 hours to several days.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Benefits of a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nThe benefits of a bacteria culture test include:\n\n*   **Accurate diagnosis**: A bacteria culture test provides an accurate diagnosis of bacterial infections, allowing healthcare providers to develop effective treatment plans.\n*   **Identification of resistant bacteria**: This type of test can help identify bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, enabling healthcare providers to choose alternative treatments.\n*   **Prevention of antibiotic misuse**: By identifying the specific type of bacteria causing an infection, healthcare providers can avoid prescribing unnecessary or ineffective antibiotics.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Risks Associated with a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nThe risks associated with a bacteria culture test include:\n\n*   **Delayed results**: The process of growing bacteria in a laboratory setting can take several days, delaying treatment and potentially allowing infections to worsen.\n*   **Misidentification of bacteria**: If the laboratory incorrectly identifies the type of bacteria, it may lead to inappropriate treatment or delayed diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Prepare for a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nTo prepare for a bacteria culture test, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Consult with your healthcare provider**: Discuss any concerns or questions you have about the test with your healthcare provider.\n2.  **Follow proper hygiene practices**: Ensure good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of infection and contamination of the sample.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens After a Bacteria Culture Test?**\n\nAfter a bacteria culture test, your healthcare provider will:\n\n1.  **Analyze the results**: Review the laboratory findings to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection.\n2.  **Develop a treatment plan**: Based on the test results, your healthcare provider will create an effective treatment plan to address the bacterial infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Antibiotics\n*   Bacterial Infections",

    "content": "**Bacterial Infections**\n\n**What are bacteria?**\n\nBacteria are tiny organisms (living things) that have only one cell. Under a microscope, they look like balls, rods, or spirals. They can be found almost everywhere on Earth. There are lots of bacteria in and on your body. In fact, your body has about 10 times more bacteria cells than human cells.\n\nThere are many different types of bacteria. Most types don't make you sick. Some types are helpful. For example, \"good\" bacteria in your digestive system can help your body digest food and absorb vitamins and minerals. They can help protect you from getting sick. Bacteria are also used in making foods like yogurt and cheese.\n\nBut some types of bacteria can cause an infection and make you sick. They are called infectious bacteria. These bacteria can reproduce quickly in your body. Many of them give off toxins (poisons) that can damage your cells and make you sick. Other types can move into and damage your tissues. A few examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and E. coli.\n\n**How do bacterial infections spread?**\n\nThere are different ways that bacterial infections may spread:\n\n* Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes.\n* By touching surfaces or objects that have the bacteria on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\n* Through cuts, scrapes, and skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.\n* From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy.\n* Through contaminated food or water.\n* By being bitten by an infected insect or animal.\n* Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal, and oral sex) with someone who has the infection.\n\n**What are the treatments for bacterial infections?**\n\nSometimes your immune system may be able to fight off a bacterial infection. But when you do need treatment, it will be with antibiotics.\n\nWhen you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Each time you take them, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant to the effects of the antibiotics. This is called antibiotic resistance. When this happens, the bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. They can cause resistant infections, which can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.\n\n**Can bacterial infections be prevented?**\n\nYou can help prevent some bacterial infections by:\n\n* Getting vaccines that protect against bacterial infections.\n* Having good hygiene habits. These include washing your hands often and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\n* Paying attention to food safety.\n* Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch.\n* Preventing insect bites by using a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. If you travel to an area that has a high risk of diseases from insect bites, also wear long pants, shirts, and socks.\n* Practicing safe sex. This means using a latex condom every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\n* Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Tests\n* Bacteria Culture Test\n* Calprotectin Stool Test\n* Gram Stain\n* Immunoglobulins Blood Test\n* Meningococcal Disease Tests\n* PCR Tests\n* Procalcitonin Test\n* Protein Electrophoresis by Immunofixation Blood Test\n* Rapid Tests\n* Respiratory Pathogens Panel\n* Sputum Culture\n* White Blood Cell (WBC) in Stool\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n* Germs and Hygiene: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n* Infection Control: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* Antibiotics: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Antibiotic Resistance: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n* Bacterial vs. Viral Infections: How Do They Differ?\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* About Brucellosis\n* About Elizabethkingia\n* About Leptospirosis\n* About Melioidosis\n* About Necrotizing Fasciitis\n* About Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n* About Q Fever\n* About Vibrio Infection\n\n**Images**\n\n* Hot Tub Rash (Pseudomonas Folliculitis)\n\n---\n\n**Bacterial Infections**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are Bacteria?**\n\nBacteria are tiny organisms (living things) that have only one cell.

    "content": "**Bacterial Vaginosis Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA bacterial vaginosis (BV) test checks a sample of vaginal discharge for signs of a bacterial infection in the vagina.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe test looks for harmful bacteria that can grow when the normal balance of good and bad bacteria in the vagina is upset. A healthy vagina contains a balance of both \"good\" (healthy) and \"harmful\" (unhealthy) bacteria. Normally, the good bacteria keep the harmful type under control.\n\n**Why do I need a BV test?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have symptoms of BV, such as:\n\n* An unusual vaginal discharge that can be gray or white\n* A strong, fish-like odor, especially after sex\n* Pain and/or itching in the vagina\n* Itching around the outside of the vagina\n* Burning feeling when urinating (peeing)\n\nYou may also need a test if you have a female sex partner who has BV or symptoms that could be BV.\n\n**What happens during a BV test?**\n\nA BV test is done much like a pelvic exam:\n\n1. You'll take off your clothes below your waist and wear a gown or use a sheet as a cover.\n2. You'll lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups.\n3. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to gently widen your vagina so the cervix can be seen.\n4. Your provider will use a cotton swab or wooden stick to collect a sample of your vaginal discharge.\n5. Your provider may examine the sample or send it to a lab for testing.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nWith a BV test from your provider, you may feel some mild discomfort when the speculum is put in your vagina.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAbnormal results from a vaginal smear or a whiff test mean that you have a bacterial infection. The results of a vaginal pH test will be a number that shows how acidic your vagina is. A pH over 4.5 is high, which means you're more likely to have BV.\n\n**What happens next?**\n\nIf your results show you have a BV infection, your provider will probably prescribe antibiotic pills and/or antibiotic creams or gels that you put in your vagina. Medicines that treat BV are safe to use during pregnancy.\n\nSometimes a BV infection will come back after successful treatment. If this happens, your provider may prescribe different medicine or a different dose of the medicine you took before.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BV test?**\n\nBV is not spread through sex between female and male partners. So, if you're diagnosed with BV and have a male sex partner, he will not need to be tested. But the infection can be spread between female sex partners. If you have an infection and your partner is female, she should get a BV test.\n\nResearchers aren't sure how BV spreads, but there are steps you can take that may lower your risk of infection:\n\n* Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex\n* Don't use douches\n* Use condoms every time you have sex\n\n---\n\n**Bacterial Vaginosis Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA bacterial vaginosis (BV) test checks for signs of a bacterial infection in the vagina.\n\n**Why do I need a BV test?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have symptoms of BV, such as:\n\n* An unusual vaginal discharge that can be gray or white, foamy, or watery\n* A strong, fish-like odor, especially after sex\n* Pain and/or itching in the vagina\n* Itching around the outside of the vagina\n* Burning feeling when urinating (peeing)\n\nYou may also need a test if you have a female sex partner who has BV or symptoms that could be BV.\n\n**What happens during a BV test?**\n\nA BV test is done much like a pelvic exam:\n\n1.

Your provider will use a cotton swab or wooden stick to collect a sample of your vaginal discharge.\n5. Your provider may examine the sample or send it to a lab for testing.\n\nAt-home test kits are available to test for the bacteria that cause BV. The kits include everything you need to collect a sample of vaginal fluid and send it to a lab for testing. To get proper care, share your results with your provider.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFollow the instructions your provider gives you to prepare for this test. For 24 hours before your test, you'll usually need to avoid:\n\n* Using tampons\n* Douching (rinsing the vagina with water or other fluid)\n* Using creams or medicines in the vagina\n* Having vaginal sex\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nWith a BV test from your provider, you may feel some mild discomfort when the speculum is put in your vagina.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAbnormal results from a vaginal smear or a whiff test mean that you have a bacterial infection.\n\nThe results of a vaginal pH test will be a number that shows how acidic your vagina is. A pH over 4.5 is high, which means you're more likely to have BV. But a pH test can't diagnose BV.\n\nIf your results show you have a BV infection, your provider will probably prescribe antibiotic pills and/or antibiotic creams or gels that you put in your vagina. Medicines that treat BV are safe to use during pregnancy.\n\nSometimes a BV infection will come back after successful treatment. If this happens, your provider may prescribe different medicine or a different dose of the medicine you took before.\n\nThere are no over-the-counter treatments for BV. Treatments for vaginal yeast infections will not help BV and could make your symptoms worse. So, don't try to treat an infection yourself.\n\nIf your results show you don't have BV, your provider may do more tests to find the cause of your symptoms.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BV test?**\n\nBV is not spread through sex between female and male partners. So, if you're diagnosed with BV and have a male sex partner, he will not need to be tested. But the infection can be spread between female sex partners. If you have an infection and your partner is female, she should get a BV test.\n\n---\n\n**How BV Spreads and How to Lower Your Risk**\n\nBV can be spread between female sex partners, so if you have an infection and your partner is female, she should get a BV test. Researchers aren't sure how BV spreads, but there are steps you can take that may lower your risk of infection:\n\n*   Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex\n*   Don't use douches\n*   Use condoms every time you have sex",

    "content": "**Bad Breath**\n\nAlso called: Halitosis\n\n**Basics**\n\nThere are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth, or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic, or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad smell. Some diseases and medicines can cause a specific breath odor.\n\n**Having Good Dental Habits**\n\nHaving good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher.

    "content": "**Baker Cyst**\n\nA Baker cyst is a buildup of joint fluid (synovial fluid) that forms a swelling behind the knee.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA Baker cyst is caused by swelling in the knee. The swelling occurs due to an increase in synovial fluid. This fluid lubricates the knee joint. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee.\n\nBaker cyst commonly occurs with:\n\n* A tear in the meniscal cartilage of the knee\n* Cartilage injuries\n* Knee arthritis (in older adults)\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Other knee problems that cause knee swelling and synovitis (inflammation of the joint)\n* Gout\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn most cases, a person may have no symptoms. A large cyst may cause some discomfort or stiffness. There may be a painless or painful swelling behind the knee.\n\nThe cyst may feel like a water-filled balloon. Sometimes, the cyst may break open (rupture), causing pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf.\n\nIt is important to know whether pain or swelling is caused by a Baker cyst or a blood clot. A blood clot (deep venous thrombosis) can also cause pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf. A blood clot may be dangerous and requires medical attention right away.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring a physical exam, the health care provider will look for a soft lump in the back of the knee. If the cyst is small, comparing the affected knee to the normal knee can be helpful. There may be a decrease in range of motion caused by pain or by the size of the cyst. In some cases, there will be catching, locking, pain, or other signs and symptoms of a meniscal tear.\n\nShining a light through the cyst (transillumination) can show that the growth is fluid filled.\n\nX-rays will not show the cyst or a meniscal tear, but they will show other problems that may be present, including arthritis.\n\nMRIs can help the provider see the cyst and look for any meniscal injury or other problems that caused the cyst.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nOften, no treatment is needed. The provider can watch the cyst over time.\n\nIf the cyst is painful, the goal of treatment is to correct the problem that is causing the cyst. Sometimes, a steroid injection to the knee can help reduce the swelling.\n\nSometimes, a cyst can be drained (aspirated), however, the cyst often returns. In rare cases, it is removed with surgery if it becomes very large or causes symptoms. The cyst has a high chance of returning if the underlying cause is not addressed. The surgery may also damage nearby blood vessels and nerves.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nA Baker cyst will not cause any long-term harm, but it can be annoying and painful. The symptoms of Baker cysts often come and go.\n\nLong-term disability is rare. Most people improve with time or with surgery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have swelling behind the knee that becomes large or painful. Pain could be a sign of infection. Also contact your provider when you have increased swelling in your calf and leg and shortness of breath. This can be a sign of blood clots.\n\nIf the lump grows quickly, or you have night pain, severe pain, or fever, you will need more tests to make sure you do not have other types of tumors.\n\n---\n\n**Baker Cyst**\n\nA Baker cyst is a buildup of joint fluid (synovial fluid) that forms a swelling behind the knee.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A tear in the meniscal cartilage of the knee\n*   Cartilage injuries\n*   Knee arthritis (in older adults)\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Other knee problems that cause knee swelling and synovitis (inflammation of the joint)\n*   Gout\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   In most cases, a person may have no symptoms.\n*   A large cyst may cause some discomfort or stiffness.\n*   There may be a painless or painful swelling behind the knee.\n*   The cyst may feel like a water-filled balloon.\n*   Sometimes, the cyst may break open (rupture), causing pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   During a physical exam, the health care provider will look for a soft lump in the back of the knee.\n*   If the cyst is small, comparing the affected knee to the normal knee can be helpful.\n*   There may be a decrease in range of motion caused by pain or by the size of the cyst.\n*   In some cases, there will be catching, locking, pain, or other signs and symptoms of a meniscal tear.\n*   Shining a light through the cyst (transillumination) can show that the growth is fluid filled.\n*   X-rays will not show the cyst or a meniscal tear, but they will show other problems that may be present, including arthritis.\n*   MRIs can help the provider see the cyst and look for any meniscal injury or other problems that caused the cyst.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Often, no treatment is needed.

    "content": "**Balance Problems**\n\nHave you ever felt dizzy, lightheaded, or as if the room is spinning around you? If the feeling happens often, it could be a sign of a balance problem. Balance problems can make you feel unsteady. You may also have blurred vision, confusion, and disorientation. They are one cause of falls and fall-related injuries, such as a hip fracture (broken hip).\n\n**Causes**\n\nSome balance problems are due to problems in the inner ear. Others may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. Aging, infections, head injury, certain medicines, or problems with blood circulation may also cause balance problems.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nIt is important to see your doctor about balance problems. They can be a sign of other health problems, such as an ear infection or a stroke. Your doctor may send you to a specialist for a diagnosis. You may need a hearing test, blood tests, or imaging studies of your head and brain. Other possible tests look at your eye movements, and how your body responds to movement.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn some cases, treating the illness that is causing the disorder will help with the balance problem. Exercises, a change in diet, and some medicines also can help.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   **Balance Disorders**: Learn more about balance disorders from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.\n*   **Symptoms of a Vestibular Disorder**: Understand the symptoms of a vestibular disorder from the Vestibular Disorders Association.\n*   **Dealing with Dizziness**: Get help for a balance disorder from the National Institutes of Health.\n*   **Improving Balance with Tai Chi**: Improve your balance with tai chi from the Vestibular Disorders Association.\n\n---\n\n**Balance Problems**\n\n**Living With**\n\n*   Dealing with dizziness: Getting help for a balance disorder  (National Institutes of Health)\n*   Improving balance with tai chi (Vestibular Disorders Association) - PDF\n*   Living with a vestibular disorder (Vestibular Disorders Association)\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   Walking (gait) difficulties (National Multiple Sclerosis Society)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n*   Statistics about hearing, balance, ear infections, and deafness  (National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Balance problems  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n    *   Article: Contextual and placebo effects of suboccipital myofascial release: evaluating its influence... \n    *   Article: The effects of series elastic stiffness and cutaneous sensitivity on leg... \n    *   Article: Cervical proprioception and dysphagia severity in multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional clinical... \n\n**Reference Desk**\n\n*   NIDCD Glossary  (National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders)\n*   Types of vestibular disorders (Vestibular Disorders Association)\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\n\n**Children**\n\n*   Balance disorders (for parents) (Nemours Foundation)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n\n**Older Adults**\n\n*   Balance & aging (Vestibular Disorders Association) - PDF\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   Dizziness (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Vertigo-associated disorders (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Dizziness and vertigo\n*   Falls\n*   Walking problems",

A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady or dizzy. Dizziness means different things to different people. It can include:\n\n* Vertigo, a feeling that you or everything around you is spinning\n* Feeling as if you're going to fall\n* Feeling lightheaded or as if you are going to faint\n\nBalance disorders can be mild or so severe that you may have trouble walking, climbing stairs, or doing other daily activities. They can happen at any age, but they are more common in older people. Balance disorders are one of the main reasons that older adults tend to have more falls than younger people.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nBalance tests are used to help find the cause of balance problems, so you can get the right treatment to improve your balance and avoid falls. There are many types of balance disorders, including:\n\n* Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)\n* Labyrinthitis\n* Meniere's disease\n* Vestibular neuritis\n* Perilymph fistula\n* Mal de Debarquement syndrome (MdDS)\n\n**Why do I need a balance test?**\n\nYou may need balance tests if you have symptoms of a balance disorder. Symptoms include:\n\n* Dizziness\n* Vertigo (a spinning feeling)\n* Falling or feeling as if you are going to fall\n* Staggering when you walk\n* Feeling lightheaded, like you are going to faint, or a floating sensation\n* Blurred vision\n* Confusion\n\nOther symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and anxiety.\n\n**What happens during a balance test?**\n\nBalance disorders can be difficult to diagnose. If you have symptoms of a problem, your provider may suggest that you see a specialist in disorders of the ear. These include:\n\n* An audiologist, a health care provider who is trained to diagnose hearing loss and balance disorders.\n* An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the ears, nose, throat, and head and neck.\n\nYou may need several tests to help find out if you have a disorder in your inner ear. Common tests include:\n\n* Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) tests\n* Rotary test, also called a rotary chair test\n* Posturography, also known as computerized dynamic posturography (CDP)\n* Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) tests\n* Dix-Hallpike maneuver\n\nThese tests can help find out whether a balance disorder is caused by a problem with your inner ear, eyes, or nerve signals from your feet and legs.\n\n---\n\n**Balance Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are Balance Tests?**\n\nBalance tests are a group of tests that check for balance disorders.

It's best to wear loose, comfortable clothes. Depending on the test, you may need to avoid certain foods or medicines before your test. But don't stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Any Risks to Balance Tests?**\n\nCertain tests may make you feel dizzy or sick to your stomach. But these feelings usually go away in a few minutes. You may want to plan to have someone bring you home in case the dizziness lasts longer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your results show that you may have a balance disorder, your provider may order more tests and/or start treatment. Treatment depends on the type of disorder you have. For example:\n\n*   For benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), your provider may move your head in different positions to move calcium grains in your inner ear back where they belong.\n*   For Meniere's disease, your provider may suggest diet and lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and quitting smoking. Medicines may also help.\n\nIf your balance problems are from medicine or a condition that's not in your inner ear, changing medicine or treating the condition may help.\n\nIf treatment doesn't help enough, balance retraining therapy, also called vestibular rehabilitation, may help you learn to cope with your symptoms and reduce your risk of falling.\n\n---\n\n**Balance Tests: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/5)**\n\nYou may need balance tests if you have symptoms of a balance disorder.

It uses a balloon attached to a catheter that's inserted into an artery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **How Does it Work?**\n\t+ The balloon is inflated at the place where deposits of plaque have closed off or narrowed the channel for blood flow.\n\t+ If the blockage is not major, it may be possible to correct the problem by inflating the balloon several times. This will compact the plaque against the wall, widening the passage and letting blood flow through.\n\t+ A tubular device called a stent is commonly placed in the artery to act like a scaffold inside the artery and keep the blood vessel open.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review Date**\n\n8/5/2024\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Updated by**\n\nThomas S.

    "content": "**Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\nBannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a large head size (macrocephaly), multiple noncancerous tumors and tumor-like growths called hamartomas, and dark freckles on the penis in males. The signs and symptoms of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are present from birth or become apparent in early childhood.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* At least half of affected infants have macrocephaly, and many also have a high birth weight and a large body size (macrosomia).\n* Growth usually slows during childhood, so affected adults are of normal height and body size.\n* About half of all children with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome have intellectual disability or delayed development, particularly the development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. These delays may improve with age.\n* About half of all people with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome develop hamartomas in their intestines, known as hamartomatous polyps.\n* Other noncancerous growths often associated with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome include fatty tumors called lipomas and angiolipomas that develop under the skin.\n* Some affected individuals also develop hemangiomas, which are red or purplish growths that consist of tangles of abnormal blood vessels.\n\n**Other Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and other muscle abnormalities\n* Seizures\n* Thyroid problems, such as an enlargement of the thyroid gland, known as multinodular goiter, or a condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis\n* Skeletal abnormalities, including an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum)\n\n**Relationship to Cowden Syndrome**\n\nThe features of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome overlap with those of another disorder called Cowden syndrome. People with Cowden syndrome develop hamartomas and other noncancerous growths; they also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. Both conditions can be caused by mutations in the PTEN gene. Some people with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome have had relatives diagnosed with Cowden syndrome, and other individuals have had the characteristic features of both conditions. Based on these similarities, researchers have proposed that Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and Cowden syndrome represent a spectrum of overlapping features known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome instead of two distinct conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome may have a large head size (macrocephaly), multiple noncancerous tumors and tumor-like growths called hamartomas, and dark freckles on the penis in males.

Both conditions can be caused by mutations in the PTEN gene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is unknown, although it appears to be rare. Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers suspect that the disorder is underdiagnosed because its signs and symptoms vary and some of them are subtle.\n\n---\n\n**Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome**\n\n**What is Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome?**\n\nBannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple hamartomas, which are benign growths that can occur in various parts of the body. The syndrome was first described in 1994 and has since been recognized as a distinct entity.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from mutations or deletions of the PTEN gene. About 60 percent of all cases of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome result from mutations in the PTEN gene. Another 10 percent of cases are caused by a large deletion of genetic material that includes part or all of this gene.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome can vary widely, but they often include:\n\n* Macrocephaly (enlarged head)\n* Developmental delay\n* Muscle and skeletal abnormalities\n* Hamartomas in various parts of the body\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nBannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nThe condition has been referred to by several other names, including:\n\n* Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome\n* Bannayan-Zonana syndrome\n* BRRS\n* BZS\n* Myhre-Riley-Smith syndrome\n* Riley-Smith syndrome\n* Ruvalcaba-Myhre syndrome\n* Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith syndrome\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\nGenetic testing can be performed to detect mutations in the PTEN gene. The Genetic Testing Registry provides information on genetic tests available for Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information and resources, please visit:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome:\n\n* Blumenthal GM, Dennis PA.

These mutations can be inherited from one's parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome include:\n\n* Multiple hamartomas, which are benign tumors that can occur in various parts of the body\n* Macrocephaly, or an abnormally large head circumference\n* Developmental disabilities, such as delayed speech and language development\n* Increased risk of certain types of cancer, including breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can detect mutations in the PTEN gene. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, may also be used to visualize the hamartomas.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, but treatment and management strategies can help reduce the risk of complications and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* Regular screening for cancer\n* Surveillance for hamartomas\n* Management of developmental disabilities through early intervention and therapy\n* Genetic counseling to inform family planning decisions\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is generally good, especially if detected and managed early. However, the risk of cancer and other complications remains a concern.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nBannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. This means that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Benign Tumors\n* Developmental Disabilities\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Medical Tests**\n\n* PTEN Genetic Test",

    "content": "**Barbiturate Intoxication and Overdose**\n\nBarbiturates are medicines that cause relaxation and sleepiness. A barbiturate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. An overdose is life threatening.\n\nAt fairly low doses, barbiturates may make you seem drunk or intoxicated.\n\nBarbiturates are addictive. People who use them become physically dependent on them. Stopping them suddenly (withdrawal) can be life-threatening. Tolerance to the mood-altering effects of barbiturates develops rapidly with repeated use. But, tolerance to the lethal effects develops more slowly, and the risk of severe poisoning increases with continued use.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBarbiturate use is a major addiction problem for many people. Most people who take these medicines for seizure disorders or pain syndromes do not abuse them, but those who do, usually start by using medicine that was prescribed for them or other family members.\n\nMost overdoses of this type of medicine involve a mixture of medicines, usually alcohol and barbiturates, or barbiturates and opioids such as heroin, oxycodone, or fentanyl.\n\nSome users take a combination of all these medicines. Those who use such combinations tend to be:\n\n*   New users who do not know these combinations can lead to coma or death\n*   Experienced users who use them on purpose to alter their consciousness\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of barbiturate intoxication and overdose include:\n\n*   Altered level of consciousness\n*   Difficulty in thinking\n*   Drowsiness or coma\n*   Faulty judgment\n*   Lack of coordination\n*   Shallow breathing\n*   Slow, slurred speech\n*   Sluggishness\n*   Staggering, difficulty with balance\n\nExcessive and long-term use of barbiturates, such as phenobarbital, may produce the following chronic symptoms:\n\n*   Changes in alertness\n*   Decreased functioning\n*   Irritability\n*   Memory loss\n\n---\n\n**Barbiturate Intoxication and Overdose**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Barbiturate use is a major addiction problem for many people.\n*   Most overdoses of this type of medicine involve a mixture of medicines, usually alcohol and barbiturates, or barbiturates and opioids such as heroin, oxycodone, or fentanyl.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Altered level of consciousness\n*   Difficulty in thinking\n*   Drowsiness or coma\n*   Faulty judgment\n*   Lack of coordination\n*   Shallow breathing\n*   Slow, slurred speech\n*   Sluggishness\n*   Staggering, difficulty with balance\n\n**Excessive and Long-term Use**\n\n*   Changes in alertness\n*   Decreased functioning\n*   Irritability\n*   Memory loss\n\n---\n\n**Barbiturate Intoxication and Overdose**\n\n**Symptoms of Barbiturate Intoxication and Overdose**\n\n* allow breathing\n* Slow, slurred speech\n* Sluggishness\n* Staggering, difficulty with balance\n\n**Chronic Symptoms of Excessive and Long-term Use**\n\n* Changes in alertness\n* Decreased functioning\n* Irritability\n* Memory loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Tests that may be done include:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAt the hospital, emergency treatment may include:\n\n* Activated charcoal by mouth or a tube through the nose into the stomach\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Fluids through a vein (IV)\n* Medicine to treat symptoms\n\nA medicine called naloxone (Narcan) may be given if an opioid was part of the mix. This medicine often rapidly restores consciousness and breathing in people with an opioid overdose, but its action is short-lived, and may need to be given repeatedly.\n\nThere is no direct antidote for barbiturates. An antidote is a medicine that reverses the effects of another medicine or drug.\n\nIn select and extreme cases of overdose, dialysis (kidney machine) may be used to help remove the medicine from the blood.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAbout 1 in 10 people who overdose on barbiturates or a mixture that contains barbiturates will die. They usually die from heart and lung problems.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of an overdose include:\n\n* Coma\n* Death\n* Head injury and concussion from falls when intoxicated\n* Miscarriage in pregnant women or damage to the developing baby in the womb\n* Neck and spinal injury and paralysis from falls when intoxicated\n* Pneumonia from depressed gag reflex and aspiration (fluid or food down the bronchial tubes into the lungs)\n* Severe muscle damage from lying on a hard surface while unconscious, which may lead to permanent kidney injury\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall your local emergency number, such as 911, if someone has taken barbiturates and seems extremely tired or has breathing problems.\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nIntoxication - barbiturates\n\n**References**\n\nAronson JK. Barbiturates. In: Aronson JK, ed.

    "content": "**Barium Sulfate**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBarium sulfate is used to help doctors examine the esophagus (tube that connects the mouth and stomach), stomach, and intestine using x-rays or computed tomography (CAT scan, CT scan; a type of body scan that uses a computer to put together x-ray images to create cross-sectional or three dimensional pictures of the inside of the body). Barium sulfate is in a class of medications called radiopaque contrast media. It works by coating the esophagus, stomach, or intestine with a material that is not absorbed into the body so that diseased or damaged areas can be clearly seen by x-ray examination or CT scan.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBarium sulfate comes as a powder to be mixed with water, a suspension (liquid), a paste, and a tablet. The powder and water mixture and the suspension may be taken by mouth or may be given as an enema (liquid that is instilled into the rectum), and the paste and tablet are taken by mouth. Barium sulfate is usually taken one or more times before an x-ray examination or CT scan.\n\nIf you are using a barium sulfate enema, the enema will be administered by medical staff at the testing center. If you are taking barium sulfate by mouth, you may be given the medication after you arrive at the testing center or you may be given the medication to take at home at specific times the night before and/or the day of your test. If you are taking barium sulfate at home, take it exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or at different times than directed.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. If you are given a powder to mix with water and take at home, be sure that you are also given directions for mixing and that you understand these directions. Ask your doctor or the staff at the testing center if you have any questions about mixing your medication.\n\nYou will be given specific directions to follow before and after your test. You may be told to drink only clear liquids after a certain time the day before your test, not to eat or drink after a specific time, and/or to use laxatives or enemas before your test. You may also be told to use laxatives to clear the barium sulfate from your body after your test. Be sure that you understand these directions and follow them carefully.

Also tell your doctor if your infant or young child has any condition that affects his or her esophagus, stomach, or intestine, or has had surgery involving the intestines. Your doctor may tell you or your child not to take barium sulfate.\n\nTell your doctor if you have recently had any type of surgery, especially surgery involving the colon (large intestine) or rectum, if you have had a colostomy (surgery to create an opening for waste to leave the body through the abdomen), intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; high pressure in the skull that may cause headaches, vision loss, and other symptoms), or if you have ever aspirated food (inhaled food into the lungs). Also tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had allergies and if you have or have ever had asthma; hay fever (allergy to pollen, dust, or other substances in the air); hives; eczema (red, itchy skin rash caused by allergy or sensitivity to substances in the environment); constipation; cystic fibrosis (inherited condition in which the body produces thick, sticky mucus that can interfere with breathing and digestion); Hirschsprung's disease (inherited condition in which the intestines do not work normally); high blood pressure; or heart disease.\n\nTell your doctor if there is any chance that you are pregnant, if you plan to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. The radiation used in x-rays and CT scans may harm the fetus.\n\n---\n\n**Barium Sulfate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor or the staff at the testing center will tell you what you may eat and drink the day before your test.

    "content": "**Barium Swallow**\n\nA **barium swallow**, also called an **esophagogram**, is an imaging test that checks for problems in your upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Your upper GI tract includes your:\n\n*   Mouth\n*   Back of the throat\n*   Esophagus (the tube that carries food and liquids from your mouth to the stomach)\n*   Stomach\n*   Duodenum (first part of your small intestine)\n\nA **barium swallow test** involves drinking a chalky-tasting liquid that contains barium. Barium is a substance that coats your internal organs and tissues, so they can be seen more clearly on an x-ray. This can allow your health care provider to find problems and abnormal areas in your GI tract.\n\nThe test uses a special type of x-ray called **fluoroscopy**. Fluoroscopy shows internal organs moving in real time as a live video. It allows your provider to see how you swallow and how some of your other internal organs look. Fluoroscopy may be used to diagnose certain health conditions or to guide treatment procedures such as surgeries.\n\nOther names: **esophagogram**, **esophagram**, **upper GI series**, **swallowing study**, **esophagography**, **modified barium swallow study**, **video fluoroscopy swallow study**.\n\n---\n\n**Barium Swallow: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What is a barium swallow?**\n\nA barium swallow is used to see what happens when you swallow and to help diagnose conditions that affect the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. These conditions can include:\n\n* Ulcers\n* GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which contents of the stomach leak backward into the esophagus\n* Hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of your stomach pushes into the diaphragm (the muscle between your stomach and chest). A hiatal hernia can cause GERD.\n* Structural problems in the GI tract, such as polyps (abnormal growths) and diverticula (pouches in the intestinal wall)\n* Tumors\n\n**Why do I need a barium swallow?**\n\nYour provider may order this test to check how well an upper GI organ works. You may need this test if you have symptoms of an upper GI disorder, such as:\n\n* Trouble swallowing\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Vomiting\n* Bloating\n\n**What happens during a barium swallow?**\n\nA barium swallow is most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.\n\nA barium swallow usually includes the following steps:\n\n1. You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.\n2. You may be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area. This protects the area from unnecessary radiation.\n3. You will stand, sit, or lie down on an x-ray table. You may be asked to change positions during the test.\n4. The radiologist may take x-rays of your chest and belly first.\n5. You will swallow a drink that contains barium. The drink is thick and chalky. It's usually flavored with chocolate or strawberry to make it easier to swallow.\n6. While you swallow, the radiologist will watch images of the barium traveling down your throat to your upper GI tract.\n7. You may be asked to hold your breath at certain times.\n8. The images will be recorded so they can be reviewed later.\n\nThe procedure may take from 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. You will probably be asked to fast (not eat or drink) after midnight on the night before the test. You may be asked to avoid anything that might coat your throat, such as smoking, chewing gum, or sucking on hard candy.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nYou should not have this test if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to a developing baby.\n\nFor others, there is little risk to having this test. The radiation dose is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had recently. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.\n\nTell your provider if you have any known allergies to the barium used in the test.\n\nYour poop may look white for several days after the test as you pass the barium. You may have constipation if all of the barium doesn't pass out of your body after the procedure. Drinking lots of fluids and eating high-fiber foods may help. But if you continue to have constipation, contact your provider.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA normal result means that no abnormalities in size, shape, and movement were found in your upper GI tract.\n\nIf your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:\n\n* Hiatal hernia\n* Ulcers\n* Tumors\n* Polyps\n* Diverticula, a condition in which small sacs form in the inner wall of the intestine\n* Esophageal stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus that can make it hard to swallow\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests to understand the results of your barium swallow.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a barium swallow?**\n\nYour results may also show signs of esophageal cancer. If your provider thinks you may have it, they may do a procedure called an esophagoscopy. During an esophagoscopy, a thin, flexible tube is inserted through your mouth or nose and down into your esophagus. The tube has a video camera so a provider can view the area. The tube may also have a tool attached that can be used to remove tissue samples for testing (biopsy).\n\n---\n\n**Barium Swallow: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\nA barium swallow is a medical test that uses X-rays and a special liquid called barium to help diagnose problems in the esophagus, such as swallowing difficulties or narrowing of the esophagus. The test involves swallowing a small amount of barium, which coats the inside of the esophagus and can be seen on an X-ray.\n\n**How is a Barium Swallow Performed?**\n\nDuring a barium swallow, you will lie on your back on an X-ray table while a tube is inserted into your mouth. The tube has a video camera so that a provider can view the area. The tube may also have a tool attached that can be used to remove tissue samples for testing (biopsy).\n\n**References**\n\n* American College of Radiology\n* American Cancer Society\n* StatPearls\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* Mayo Clinic\n* Merck Manual Consumer Version\n* National Cancer Institute\n* RadiologyInfo.org\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Benign Tumors\n* Cancer\n* Esophageal Cancer\n* Esophagus Disorders\n* Hiatal Hernia\n* Peptic Ulcer\n* Stomach Disorders\n* Throat Disorders\n* X-Rays\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* Dysphagia Tests\n* Esophageal pH Test\n* Fluoroscopy\n* Gastric Emptying Tests\n* Helicobacter Pylori (H.

A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon. The technician or radiologist monitors the flow of the barium on an x-ray screen.\n* Sometimes a small amount of air is delivered into the colon to expand it. This allows for even clearer images. This test is called a double contrast barium enema.\n* You are asked to move into different positions. The table will move up and down to get different views. At certain times when the x-ray pictures are taken, you are told to hold your breath and be still for a few seconds so the images will not be blurry.\n* The enema tube is removed after the x-rays are taken.\n* You are then given a bedpan or helped to the toilet, so you can empty your bowels and remove as much of the barium as possible. Afterward, 1 or 2 more x-rays may be taken.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour bowels need to be completely empty for the exam. If they are not empty, the test may miss a problem in your large intestine.\n\nYou will be given instructions for cleansing your bowel using an enema or laxatives. This is also called bowel preparation. Follow the instructions exactly.\n\nFor 1 to 3 days before the test, you need to be on a clear liquid diet. Examples of clear liquids are:\n\n* Clear coffee or tea\n* Fat-free bouillon or broth\n* Gelatin\n* Sports drinks\n* Strained fruit juices\n* Water\n\n---\n\n**Barium Enema Test**\n\nThe barium enema test is a medical procedure used to diagnose problems in the large intestine, also known as the colon.\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, you will need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days. This means that you can only drink liquids that are clear, such as:\n\n* Clear coffee or tea\n* Fat-free bouillon or broth\n* Gelatin\n* Sports drinks\n* Strained fruit juices\n* Water\n\nYou will also be given instructions on how to cleanse your bowel using an enema or laxatives. It is essential to follow these instructions exactly.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen barium enters your colon, you may feel like you need to have a bowel movement. You may also experience:\n\n* A feeling of fullness\n* Moderate to severe cramping\n* General discomfort\n\nTaking long, deep breaths may help you relax during the procedure.\n\nAfter the test, it is normal for your stools to be white for a few days. To prevent hard stools, drink extra fluids for 2 to 4 days and ask your provider about a laxative if needed.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe barium enema test is used to:\n\n* Detect or screen for colon cancer\n* Diagnose or monitor ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease\n* Diagnose the cause of blood in stools, diarrhea, or very hard stools (constipation)\n\nAlthough the barium enema test is still used today, it is not as common as other procedures like colonoscopy. CT colonography has also been used as an alternative.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nBarium should fill the colon evenly, showing normal bowel shape and position with no blockages.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal test results may indicate:\n\n* Blockage of the large intestine\n* Narrowing of the colon above the rectum (Hirschsprung disease in infants)\n* Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis\n* Cancer in the colon or rectum\n* Sliding of one part of the intestine into another (intussusception)\n* Small growths that stick out of the lining of the colon, called polyps\n* Small, bulging sacs or pouches of the inner lining of the intestine, called diverticula\n* Twisted loop of the bowel (volvulus)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is low radiation exposure during the test. X-rays are monitored to use the smallest amount of radiation possible. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to x-ray risks.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nThe barium enema test has several alternative names, including:\n\n* Lower gastrointestinal series\n* Lower GI series\n* Colorectal cancer - lower GI series\n* Colorectal cancer - barium enema\n* Crohn disease - lower GI series\n* Crohn disease - barium enema\n* Intestinal blockage - lower GI series\n* Intestinal blockage - barium enema\n\n---\n\n**Barium Enema**\n\nA barium enema is a medical imaging procedure used to visualize the large intestine, also known as the colon.

    "content": "**Barrett Esophagus**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Barrett Esophagus?**\n\nBarrett esophagus (BE) is a disorder in which the lining of the esophagus is damaged by stomach acid leading to changes in the cells of the lining. The esophagus is also called the food pipe, and it connects your throat to your stomach.\n\nPeople with BE have an increased risk for cancer in the area involved. However, cancer is not common.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen you eat, food passes from your throat to your stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus keeps stomach contents from moving backward.\n\nIf these muscles do not close tightly, harsh stomach acid can leak into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). It may cause tissue damage over time. The lining becomes similar to that of the intestine.\n\nBE occurs more often in men than women. People who have had GERD for a long time are more likely to have this condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBE itself does not cause symptoms. The acid reflux that causes BE often leads to symptoms of heartburn. Many people with this condition do not have any symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will recommend an endoscopy (EGD) to screen for BE if you are a high risk person. You may also need an endoscopy if GERD symptoms are severe or come back after treatment.\n\nDuring the endoscopy, your endoscopist (usually a gastroenterologist or specialist in conditions of the GI tract) may take tissue samples (biopsies) from different parts of the esophagus. These samples help detect the condition. They also help look for changes that could lead to cancer.\n\nIf you have BE, your provider may recommend a follow-up endoscopy to look for cell changes that indicate cancer at regular intervals.\n\nSome patients may choose to screen with a swallowed capsule, but this is not widely available.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment should improve acid reflux symptoms, and may keep BE from getting worse. Treatment of GERD may involve lifestyle changes and medicines such as:\n\n*   Antacids after meals and at bedtime\n*   Histamine H2 receptor blockers\n*   Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\n*   Avoiding use of tobacco, chocolate, and caffeine\n\nHowever in BE, PPIs are the recommended medicine.\n\nLifestyle changes, medicines, and anti-reflux surgery may help with symptoms of GERD. However, these steps will not make BE go away.\n\nThe recommended procedure to treat abnormal tissues in BE is radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which is done at the time of an endoscopy. Sometimes this is combined with endoscopic removal of particular sections of abnormal tissue. After RFA you will have follow-up endoscopy and further treatment if necessary.\n\nSome people may choose to have surgery to correct anatomic abnormalities such as hiatal hernia, that may lead to BE.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment should improve acid reflux symptoms and may keep BE from getting worse. RFA removes the BE tissue as does endoscopic removal, but BE often comes back and this is why surveillance with EGDs is done after RFA.\n\nPeople with chronic GERD or BE generally need to be monitored for cancer of the esophagus.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   Heartburn lasts for longer than a few days, or you have pain or problems swallowing.\n*   You have been diagnosed with BE and your symptoms get worse.\n*   You develop new symptoms (such as weight loss, problems swallowing).\n\n---\n\n**Barrett Esophagus**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Barrett Esophagus?**\n\nBarrett esophagus (BE) is a disorder in which the lining of the esophagus is damaged by stomach acid leading to changes in the cells of the lining.

    "content": "**Barth Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\nBarth syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an enlarged and weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), weakness in muscles used for movement (skeletal myopathy), recurrent infections due to small numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and short stature. Barth syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\nIn males with Barth syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy is often present at birth or develops within the first months of life. Over time, the heart muscle becomes increasingly weakened and is less able to pump blood. Individuals with Barth syndrome may have elastic fibers in place of muscle fibers in some areas of the heart muscle, which contributes to the cardiomyopathy. This condition is called endocardial fibroelastosis; it results in thickening of the muscle and impairs its ability to pump blood. In people with Barth syndrome, the heart problems can lead to heart failure. In rare cases, the cardiomyopathy gets better over time and affected individuals eventually have no symptoms of heart disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\nIn Barth syndrome, skeletal myopathy, particularly of the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles), is usually noticeable from birth and causes low muscle tone (hypotonia). The muscle weakness often causes delay of motor skills such as crawling and walking. Additionally, affected individuals tend to experience extreme tiredness (fatigue) during strenuous physical activity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\nMost males with Barth syndrome have neutropenia. The levels of white blood cells can be consistently low (persistent), can vary from normal to low (intermittent), or can cycle between regular episodes of normal and low (cyclical). Neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses, so affected individuals have an increased risk of recurrent infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\nNewborns with Barth syndrome are often smaller than normal, and their growth continues to be slow throughout life. Some boys with this condition experience a growth spurt in puberty and are of average height as adults, but many men with Barth syndrome continue to have short stature in adulthood.\n\nMales with Barth syndrome often have distinctive facial features including prominent cheeks. Affected individuals typically have normal intelligence but often have difficulty performing tasks involving math or visual-spatial skills such as puzzles.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Life Expectancy**\nMales with Barth syndrome have a reduced life expectancy. Many affected children die of heart failure or infection in infancy or early childhood, but those who live into adulthood can survive into their late forties.\n\n---\n\n**Barth Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Barth Syndrome?**\n\nBarth syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males almost exclusively. It is characterized by an enlarged and weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), weakness in muscles used for movement (skeletal myopathy), recurrent infections due to small numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and short stature.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Barth Syndrome**\n\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy: often present at birth or develops within the first months of life, leading to heart failure in rare cases\n* Skeletal myopathy: noticeable from birth, causing low muscle tone (hypotonia) and delay of motor skills such as crawling and walking\n* Neutropenia: consistently low, intermittent, or cyclical levels of white blood cells, increasing the risk of recurrent infections\n* Short stature: often smaller than normal at birth, with slow growth throughout life\n* Distinctive facial features: prominent cheeks\n* Normal intelligence, but difficulty with math and visual-spatial skills\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Prognosis**\n\nBarth syndrome can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). The severity of signs and symptoms among affected individuals is highly variable, and many affected children die of heart failure or infection in infancy or early childhood. Those who live into adulthood can survive into their late forties.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Key Facts**\n\n* Barth syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy is often present at birth or develops within the first months of life\n* Skeletal myopathy causes low muscle tone and delay of motor skills\n* Neutropenia increases the risk of recurrent infections\n* Short stature is a common feature\n* Distinctive facial features are often present\n\n---\n\n**Barth Syndrome**\n\n**What is Barth Syndrome?**\n\nBarth syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males almost exclusively. It is characterized by an enlarged and weakened heart, muscle weakness, recurrent infections due to low white blood cell count, and short stature.\n\n**Symptoms of Barth Syndrome**\n\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy: The heart muscle becomes increasingly weakened and less able to pump blood.\n* Skeletal myopathy: Muscle weakness, particularly in the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles).\n* Neutropenia: Low white blood cell count, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.\n* Short stature: Newborns with Barth syndrome are often smaller than normal, and their growth continues to be slow throughout life.\n\n**Facial Features and Intelligence**\n\n* Distinctive facial features: Prominent cheeks\n* Normal intelligence: Affected individuals typically have normal intelligence but may have difficulty performing tasks involving math or visual-spatial skills.\n\n**Life Expectancy and Age of Diagnosis**\n\n* Many affected children die of heart failure or infection in infancy or early childhood.\n* Those who live into adulthood can survive into their late forties.\n* The age at which individuals with Barth syndrome display symptoms or are diagnosed varies greatly.\n\n**Causes of Barth Syndrome**\n\nMutations in the TAFAZZIN gene cause Barth syndrome. The TAFAZZIN gene provides instructions for making a protein called tafazzin, which is involved in altering cardiolipin, a fat critical for mitochondrial shape and energy production. TAFAZZIN gene mutations result in the production of non-functional tafazzin proteins, leading to impaired mitochondrial shape and functions.\n\n**Frequency of Barth Syndrome**\n\nEstimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 400,000 individuals worldwide. More than 150 cases have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n---\n\n**Barth Syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/6)**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Would affect their ability to grow (proliferate), mature (differentiate), and function, leading to neutropenia. Dysfunctional mitochondria likely lead to other signs and symptoms of Barth syndrome.**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Learn more about the gene associated with Barth syndrome**\n\n*   **TAFAZZIN**: Mutations in the TAFAZZIN gene cause Barth syndrome. The TAFAZZIN gene provides instructions for making a protein called tafazzin. This protein is located in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells.\n*   The tafazzin protein is involved in altering a fat (lipid) called cardiolipin, which plays critical roles in the mitochondrial inner membrane.\n*   Once altered by tafazzin, cardiolipin is key in maintaining mitochondrial shape, energy production, and protein transport within cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes.\n\n*   In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n*   In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder.\n*   Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   3 methylglutaconic aciduria, type II\n*   3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 2\n*   BTHS\n*   Cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria\n*   DNAJC19 defect\n*   MGA type 2\n*   MGA type II\n\n---\n\n**Barth Syndrome**\n\n**What is Barth syndrome?**\n\nBarth syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males. It is characterized by a combination of physical abnormalities, developmental delays, and an increased risk of infections.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nBarth syndrome is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene, which codes for the protein tafazzin. The mutation leads to a deficiency of tafazzin, resulting in abnormal fatty acid metabolism and accumulation of 3-methylglutaconic acid (3-MGA) in the urine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Barth syndrome can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Cardiomyopathy: a condition where the heart muscle is weakened\n* Developmental delays: delayed physical and mental development\n* Infections: recurrent infections, particularly of the skin and lungs\n* Physical abnormalities: abnormal fat distribution, short stature, and other physical anomalies\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of Barth syndrome is typically made through genetic testing, which can detect mutations in the TAZ gene. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Urine analysis: to detect 3-MGA\n* Echocardiogram: to assess heart function\n* Physical examination: to evaluate physical abnormalities\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Barth syndrome, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n* Antibiotics: to prevent and treat infections\n* Cardiac medications: to manage cardiomyopathy\n* Dietary modifications: to manage fatty acid metabolism\n* Physical therapy: to improve physical development\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Barth syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many individuals can lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nBarth syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that males are more likely to be affected than females.

    "content": "**Bartter Syndrome**\n\n_Bartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body._\n\n_In some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth._\n\n_Beginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness)._\n\n**Two Major Forms**\n\n_Two major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe._\n\n---\n\n**Bartter Syndrome**\n\n**What is Bartter syndrome?**\n\nBartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body.\n\n**Forms of Bartter syndrome**\n\nTwo major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe.\n\n**Types of Bartter syndrome**\n\nOnce the genetic causes of Bartter syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different types based on the genes involved. Types I, II, and IV have the features of antenatal Bartter syndrome. Because type IV is also associated with hearing loss, it is sometimes called antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type III usually has the features of classical Bartter syndrome.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth.\n\nBeginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis).\n\nBartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe exact prevalence of this disorder is unknown, although it likely affects about 1 per million people worldwide. The condition appears to be more common in Costa Rica and Kuwait than in other populations.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBartter syndrome can be caused by mutations in at least five genes. Mutations in the SLC12A1 gene cause type I. Type II results from mutations in the KCNJ1 gene. Mutations in the CLCNKB gene are responsible for type III. Type IV can result from mutations in the BSND gene or from a combination of mutations in the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes.\n\nThe genes associated with Bartter syndrome play important roles in normal kidney function. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in the kidneys' reabsorption of salt. Mutations in any of the five genes impair the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt, leading to the loss of excess salt in the urine (salt wasting). Abnormalities of salt transport also affect the reabsorption of other charged atoms (ions), including potassium and calcium.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n---\n\n**Bartter Syndrome**\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Aldosteronism with hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex\n* Bartter disease\n* Bartter's syndrome\n* Juxtaglomerular hyperplasia with secondary aldosteronism\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic Testing Information**\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Antenatal Bartter Syndrome\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Bartter disease type 4a\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Bartter syndrome\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Bartter disease type 3\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Bartter disease type 4B\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\t+ Bartter syndrome\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Clinical Trials**\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 1, ANTENATAL; BARTS1\n\t+ BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 2, ANTENATAL; BARTS2\n\t+ BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4A, NEONATAL, WITH SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS; BARTS4A\n\t+ BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3; BARTS3\n\t+ BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B, NEONATAL, WITH SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS; BARTS4B\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Hebert SC.

The condition is present at birth (congenital).\n\nThe condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. People affected by Bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting.\n\nThe condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThis disease usually occurs in childhood. Symptoms include:\n\n* Constipation\n* Less weight gain than other children of similar age and sex (growth failure)\n* Frequent urination (urinary frequency)\n* Low blood pressure\n* Kidney stones\n* Muscle cramping and weakness\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBartter syndrome is usually suspected when a blood test finds a low level of potassium in the blood. Unlike other forms of kidney disease, this condition does not cause high blood pressure. There is a tendency toward low blood pressure. Laboratory tests may show:\n\n* High urine potassium, calcium, and chloride levels\n* High blood levels of the hormones, renin and aldosterone\n* Low blood chloride level\n* Metabolic alkalosis\n\nThese same signs and symptoms can also occur in people who take too many diuretics (water pills) or laxatives. Urine tests can be done to rule out other causes.\n\nAn ultrasound of the kidneys may be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBartter syndrome is treated by eating foods rich in potassium or taking potassium supplements.\n\nMany people also need salt and magnesium supplements. Medicine may be needed that blocks the kidney's ability to get rid of potassium. High doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nInfants who have severe growth failure may grow normally with treatment.

    "content": "**Basal Cell Skin Cancer**\n\nBasal cell cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Most skin cancers are basal cell cancer.\n\n* Other common types of skin cancer are:\n\t+ Squamous cell cancer\n\t+ Melanoma\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe top layer of the skin is called the epidermis. The bottom layer of the epidermis is the basal cell layer. With basal cancer, cells in this layer are the ones that become cancerous. Most basal cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThis type of skin cancer is most common in people over age 50. But it can also occur in younger people who have had extensive sun exposure. Basal cell cancer is almost always slow-growing. It rarely spreads to other parts of the body.\n\nYou are more likely to develop basal cell cancer if you have:\n\n* Light-colored or freckled skin\n* Blue, green, or grey eyes\n* Blond or red hair\n* Overexposure to x-rays or other forms of radiation\n* Many moles\n* Close relatives who have or had skin cancer\n* Many severe sunburns early in life\n* Long-term daily sun exposure (such as the sun exposure received by people who work outside)\n\nOther risk factors include:\n\n* Smoking\n* Weakened immune system, such as being on medicines that suppress the immune system after an organ transplant\n* Inherited skin diseases, such as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\n* Having had photodynamic therapy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBasal cell cancer usually grows slowly and is often painless. It may not look that different from your normal skin. You may have a skin bump or growth that is:\n\n* Pearly or waxy\n* White or light pink\n* Flesh-colored or brown\n* A red, scaly patch of skin\n\nIn some cases, the skin is just slightly raised, or even flat.\n\nYou may have:\n\n* A skin sore that bleeds easily\n* A sore that does not heal\n* Oozing or crusting spots in a sore\n* A scar-like sore without having injured the area\n* Irregular blood vessels in or around the spot\n* A sore with a depressed (sunken) area in the middle\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will check your skin and look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any suspicious areas.\n\nIf your provider thinks you might have skin cancer, a piece of skin will be removed. This is called a skin biopsy. The sample is sent to a lab for examination under a microscope.\n\nA skin biopsy must be done to confirm basal cell cancer or other skin cancers. The diagnosis cannot be based only on the appearance of your skin.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the size, depth, and location of the skin cancer and your overall health. Each treatment has its risks and benefits. You and your provider can discuss the treatment that's right for you.\n\nTreatment may involve any of the following:\n\n* Excision: Cutting out the skin cancer and stitching the skin together\n* Curettage and electrodessication: Scraping away cancer cells and using electricity to kill any that remain; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep; often curettage is used alone without electrodessication\n* Cryosurgery: Freezing the cancer cells, which kills them; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep\n* Medicine: Skin creams that have medicine; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep\n* Mohs surgery: Removing a layer of skin and looking at it immediately under a microscope, then removing additional layers of skin until there are no signs of the cancer; usually used for skin cancers on the nose, ears, and other areas of the face\n* Photodynamic therapy: Using a light-activated chemical to treat cancers that are not large or deep\n* Radiation therapy: May be used if a basal cell cancer cannot be treated with surgery\n* Chemotherapy: May be used in the rare instances of basal cell cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that cannot be treated with surgery\n* Biologic therapies (immunotherapies): Medicines that target and kill basal cell skin cancer and are used when standard treatments do not work\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of these cancers are cured when treated early. Some basal cell cancers return in the same location. Smaller ones are less likely to come back.\n\nBasal cell skin cancer almost never spreads beyond the original location. Left untreated, however, it may spread into surrounding areas and nearby tissues and bone.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have a sore or spot on your skin that changes in:\n\n* Appearance\n* Color\n* Size\n* Texture\n\nAlso contact your provider if a spot becomes painful or swollen, or if it starts to bleed or itch.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nExperts disagree about the value of routine skin examinations by your provider. But all agree it's important to know your own skin and to contact your provider if you notice anything unusual.\n\nThe best way to prevent skin cancer is to reduce your exposure to sunlight. Always use sunscreen:\n\n* Apply sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, even when you are going outdoors for a short time.\n* Apply a large amount of sunscreen on all exposed areas, including ears and feet.\n* Look for sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB light.\n* Use a water-resistant sunscreen.\n* Apply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out. Follow package instructions about how often to reapply. Be sure to reapply after swimming or sweating.\n* Use sunscreen in winter and on cloudy days too.\n\nOther measures to help you avoid too much sun exposure:\n\n* Ultraviolet light is most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to avoid the sun during these hours. \n* Protect your skin by wearing wide-brim hats, long-sleeve shirts, long skirts, or pants. You can also buy sun-protective clothing.\n* Avoid surfaces that reflect light more, such as water, sand, concrete, and areas that are painted white.\n* The higher the altitude, the faster your skin burns.\n* Do not use sun lamps and tanning beds (salons).

These disorders can be caused by various factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and medications.\n\n**Types of Basal Ganglia Dysfunction**\n\nThere are several types of basal ganglia dysfunction, including:\n\n* **Parkinson's disease**: a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n* **Huntington's disease**: a genetic disorder that affects movement, cognition, and behavior.\n* **Tardive dyskinesia**: a side effect of long-term antipsychotic medication use.\n\n**Causes of Basal Ganglia Dysfunction**\n\nBasal ganglia dysfunction can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* **Genetic mutations**: certain genetic mutations can increase the risk of developing basal ganglia dysfunction.\n* **Infections**: infections such as encephalitis or meningitis can cause basal ganglia dysfunction.\n* **Medications**: long-term use of antipsychotic medications can cause tardive dyskinesia.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosing basal ganglia dysfunction typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medication, surgery, or lifestyle changes.\n\n**References**\n\n* Jankovic J. Parkinson disease and other movement disorders.

    "content": "**Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**\n\nA basic metabolic panel (BMP) measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's fluid balance, your metabolism (the process your body uses to make energy from food you eat), and how well your kidneys are working. This test is often used to check your general health.\n\n**What does a BMP test include?**\n\n*   Glucose, a type of sugar and your body's main energy source\n*   Calcium, one of the body’s most important minerals\n*   Sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, and chloride (electrolytes)\n*   BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys\n\n**What is a BMP used for?**\n\nA BMP can be used to screen or diagnose health conditions or monitor treatment. This test may also be used to check how well your body functions. It can provide information on your:\n\n*   Kidney function\n*   Fluid and electrolyte balance\n*   Blood glucose levels\n*   Acid and base balance\n*   Metabolism\n\n**Why do I need a BMP?**\n\nA BMP is often done as part of a regular checkup. This may help your health care provider find health problems before you have any symptoms.\n\nYou may also need this test if you:\n\n*   Have general symptoms such as fatigue, confusion, breathing problems, or vomiting that lasts a long time\n*   Are being treated in the emergency room\n*   Are being monitored for a certain chronic (long-lasting) condition, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease\n\n**What happens during a BMP?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf any one result or combination of BMP results were not normal, it could be a sign of several different health conditions. These include kidney disease, breathing problems, and complications from diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis.\n\nTo understand what your test results may mean, your provider may also consider your symptoms, your medical history, and the results of other tests you had. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**\n\nA Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) is often done as part of a regular checkup to help your healthcare provider find health problems before you have any symptoms.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.**\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BMP?**\nThere is a similar test to a BMP called a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP). A CMP includes the same eight tests as a BMP, plus six more tests, which measure certain proteins and liver enzymes.\n\n* **Albumin**, a protein made in the liver\n* **Total protein**, which measures the total amount of protein in the blood\n* **ALP (alkaline phosphatase)**, ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are different enzymes (proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body) made by the liver.\n* **Bilirubin**, a waste product made by the liver\n\nYour provider may order a CMP instead of a BMP to get a more complete picture of the health of your organs or to check for liver disease or other specific conditions.",

For these people, daily bed baths can help keep their skin healthy, control odor, and increase comfort. If moving the patient causes pain, plan to give them a bed bath after they have received pain medicine and it has taken effect.\n\n**Encouraging Patient Involvement**\n\nEncourage the patient to be as involved as possible in bathing themselves.\n\n**Inspecting the Skin**\n\nA bed bath is a good time to inspect a patient's skin for redness and sores. Pay special attention to skin folds and bony areas when checking.\n\n**Supplies Needed**\n\nYou will need:\n\n*   Gloves\n*   Large bowl of warm water (around 106 degrees Fahrenheit)\n*   Soap (regular or non-rinse soap)\n*   Two washcloths or sponges or at least 7 no-rinse cloths\n*   Dry towel\n*   Lotion\n*   Shaving supplies, if you are planning to shave the patient\n*   Comb or other hair care products\n*   Deodorant\n\n**Bag Bath Alternative**\n\nIf available, you can use a bag bath package with 8 to 10 premoistened disposable cloths that contain a no-rinse surfactant instead of using soap and water. The bag bath needs to be warmed before use.\n\nTo prevent hospital-acquired infections, consider the use of chlorhexidine-impregnated disposable no-rinse cloths. Make sure the patient can tolerate and does not have allergies to chlorhexidine.\n\n**Washing Hair**\n\nIf you wash the patient's hair, use either a dry shampoo that combs out or a basin that is designed for washing hair in bed. This kind of basin has a tube in the bottom that allows you to keep the bed dry before you later drain the water.\n\n**How to Give a Bed Bath**\n\nThe following steps should be followed when giving a bed bath:\n\n1.  Bring all the supplies you will need to the patient's bedside. Raise the bed to a comfortable height to prevent straining your back.\n2.  Explain to the patient that you are about to give them a bed bath. Make sure the room is warm enough and the doors and windows are closed to prevent a draft of cold air.\n3.  Put on gloves.\n4.  Make sure you uncover only the area of the body you are washing. This will keep the person from getting too cold. It also provides privacy.\n5.  While the patient is lying on their back, begin by washing their face and move toward their feet. Then, roll your patient to one side and wash their back.\n6.  To wash a patient's skin with soap and water, first wet the skin with a sponge, then gently apply a small amount of soap. Check with the patient to make sure the temperature is okay and you are not rubbing too hard.\n7.  Make sure you rinse off all the soap and then pat the area dry, including the skin folds and creases. Apply lotion before covering the area up.\n8.  Bring fresh, warm water to the patient's bedside with a clean washcloth to wash private areas. First wash the genitals, then move toward the buttocks, always washing from front to back.\n\nIf you are using a bag bath or no-rinse cloth, you should let the skin air dry before you cover the skin. Most no-rinse cloths have moisturizers, so you do not need to rinse, dry, or put lotion on the skin afterwards. Start by cleaning the face, do not use chlorhexidine cloths on the face. You will need a fresh no-rinse cloth for each of these areas: face, neck to chest, armpit to hand, stomach to a private area, each leg to the foot, neck to back, and finally the buttocks.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBed bath; Sponge bath\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Red Cross.

    "title": "Becaplermin Topical: MedlinePlus Drug Information",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699049.html",
    "content": "**Becaplermin Topical**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBecaplermin gel is used as part of a total treatment program to help heal certain ulcers (sores) of the foot, ankle, or leg in people who have diabetes. Becaplermin gel must be used along with good ulcer care including: removal of dead tissue by a medical professional; the use of special shoes, walkers, crutches, or wheelchairs to keep weight off the ulcer; and treatment of any infections that develop. Becaplermin cannot be used to treat ulcers that have been stitched or stapled. Becaplermin is a human platelet-derived growth factor, a substance naturally produced by the body that helps in wound healing. It works by helping to repair and replace dead skin and other tissues, attracting cells that repair wounds, and helping to close and heal the ulcer.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBecaplermin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day to the ulcer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use becaplermin gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Using more gel than your doctor prescribed will not help your ulcer heal faster.\n\nYour doctor will show you how to measure becaplermin gel and will tell you how much gel to apply. The amount of gel you will need depends on the size of your ulcer. Your doctor will examine your ulcer every 1 to 2 weeks, and may tell you to use less gel as your ulcer heals and grows smaller.\n\nBecaplermin gel is for use on the skin only. Do not swallow the medication. Do not apply the medication to any part of your body other than the ulcer that is being treated.\n\nTo apply becaplermin gel, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly.\n*   Gently rinse the wound with water. Wash your hands again.\n*   Squeeze the length of gel your doctor has told you to use onto a clean, nonabsorbent surface such as wax paper. Do not touch the tip of the tube to the wax paper, the ulcer, or any other surface. Recap the tube tightly after use.\n*   Use a clean cotton swab, tongue depressor, or other applicator to spread the gel over the ulcer surface in an even layer about 1/16th of an inch (0.2 centimeters) thick (about as thick as a penny).\n*   Moisten a piece of gauze dressing with saline and place it on the wound. The gauze should cover only the wound, not the skin around it.\n*   Place a small, dry pad dressing over the wound. Wrap a soft, dry gauze bandage over the pad and hold it in place with adhesive tape. Be careful not to attach the adhesive tape to your skin.\n*   After about 12 hours, remove the bandage and gauze dressing and rinse the ulcer gently with saline or water to remove whatever gel is left.\n*   Bandage the ulcer following the instructions in steps 5 and 6. Do not reuse the gauze, dressing, or bandage that you removed before washing the ulcer. Use fresh supplies.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nSide effects of becaplermin gel include redness, swelling, itching, stinging, burning, or blistering where the gel is applied. These side effects usually go away within a few days after treatment starts. If any of these side effects are severe or do not go away, tell your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep becaplermin gel out of reach of children and pets. Store the tube tightly closed in its original container at room temperature (about 77°F) for up to 6 months after opening. Do not freeze or refrigerate the gel. Dispose of any unused becaplermin gel responsibly.\n\n\\n\\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBecaplermin gel may cause your skin to become more sensitive to sunlight than usual. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight, especially during peak hours (10 am - 4 pm), and use a sunscreen with at least SPF 15 when going outdoors. If you experience any unusual side effects or have questions about becaplermin gel, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Becaplermin Topical: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**How to Apply Becaplermin Gel**\n\nTo apply becaplermin gel, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Wash Your Hands**: Wash your hands thoroughly.\n2. **Rinse the Wound**: Gently rinse the wound with water. Wash your hands again.\n3. **Prepare the Gel**: Squeeze the length of gel your doctor has told you to use onto a clean, nonabsorbent surface such as wax paper. Do not touch the tip of the tube to the wax paper, the ulcer, or any other surface. Recap the tube tightly after use.\n4. **Apply the Gel**: Use a clean cotton swab, tongue depressor, or other applicator to spread the gel over the ulcer surface in an even layer about 1/16th of an inch (0.2 centimeters) thick (about as thick as a penny).\n5. **Cover the Wound**: Moisten a piece of gauze dressing with saline and place it on the wound. The gauze should cover only the wound, not the skin around it.\n6. **Secure the Bandage**: Place a small, dry pad dressing over the wound. Wrap a soft, dry gauze bandage over the pad and hold it in place with adhesive tape. Be careful not to attach the adhesive tape to your skin.\n\n**Using Becaplermin Gel**\n\nBecaplermin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day to the ulcer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use becaplermin gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore using becaplermin gel:\n\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to becaplermin, parabens, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in becaplermin gel.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional products, and herbal supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention other medications that are applied to the ulcer.\n* Tell your doctor if you have a skin tumor or cancer by the area that you are to apply becaplermin gel. Your doctor will probably tell you not to use becaplermin gel.\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had poor blood flow to your legs or feet, or cancer.

Do not share beclomethasone nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\nBeclomethasone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve a few days after you first use beclomethasone, but it may take 1 to 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of beclomethasone. Beclomethasone works best when used regularly. Use beclomethasone on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use beclomethasone nasal spray for 3 weeks.

    "content": "**Beclomethasone Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBeclomethasone is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children 5 years of age and older. It belongs to a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBeclomethasone comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It usually is inhaled twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use beclomethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with beclomethasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use beclomethasone.\n\nBeclomethasone controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon as 24 hours after using the medication, but full effects may not be seen for 1 to 4 weeks after using it regularly.
