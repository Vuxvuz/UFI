    "content": "**Down Syndrome Tests**\n\n**What are Down syndrome tests?**\n\nDown syndrome is a condition in which a person is born with an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. The condition causes problems with development, thinking, learning, and physical health. Down syndrome tests can help find this chromosome disorder in unborn babies.\n\n**Types of Down Syndrome Tests**\n\nThere are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy:\n\n* Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome.\n* Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells.\n\n**Prenatal Screening Tests**\n\nThere are several types of prenatal screening tests for Down syndrome:\n\n* First trimester screening includes:\n\t+ A blood test to check your blood for \"markers\" such as certain proteins that may be linked to a higher risk of Down syndrome\n\t+ An ultrasound image to look for fluid in the back of the baby's neck, which may be a sign of Down syndrome\n* Second trimester screening includes blood tests to check the levels of several markers in your blood that may be a sign of Down syndrome.\n* Combined (or integrated) testing uses results from both first and second trimester screening tests to estimate your baby's risk for Down syndrome.\n\n**Prenatal Diagnostic Tests**\n\nDiagnostic tests for Down syndrome include:\n\n* Amniocentesis. This test takes a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the unborn baby in the uterus.\n* Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). A CVS collects tissue from parts of the placenta called the chorionic villi.\n* Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), also called cordocentesis. This test removes a sample of the baby's blood from the umbilical cord.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Down Syndrome Test?**\n\nYou may need Down syndrome testing during pregnancy if you have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your risk may be higher if:\n\n* You were age 35 or older when you got pregnant.\n* You have a child with Down syndrome or had a diagnosis of Down syndrome in a past pregnancy.\n* You have a family history of Down syndrome.\n\n**What Happens During Down Syndrome Testing?**\n\nThe tests involve different procedures, including blood tests, ultrasounds, and amniocentesis. The specific procedure will depend on the type of test being performed.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Tests?**\n\nSome tests may require preparation, such as drinking extra fluid or not urinating before the test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Tests?**\n\nBlood tests and ultrasounds have very little risk. Amniocentesis and CVS have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage. PUBS has a slightly higher risk of causing serious problems than amniocentesis or CVS.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults from Down syndrome screening tests show your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**What is Down Syndrome?**\n\n\\n\\nDown syndrome is a condition in which a person is born with an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. The condition causes problems with development, thinking, learning, and physical health.\n\n**How Do Chromosomes Work?**\n\n\\n\\nChromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell. The chromosomes are grouped into 23 pairs. Each pair has two chromosomes, one coming from each parent.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Down Syndrome?**\n\n\\n\\nThe extra chromosome affects the way a baby's brain and body develop. The symptoms may range from mild to severe. Children with Down syndrome usually have some problems with thinking and learning. They may start talking later than other children. Common physical signs of Down syndrome include a flat face, eyes that slant up, a short neck, small hands and feet, poor muscle tone, and loose joints. Common health problems in childhood include hearing loss, sleep apnea, ear infections, eye diseases, and heart defects.\n\n**What Are the Types of Down Syndrome Tests?**\n\n\\n\\nThere are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy: prenatal screening tests and prenatal diagnostic tests. Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure.\n\n**What Are the Different Types of Screening Tests?**\n\n\\n\\nThere are several types of screening tests for Down syndrome:\n\n*   First trimester screening includes:\n    *   A blood test to check your blood for \"markers\" such as certain proteins that may be linked to a higher risk of Down syndrome\n    *   An ultrasound image to look for fluid in the back of the baby's neck, which may be a sign of Down syndrome\n*   Second trimester screening includes blood tests to check the levels of several markers in your blood that may be a sign of Down syndrome. The test may check three markers (a triple screen test) or four markers (a quadruple screen test).\n*   Combined (or integrated) testing uses results from both first and second trimester screening tests to estimate your baby's risk for Down syndrome.\n*   Cell-free fetal DNA is a newer test that checks a sample of your blood for unusually large amounts of material from chromosome 21. This test can be done as early as ten weeks.\n\n**What Are the Different Types of Diagnostic Tests?**\n\n\\n\\nPrenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome. Diagnostic tests for Down syndrome include:\n\n*   Amniocentesis: This test takes a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the unborn baby in the uterus.\n*   Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): A CVS collects tissue from parts of the placenta called the chorionic villi.\n*   Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), also called cordocentesis: This test removes a sample of the baby's blood from the umbilical cord.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Down Syndrome Test?**\n\n\\n\\nYou may need Down syndrome testing during pregnancy if you have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your risk may be higher if:\n\n*   You're over 35 years old\n*   You've had a previous pregnancy affected by Down syndrome\n*   You have a family history of the condition\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome Tests**\n\nYou may need Down syndrome testing during pregnancy if you have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your risk may be higher if:\n\n* You were age 35 or older when you got pregnant. The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increases with age.\n* You have a child with Down syndrome or had a diagnosis of Down syndrome in a past pregnancy.\n* You have a family history of Down syndrome.\n* An ultrasound of your unborn baby showed a possible sign of Down syndrome.\n\nYou may choose to be tested even if you don't have a high risk for having a baby with Down syndrome. Your provider or a genetic counselor can help you consider the pros and cons of testing.\n\n**What Happens During Down Syndrome Testing?**\n\nFor a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor the first trimester ultrasound, a health care professional will move an ultrasound wand-like device on your belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make an image of your unborn baby.\n\nFor amniocentesis, a provider inserts a hollow needle through your belly and into your uterus to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid.\n\nFor chorionic villus sampling (CVS), a provider collects a sample of tissue from the placenta with either a needle that's inserted through your belly or a tube that's inserted through your vagina.\n\nFor percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), a provider inserts a hollow needle through your belly and into the umbilical cord in your uterus. A small blood sample is removed from a vein in the cord.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Tests?**\n\nBlood tests and ultrasounds usually don't require any preparation.\n\nFor a CVS or amniocentesis, you may need to drink extra fluid and not urinate before your test so that your bladder is full.\n\nIf you're having a PUBS test after 23 weeks of pregnancy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Tests?**\n\nBlood tests and ultrasounds have very little risk. After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nDuring amniocentesis or CVS, you may feel mild stinging or cramping. Both tests are safe, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage.\n\nPUBS may cause brief discomfort. This test has a slightly higher risk of causing serious problems than amniocentesis or CVS. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of testing for Down syndrome.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults from Down syndrome screening tests show your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome:\n\n* A positive screening test result means that your baby's chance of having Down syndrome is higher than average. Your test results may include a number that describes how high the risk is. But a high risk doesn't mean your baby will have Down syndrome. You could still deliver a healthy baby with no chromosomal defects or disorders.\n* A negative/normal screening test result means that your baby is unlikely to have Down syndrome. But a screening test can't guarantee that your baby won't have Down syndrome.\n\nWhether or not your screening tests were normal, you may choose to have one or more diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests can usually tell you whether or not your baby will have Down syndrome. But diagnostic tests cannot predict how much Down syndrome will affect your baby's health and abilities.\n\nYou may find it helpful to speak with a genetic counselor before testing and again after you get your results. Genetic counselors are specially trained to help you weigh the risks and benefits of testing. They can also help you understand and what your results mean so you can make informed decisions.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome Tests**\n\nIf you're considering testing during pregnancy, it's essential to understand what each test involves and what the results mean. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions about your care.\n\n**Learning More About Laboratory Tests**\n\nTo better comprehend your test results, learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n**References**\n\n* ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

Women ages 35 and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 1 in every 700 babies born in the United States has Down syndrome.\n* According to the National Institute on Aging, people with Down syndrome are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Down Syndrome?**\n\nDown syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. This extra copy changes how a baby's body and brain develop. It can cause both mental and physical challenges during their lifetime. Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person has different abilities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Down Syndrome?**\n\nChromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. In some cases, they may have an extra copy of part of the chromosome. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is called trisomy. So sometimes Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21.\n\nDown syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens by chance, as an error when cells are dividing during early development of the fetus. It is not known for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role.\n\nOne factor that increases the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is the age of the mother. Women ages 35 and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Down Syndrome?**\n\nThe symptoms of Down syndrome are different in each person. And people with Down syndrome may have different problems at different times of their lives. They usually have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Their development is often delayed. For example, they may start talking later than other children.\n\nSome of the common physical signs of Down syndrome include:\n\n*   A flat face\n*   Eyes that slant up\n*   A short neck\n*   Small hands and feet\n*   Poor muscle tone\n*   Loose joints\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Problems Does Down Syndrome Cause?**\n\nMany people with Down syndrome have the common physical signs and have healthy lives. But some people with Down syndrome might have one or more birth defects or other health problems. Some of the more common ones include:\n\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Sleep apnea (a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep)\n*   Ear infections\n*   Eye diseases\n*   Congenital heart defects (heart defects that are present at birth)\n*   Digestive problems\n*   Problems with the upper part of the spine\n*   Obesity\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Is Down Syndrome Diagnosed?**\n\nHealth care providers can check for Down syndrome during pregnancy or after a child is born.\n\nThere are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy:\n\nPrenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure.\n\nPrenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells.\n\nThese tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome.\n\nAfter a baby is born, the provider may make an initial diagnosis of Down syndrome based on the physical signs of the syndrome. The provider can use a karyotype genetic test to confirm the diagnosis. The test can check for extra chromosomes in a sample of the baby's blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Down Syndrome?**\n\nThere is no single, standard treatment for Down syndrome. Treatments are based on each person's physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations.\n\nServices early in life focus on helping children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services include speech, occupational, and physical therapies. They are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state.\n\nSince people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care. They may need to have certain extra health screenings to check for problems that happen more often in people with Down syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\nPeople with Down syndrome can develop to their full potential with the right support and services. These may include speech, occupational, and physical therapies, which are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state.\n\nChildren with Down syndrome may also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are included in regular classes.\n\nSince people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care.

Digestive abnormalities, such as a blockage of the intestine, are less common.\n\n**Medical Conditions**\n\nIndividuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing several medical conditions, including:\n\n* Gastroesophageal reflux\n* Celiac disease (an intolerance of wheat protein called gluten)\n* Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) in about 15% of people\n* Hearing and vision problems\n* Cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia) in a small percentage of children\n\n**Developmental and Behavioral Issues**\n\nDelayed development and behavioral problems are often reported in children with Down syndrome, including:\n\n* Growth problems\n* Slow speech and language development\n* Speech that may be difficult to understand\n* Attention problems\n* Obsessive/compulsive behavior\n* Stubbornness or tantrums\n* Developmental conditions called autism spectrum disorders\n\n**Aging and Cognitive Decline**\n\nPeople with Down syndrome often experience a gradual decline in thinking ability as they age, usually starting around 50. They are also at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which affects memory, judgment, and ability to function. Approximately half of adults with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease, commonly earlier than usual, in their fifties or sixties.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n**What is Down Syndrome?**\n\nDown syndrome is a chromosomal condition that is associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy.\n\n**Characteristics of Down Syndrome**\n\nPeople with Down syndrome often have a characteristic facial appearance that includes:\n\n* A flattened appearance to the face\n* Outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures)\n* Small ears\n* A short neck\n* A tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth\n\nAffected individuals may have a variety of birth defects. Many people with Down syndrome have small hands and feet and a single crease across the palms of the hands.\n\n**Medical Conditions Associated with Down Syndrome**\n\nIndividuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing several medical conditions, including:\n\n* Gastroesophageal reflux\n* Celiac disease (an intolerance of a wheat protein called gluten)\n* Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland)\n\nAbout 15 percent of people with Down syndrome have hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ in the lower neck that produces hormones.\n\n**Delayed Development and Behavioral Problems**\n\nDelayed development and behavioral problems are often reported in children with Down syndrome. Affected individuals can have growth problems and their speech and language develop later and more slowly than in children without Down syndrome.\n\nBehavioral issues can include:\n\n* Attention problems\n* Obsessive/compulsive behavior\n* Stubbornness or tantrums\n\nA small percentage of people with Down syndrome are also diagnosed with developmental conditions called autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction.\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nDown syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Approximately half of adults with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAlthough Alzheimer's disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, people with Down syndrome commonly develop this condition earlier, in their fifties or sixties.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDown syndrome occurs in about 1 in 700 newborns. About 5,300 babies with Down syndrome are born in the United States each year, and approximately 200,000 people in this country have the condition.\n\nAlthough women of any age can have a child with Down syndrome, the chance of having a child with this condition increases as a woman gets older.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n**Prevalence**\n\n* Down syndrome occurs in about 1 in 700 newborns.\n* Approximately 200,000 people in the United States have the condition.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost cases of Down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies. Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. This is called translocation Down syndrome.\n\nA very small percentage of people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of Down syndrome are not inherited. When the condition is caused by trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent. The abnormality usually occurs in egg cells, but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes.\n\nPeople with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems.\n\nHowever, as this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. People who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 21 may have extra genetic material from chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome.\n\nLike trisomy 21, mosaic Down syndrome is not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n**What is Down Syndrome?**\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in every cell of the body.\n\n**Causes of Down Syndrome**\n\nThere are three main causes of Down syndrome:\n\n*   **Trisomy 21**: This is the most common cause, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in every cell.\n*   **Mosaic Down Syndrome**: This occurs when some cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21 and other cells have three copies.\n*   **Translocation Down Syndrome**: This happens when a part of chromosome 21 breaks off and attaches to another chromosome, resulting in an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nDown syndrome is not usually inherited from parents. However, people with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent who carries a balanced translocation.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **47,XX,+21**\n*   **47,XY,+21**\n*   **Down's Syndrome**\n*   **Trisomy 21**\n*   **Trisomy G**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on Down syndrome, you can visit the following resources:\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Down Syndrome**\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov**\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide more information on Down syndrome:\n\n*   Antonarakis SE, Lyle R, Dermitzakis ET, Reymond A, Deutsch S.

In most cases, Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This form of Down syndrome is called trisomy 21. The extra chromosome causes problems with the way the body and brain develop.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDown syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. No matter how severe the condition is, people with Down syndrome have a widely-recognized appearance. Common physical signs include:\n\n*   Decreased muscle tone at birth\n*   Excess skin at the nape of the neck\n*   Flattened nose\n*   Separated joints between the bones of the skull (sutures)\n*   Single crease in the palm of the hand\n*   Small ears\n*   Small mouth\n*   Upward slanting eyes\n*   Wide, short hands with short fingers\n*   White spots on the colored part of the eye (Brushfield spots)\n\nPhysical development is often slower than normal. Most children with Down syndrome never reach average adult height.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider can often make a diagnosis of Down syndrome at birth based on how your baby looks. Your provider may hear a heart murmur when listening to your baby's chest with a stethoscope. A blood test can be done to check for the extra chromosome and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n*   Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for heart defects (usually done soon after birth)\n*   X-rays of the chest and gastrointestinal tract\n\nPeople with Down syndrome need to be screened for certain medical conditions. They should have:\n\n*   An eye exam every year during infancy\n*   Hearing tests every 6 to 12 months, depending on age\n*   Dental exams every 6 months\n*   X-rays of the upper or cervical spine between ages 3 and 5 years\n*   Pap smears and pelvic exams beginning during puberty or by age 21\n*   Thyroid testing every 12 months\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Down syndrome. If treatment is needed, it is usually for associated health problems. For example, a child born with a gastrointestinal blockage may need major surgery right after birth. Certain heart defects may also require surgery.\n\nWhen breast-feeding, your baby should be well supported and fully awake. Your baby may have some leakage because of poor tongue control. But many infants with Down syndrome can successfully breastfeed.\n\nObesity can become a problem for older children and adults. Getting plenty of activity and avoiding high-calorie foods are important. Before beginning sports activities, your child's neck and hips should be examined.\n\nBehavioral training can help people with Down syndrome and their families deal with the frustration, anger, and compulsive behavior that often occur. Parents and caregivers should learn to help a person with Down syndrome deal with frustration. At the same time, it is important to encourage independence.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with Down syndrome and their families can be found at:\n\n*   National Down Syndrome Society -- www.ndss.org\n*   National Down Syndrome Congress -- www.ndsccenter.org\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n**What is Down syndrome?**\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition in which a person has 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn most cases, Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.

There is an increased risk for sexual abuse and other types of abuse in both males and females. It is important for those with Down syndrome to:\n\n* Be taught about pregnancy and taking the proper precautions\n* Learn to advocate for themselves in difficult situations\n* Be in a safe environment\n\nIf the person has any heart defects or other heart problems, antibiotics may need to be prescribed to prevent a heart infection called endocarditis.\n\nSpecial education and training are offered in most communities for children with delays in mental development. Speech therapy may help improve language skills. Physical therapy may teach movement skills. Occupational therapy may help with feeding and performing tasks. Mental health care can help both parents and the child manage mood or behavior problems.

Severe heart problems may lead to early death.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome have an increased risk for certain types of leukemia, which can also cause early death.\n\nThe level of intellectual disability varies, but is usually moderate. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk for dementia.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nA provider should be consulted to determine if the child needs special education and training. It is important for the child to have regular checkups with a provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nExperts recommend genetic counseling for people with a family history of Down syndrome who wish to have a baby.\n\nA woman's risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases as she gets older. The risk is significantly higher among women age 35 and older.\n\nCouples who already have a baby with Down syndrome have an increased risk of having another baby with the condition.\n\nTests such as nuchal translucency ultrasound, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling can be done on a fetus during the first few months of pregnancy to check for Down syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn most cases, Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.

    "content": "**Doxazosin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDoxazosin is used in men to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. It is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDoxazosin comes as a tablet and an extended-release tablet to take by mouth.

Doxercalciferol injection is in a class of medications called vitamin D analogs. It works by helping the body to use more of the calcium found in foods or supplements and regulating the body's production of parathyroid hormone.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDoxercalciferol injection comes as a solution to be injected intravenously 3 times weekly at the end of each dialysis session.

If you receive doxercalciferol injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of doxercalciferol injection and will gradually adjust your dose depending on your body's response to doxercalciferol injection.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using doxercalciferol injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to doxercalciferol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in doxercalciferol injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving doxercalciferol injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medication or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking magnesium-containing antacids (Maalox, Mylanta) and are being treated for dialysis. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take magnesium-containing antacids during your treatment with doxercalciferol injection.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with doxercalciferol injection: mineral oil; vitamin D supplements; calcium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start receiving doxercalciferol injection. Do not start any of these medications while using doxercalciferol injection without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have high blood levels of calcium or vitamin D. Your doctor will probably tell you not to use doxercalciferol injection.\n\nTell your doctor if you have high levels of phosphorus or if you have or have ever had liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.

If your stomach becomes upset when you take doxycycline, you may take it with food or milk.\n\n*   Swallow the delayed-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n*   If you cannot swallow certain delayed-release tablets (Doryx; generics) whole, carefully break up the tablet and sprinkle the contents of the tablet on a spoonful of cold or room temperature applesauce. Eat the mixture right away and swallow without chewing.\n*   Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nDoxycycline (Oracea) is used only to treat pimples and bumps caused by rosacea. It works to treat acne by killing the bacteria that infects pores and decreasing a certain natural oily substance that causes acne. It works to treat rosacea by decreasing the inflammation that causes this condition.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nAntibiotics such as doxycycline will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.

Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms that make it hard to swallow.\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with at least 2 quarts (1.8 liters) for at least 15 minutes.\n\nDo not give vinegar or lemon juice, as this may cause more severe burning.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nThe following information is helpful for emergency assistance:\n\n* The person's age, weight, and condition\n* The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n* The time it was swallowed\n* The amount swallowed\n\nHowever, do not delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n* Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Camera down the throat (endoscopy) to see burns in the food pipe (esophagus) and stomach\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\nActivated charcoal, which is used to treat other types of poisoning, does not effectively treat sodium hydroxide poisoning.\n\nFor skin exposure, treatment may include:\n\n* Surgical removal of burned skin (debridement)\n* Transfer to a hospital that specializes in burn care\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation), possibly every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing this type of poison can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the sodium hydroxide was swallowed. Death may occur up to several months later from additional complications. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may cause serious infections in the inside spaces of the chest and abdomen, which may lead to death. Surgery may be needed if the chemical has perforated the esophagus, stomach, or intestine.\n\n**References**\n\nHoyte C. Caustics. In: Walls RM, ed.

Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider.\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a provider. Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.\n\nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests.\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator).\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was inhaled).\n*   Chest x-ray.\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG).\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach.\n*   Fluids through a vein (by IV).\n*   Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms.\n*   Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement).\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed.\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nIf this type of poison gets in the eye, it can be very dangerous and difficult to manage. Loss of vision is common.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDrain opening agents\n\n**References**\n\nHoyte C. Caustics.

Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.\n\nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n---\n\n**Drainpipe cleaners: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/4)**\n\n**What to Do If Someone Swallows a Drainpipe Cleaner**\n\nIf someone swallows a drainpipe cleaner, also known as a caustic substance, it's essential to act quickly. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n*   **Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms that make it hard to swallow**.\n*   If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n*   Seek medical help right away. Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by Poison Control or a healthcare provider.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nGet the following information:\n\n*   Person's age, weight, and condition\n*   Name of the product (and ingredients and strength, if known)\n*   Time it was swallowed\n*   Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests.\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator).\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was inhaled).\n*   Chest x-ray.\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG).\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach.\n*   Fluids through a vein (by IV).\n*   Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms.\n*   Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement).\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed.\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n**References**\n\nHoyte C. Caustics. In: Walls RM, ed.

    "content": "**Drawing Medicine Out of a Vial**\n\nSome medicines need to be given with an injection. Learn the proper technique to draw your medicine into a syringe.\n\n**Get Ready**\n\nTo get prepared:\n\n* Gather your supplies: medicine vial, syringe, alcohol pad, sharps container.\n* Make sure you are working in a clean area.\n* Wash your hands.\n\n**Check Your Medicine**\n\nCarefully check your medicine:\n\n* Check the label. Make sure you have the right medicine.\n* Check the date on the vial. Do not use medicine that is out of date.\n* You may have a multi-dose vial. Or you may have a vial with powder that you mix with liquid. Read or ask about instructions if you have to mix your medicine.\n* If you will use the medicine more than once, write the date on the vial so you remember when you opened it.\n* Look at the medicine in the vial. Check for a change in color, small pieces floating in the liquid, cloudiness, or any other changes.\n\n**Get the Vial Ready**\n\nPrepare your medicine vial:\n\n* If this is your first time using this medicine, take the cap off the vial.\n* Wipe the rubber top clean with an alcohol pad.\n\n**Filling the Syringe With Medicine**\n\nFollow these steps to fill the syringe with medicine:\n\n1. Hold the syringe in your hand like a pencil, with the needle pointed up.\n2. With the cap still on, pull back the plunger to the line on your syringe for your dose. This fills the syringe with air.\n3. Insert the needle into the rubber top. Do not touch or bend the needle.\n4. Push the air into the vial. This keeps a vacuum from forming. If you put in too little air, you will find it hard to draw out the medicine. If you put in too much air, the medicine may be forced out of the syringe.\n5. Turn the vial upside down and hold it up in the air. Keep the needle tip in the medicine.\n6. Pull back the plunger to the line on your syringe for your dose. For example, if you need 1 cubic centimeter (cc) of medicine, pull the plunger to the line marked 1 cc on the syringe. Note that some bottles of medicine may say mL (milliliters). One cc of medicine is the same amount as 1 mL of medicine.\n\n**To Remove Air Bubbles From the Syringe**\n\nKeep the syringe tip in the medicine:\n\n* Tap the syringe with your finger to move air bubbles to the top. Then push gently on the plunger to push the air bubbles back into the vial.\n* If you have a lot of bubbles, push the plunger to push all the medicine back into the vial. Draw medicine out again slowly and tap air bubbles out. Double check that you still have the right amount of medicine drawn up.\n\n**Remove the Syringe From the Vial**\n\nRemove the syringe from the vial and keep the needle clean:\n\n* If you plan to put the syringe down, put the cover back on the needle.\n\n---\n\n**Drawing Medicine Out of a Vial**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Your Supplies**\n\n*   Medicine vial\n*   Syringe\n*   Alcohol pad\n*   Sharps container\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Getting Prepared**\n\n1.  **Check Your Medicine**\n    *   Check the label to ensure you have the right medicine.\n    *   Verify the date on the vial and discard any expired medication.\n    *   If using a multi-dose vial, read or ask about instructions for mixing the medicine (if necessary).\n    *   Write the date on the vial if you plan to use it multiple times.\n    *   Inspect the medicine in the vial for changes in color, small pieces floating in the liquid, cloudiness, or any other abnormalities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Getting the Vial Ready**\n\n1.  If this is your first time using the medicine, remove the cap from the vial.\n2.  Wipe the rubber top clean with an alcohol pad to prevent contamination.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Filling the Syringe With Medicine**\n\n1.

You also may have trouble turning your head far enough to check out your blind spot.\n* **Slower reflexes**: Reaction time often slows with age, making it harder to react quickly to avoid other cars or obstacles.\n* **Vision problems**: As your eyes age, it's common to have a harder time seeing clearly at night due to glare. Certain eye conditions can cause vision loss, which makes it harder to see other drivers and street signs.\n* **Hearing problems**: Hearing loss makes it harder to hear horns and other street noise. You also may not hear sounds of trouble coming from your own car.\n* **Dementia**: People with dementia may get lost more easily, even in familiar places. People who have dementia often do not know they have driving problems. If a loved one has dementia, family and friends should monitor their driving. People with severe dementia should not drive.\n* **Medicine side effects**: Many older adults take more than one medicine.

    "content": "**Dronabinol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDronabinol is used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in people who have already taken other medications to treat this type of nausea and vomiting without good results. Dronabinol is also used to treat loss of appetite and weight loss in people who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDronabinol comes as a capsule and as a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. When dronabinol capsules and solution are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, it is usually taken 1 to 3 hours before chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy, for a total of 4 to 6 doses a day.\n\n*   Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew or crush them.\n*   Swallow the dronabinol solution with a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces).\n*   Always use the oral dosing syringe that comes with dronabinol solution to measure your dose. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to measure your dose of dronabinol solution.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dronabinol and may gradually increase your dose. Your doctor may also decrease your dose if you experience side effects that do not go away after 1 to 3 days. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with dronabinol.\n\nDronabinol may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.

This may cause harm if there is a problem with the body's normal reflexes (such as gagging and coughing).\n\n**Causes**\n\nSome drooling in infants and toddlers is normal. It may occur with teething. Drooling in infants and young children may get worse with colds and allergies.\n\nDrooling may happen if your body makes too much saliva. Infections can cause this, including:\n\n*   Mononucleosis\n*   Peritonsillar abscess\n*   Strep throat\n*   Sinus infections\n*   Tonsillitis\n\nOther conditions that can cause too much saliva are:\n\n*   Allergies\n*   Heartburn or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n*   Poisoning (especially by pesticides)\n*   Pregnancy (may be due to pregnancy side effects, such as nausea or reflux)\n*   Reaction to snake or insect venom\n*   Swollen adenoids\n*   Use of certain medicines\n\nDrooling may also be caused by nervous system disorders that make it hard to swallow. Examples are:\n\n*   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS\n*   Autism\n*   Cerebral palsy (CP)\n*   Down syndrome\n*   Multiple sclerosis\n*   Parkinson disease\n*   Stroke\n\n**Home Care**\n\nPopsicles or other cold objects (such as frozen bagels) may be helpful for young children who are drooling while teething.

This is called aspiration. A speech therapist may provide information about:\n\n*   How to hold your head\n*   Lip and mouth exercises\n*   How to encourage you to swallow more often\n\nDrooling caused by nervous system problems can often be managed with drugs that reduce saliva production. Different drops, patches, pills or liquid medicines may be tried.\n\nIf you have severe drooling, the provider may recommend:\n\n*   Botulinum toxin (Botox) shots\n*   Radiation to the salivary glands\n*   Surgery to remove the salivary glands\n\n---\n\n**Drooling**\n\nDrooling is saliva flowing outside the mouth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSome drooling in infants and toddlers is normal.

People who are drowsy may fall asleep when they do not want to or at times which can lead to safety concerns.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (without a known cause) may be a sign of a sleep disorder.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, and boredom can all contribute to excessive sleepiness. However, these conditions more often cause fatigue and apathy.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDrowsiness may be due to the following:\n\n* Long-term (chronic) pain\n* Diabetes\n* Having to work long hours or different shifts (nights, weekends)\n* Insomnia and other problems falling or staying asleep\n* Changes in blood sodium levels (hyponatremia or hypernatremia)\n* Medicines (tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antihistamines, certain painkillers, some psychiatric drugs)\n* Not sleeping long enough\n* Sleep disorders (such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy)\n* Too much calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia)\n* Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nYou can relieve drowsiness by treating the cause of the problem. First, determine whether your drowsiness is due to depression, anxiety, boredom, or stress. If you are not sure, talk with your health care provider.\n\nFor drowsiness due to medicines, talk to your provider about switching or stopping your medicines. But, DO NOT stop taking or change your medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\nDo not drive when drowsy.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will examine you to determine the cause of your drowsiness. You will be asked about your sleep patterns and health. Questions may include:\n\n* How well do you sleep?\n* How much do you sleep?\n* Do you snore?\n* Do you fall asleep during the day when you do not plan to nap (such as when watching TV or reading)? If so, do you awake feeling refreshed? How often does this happen?\n* Are you depressed, anxious, stressed, or bored?\n* What medicines do you take?\n* What have you done to try to relieve the drowsiness? How well did it work?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Blood tests (such as a CBC and blood differential, blood sugar level, electrolytes, calcium, and thyroid hormone levels)\n* CT or MRI scan of the head\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* Sleep studies\n* Urine tests (such as a urinalysis)\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of your drowsiness.\n\n---\n\n**Drowsiness: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Long-term (chronic) pain\n*   Diabetes\n*   Having to work long hours or different shifts (nights, weekends)\n*   Insomnia and other problems falling or staying asleep\n*   Changes in blood sodium levels (hyponatremia or hypernatremia)\n*   Medicines (tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antihistamines, certain painkillers, some psychiatric drugs)\n*   Not sleeping long enough\n*   Sleep disorders (such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy)\n*   Too much calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia)\n*   Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nYou can relieve drowsiness by treating the cause of the problem.

    "content": "**Droxidopa: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDroxidopa is used to treat symptoms (dizziness, lightheadedness, or a fainting sensation [feeling that you are about to black out]) of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (a sudden fall in blood pressure that occurs when a person assumes a standing position caused by certain nervous system conditions). Droxidopa is in a class of medications called alpha and beta-adrenergic agonists. It works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine, a natural substance in the body.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDroxidopa comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day (morning, midday, and late afternoon). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take droxidopa exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of droxidopa and gradually increase your dose every 1 to 2 days.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDroxidopa may cause or worsen supine hypertension (high blood pressure that occurs when lying flat on your back) that may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. You should raise the head of your bed when resting or sleeping and take droxidopa at least 3 hours before bedtime to reduce the risk of supine hypertension. You should have your blood pressure checked before starting treatment, anytime your dose is increased, and regularly while you are taking droxidopa.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking droxidopa.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Supine hypertension (high blood pressure that occurs when lying flat on your back)\n*   Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke\n\n\\n\\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of overdose, such as difficulty breathing or a rapid heartbeat, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore droxidopa capsules at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze the capsules. Dispose of any unused capsules responsibly.\n\n\\n\\n**Brand names**\n\nDroxidopa is available under the brand name Northyde.\n\n---\n\n**Droxidopa: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking droxidopa, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to droxidopa, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and medications), other medications, or any of the ingredients in the capsule. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking droxidopa. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, coronary artery disease (blockage or narrowing of the blood vessels that lead to the heart), irregular heartbeat, heart failure, or heart or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking droxidopa, call your doctor.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nSkip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDroxidopa may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* headache\n* dizziness\n* nausea\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* confusion\n* high fever\n* muscle stiffness\n* unusual movements that you cannot control\n* changes in awareness, thinking, or behavior\n\nDroxidopa may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website https://goo.gl/c4Rm4p for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. https://www.upandaway.org\n\n---\n\n**Droxidopa: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n* **In case of emergency/overdose**: In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.\n* **What other information should I know?**: Keep all appointments with your doctor. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking.

    "content": "**Drug Reactions**\n\nMost of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies.\n\n**What is a Drug Interaction?**\n\nA drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include:\n\n*   Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners\n*   Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit\n*   Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners\n*   Drugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers\n\nInteractions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work.\n\n**What are Side Effects?**\n\nSide effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth, or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine. Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat.\n\n**What are Drug Allergies?**\n\nDrug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is less common.\n\n**How Can I Stay Safe When Taking Medicines?**\n\nWhen you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine, make sure you understand how to take it correctly.

    "content": "**Drug Testing**\n\n**What is a Drug Test?**\n\nA drug test looks for signs of one or more illegal drugs or certain prescription medicines that can be misused. The test is usually done with a sample of your urine (pee). Less commonly, drug testing uses a sample of your blood, saliva (spit), hair, sweat, fingernails, or breath.\n\n**What Does a Drug Test Check For?**\n\nA drug test can check for a single drug or for a group of drugs in your body. Drug tests commonly test for:\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Amphetamines, such as methamphetamine and Ecstasy (MDMA)\n*   Barbiturates, such as phenobarbital and secobarbital\n*   Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam or clonazepam\n*   Cocaine\n*   Marijuana (cannabis, THC)\n*   Opioids and opiates, such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl\n*   Phencyclidine (PCP)\n*   Anabolic steroids\n\n**How Long Do Drugs Last in Your Body?**\n\nThe length of time a drug lasts in your body depends on:\n\n*   The type of drug\n*   How much you used\n*   How long you were using it before the test\n*   How your body reacts to the drug\n\n---\n\n**Drug Testing: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Category:** health\n\nDrugs are chemical substances that can change how your body and mind work. A drug test looks for signs of one or more illegal drugs or certain prescription medicines that can be misused.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nDrug testing is used to find out whether you have been using or misusing one or more drugs but can't diagnose a drug use disorder (addiction).\n\nA drug test may be used for different purposes, including:\n\n* Employment. Employers may require that you pass a drug test before they will hire you.\n* Sports. Professional and other athletes are often tested for drugs that are used to improve performance, such as anabolic steroids that help build muscle.\n* Substance use disorder treatment. Drug testing may be used to monitor treatment in programs for drug or alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n* Legal evidence. Testing may be part of a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation.\n* To prevent prescription drug misuse. If you take a prescription medicine that can be addictive, such as opioids for chronic (long-term) pain, your provider may order a drug test to make sure you're taking the medicine correctly.\n\n**Why do I need a drug test?**\n\nYou may be asked to take a drug test for a job, to participate in certain organized sports, or as part of a police investigation or court case. In a hospital emergency room, a health care provider may order a drug test if you have signs of a possible drug overdose. Newborns can also be tested for possible prenatal exposure to illegal drugs.\n\n**What happens during a drug test?**\n\nDrug testing may be done in many different locations, including labs, hospitals, drug treatment centers, and workplaces.\n\nUrine is the most commonly used sample for drug testing. You will be given instructions for how to collect your sample. In certain cases, a health care professional or other person may need to be present while you provide your sample. This is to make sure the urine is yours and isn't contaminated with anything that might affect the test results.\n\nIf a blood sample is used to test for drugs, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nBe sure to tell the testing professional if you are taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, or supplements, because these substances may affect your test results. Also, you should avoid foods with poppy seeds, which can show up as opiates in a drug test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere are no known physical risks to having a drug test. But if drugs show up in your results, it may affect your job, your eligibility to play sports, the outcome of a legal matter, or other parts of your life.\n\nBefore you take a drug test, make sure you know:\n\n* What you are being tested for\n* Why you are being tested\n* How the results will be used\n\n---\n\n**Drug Testing**\n\nIf you're facing a drug test, it's essential to understand what's involved and what the results mean.\n\n**Before You Take a Drug Test**\n\nMake sure you know:\n\n* What you are being tested for\n* Why you are being tested\n* How the results will be used\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about a drug test, talk with your provider or the person or organization that is asking for the test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nA positive test result means that one or more drugs were found in amounts that suggest drug use or misuse. You'll usually have a follow-up test to confirm the results.\n\nA false positive can occur if the test reacts with other chemicals in your body from certain over-the-counter medicines, prescriptions, and foods. A confirmatory test is a more sensitive test that provides more accurate results.\n\n**Negative Test Result**\n\nIf a drug test result is negative, it means that either:\n\n* The drugs that were tested were not found in your sample\n* A very small amount of drugs was found, but not enough to count as a positive test result for drugs\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Drug Test?**\n\nIf you test positive for a legal drug prescribed by your provider, your employer can't punish you, unless the drug is affecting your ability to perform your job.\n\nIf you test positive for marijuana and live in a state where it is legal, employers may still be able to punish you in some states. Employers may do this because they want a drug-free workplace. Also, marijuana is still illegal under federal law.\n\n**Home Tests**\n\nYou can buy home tests for many illegal and prescription drugs. There are two types of tests:\n\n* At-home tests let you do the entire test at home and get rapid results. But if the test result is positive for drugs, you'll need to have a follow-up lab test to check the accuracy of the result.\n* A self-collection test has a kit for gathering urine, saliva, or another type of sample to send to a lab for testing.\n\nWhen using home tests, be careful to follow all the instructions. It's best to talk with your provider about using home drug testing so you can decide if it's right for your situation.\n\n**References**\n\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* FDA: US Food and Drug Administration\n* Drugs.com\n* Merck Manual Professional Version\n* National Institute on Drug Abuse\n* Nemours KidsHealth\n* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n* Testing.com\n\n---\n\n**Drug Testing**\n\nAre you considering drug testing for yourself or someone else? This article will provide an overview of the process, its benefits and drawbacks, and what to expect during the test.\n\n**What is Drug Testing?**\n\nDrug testing is a medical procedure used to detect the presence of illicit substances in an individual's system.

While it has its drawbacks, the benefits of drug testing far outweigh the risks. If you are considering drug testing for yourself or someone else, be sure to discuss any concerns you may have with a medical professional.",

    "content": "**Drug Use and Addiction**\n\nAlso called: Drug Abuse, Substance Use\n\n**Basics**\n\n* Drugs are chemical substances that can change how your body and mind work.\n* They include prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.\n\n**What is drug use?**\n\n* Using illegal substances, such as:\n\t+ Anabolic steroids\n\t+ Club drugs\n\t+ Cocaine\n\t+ Heroin\n\t+ Inhalants\n\t+ Marijuana\n\t+ Methamphetamines\n* Misusing prescription medicines, including opioids.\n* Misusing over-the-counter medicines.\n\n**Why is drug use dangerous?**\n\n* It can harm your brain and body, sometimes permanently.\n* It can hurt the people around you, including friends, families, and kids.\n* If you are pregnant, it can harm your fetus.\n* Drug use can also lead to mild, moderate, or severe substance use disorders. Substance use disorders are sometimes called addiction.\n\n**What is drug addiction?**\n\n* A chronic brain disease that causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause.\n* Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.\n* The brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a \"relapsing\" disease.\n\n**Who is at risk for drug addiction?**\n\n* Various risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including:\n\t+ Genetic factors\n\t+ Environmental factors\n\t+ Developmental factors\n\t+ Mental health problems\n\t+ Trouble at home\n\t+ Trouble in school, at work, or with making friends\n\t+ Hanging around other people who use drugs\n\t+ Starting drug use when you're young\n\n**What are the signs that someone has a drug problem?**\n\n* Changing friends a lot\n* Spending a lot of time alone\n* Losing interest in favorite things\n* Not taking care of themselves\n* Being very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense\n* Quickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good\n* Having different eating or sleeping habits\n* Missing important appointments\n* Having problems at work or at school\n* Having problems in personal or family relationships\n\n**What are the treatments for drug addiction?**\n\n* Counseling, medicines, or both.\n* Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.\n\n**Can drug use and addiction be prevented?**\n\n* Yes, drug use and addiction can be prevented.\n* Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction.\n\n---\n\n**Drug Use and Addiction**\n\n**Start Here**\n\n*   **Drug Addiction (Substance Use Disorder)**: A chronic brain disease that causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause.\n*   **Drugs A to Z**: A comprehensive list of drugs, their effects, and risks.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Drug Testing**: A method used to detect the presence of drugs in an individual's system.\n*   **Mental Health Screening**: A tool used to identify individuals who may be at risk for substance use disorders.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n*   **Drug Use and Addiction: Prevention**: Strategies and techniques used to prevent drug use and addiction.\n*   **Harm Reduction**: Methods used to reduce the negative consequences of drug use.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **Medications for Substance Use Disorders**: A list of medications used to treat substance use disorders.\n*   **Treatment of Substance Use Disorders**: A comprehensive approach to treating substance use disorders.\n\n**Living With**\n\n*   **Intervention: Help a Loved One Overcome Addiction**: A guide on how to help a loved one overcome addiction.\n*   **Related Issues**: Topics related to drug use and addiction, such as drugged driving and infectious diseases.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Kratom**: A plant-based substance that has been used for its medicinal properties.\n*   **Psychedelic and Dissociative Drugs**: A category of drugs that alter perception and consciousness.\n*   **Synthetic Cathinones (\"Bath Salts\")**: A type of synthetic stimulant.\n\n**Images**\n\n*   **Drug Index**: A visual guide to different types of drugs.\n\n**Health Check Tools**\n\n*   **Addiction Test**: A tool used to assess an individual's risk for substance use disorders.\n*   **Substance Abuse Screening**: A method used to identify individuals who may be at risk for substance use disorders.\n\n**Test Your Knowledge**\n\n*   **Fact or Fiction?

Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.\n\n**Is Everyone Who Takes Drugs Addicted?**\n\nNot everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone's bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors, including genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.\n\n**Who Is At Risk For Drug Addiction?**\n\nVarious risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including:\n\n* Your biology: People can react to drugs differently.\n* Mental health problems: Untreated mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), increase the likelihood of addiction.\n* Trouble at home: An unhappy home environment can contribute to a drug problem.\n* Trouble in school, at work, or with making friends: Using drugs to cope with these issues can lead to addiction.\n* Hanging around other people who use drugs: Peer influence can encourage drug use.\n* Starting drug use when young: Early exposure to drugs can increase the risk of addiction later in life.\n\n**What Are The Signs That Someone Has A Drug Problem?**\n\nSigns that someone has a drug problem include:\n\n* Changing friends frequently\n* Spending a lot of time alone\n* Losing interest in favorite activities\n* Neglecting personal hygiene and self-care\n* Displaying excessive energy, talking rapidly, or saying nonsensical things\n* Quickly shifting between feeling bad and feeling good\n* Changes in eating or sleeping habits\n* Missing important appointments\n* Problems at work or school\n* Strained relationships with family and friends\n\n**What Are The Treatments For Drug Addiction?**\n\nTreatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or a combination of both. Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.\n\nThe counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy, helping you:\n\n* Understand why the addiction began\n* See how drugs changed your behavior\n* Learn to manage personal problems\n* Avoid places, people, and situations where drugs are accessible\n\nIf you stop or cut back on drugs, you may experience withdrawal symptoms. Medicines can help alleviate these symptoms. For certain addictions, medicines can re-establish normal brain function and decrease cravings.\n\n**Can Drug Use And Addiction Be Prevented?**\n\nYes, drug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media can reduce or prevent drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.\n\n---\n\n**Drug Use and Addiction**\n\nDrug use and addiction are preventable.

    "content": "**Drug Allergies**\n\nA drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A drug allergy occurs when your body's immune system produces a substance (antibody) against a particular drug.\n*   The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, causing your allergy symptoms.\n*   Common allergy-causing drugs include:\n    *   Drugs used to treat seizures\n    *   Insulin (mainly insulin from animal sources)\n    *   Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes\n    *   Penicillin and related antibiotics\n    *   Sulfa drugs\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives.\n*   These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug.\n*   Serum sickness is a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine.\n*   Common symptoms of a drug allergy include:\n    *   Hives\n    *   Itching of the skin or eyes (common)\n    *   Skin rash (common)\n    *   Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face\n    *   Wheezing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn examination may show:\n\n*   Decreased blood pressure\n*   Hives\n*   Rash\n*   Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema)\n*   Wheezing\n\n---\n\n**Drug Allergies**\n\nA drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. The reaction of the body when a drug allergy is present generally involves special cells called B and T cell lymphocytes.\n\nCommon allergy-causing drugs include:\n\n* Drugs used to treat seizures\n* Insulin (mainly insulin from animal sources)\n* Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)\n* Penicillin and related antibiotics\n* Sulfa drugs\n\nMost side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction caused by the formation of IgE antibodies. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Drug allergies can also be associated with low blood counts.\n\nCommon symptoms of a drug allergy include:\n\n* Hives\n* Itching of the skin or eyes (common)\n* Skin rash (common)\n* Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face\n* Wheezing\n\nSymptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n* Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching\n* Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)\n* Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)\n* Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis\n\nThe offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.\n\nIn some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.\n\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.\n\nIf you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.\n\nIn some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.\n\nYour provider may also recommend desensitization.\n\n---\n\n**Drug Allergies**\n\n**Common Symptoms of a Drug Allergy**\n\n*   Hives\n*   Itching of the skin or eyes (common)\n*   Skin rash (common)\n*   Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face\n*   Wheezing\n\n**Symptoms of Anaphylaxis**\n\n*   Abdominal pain or cramping\n*   Confusion\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fainting, lightheadedness\n*   Hives over different parts of the body\n*   Nausea, vomiting\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn examination may show:\n\n*   Decreased blood pressure\n*   Hives\n*   Rash\n*   Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema)\n*   Wheezing\n\nSkin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines.

    "content": "**Drug Use First Aid**\n\n**Considerations**\n\nMany drugs and medicines can cause harm if taken incorrectly or misused. Many street drugs, such as methamphetamine or crack cocaine, have no known beneficial use in any amount.\n\nMedicines that are used to treat a health problem can be misused, either accidentally or intentionally. This can occur when people take more than the normal dose or if the medicine is taken with alcohol or other medicines.\n\nDrug interactions may also lead to side effects. So, it is important to let your health care provider know about all the medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, supplements, medicines from other countries, and other medicines or drugs you bought without a prescription.\n\nMany drugs and medicines are addictive. Sometimes, the addiction is gradual. And some drugs (such as cocaine and opioids) can cause addiction after only a few doses. Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and can't stop, even if they want to.\n\nSomeone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Treatment can help prevent or lessen withdrawal symptoms.\n\nA drug dose that is large enough to cause harm to the body (toxic) is called an overdose. This may occur suddenly, when a large amount of the drug is taken at one time. It may also occur gradually as a drug builds up in the body over a longer period. Prompt medical attention may save the life of someone who has an overdose.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAn overdose of narcotics can cause sleepiness, slowed breathing, and even unconsciousness.\n\nWhen prescription medicines are taken in higher than prescribed amounts, serious side effects may occur. Uppers (stimulants) produce excitement, increased heart rate, and rapid breathing. Downers (depressants) do the opposite.\n\nMind-altering drugs are called hallucinogens. They vary widely in effect and include drugs like peyote and LSD, which primarily affect serotonin receptors in the brain, as well as ketamine and PCP (angel dust), which affect multiple receptors in the brain. These mind-altering substances are not well understood and in some cases may cause paranoia, dangerous behaviors, or extreme social withdrawal.\n\nCannabis drugs such as marijuana may cause relaxation, impaired motor skills, and increased appetite.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDrug overdose symptoms vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include:\n\n*   Abnormal pupil size or pupils that don't change size when light is shined into them\n*   Agitation\n*   Seizures, tremors\n*   Delusional or paranoid behavior, hallucinations\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Drowsiness, coma\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Staggering or unsteady gait (ataxia)\n*   Sweating or extremely dry, hot skin, blisters, rash\n*   Violent or aggressive behavior\n*   Death\n\nDrug withdrawal symptoms also vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include:\n\n*   Abdominal cramping\n*   Agitation, restlessness\n*   Cold sweat\n*   Delusions, hallucinations\n*   Depression\n*   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea\n*   Seizures\n*   Death\n\n**First Aid**\n\n1.  Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If needed, begin CPR. If unconscious but breathing, carefully place the person in the recovery position by log rolling the person toward you onto their left side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If the person is conscious, loosen the clothing and keep the person warm, and provide reassurance. Try to keep the person calm. If you suspect an overdose, try to prevent the person from taking more drugs. Call for medical help right away.\n2.  Treat the person for signs of shock. Signs include weakness, bluish lips and fingernails, clammy skin, paleness, and decreasing alertness.\n3.  If the person is having seizures, give first aid for seizures.\n4.  Keep monitoring the person's vital signs (pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure, if possible) until emergency medical help arrives.\n5.  If possible, try to determine which drug(s) were taken, how much and when. Save any pill bottles or other drug containers. Give this information to emergency personnel.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nThings you shouldn't do when tending to someone who has overdosed:\n\n*   Do not put your own safety in danger. Some drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behavior. Call for medical help.\n*   Do not try to reason with someone who is on drugs. Do not expect them to behave reasonably.\n*   Do not offer your opinions when giving help. You don't need to know why drugs were taken in order to give effective first aid.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nDrug emergencies are not always easy to identify. If you think someone has overdosed, or if you think someone is having withdrawal, give first aid and seek medical help.\n\nTry to find out what drug the person has taken. If possible, collect all drug containers and any remaining drug samples or the person's vomit and take them to the hospital.\n\nIf you or someone you are with has overdosed, call 911 or the local emergency number or the poison control center, which can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAt the hospital, the provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as necessary.\n\nThese may include:\n\n*   Activated charcoal and laxatives to help remove swallowed drugs from the body (sometimes given through a tube placed through the mouth into the stomach)\n*   Airway and breathing support, including oxygen, a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   CT scan of the head, neck, and other areas\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n*   Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein)\n*   Medicines to reverse the effects of the drugs\n*   Mental health and social work evaluation and assistance\n\nIn serious cases, the person may need to be admitted to the hospital for further treatment.\n\nOutcome depends on many things, including:\n\n*   The type and amount of drugs\n*   Where the drugs entered the body, such as through the mouth, nose, or by injection (intravenous or skin popping)\n*   Whether the person has other health problems\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany resources are available for treating substance use. Ask your provider about local resources.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOverdose from drugs; Drug abuse first aid\n\n---\n\n**Drug Use First Aid**\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Drug Use and Addiction\n*   First Aid\n\n**Considerations**\n\nMany drugs and medicines can cause harm if taken incorrectly or misused.

This includes vitamins, supplements, medicines from other countries, and other medicines or drugs you bought without a prescription.\n\nMany drugs and medicines are addictive. Sometimes, the addiction is gradual. And some drugs (such as cocaine and opioids) can cause addiction after only a few doses. Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and can't stop, even if they want to.\n\nSomeone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Treatment can help prevent or lessen withdrawal symptoms.\n\nA drug dose that is large enough to cause harm to the body (toxic) is called an overdose. This may occur suddenly, when a large amount of the drug is taken at one time. It may also occur gradually as a drug builds up in the body over a longer period. Prompt medical attention may save the life of someone who has an overdose.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAn overdose of narcotics can cause sleepiness, slowed breathing, and even unconsciousness.\n\nWhen prescription medicines are taken in higher than prescribed amounts, serious side effects may occur. Uppers (stimulants) produce excitement, increased heart rate, and rapid breathing. Downers (depressants) do the opposite.\n\nMind-altering drugs are called hallucinogens. They vary widely in effect and include drugs like peyote and LSD, which primarily affect serotonin receptors in the brain, as well as ketamine and PCP (angel dust), which affect multiple receptors in the brain. These mind-altering substances are not well understood and in some cases may cause paranoia, dangerous behaviors, or extreme social withdrawal.\n\nCannabis drugs such as marijuana may cause relaxation, impaired motor skills, and increased appetite.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDrug overdose symptoms vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include:\n\n*   Abnormal pupil size or pupils that don't change size when light is shined into them\n*   Agitation\n*   Seizures, tremors\n*   Delusional or paranoid behavior, hallucinations\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Drowsiness, coma\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Staggering or unsteady gait (ataxia)\n*   Sweating or extremely dry, hot skin, blisters, rash\n*   Violent or aggressive behavior\n*   Death\n\nDrug withdrawal symptoms also vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include:\n\n*   Abdominal cramping\n*   Agitation, restlessness\n*   Cold sweat\n*   Delusions, hallucinations\n*   Depression\n*   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea\n*   Seizures\n*   Death\n\n**First Aid**\n\n1.  Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If needed, begin CPR. If unconscious but breathing, carefully place the person in the recovery position by log rolling the person toward you onto their left side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If the person is conscious, loosen the clothing and keep the person warm, and provide reassurance. Try to keep the person calm. If you suspect an overdose, try to prevent the person from taking more drugs. Call for medical help right away.\n\n2.  Treat the person for signs of shock. Signs include weakness, bluish lips and fingernails, clammy skin, paleness, and decreasing alertness.\n\n3.  If the person is having seizures, give first aid for seizures.\n\n4.  Keep monitoring the person's vital signs (pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure, if possible) until emergency medical help arrives.\n\n5.  If possible, try to determine which drug(s) were taken, how much and when. Save any pill bottles or other drug containers. Give this information to emergency personnel.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nThings you shouldn't do when tending to someone who has overdosed:\n\nDo not put your own safety in danger. Some drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behavior. Call for medical help.\nDo not try to reason with someone who is on drugs. Do not expect them to behave reasonably.\nDo not offer your opinions when giving help. You don't need to know why drugs were taken in order to give effective first aid.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nDrug emergencies are not always easy to identify. If you think someone has overdosed, or if you think someone is having withdrawal, give first aid and seek medical help.\n\nTry to find out what drug the person has taken. If possible, collect all drug containers and any remaining drug samples or the person's vomit and take them to the hospital.\n\nIf you or someone you are with has overdosed, call 911 or the local emergency number or the poison control center, which can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAt the hospital, the provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as necessary.\n\nThese may include:\n\nActivated charcoal and laxatives to help remove swallowed drugs from the body (sometimes given through a tube placed through the mouth into the stomach)\nAirway and breathing support, including oxygen, a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, and breathing machine (ventilator)\nBlood and urine tests\nCT scan of the head, neck, and other areas\nChest x-ray\nECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\nIntravenous fluids (fluids through a vein)\nMedicines to reverse the effects of the drugs\nMental health and social work evaluation and assistance\n\nIn serious cases, the person may need to be admitted to the hospital for further treatment.\n\nOutcome depends on many things, including:\n\nThe type and amount of drugs\nWhere the drugs entered the body, such as through the mouth, nose, or by injection (intravenous or skin popping)\nWhether the person has other health problems\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany resources are available for treating substance use. Ask your provider about local resources.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOverdose from drugs; Drug abuse first aid\n\n---\n\n**Drug Use First Aid**\n\n**Considerations**\n\nMany drugs and medicines can cause harm if taken incorrectly or misused. Many street drugs, such as methamphetamine or crack cocaine, have no known beneficial use in any amount.\n\nMedicines that are used to treat a health problem can be misused, either accidentally or intentionally. This can occur when people take more than the normal dose or if the medicine is taken with alcohol or other medicines.\n\nDrug interactions may also lead to side effects.

The medicines listed below, however, are more likely to cause diarrhea:\n\n*   Laxatives are meant to cause diarrhea.\n    They work either by drawing water into the gut or by causing the muscles of the intestines to contract.\n    However, taking too much of a laxative can cause diarrhea that is a problem.\n*   Antacids that have magnesium in them may also cause diarrhea or make it worse.\n*   Antibiotics also can produce diarrhea.\n    Normally, the intestines have many different bacteria. They keep each other in balance. Antibiotics destroy some of these bacteria, which allow other types to grow too much.\n    In some cases, antibiotics can allow a type of bacteria called Clostridioides difficile to grow too much. This can lead to severe, watery, and often bloody diarrhea due to a condition called pseudomembranous colitis.\n*   Many other drugs may cause diarrhea:\n    *   Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer.\n    *   Drugs used to treat heartburn and stomach ulcers, such as omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlanxoprazole (Dexilant), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Zantac 360 and Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid).

    "content": "**Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia**\n\nDrug-induced immune hemolytic anemia is a rare blood disorder that occurs when a medicine triggers the body's defense (immune) system to attack its own red blood cells. This causes red blood cells to break down earlier than normal, a process called hemolysis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\n\nNormally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.\n\nIn some cases, a drug can cause the immune system to mistake your own red blood cells for foreign substances. The body responds by making antibodies to attack the body's own red blood cells. The antibodies attach to red blood cells and cause them to break down too early.\n\n**Drugs that can cause this type of hemolytic anemia**\n\n*   Cephalosporins (a class of antibiotics), most common cause\n*   Dapsone\n*   Levodopa\n*   Levofloxacin\n*   Methyldopa\n*   Nitrofurantoin\n*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n*   Penicillin and its derivatives\n*   Phenazopyridine (Pyridium)\n*   Quinidine\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Dark urine\n*   Fatigue\n*   Pale skin color\n*   Rapid heart rate\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show an enlarged spleen. You may have blood and urine tests to help diagnose this condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Absolute reticulocyte count to determine if red blood cells are being created in the bone marrow at an appropriate rate\n*   Direct or indirect Coombs test to check if there are antibodies against red blood cells that are causing red blood cells to die too early\n*   Indirect bilirubin levels to check for jaundice\n*   Red blood cell count\n*   Serum haptoglobin to check if red blood cells are being destroyed too early\n*   Lactate dehydrogenase level, which increases with red cell destruction\n*   Urine hemoglobin to check for hemolysis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nStopping the drug that is causing the problem may relieve or control the symptoms.\n\nYou may need to take a medicine called prednisone to suppress the immune response against the red blood cells.

Other types of liver injury include viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, iron overload, and fatty liver.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe liver helps the body break down certain medicines. These include some drugs that you buy over-the-counter or your health care provider prescribes for you. However, the process is slower in some people. This can make you more likely to get liver damage.\n\nSome drugs can cause hepatitis with small doses, even if the liver breakdown system is normal. Large doses of many medicines can damage a normal liver.\n\nMany different drugs can cause drug-induced hepatitis. Painkillers and fever reducers that contain acetaminophen are a common cause of liver injury, particularly when taken in doses greater than those recommended. People who drink alcohol to excess are more likely to have this problem.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, may also cause drug-induced hepatitis. Other drugs that can lead to liver injury include amiodarone, anabolic steroids, birth control pills, chlorpromazine, erythromycin, halothane, methyldopa, isoniazid, methotrexate, statins, sulfa drugs, tetracyclines, amoxicillin-clavulanate, some anti-seizure medicines, disulfiram, niacin, azathoaprine, and ketoconazole.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include abdominal pain, dark urine, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, headache, jaundice, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, rash, and white or clay-colored stools.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou will have blood tests to check liver function. Liver enzymes will be higher if you have the condition. Your provider will do a physical exam to check for an enlarged liver and abdominal tenderness in the right upper part of the belly area. A rash or fever may be part of some drug reactions that affect the liver.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe only specific treatment for most cases of liver damage caused by taking a drug is to stop taking the drug that caused the problem. However, if you took high doses of acetaminophen, you should get treated for liver injury in the emergency department or other acute treatment setting as soon as possible as there is a specific antidote for acetaminophen poisoning.\n\nIf symptoms are severe, you should rest and avoid heavy exercise, alcohol, acetaminophen, and any other substances that might harm the liver.

It is similar but not identical to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe most common medicines known to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus are:\n\n* Isoniazid\n* Hydralazine\n* Procainamide\n* Tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors (such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab)\n* Minocycline\n* Quinidine\n\nOther less common drugs may also cause the condition. These may include:\n\n* Anti-seizure medicines\n* Capoten\n* Chlorpromazine\n* Methyldopa\n* Sulfasalazine\n* Levamisole, typically as a contaminant of cocaine\n\nCancer immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab can also cause a variety of autoimmune reactions including drug-induced lupus.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Fever\n* General ill feeling (malaise)\n* Joint pain\n* Joint swelling\n* Loss of appetite\n* Pleuritic chest pain (sharp pain that is worse with breathing in)\n* Skin rash on areas exposed to sunlight\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam and listen to your chest with a stethoscope. The provider may hear a sound called a heart friction rub or pleural friction rub.\n\nA skin exam shows a rash.\n\nJoints may be swollen and tender.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Antihistone antibody\n* Antinuclear antibody (ANA) panel\n* Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) panel\n\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\nComprehensive chemistry panel\nUrinalysis\n\nA chest x-ray may show signs of pleuritis or pericarditis (inflammation around the lining of the lung or heart). An ECG may show that the heart is affected.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost of the time, symptoms go away within weeks after stopping the medicine that caused the condition.\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat arthritis and pleurisy\n* Corticosteroid creams to treat skin rashes\n* Antimalarial drugs (hydroxychloroquine) to treat skin and arthritis symptoms\n\nIf the condition is affecting your heart, kidney, or nervous system, you may be prescribed high doses of corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone) and immune system suppressants (azathioprine or cyclophosphamide).

This is rare.\n\nWhen the disease is active, you should wear protective clothing and sunglasses to guard against too much sun.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, drug-induced lupus erythematosus is not as severe as SLE. The symptoms often go away within a few days to weeks after stopping the medicine you were taking. Rarely, kidney inflammation (nephritis) can develop with drug-induced lupus caused by TNF inhibitors or with ANCA vasculitis due to hydralazine or levamisole. Nephritis may require treatment with prednisone and immunosuppressive medicines.\n\nAvoid taking the drug that caused the reaction in future. Symptoms are likely to return if you do so.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Infection\n*   Thrombocytopenic purpura -- bleeding near the skin surface, resulting from a low number of platelets in the blood\n*   Hemolytic anemia\n*   Myocarditis\n*   Pericarditis\n*   Nephritis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You develop new symptoms when taking any of the medicines listed above.\n*   Your symptoms do not get better after you stop taking the medicine that caused the condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWatch for signs of a reaction if you are taking any of the drugs that can cause this problem.\n\n---\n\n**Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus**\n\n**What is drug-induced lupus?**\n\nDrug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is a rare condition where certain medications trigger an autoimmune response, leading to symptoms similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   Medications: Certain drugs can cause DILE, including:\n    *   Hydralazine\n    *   Procainamide\n    *   Isoniazid\n    *   Phenylbutazone\n    *   Minocycline\n    *   Chlorpromazine\n    *   Quinidine\n*   Genetic predisposition: Some people may be more susceptible to developing DILE due to their genetic makeup.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of DILE can vary from person to person but often include:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Fatigue\n*   Joint pain and swelling\n*   Skin rashes\n*   Kidney problems\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing DILE can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other conditions. A healthcare professional will typically perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and order laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This may involve:\n\n*   Stopping the offending medication\n*   Administering corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system\n*   Providing supportive care, such as pain management and wound care\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo minimize the risk of developing DILE, it's essential to:\n\n*   Inform your healthcare provider about any medications you're taking\n*   Follow their instructions carefully\n*   Report any symptoms or concerns promptly\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of drug-induced lupus erythematosus, individuals can take steps to protect themselves from this rare but potentially serious condition.",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000765.htm",
    "content": "**Drug-induced Tremor**\n\nDrug-induced tremor is involuntary shaking due to the use of medicines. Involuntary means you shake without trying to do so and can't stop when you try. The shaking occurs when you move or try to hold your arms, hands, or head in a certain position. It is not associated with other symptoms.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDrug-induced tremor is a nervous system and muscle response to certain medicines. Medicines that can cause tremors include the following:\n\n* Cancer medicines such as thalidomide and cytarabine\n* Seizure medicines such as divalproex sodium (Depakote)\n* Asthma medicines such as theophylline and albuterol\n* Immune suppressing medicines such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus\n* Mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate\n* Stimulants such as caffeine and amphetamines\n* Antidepressant medicines such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics\n* Heart medicines such as amiodarone, procainamide, and others\n* Certain antibiotics\n* Steroids\n* Certain antivirals, such as acyclovir and vidarabine\n* Alcohol\n* Nicotine\n* Certain high blood pressure medicines\n* Epinephrine and norepinephrine\n* Too much thyroid medicine (levothyroxine)\n* Tetrabenazine, a medicine to treat excessive movement disorder\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYour tremor may affect your hands, arms, head, or eyelids. In rare cases, your lower body is affected. Your tremor may not affect both sides of the body equally.\n\nThe shaking is usually fast, about 4 to 12 movements per second.\n\nYour tremor may be:\n\n* Episodic (occurring in bursts, sometimes about an hour after taking the medicine)\n* Intermittent (comes and goes with activity, but not always)\n* Sporadic (happens on occasion)\n\nYour tremor can:\n\n* Occur either with movement or at rest\n* Disappear during sleep\n* Get worse with voluntary movement and emotional stress\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Head nodding\n* Shaking or quivering sound to the voice\n* Problems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider can make the diagnosis by performing a physical exam and asking about your medical and personal history. You will also be asked about the medicines you take.\n\nTests may be done to check for other reasons for your tremor. A tremor that occurs when the muscles are relaxed or that affects the legs or coordination may be a sign of another condition, such as Parkinson disease. The speed of the tremor can be an important way to determine its cause.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDrug-induced tremor often goes away when you stop taking the medicine that is causing the shaking.\n\nYou may not need treatment or changes in the medicine if the tremor is mild and does not interfere with your daily activity.\n\nIf the benefit of the medicine is greater than the problems caused by the tremor, your provider may have you try different dosages of the medicine. Or, you may be prescribed another medicine to treat your condition. In rare cases, a medicine such as propranolol may be added to help control the tremor.\n\nDo not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSevere tremor can interfere with daily activities, especially fine motor skills such as writing, and other activities such as eating or drinking.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you are taking a medicine and a tremor develops that interferes with your activity or is accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Drug-induced Tremor**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nDrug-induced tremor is involuntary shaking due to the use of medicines.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMedicines that can cause tremors include:\n\n*   Cancer medicines such as thalidomide and cytarabine\n*   Seizure medicines such as divalproex sodium (Depakote)\n*   Asthma medicines such as theophylline and albuterol\n*   Immune suppressing medicines such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus\n*   Mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate\n*   Stimulants such as caffeine and amphetamines\n*   Antidepressant medicines such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics\n*   Heart medicines such as amiodarone, procainamide, and others\n*   Certain antibiotics\n*   Steroids\n*   Certain antivirals, such as acyclovir and vidarabine\n*   Alcohol\n*   Nicotine\n*   Certain high blood pressure medicines\n*   Epinephrine and norepinephrine\n*   Too much thyroid medicine (levothyroxine)\n*   Tetrabenazine, a medicine to treat excessive movement disorder\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYour tremor may affect your hands, arms, head, or eyelids. In rare cases, your lower body is affected. Your tremor may not affect both sides of the body equally.\n\nThe shaking is usually fast, about 4 to 12 movements per second.\n\nYour tremor may be:\n\n*   Episodic (occurring in bursts, sometimes about an hour after taking the medicine)\n*   Intermittent (comes and goes with activity, but not always)\n*   Sporadic (happens on occasion)\n\nYour tremor can:\n\n*   Occur either with movement or at rest\n*   Disappear during sleep\n*   Get worse with voluntary movement and emotional stress\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n*   Head nodding\n*   Shaking or quivering sound to the voice\n*   Problems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands\n\n---\n\n**Drug-induced Tremor**\n\nA drug-induced tremor is a type of tremor that occurs as a side effect of certain medications.\n\n**Causes of Drug-induced Tremor**\n\nOther causes of tremors may include:\n\n* Essential tremor\n* Alcohol withdrawal\n* Cigarette smoking\n* Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n* Parkinson disease\n* Adrenal gland tumor (pheochromocytoma)\n* Too much caffeine\n* Disorder in which there is too much copper in the body (Wilson disease)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nBlood tests and imaging tests (such as a CT scan of the head, brain MRI, and x-rays) are usually normal.\n\nYour health care provider can make the diagnosis by performing a physical exam and asking about your medical and personal history. You will also be asked about the medicines you take.\n\nTests may be done to check for other reasons for your tremor. A tremor that occurs when the muscles are relaxed or that affects the legs or coordination may be a sign of another condition, such as Parkinson disease. The speed of the tremor can be an important way to determine its cause.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDrug-induced tremor often goes away when you stop taking the medicine that is causing the shaking.\n\nYou may not need treatment or changes in the medicine if the tremor is mild and does not interfere with your daily activity.\n\nIf the benefit of the medicine is greater than the problems caused by the tremor, your provider may have you try different dosages of the medicine. Or, you may be prescribed another medicine to treat your condition. In rare cases, a medicine such as propranolol may be added to help control the tremor.\n\nDo not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSevere tremor can interfere with daily activities, especially fine motor skills such as writing, and other activities such as eating or drinking.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you are taking a medicine and a tremor develops that interferes with your activity or is accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you take. Ask your provider if it is OK to take over-the-counter medicines that contain stimulants or theophylline. Theophylline is a medicine used to treat wheezing and shortness of breath.\n\nCaffeine can cause tremor and make tremor caused by other medicines worse. If you have a tremor, avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea, and soda. Also avoid other stimulants.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nTremor - drug-induced; Shaking - drug tremor\n\n---\n\n**Drug-induced tremor**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of drug-induced tremor**: Certain medications can cause tremors as a side effect. These include:\n    *   Lithium\n    *   Iodine\n    *   Caffeine\n    *   Amphetamines\n    *   Cocaine\n    *   Methylxanthines\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Pathophysiology of drug-induced tremor**: Research suggests that drug-induced tremors may be related to changes in the brain's dopamine and serotonin systems. For example, a study published in Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y) found that medication-induced tremor can provide insights into pathophysiology.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Diagnosis of drug-induced tremor**: Diagnosis is typically based on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to rule out other causes of tremors. Treatment focuses on discontinuing the offending medication or reducing its dosage.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Prevention of drug-induced tremor**: To prevent drug-induced tremors, it's essential to be aware of the potential side effects of medications and to discuss any concerns with a healthcare provider before starting treatment.",
