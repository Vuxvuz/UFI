You can also have it checked at your health care provider's office, many pharmacies, or even at some fire stations.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nTo take your blood pressure, sit in a chair with your back supported. Your legs should be uncrossed, and your feet on the floor. Your arm should be supported so that your upper arm is at heart level. Roll up your sleeve so that your arm is bare. Be sure the sleeve is not bunched up and squeezing your arm.\n\nThe blood pressure cuff will be wrapped snugly around your upper arm, with the lower edge 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bend of your elbow. The cuff will be inflated quickly, either by pumping the squeeze bulb or pushing a button on the device attached to the cuff. You will feel tightness around your arm.\n\nAs the pressure falls, the reading when the sound of blood pulsing is first heard is recorded. This is the systolic pressure. As the air continues to be let out, the sounds will disappear. The point at which the sound stops is recorded. This is the diastolic pressure.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nBefore you measure your blood pressure:\n\n* Rest for at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes is better, before blood pressure is taken.\n* DO NOT take your blood pressure when you are under stress, have had caffeine or used tobacco in the past 30 minutes, or have exercised recently.\n\nTake 2 or 3 readings at a sitting. Take the readings 1 minute apart. Remain seated. When checking your blood pressure on your own, note the time of the readings. Your provider may suggest that you do your readings at certain times of the day.\n\nA typical approach is to take your blood pressure before breakfast and dinner for 5 days. This will give you at least 10 readings and will help your provider make decisions about your blood pressure treatment.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nHigh blood pressure has no symptoms (except in rare, extreme situations), so you may not know if you have this problem. High blood pressure is often discovered during a visit to your provider for another reason, such as a routine physical exam.\n\nFinding high blood pressure and treating it early can help prevent heart disease, stroke, eye problems, or chronic kidney disease. All adults 18 years and older should have their blood pressure checked regularly:\n\n* Once a year for adults aged 40 years and older\n* Once a year for people at increased risk for high blood pressure, including people who are overweight or obese, African Americans, and those with an elevated blood pressure (120/80 mm Hg or higher)\n* Every 3 to 5 years for adults aged 18 to 39 years with blood pressure lower than 120/80 mm Hg who do not have other risk factors\n\nYour provider may recommend more frequent checks based on your blood pressure levels and other health conditions.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nBlood pressure readings are usually given as two numbers. For example, your provider might tell you that your blood pressure is 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mm Hg). One or both of these numbers can be too high.\n\nNormal blood pressure is when the top number (systolic blood pressure) is below 120 and the bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) is below 80 (written as 120/80 mm Hg).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf your systolic blood pressure is 120 to 129 and your diastolic blood pressure is less than 80, you have elevated blood pressure. Your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range.\n\nMedicines are rarely used at this stage. If your blood pressure is 130/80 or higher but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, you have Stage 1 high blood pressure. When thinking about the best treatment, you and your provider must consider:\n\n* If you have no other diseases or risk factors, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and repeat the measurements after a few months.\n* If your blood pressure remains 130/80 or higher but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, your provider may recommend medicines to treat high blood pressure.\n* If you have other diseases or risk factors for heart disease, your provider may be more likely to recommend medicines to treat high blood pressure and make lifestyle changes.\n\nIf your blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, you have Stage 2 high blood pressure. Your provider will most likely recommend you start medicines and make lifestyle changes.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt is normal for your blood pressure to vary at different times of the day:\n\n* It is usually higher when you are at work.\n* It drops slightly when you are at home.\n* It is usually lowest when you are sleeping.\n* It is normal for your blood pressure to increase suddenly when you wake up. In people with very high blood pressure, this is when they are most at risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBlood pressure readings taken at home are usually a better measure of your current blood pressure than those taken at your provider's office.\n\nMake sure your home blood pressure monitor is accurate. Ask your provider to compare your home readings with those taken in the office.\n\nMany people get nervous at their provider's office and have higher readings than they have at home. This is called white coat hypertension. Home blood pressure readings can help detect this problem.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Pressure Measurement**\n\n**What is Blood Pressure?**\n\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the force on the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through your body.\n\n**How to Measure Your Blood Pressure**\n\nYou can measure your blood pressure at home or have it checked at your health care provider's office, many pharmacies, or even at some fire stations.

To do this, you will need to get a home blood pressure monitor. The monitor you choose should be good quality and fit well.\n\n**Manual Blood Pressure Monitors**\n\nManual devices include a cuff that wraps around your arm, a rubber squeeze bulb, and a gauge that measures the blood pressure. A stethoscope is needed to listen to the blood pulsing through the artery. You can see your blood pressure on the circular dial of the gauge as the needle moves around and the pressure in the cuff rises or falls. When used correctly, manual devices are very accurate. However, they are not the recommended type of blood pressure monitor for home use.\n\n**Digital Blood Pressure Monitors**\n\nA digital device will also have a cuff that wraps around your arm. To inflate the cuff, you may need to use a rubber squeeze ball. Other kinds will inflate automatically when you push a button. After the cuff is inflated, the pressure will slowly drop on its own. The screen will show a digital readout of your systolic and diastolic blood pressure. After showing your blood pressure, the cuff will deflate on its own. With many machines, you must wait for 15 to 30 seconds before using it again.\n\n**Tips for Monitoring Your Blood Pressure**\n\n*   Practice using the monitor with your provider or nurse to make sure you are taking your blood pressure correctly.\n*   Your arm should be supported, with your upper arm at heart level and feet on the floor (back supported, legs uncrossed).\n*   It's best to measure your blood pressure after you rest for at least 5 minutes.\n*   Do not take your blood pressure when you are under stress, have had caffeine or used a tobacco product in the last 30 minutes, or have recently exercised.\n*   Take at least 2 readings 1 minute apart in the morning before taking medicines and in evening before eating supper. Try to measure and record BP daily for 5 days and then report your results to your provider.\n\n**References**\n\nBakris GL, Sorrentino MJ.

With the right guidance, you can accurately measure your blood pressure and take control of your health.\n\n**Understanding Hypertension**\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measuring your blood pressure regularly is crucial in detecting hypertension. In fact, the CDC recommends using a home blood pressure monitor as part of your regular health check-ups.\n\n**Choosing the Right Monitor**\n\nWhen selecting a blood pressure monitor for home use, consider the following factors:\n\n*   Accuracy: Look for monitors that have been certified by reputable organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n*   Ease of use: Choose a monitor with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to take accurate readings.\n*   Comfort: Select a monitor that allows you to comfortably place your arm in the cuff.\n\n**Monitoring Your Blood Pressure**\n\nRegular blood pressure monitoring is essential in detecting hypertension. The American Heart Association recommends taking your blood pressure at least twice a week, ideally in the morning after resting for 30 minutes. By tracking your readings over time, you can identify any changes or trends that may indicate high blood pressure.\n\n**Consulting with Your Healthcare Provider**\n\nBefore starting to monitor your blood pressure at home, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider. They can help you choose the right monitor and provide guidance on how to accurately take readings. Additionally, they can interpret your results and develop a plan to manage your blood pressure if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps and using a reliable blood pressure monitor, you can effectively monitor your blood pressure at home and take control of your health.",

    "content": "**Blood Smear**\n\nA blood smear is a blood test that gives information about the number and shape of blood cells. It is often done as part of or along with a complete blood count (CBC).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A blood sample is needed.\n*   The blood sample is sent to a lab where it is examined under a microscope or by an automated machine.\n\n**What the Smear Provides**\n\nThe smear provides information on:\n\n*   The number and kinds of white blood cells (differential, or percentage of each type of cell)\n*   The number and kinds of abnormally shaped blood cells\n*   A rough estimate of white blood cell and platelet counts\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be done as part of a general health exam to help diagnose many illnesses. Or, your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of:\n\n*   Any known or suspected blood disorder\n*   Cancer\n*   Leukemia\n\nA blood smear may also be done to monitor the side effects of chemotherapy or to help diagnose an infection, such as malaria.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nRed blood cells (RBCs) normally are of similar size and color and are a lighter color in the center. The blood smear is considered normal if there is:\n\n*   Normal appearance of cells\n*   Normal white blood cell differential\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

    "content": "**Blood Sugar Test**\n\n_A blood sugar test measures the amount of a sugar called glucose in a sample of your blood._\n\n**What is Glucose?**\n\nGlucose is a major source of energy for most cells of the body, including brain cells. It's a building block for carbohydrates, which are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice.\n\n**How Does Insulin Control Blood Sugar Levels?**\n\nThe hormone insulin made in the body helps control the blood glucose level.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nThe test may be done in the following ways:\n\n* After you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\n* At any time of the day (random)\n* Two hours after you drink a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or oral glucose tolerance test)\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of diabetes. The test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\n\n**Screening for Diabetes**\n\nThis test may also be used to screen a person for diabetes. High blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35.\n\n**Risk Factors for Diabetes**\n\nIf you're overweight and have any of the following risk factors, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age and more often:\n\n* High blood sugar level on a previous test\n* Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\n* History of heart disease\n* Member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\n* Woman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n* Polycystic ovary disease (condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones which may cause cysts in the ovaries)\n* Close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother, or sister)\n* Not physically active\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test:\n\n* A level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) means you have impaired fasting glucose, a type of prediabetes.\n* A level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher usually means you have diabetes.\n\nIf you had a random blood glucose test:\n\n* A level of 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) or higher often means you have diabetes.\n\n**Other Medical Problems That Can Cause Abnormal Blood Glucose Levels**\n\nOveractive thyroid gland, pancreatic cancer, swelling and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), stress due to trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery, rare tumors, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, or glucagonoma.\n\n**Risks Associated with Having Blood Drawn**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

It's a building block for carbohydrates, which are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice. When you consume these foods, your body quickly turns them into glucose, raising your blood glucose level.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed to perform the test.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nThe test may be done in the following ways:\n\n* After you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\n* At any time of the day (random)\n* Two hours after you drink a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or oral glucose tolerance test)\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of diabetes. More than likely, the provider will order a fasting blood sugar test.\n\nThe blood glucose test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\n\n**Screening for Diabetes**\n\nThis test may also be used to screen a person for diabetes. High blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35. If you have no other diabetes risk factors, you should be tested every 3 years (in some cases, more often if your weight is rising).\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nIf you're overweight and have any of the following risk factors, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age and more often:\n\n* High blood sugar level on a previous test\n* Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\n* History of heart disease\n* Member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\n* Woman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n* Polycystic ovary disease (condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones which may cause cysts in the ovaries)\n* Close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother, or sister)\n* Not physically active\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\n\nIf you had a random blood glucose test, a normal result depends on when you last ate. Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or lower.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test:\n\n* A level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) means you have impaired fasting glucose, a type of prediabetes.\n* A level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher usually means you have diabetes.\n\nIf you had a random blood glucose test:\n\n* A level of 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) or higher often means you have diabetes.\n\n**Other Medical Problems**\n\nSome medical problems can also cause a higher-than-normal blood glucose level, including:\n\n* Overactive thyroid gland\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Swelling and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n* Stress due to trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery\n* Rare tumors, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, or glucagonoma\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

It's a building block for carbohydrates, which are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice. When you eat these foods, they're quickly turned into glucose in your body, which can raise your blood glucose level.\n\n**The Role of Insulin**\nThe hormone insulin made in the body helps control the blood glucose level.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\n* A blood sample is needed.\n* The test may be done in the following ways:\n\t1. After you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\n\t2. At any time of the day (random)\n\t3. Two hours after you drink a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or oral glucose tolerance test)\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\n* When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging.\n* Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\n* Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of diabetes.\n* The blood glucose test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\n* The test may also be done if you have:\n\t+ An increase in how often you need to urinate\n\t+ Recently gained a lot of weight\n\t+ Blurred vision\n\t+ Confusion or a change in the way you normally talk or behave\n\t+ Fainting spells\n\t+ Seizures (for the first time)\n\t+ Unconsciousness or coma\n\n**SCREENING FOR DIABETES**\n\n* This test may also be used to screen a person for diabetes.\n* High blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35.\n* If you're overweight and have any of the other risk factors below, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age and more often:\n\t+ High blood sugar level on a previous test\n\t+ Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\n\t+ History of heart disease\n\t+ Member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\n\t+ Woman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n\t+ Polycystic ovary disease\n\t+ Close relative with diabetes\n\t+ Not physically active\n\n**Normal Results**\n\n* If you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Sugar Test**\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\n\nIf you had a random blood glucose test, a normal result depends on when you last ate. Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or lower.\n\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nBlood glucose measured by a blood test from a vein is considered more accurate than blood glucose measured from a fingerstick with a blood glucose meter, or blood glucose measured by a continuous glucose monitor.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test:\n\nA level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) means you have impaired fasting glucose, a type of prediabetes. This increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and you should consult with your provider.\nA level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher usually means you have diabetes.\n\nIf you had a random blood glucose test:\n\nA level of 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) or higher often means you have diabetes.\nYour provider will order a fasting blood glucose, A1C test, or glucose tolerance test, depending on your random blood glucose test result.\nIn someone who has diabetes, an abnormal result on the random blood glucose test may mean that the diabetes is not well controlled. Talk with your provider about your blood glucose goals if you have diabetes.\n\nOther medical problems can also cause a higher-than-normal blood glucose level, including:\n\nOveractive thyroid gland\nPancreatic cancer\nSwelling and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nStress due to trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery\nRare tumors, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, or glucagonoma\n\nA lower-than-normal blood glucose level (hypoglycemia) may be due to:\n\nHypopituitarism (a pituitary gland disorder)\nUnderactive thyroid gland or adrenal gland\nTumor in the pancreas (insulinoma - very rare)\nToo little food\nToo much insulin or other diabetes medicines\nLiver or kidney disease\nWeight loss after weight loss surgery\nVigorous exercise\n\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level. Before having the test, tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.\n\nFor some people, mainly those who are thin and young, a fasting blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) may be normal.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

It takes 1 to 4 hours to receive the blood, depending on how much you need.\n\n**Sources of Blood**\n\nThere are several sources of blood, which are described below.\n\n### **Blood From the Public (Volunteer Blood Donation)**\n\nThe most common source of blood is from volunteers in the general public. This kind of donation is also called homologous blood donation.\n\nMany communities have a blood bank at which any healthy person can donate blood. This blood is tested to see if it matches yours.\n\nYou may have read about the danger of becoming infected with hepatitis, HIV, or other viruses after a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are not 100% safe. But the current blood supply is thought to be safer now than ever. Donated blood is tested for many different infections. Also, blood centers keep a list of unsafe donors.\n\nDonors answer a detailed list of questions about their health before they are allowed to donate. Questions include risk factors for infections that can be passed on through their blood, such as sexual habits, drug use, and current and past travel history. This blood is then tested for infectious diseases before it is allowed to be used.\n\n### **Directed Donor Blood From a Family Member or Friend**\n\nThis method involves a family member or friend donating blood before a planned surgery. This blood is then set aside and held only for you if you need a blood transfusion after surgery.\n\nBlood from these donors must be collected at least a few days before it is needed. The blood is tested to see if it matches yours. It is also screened for infection.\n\nMost of the time, you need to arrange with your hospital or local blood bank before your surgery to have directed donor blood.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no evidence that receiving blood from family members or friends is any safer than receiving blood from the general public. In very rare cases, though, blood from family members can cause a condition called graft-versus-host disease. For this reason, the blood needs to be treated with radiation before it can be transfused.\n\n### **Autologous Blood Donation (Your own Blood)**\n\nAlthough blood donated by the general public and used for most people is thought to be very safe, some people choose a method called autologous blood donation.\n\nAutologous blood is blood donated by you, which you later receive if you need a transfusion during or after surgery.\n\nYou can have blood taken from 6 weeks to 5 days before your surgery.\nYour blood is stored and is good for a few weeks from the day it is collected.\nIf your blood is not used during or after surgery, it will be thrown away.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Transfusions**\n\n**Why You May Need a Blood Transfusion**\n\nThere are many reasons you may need a blood transfusion:\n\n* After knee or hip replacement surgery, or other major surgery that results in blood loss\n* After a serious injury that causes a lot of bleeding\n* When your body cannot make enough blood\n\n**What is a Blood Transfusion?**\n\nA blood transfusion is a safe and common procedure during which you receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line placed in one of your veins.

    "content": "**Blood Typing**\n\nBlood typing is a method to determine what type of blood you have. It's essential for safely donating your blood or receiving a blood transfusion. The test also checks if you have a substance called Rh factor on the surface of your red blood cells.\n\n**Understanding Blood Types**\n\nYour blood type is based on whether certain proteins, known as antigens, are present on your red blood cells. These antigens are passed down from your parents. There are four major blood types:\n\n*   Type A\n*   Type B\n*   Type AB\n*   Type O\n\n**The Blood Typing Test**\n\nTo determine your blood group, a blood sample is taken and mixed with antibodies against type A and B blood. The sample is then checked to see if the blood cells stick together. If they do, it means the blood reacted with one of the antibodies.\n\nThe second step is called back typing. The liquid part of your blood without cells (serum) is mixed with blood that's known to be type A and type B. People with type A blood have anti-B antibodies, while those with type B blood have anti-A antibodies. Type O blood contains both types of antibodies.\n\n**Rh Typing**\n\nRh typing uses a similar method to ABO typing. When checking for Rh factor, the results will be either:\n\n*   Rh+ (positive) if you have the cell surface protein\n*   Rh- (negative) if you don't have it\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain, while others might only experience a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there might be some throbbing or slight bruising, but it usually subsides quickly.\n\n**Why Blood Typing is Important**\n\nBlood typing is crucial for safely receiving a blood transfusion or transplant. Your blood type must closely match the blood type of the donated blood to avoid any adverse reactions. If the blood types don't match:\n\n*   Your immune system may see the donated red blood cells as foreign.\n*   Antibodies will develop against the donated red blood cells and attack them.\n\nThe two ways your blood and the donated blood may not match are:\n\n1.  A mismatch between blood types A, B, AB, and O.\n2.  Rh factor may not match.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nYou'll be told which ABO blood type you have, which will be one of the following:\n\n*   Type A blood\n*   Type B blood\n*   Type AB blood\n*   Type O blood\n\nYou'll also be informed whether you have Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood.\n\nBased on your results, your healthcare providers can determine which type of blood you can safely receive. For example:\n\n*   If you have type A blood, you can only receive types A and O blood.\n*   If you have type B blood, you can only receive types B and O blood.\n*   If you have type AB blood, you can receive types A, B, AB, and O blood.\n*   If you have type O blood, you can only receive type O blood.\n\nType O blood is considered universal because it can be given to anyone with any blood type. That's why people with type O blood are called universal blood donors.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere's little risk involved with having your blood taken. However, there are some possible risks to consider:\n\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThere are many antigens besides the major ones (A, B, and Rh). Many minor ones aren't routinely detected during blood typing. If they're not detected, you may still have a reaction when receiving certain types of blood, even if the A, B, and Rh antigens match.\n\nTo detect these minor antigens, a process called cross-matching followed by a Coombs test is used before transfusions, except in emergency situations.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Typing**\n\nBlood typing is a method to tell what type of blood you have.

A mismatch between blood types A, B, AB, and O. This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, the immune response is very severe.\n2.  Rh factor may not match.\n\n**Blood Typing During Pregnancy**\n\nBlood typing is very important during pregnancy. Careful testing can prevent a severe anemia in the newborn and jaundice.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nYou will be told which ABO blood type you have. It will be one of these:\n\n*   Type A blood\n*   Type B blood\n*   Type AB blood\n*   Type O blood\n\nYou will also be told whether you have Rh-positive blood or Rh-negative blood.\n\nBased on your results, your health care providers can determine which type of blood you can safely receive:\n\n*   If you have type A blood, you can only receive types A and O blood.\n*   If you have type B blood, you can only receive types B and O blood.\n*   If you have type AB blood, you can receive types A, B, AB, and O blood.\n*   If you have type O blood, you can only receive type O blood.\n*   If you are Rh+, you can receive Rh+ or Rh- blood.\n*   If you are Rh-, you can only receive Rh- blood.\n\n**Type O Blood**\n\nType O blood can be given to anyone with any blood type.

There are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O. Each blood type has different antigens on the surface of red blood cells.\n\n**How Does Blood Typing Work?**\n\nWhen you donate or receive blood, your blood type must be matched with the recipient's or donor's blood type to prevent a reaction. If the blood types are not compatible, the immune system may react and cause harm to the recipient.\n\n**What Happens During a Blood Transfusion?**\n\nBefore a transfusion, the donor's and recipient's blood types are checked to ensure compatibility. A process called cross-matching is performed to detect any minor antigens that may be present in the blood. This helps prevent adverse reactions during the transfusion.\n\n**Minor Antigens**\n\nMinor antigens are matched during the cross-matching process. These antigens can cause a reaction if they are not compatible between the donor and recipient.\n\n**Emergency Situations**\n\nIn emergency situations, blood transfusions may be performed without checking for compatibility. However, this is not recommended as it can lead to adverse reactions.\n\n**References**\n\nArinsburg SA. Pretransfusion testing. In: Shaz BH, Hillyer CD, Gil MR, eds.

Over half of your blood is plasma.\n\nThe solid part of your blood contains:\n\n*   **Red Blood Cells (RBC)**: deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs.\n*   **White Blood Cells (WBC)**: fight infection and are part of your immune system.\n*   **Platelets**: help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound.\n\nBone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days, and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day, but others live much longer.\n\nThere are four blood types: A, B, AB, or O. Also, blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood, it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems.\n\nBlood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions.

Mucous membranes are the moist parts of your body, such as in your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nHIV can also spread from one person to another through fluid in your joints or spinal fluid. And it can spread through semen, fluids in the vagina, breast milk, and the fluid that surrounds a baby in the womb (amniotic fluid).\n\n**More About Hepatitis and HIV Infections**\n\n*   **Hepatitis**\n    Symptoms of hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be mild, and not start until 8 weeks to 5 months after contact with the virus. Sometimes, there are no symptoms.\n    Hepatitis B often gets better on its own and sometimes does not need to be treated. Some people develop a long-term infection that leads to liver damage. This is called chronic hepatitis B.\n    Most people who become infected with hepatitis C develop a long-term infection. After many years, they often have liver damage. This is called chronic hepatitis C.\n*   **HIV**\n    After someone is infected with HIV, the virus stays in their body. It slowly harms or destroys their immune system.

    "content": "**Blount Disease**\n\nBlount disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone (tibia) in which the lower leg turns inward, making it look like a bowleg.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Blount disease occurs in young children and adolescents.\n*   The cause is unknown, but it's thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate.\n*   The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.\n*   Unlike bowlegs, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse and can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   One or both of the lower legs turn inward, causing bowing.\n*   The bowing may look the same on both legs.\n*   It occurs just below the knee.\n*   The condition rapidly gets worse if left untreated.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will examine you to show that the lower legs turn inward. An x-ray of the knee and the lower leg confirms the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBraces are used to treat children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3. Surgery is most often needed if braces do not work, or if the problem is not diagnosed until the child is older. Surgery may involve cutting the shin bone to place it in the proper position. Sometimes, the bone will be lengthened as well.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nFailure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity. The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated. Blount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing. Also contact the provider if your child has bowed legs that appear to be getting worse.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWeight loss may be helpful for overweight children.\n\n---\n\n**Blount Disease**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBlount disease is a condition where the lower legs turn inward, causing bowing of one or both legs. It occurs in young children and adolescents, with an unknown cause.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* One or both of the lower legs turn inward\n* Bowing may occur just below the knee\n* The condition can rapidly get worse if left untreated\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will examine you to show that the lower legs turn inward.

It causes the lower leg to tilt inward, resulting in an abnormal gait.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Blount disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to uneven growth rates between the two bones in the lower leg. Certain risk factors may increase a child's likelihood of developing the condition, including:\n\n*   **Genetic predisposition**: Some children may be more prone to Blount disease due to their genetic makeup.\n*   **Growth spurts**: Rapid growth during puberty can put additional stress on the bones and joints, increasing the risk of Blount disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChildren with Blount disease may experience:\n\n*   **Abnormal gait**: A noticeable limp or uneven walk\n*   **Pain or discomfort**: Pain in the lower leg or knee area\n*   **Limited mobility**: Difficulty walking or engaging in physical activities\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nA diagnosis of Blount disease is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A healthcare professional will assess the child's gait, posture, and overall health.\n*   **Imaging tests**: X-rays or other imaging procedures may be used to evaluate the bones and joints.\n\nTreatment for Blount disease usually involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Bracing or casting**: To correct the abnormal alignment of the shin bone\n*   **Physical therapy**: To improve mobility and strength in the affected leg\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to realign the bones and restore proper function.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nWith proper treatment and care, most children with Blount disease can make a full recovery and lead active, healthy lives. However, some children may experience ongoing issues or complications, such as:\n\n*   **Chronic pain**: Persistent pain in the affected leg\n*   **Limited mobility**: Continued difficulty walking or engaging in physical activities\n\nIt's essential for parents to work closely with their child's healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan and ensure the best possible outcomes.",

    "content": "**Blue Discoloration of the Skin**\n\nA bluish color to the skin or mucous membrane is usually due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. The medical term is cyanosis.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\n* Most of the time, nearly all red blood cells in the arteries carry a full supply of oxygen.\n* These blood cells are bright red and the skin is pinkish or red.\n* Blood that has lost its oxygen is dark bluish-red. People whose blood is low in oxygen tend to have a bluish color to their skin. This condition is called cyanosis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCyanosis that is seen in only one part of the body may be due to:\n\n* A blood clot that blocks the blood supply to a leg, foot, hand, or arm\n* Raynaud phenomenon (condition in which cold temperatures or strong emotions cause blood vessel spasms, which block blood flow to the fingers, toes, ears, and nose)\n\nMost cyanosis occurs because of a lack of oxygen in the blood. This can be caused by the following problems.\n\nProblems with the lungs:\n\n* Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n* Drowning or near-drowning\n* High altitude\n* Infection in the smallest air passages in the lungs of children, called bronchiolitis\n* Long-term lung problems that become more severe, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and interstitial lung disease\n* Pneumonia (severe)\n\nProblems with the heart:\n\n* Heart defects that are present at birth (congenital)\n* Heart failure\n* Heart stops working (cardiac arrest)\n\nOther problems:\n\n* Drug overdose (narcotics, benzodiazepines, sedatives)\n* Exposure to cold air or water\n* Seizure that lasts a long time\n* Toxins such as cyanide\n\n---\n\n**Blue Discoloration of the Skin**\n\nA bluish color to the skin or mucous membrane is usually due to a lack of oxygen in the blood.

Contact or visit your provider.\n\nFor adults, contact your provider or call the local emergency number, such as 911 if you have bluish skin and any of the following:\n\n* Cannot get a deep breath or your breathing is getting harder, or faster\n* Need to lean forward when sitting to breathe\n* Are using muscles around the ribs to get enough air\n* Have chest pain\n* Are having headaches more often than usual\n* Feel sleepy or confused\n* Have a fever\n* Are coughing up dark mucus\n* Are unable to speak a full sentence because of shortness of breath\n\nFor children, contact your provider or call 911 or the local emergency number if your child has bluish skin and any of the following:\n\n* Hard time breathing\n* Moving chest muscles in with each breath\n* Breathing faster than 50 to 60 breaths per minute (when not crying)\n* Making a grunting noise\n* Sitting with shoulders hunched over\n* Is very tired\n* Moving very little\n* Has a limp or floppy body\n* Nostrils flare out when breathing\n* Does not feel like eating\n* Is irritable\n* Has trouble sleeping\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical examination. This will include listening to your breathing and heart sounds. In emergency situations (such as shock), you will be stabilized first.\n\nThe provider will ask about your symptoms. Questions may include:\n\n* When did the bluish skin develop? Did it begin slowly or suddenly?\n* Is your body blue all over? How about your lips or nailbeds?\n* Have you been exposed to cold or have you been at a high altitude?\n* Do you have trouble breathing? Do you have a cough or chest pain?\n* Do you have ankle, foot, or leg swelling?\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Arterial blood gas analysis\n* Blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry\n* Chest x-ray\n* Chest CT scan\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)\n\nThe treatment you receive depends on the cause of cyanosis. For example, you may receive oxygen for shortness of breath.\n\n**References**\n\nMcGee S. Cyanosis. In: McGee S, ed. Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis. 5th ed.

    "content": "**Blue-Green Algae**\n\n**What is it?**\nBlue-green algae are a group of bacteria that can be used as a source of protein. They produce blue-green colored pigments and are high in protein, iron, and other minerals.\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThe effectiveness ratings for BLUE-GREEN ALGAE are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ High blood pressure: Taking blue-green algae by mouth seems to reduce blood pressure in some people with high blood pressure.\n* There is interest in using blue-green algae for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth:\n\n* Blue-green algae products that are free of contaminants are possibly safe for most people when used short-term. Doses up to 19 grams daily have been used safely for up to 2 months.\n* Lower doses of 10 grams daily have been used safely for up to 6 months.\n\nSide effects are typically mild and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.\n\nHowever, blue-green algae products that are contaminated are possibly unsafe. Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, vomiting, weakness, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death.\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough information available to know if it is safe to use blue-green algae when pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Children: Blue-green algae are possibly unsafe for children. Children are more sensitive to contaminated blue-green algae products than adults.\n* Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pemphigus vulgaris (a skin condition), and others: Blue-green algae might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases.\n* Surgery: Blue-green algae might lower blood sugar levels. There is some concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Blue-Green Algae: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\n*   **Moderate**: Be cautious with this combination.\n    *   **Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)**: Blue-green algae might lower blood sugar levels. Taking blue-green algae along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n    *   **Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)**: Blue-green algae can increase the activity of the immune system. Some medications, such as those used after a transplant, decrease the activity of the immune system. Taking blue-green algae along with these medications might decrease the effects of these medications.\n    *   **Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)**: Blue-green algae might slow blood clotting. Taking blue-green algae along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar**: Blue-green algae might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting**: Blue-green algae might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n*   **Iron**: Blue-green algae can decrease the amount of iron the body can absorb. Taking blue-green algae with iron supplements might decrease the effects of the iron supplement.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\n*   Keep in mind that taking blue-green algae can decrease the amount of iron the body can absorb from food and supplements.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\n*   Blue-green algae has most often been used by adults in doses of 1-10 grams by mouth daily for up to 6 months. Only use products that have been tested and are free of contaminants such as heavy metals, liver toxins called microcystins, and harmful bacteria.

    "content": "**Boceprevir**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBoceprevir is used along with two other medications (ribavirin [Copegus, Rebetol] and peginterferon alfa [Pegasys]) to treat chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver) in people who have not yet been treated for this condition or whose condition did not improve when they were treated with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBoceprevir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal or light snack three times a day (every 7 to 9 hours). Take boceprevir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take boceprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou will take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 4 weeks before you begin treatment with boceprevir. Then you will take all three medications for 12 to 44 weeks. After this time, you will stop taking boceprevir, but you may continue to take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for an additional number of weeks. The length of your treatment depends on your condition, how well you respond to the medication, and whether you experience severe side effects. Continue to take boceprevir, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin as long as they are prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking any of these medications without talking to your doctor even if you are feeling well.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with boceprevir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Continue to take boceprevir, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin as long as they are prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Do not stop taking any of these medications without talking to your doctor even if you are feeling well.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nBoceprevir is usually taken with a meal or light snack three times a day (every 7 to 9 hours).\n\n---\n\n**Boceprevir: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking boceprevir, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to boceprevir, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in boceprevir capsules. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medications or herbal products: alfuzosin (Uroxatral); ergot medications such as dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergonovine, ergotamine (Ergomar, in Cafergot, in Migergot) or methylergonovine; cisapride (Propulsid) (not available in the U.S.); drospirenone (in some oral contraceptives such as Beyaz, Gianvi, Ocella, Safyral, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah); lovastatin (Altoprev, Mevacor); certain medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Equetro, Tegretol), phenobarbital, or phenytoin (Dilantin); midazolam taken by mouth; pimozide (Orap); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in IsonaRif, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sildenafil (only Revatio brand used for lung disease); simvastatin (Simcor, in Vytorin); tadalafil (only Adcirca brand used for lung disease); St. John's wort; or triazolam (Halcion). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take boceprevir if you are taking one or more of these medications.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: alprazolam (Niravam, Xanax); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), posaconazole (Noxafil), and voriconazole (Vfend); atorvastatin (Lipitor, in Caduet); bosentan (Tracleer); budesonide (Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort); buprenorphine (Buprenex, Butrans, Subutex, Suboxone); calcium channel blockers such as felodipine (Plendil), nicardipine (Cardene), and nifedipine (Adalat, Afeditab, Procardia); clarithromycin (Biaxin); colchicine (Colcrys, in Col-Probenecid); cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune); desipramine (Norpramin); dexamethasone; certain medications for erectile dysfunction such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn); certain medications for HIV such as atazanavir taken with ritonavir, darunavir taken with ritonavir, efavirenz (Sustiva, in Atripla), lopinavir taken with ritonavir, and ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra); certain medications for irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), digoxin (Lanoxin), flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rythmol), and quinidine; methadone (Dolophine, Methadose); midazolam given intravenously (into a vein); rifabutin (Mycobutin); salmeterol (Serevent, in Advair); sirolimus (Rapamune); tacrolimus (Prograf); and trazodone.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had an organ transplant, and if you have or have ever had anemia (not enough red blood cells in the blood to carry oxygen to the rest of the body), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), any other condition that affects your immune system, or hepatitis B (a viral infection that damages the liver) or any type of liver disease other than hepatitis C.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking boceprevir.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or can possibly become pregnant. If you are male, tell your doctor if your partner is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, or can possibly become pregnant. Boceprevir must be taken with ribavirin which can seriously harm the fetus. You must use two methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy in you or your partner during your treatment with these medications and for 6 months after your treatment. Talk to your doctor about which methods you should use; hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, implants, rings, or injections) may not work well in women who are taking these medications. You or your partner must be tested for pregnancy every month during your treatment and for 6 months after your treatment.

    "content": "**Body Lice**\n\n**What are Body Lice?**\n\nBody lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed.\n\n**How Do Body Lice Spread?**\n\nBody lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals.\n\n**Who Is at Risk for Body Lice?**\n\nBody lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often people experiencing homelessness. In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Body Lice?**\n\nThe most common symptom of body lice is intense itching. There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with bacteria or fungi.\n\nIf someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs).\n\n**How Do You Know If You Have Body Lice?**\n\nA diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Body Lice?**\n\nThe main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nNote: The original text has been reformatted to improve readability and clarity. Bold headings have been added to separate sections and highlight important information.\n\n---\n\n**Body Lice**\n\n\\n\\nTo get rid of body lice, you need to improve your personal hygiene.

They feed on human blood and lay their eggs and deposit waste matter on the skin and clothing.\n\nLice die within 3 days at room temperature if they fall off a person into most areas of the environment. However, they can live in the seams of clothing for up to 1 month.\n\nYou can get body lice if you come in direct contact with someone who has lice. You can also get lice from infected clothing, towels, or bedding.\n\nBody lice are bigger than other types of lice.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nLice cause severe itching. The itching is a reaction to the saliva from the insect's bite. Itching is usually worse around the waist, under the arms, and in places where clothing is tighter and closer to the body (such as near bra straps).\n\nYou may have red bumps on your skin. The bumps may scab or become crusty after scratching.\n\nSkin around the waist or groin may become thickened or change color if you have been infected with lice in that area for a long time.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin and clothing for signs of lice.\n\nFull-grown lice are the size of a sesame seed, have 6 legs, and are tan to grayish-white.\nNits are lice eggs. They will most often be seen in the clothing of someone with lice, usually around the waist and in the armpits.\n\nYou should also be checked for head and pubic lice if you have body lice.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTo get rid of body lice, take the following important steps:\n\nBathe regularly to get rid of lice and their eggs.\nChange your clothes often.\nWash clothes and bedding in hot water (at least 130°F or 54°C) and machine dry using the hot cycle.\nItems that can't be washed, such as stuffed toys, mattresses, or furniture, can be thoroughly vacuumed to get rid of lice and eggs that have fallen off the body.\n\nYour provider may prescribe a skin cream or a wash that contains permethrin, malathion, or benzyl alcohol. If your case is severe, your provider may prescribe medicine that you take by mouth.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBy taking the above mentioned steps, body lice can be completely destroyed.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nScratching can make your skin more likely to become infected. Because body lice spread easily to others, people you live with and sexual partners need to be treated as well. In rare cases, lice carry uncommon diseases, such as trench fever, which may be spread to humans.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have lice in your clothing or itching that does not go away.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf you know someone is infested with body lice, avoid direct contact with that person, the person's clothing, and bedding.\n\n---\n\n**Body Lice**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Body Lice?**\n\nBody lice are tiny insects (scientific name is Pediculus humanus corporis) that are spread through close contact with other people.\n\n**Types of Lice**\n\nTwo other types of lice are:\n\n*   Head lice\n*   Pubic lice\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nBody lice live in the seams and folds of clothing.

    "content": "**Body Mass Index**\n\nA good way to decide if your weight is healthy for your height is to figure out your body mass index (BMI). You and your health care provider can use your BMI to estimate how much body fat you have.\n\n**Information**\n\nHaving obesity puts a strain on your heart and can lead to serious health problems. These include:\n\n* Arthritis in your knees and hips\n* Heart disease\n* High blood pressure\n* Sleep apnea\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Varicose veins\n\n**HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR BMI**\n\nYour BMI estimates how much you should weigh based on your height.\n\nThere are many websites with calculators that give your BMI when you enter your weight and height.\n\nYou can also calculate it yourself:\n\n1. Multiply your weight in pounds by 703.\n2. Divide that answer by your height in inches.\n3. Divide that answer by your height in inches again.\n\nFor example, a woman who weighs 270 pounds (lbs) or 122 kilograms (kgs) and is 68 inches (in) or 172 centimeters (cm) tall has a BMI of 41.0.\n\n**Use the chart below to see what category your BMI falls into**\n\n* Below 18.5: Underweight\n* 18.5 to 24.9: Healthy\n* 25.0 to 29.9: Overweight\n* 30.0 to 39.9: Obese\n* Over 40: Severe or high risk obesity\n\nThere are three classes of obesity:\n\n* Class 1: BMI of 30 to less than 35.\n* Class 2: BMI of 35 to less than 40.\n* Class 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 is considered \"severe obesity.\"\n\n**Limitations of BMI**\n\nBMI is not always the best way to decide whether you need to lose weight. If you have more or less muscle than is normal, your BMI may not be a perfect measure of how much body fat you have. For example:\n\n* Body builders-- Because muscle weighs more than fat, people who are very muscular may have a high BMI.\n* Older people -- Healthy weight ranges for older adults are different than for other age groups. The BMI only tells part of the story. Older adults with a normal BMI may have less muscle compared to others who are slightly overweight. If you are 65 years or older, a slightly higher BMI may help protect you from thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Always talk to your provider before trying to lose or gain weight.\n* Children -- While many children have obesity, Do not use this BMI calculator for evaluating a child. Talk to your child's provider about the right weight for your child's age.\n\n**Providers Use Additional Methods**\n\nYour provider may also take your waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio into consideration.\n\n**Exercise Can Help Reduce Health Risk**\n\nYour BMI alone can't predict your health risk, but most experts say that a BMI of 30 or greater (obesity) is unhealthy. No matter what your BMI is, exercise can help reduce your risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. Remember to always talk to your provider before starting an exercise program.\n\n**References**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Boils**\n\nA boil is an infection that affects groups of hair follicles and nearby skin tissue. Related conditions include folliculitis, an inflammation of one or more hair follicles, and carbunculosis, a skin infection that often involves a group of hair follicles.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBoils are very common. They are most often caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. They can also be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi found on the skin's surface. Damage to the hair follicle allows the infection to grow deeper into the follicle and the tissues under it.\n\nBoils may occur in the hair follicles anywhere on the body. They are most common on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and thighs. You may have one or many boils. The condition may occur only once or it can be a long-lasting (chronic) or recurring problem.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA boil may begin as tender, pinkish-red, and swollen, on a firm area of the skin. Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or cyst.\n\nPain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue. Pain lessens when the boil drains. A boil may drain on its own. More often, the boil needs to be opened to drain.\n\nThe main symptoms of a boil include:\n\n*   A bump about the size of a pea, but may be as large as a golf ball\n*   White or yellow center (pustules)\n*   Spread to other skin areas or joining with other boils\n*   Quick growth\n*   Weeping, oozing, or crusting\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Fever\n*   General ill-feeling\n*   Itching before the boil develops\n*   Skin redness around the boil\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider can usually diagnose a boil based on how it looks. A sample of cells from the boil may be sent to the lab for a culture to look for staphylococcus or other bacteria.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBoils may heal on their own after a period of itching and mild pain. More often, they become more painful as pus builds up.\n\nBoils usually need to open and drain in order to heal. This most often happens within 2 weeks. You should:\n\n*   Put warm, moist, compresses on the boil several times a day to speed draining and healing.\n*   Never squeeze a boil or try to cut it open at home. This can spread the infection.\n*   Continue to put warm, wet, compresses on the area after the boil opens.\n\nYou may need to have surgery to drain deep or large boils. Get treatment from your provider if:\n\n*   You have a fever or other symptoms with the boil.\n*   The boil causes pain or discomfort. \n*   You have a boil on your spine or the middle of your face.\n*   A boil lasts longer than 1 week.\n*   A boil comes back.\n\nIt is important to keep a boil clean. To do this:\n\n*   Clean boils and change their dressing often.\n*   Wash your hands well before and after touching a boil.\n*   Do not reuse or share washcloths or towels. Wash clothing, washcloths, towels, and sheets or other items that have touched infected areas in hot water.\n*   Throw out used dressings in a sealed bag so that fluid from the boil does not touch anything else.\n\nYour provider may give you antibiotics to take by mouth or a shot, if the boil is very bad or comes back.\n\nAntibacterial soaps and creams cannot help much once a boil has formed.\n\n---\n\n**Boils: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Boils are very common and most often caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.\n* They can also be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi found on the skin's surface.\n* Damage to the hair follicle allows the infection to grow deeper into the follicle and the tissues under it.\n\n**Boils may occur in the hair follicles anywhere on the body.**\n\n* They are most common on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and thighs.\n* You may have one or many boils.\n* The condition may occur only once or it can be a long-lasting (chronic) or recurring problem.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* A boil may begin as tender, pinkish-red, and swollen, on a firm area of the skin.\n* Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or cyst.\n* Pain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue.

You may feel very protective of your baby.\n\nIt is this first relationship with you that teaches babies to feel secure and good about themselves with other people. They learn to trust you because they know you are paying attention to them and taking care of them. Babies that have strong bonds with their parents are more likely to trust others and have good relationships as adults.\n\n**Bonding is a Process**\n\nYou and your baby may bond within a few minutes, over a few days, or a few weeks. Bonding may take longer if your baby needed intensive medical care at birth, or if you adopted your baby.

As long as you are taking care of your baby's basic needs, the bond will form.\n\n**Tips for Bonding with Your Baby**\n\nIf the birthing process went smoothly, your baby may be very alert at birth. Take this time to hold and look at your baby. This is a great chance to bond. Other bonding moments can occur when you:\n\n* Breastfeed. If you chose to breastfeed, your baby will become attached to your smell and touch during feedings.\n* Bottle-feed. During bottle feedings, your baby can become acquainted with your smell and touch, as well.\n* Hold your baby, especially skin to skin when you can.\n* Make eye contact with your baby.\n* Respond to your baby when they cry. Some people worry about spoiling a baby. But you will not spoil your baby with too much attention.\n* Play with your baby.\n* Talk, read, and sing to your baby. This helps them become well acquainted with the sound of your voice.\n\n**Accept Help from Others**\n\nWhen you bring your newborn home, your job is to take care of your baby and bond. This is easier if you have help at home. You may become very tired from all the new responsibilities that come with having a new baby. Let friends and family take on routine chores like laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking.\n\n**Obstacles to Bonding**\n\nYou may have trouble bonding with your baby if you:\n\n* Had a long or difficult birthing process\n* Feel exhausted\n* Experience mood swings or hormonal changes\n* Suffer from postpartum depression\n* Have a baby who needs special medical care\n\nAgain, this does not mean that you are a bad parent or that you will never form a bond. It just may take more time and effort.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nAfter a few weeks of caring for your newborn, if you do not feel like you are bonding or you feel detached or resentful of your baby, talk to a health care provider.

In this article, we'll explore the importance of bonding and provide tips on how to create a secure attachment bond with your newborn.\n\n**The Importance of Bonding**\n\nBonding with your baby is essential for their emotional well-being. When you form a strong attachment bond, your child will be more likely to develop healthy relationships in the future. According to Dr. Goyal's chapter in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, \"the newborn infant\" is a crucial period for bonding.\n\n**Tips for Bonding with Your Newborn**\n\n1.  **Skin-to-Skin Contact**: Hold your baby close and engage in skin-to-skin contact.

Other symptoms vary, depending on the location and size of the cancer.\n\n**Treatment for Bone Cancer**\n\nSurgery is often the main treatment for bone cancer. Other treatments may include amputation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Because bone cancer can come back after treatment, regular follow-up visits are important.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Cancer**\n\nBone cancer is a rare type of cancer that starts in the bones. It can be primary, meaning it originates in the bones, or secondary, meaning it spreads to the bones from another part of the body.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe most common symptom of bone cancer is pain. Other symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the cancer. To diagnose bone cancer, doctors use various tests such as:\n\n*   Bone biopsy\n*   Bone cancer stages\n*   Bone scan\n*   Stages of Ewing Sarcoma\n*   Tests for bone cancer\n*   TP53 genetic test\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment options for bone cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and amputation. Regular follow-up visits are important because bone cancer can come back after treatment.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nRisk factors for bone cancer include:\n\n*   Genetic predisposition\n*   Family history of bone cancer\n*   Radiation exposure\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent bone cancer, being aware of these risk factors can help individuals take necessary precautions.\n\n**Living With Bone Cancer**\n\nLiving with bone cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach. This includes working closely with healthcare providers to develop an effective treatment plan and making lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\n**Genetics and Statistics**\n\nBone cancer has been linked to certain genetic conditions, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Research is ongoing to better understand the genetic underpinnings of bone cancer.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, cancer of the bone and joint is a rare type of cancer. Ongoing research aims to improve our understanding of bone cancer and develop more effective treatment options.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinical trials are an essential part of advancing bone cancer research. By participating in clinical trials, patients can access new and innovative treatments that may not be available through standard care.\n\nBy staying informed about the latest developments in bone cancer research and treatment, individuals can make informed decisions about their care and work towards a better outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Bone Cancer?**\n    Bone cancer, also known as osteosarcoma, is a type of cancer that affects the bones.\n*   **Symptoms of Bone Cancer**\n    The symptoms of bone cancer may include pain in the affected bone, swelling or redness around the tumor, and difficulty moving the affected limb.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors of Bone Cancer**\n    The exact cause of bone cancer is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that occur during cell division. Certain risk factors, such as family history and radiation exposure, may increase the likelihood of developing bone cancer.\n*   **Diagnosis of Bone Cancer**\n    Diagnosis of bone cancer typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests (such as X-rays or CT scans), and biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer cells.\n*   **Treatment Options for Bone Cancer**\n    Treatment options for bone cancer may include surgery to remove the tumor, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/bone-density-scan/",
    "content": "**Bone Density Scan**\n\nA bone density scan, also known as a DEXA or DXA scan, is a low-dose x-ray that measures calcium and other minerals in your bones. Bones containing more minerals are denser and tend to be stronger and less likely to break. The measurement helps show your bone's strength and thickness (known as bone density or mass).\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA bone density scan is used to:\n\n* Diagnose osteopenia (low bone mass)\n* Diagnose osteoporosis\n* Predict your risk of future fractures\n* See if treatment for osteoporosis is working\n\n**Why do I need a bone density scan?**\n\nMost women age 65 or older should have a bone density scan. Women in this age group are at high risk of losing bone density, which can lead to fractures. Women of other ages and men may also be at risk for losing bone density if they:\n\n* Have a very low body weight\n* Have had one or more fractures after the age of 50\n* Have lost a half inch or more in height within one year\n* Have a family history of osteoporosis\n\nOther risk factors for losing bone density include:\n\n* Lack of physical activity\n* Long-time use of tobacco or alcohol\n* Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet\n* Having medical conditions such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis\n* Being an older male with risk factors for weak bones or osteoporosis\n\n**What happens during a bone density scan?**\n\nThere are different ways to measure bone density. The most common and accurate method is with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, also known as a central DEXA scan. The scan checks the bone density of your lower spine, hip, wrist, or entire body. It is usually done in a hospital or clinic.\n\nDuring a central DEXA scan:\n\n* You will lie on your back on a padded table. You will probably be able to leave your clothes on.\n* You may need to lie with your legs straight, or you may be asked to rest your legs on a padded platform.\n* The arm of the scanning machine will pass over your hips and spine. At the same time, another scanning machine will pass under you. The images from the two machines will be combined and sent to a computer. A health care provider will view the images on the computer screen.\n* While the machines are scanning, you need to stay very still. You may be asked to hold your breath to keep the images from blurring.\n\nThe test usually takes 10 to 30 minutes. Your provider will usually get the results in a few days.\n\nSometimes, a bone density scan is only done on your wrist, hand, or foot bones. This is known as a peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) scan. The portable p-DEXA device has a box-like structure. This kind of scan might be done in a provider's office, mobile health van, or drugstore.\n\nDuring a peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) scan:\n\n* You will be asked to place your finger, hand, forearm, or foot in the space for imaging.\n* This test takes a few minutes, and your provider should receive the results shortly after.\n* This scan can provide good information about your fracture risk but cannot give as much detail as the central DEXA scan.\n\nIf you are found to be at risk of bone fractures, your provider may recommend a central DEXA scan.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may be told to stop taking calcium supplements 24 to 48 hours before your test. You should also avoid wearing metal jewelry or clothes with metal parts, such as buttons or buckles.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nA bone density scan uses very low doses of radiation. It is safe for most people. But it is not recommended during pregnancy. Even low doses of radiation could harm a developing baby. Be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nBone density results are often given as T-scores and Z-scores. A higher number means that you have greater bone density. The lower your score, the higher your risk of bone fracture.\n\nT-score may be used if you are a postmenopausal woman or a man age 50 or older. This measurement compares your bone density with a healthy young adult of the same sex.\nZ-score may be used if you are premenopausal, a male under age 50, or a child. This measurement compares your bone density measurement with other people your age, weight, sex, and ethnic or racial origin.\n\nYour T-score results may show one of the following:\n\n* A T-score of -1.0 or higher. This is considered normal bone density.\n* A T-score between -1.0 and -2.4. This means you have low bone density (osteopenia) and may be at risk for developing osteoporosis.\n* A T-score of -2.5 or less. This means you probably have osteoporosis.\n\nIf your results show you have low bone density, your provider will recommend steps to prevent further bone loss. These may include:\n\n* Getting more exercise, with activities such as walking, dancing, and using weight machines.\n* Adding calcium and vitamin D to your diet.\n* Taking prescription medicines to increase bone density.\n\nYour provider may recommend how often you need to have repeat scans, based on your risk of bone fractures. The recommendations are to get a central DEXA scan every two years for high risk, every 3 to 5 years for moderate risk, and every 10 to 15 years for low risk.\n\nIf you have questions about your results and/or treatments for bone loss, talk to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Density Scan**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA bone density scan, also known as a DEXA or DXA scan, is a low-dose x-ray that measures calcium and other minerals in your bones.

    "content": "**Bone Marrow Tests**\n\n**What are bone marrow tests?**\n\nBone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue found in the center of your bones. It makes different types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Bone marrow tests remove a sample of your bone marrow and bone to examine it under a microscope and test for signs of disease.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nBone marrow tests help diagnose and monitor bone marrow disorders, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer. They can also plan and monitor treatment for conditions that involve your blood or bone marrow.\n\n* Diagnose blood and bone marrow disorders, such as anemia, hemochromatosis, myelodysplastic syndromes, polycythemia vera, platelet disorders\n* Plan and monitor treatment for conditions that involve your blood or bone marrow\n* Find out if certain types of cancer have spread to your bone marrow\n\n**Why do I need bone marrow tests?**\n\nYou may need a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy if you:\n\n* Had abnormal results on other blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) or a blood smear\n* Have signs and symptoms that could mean you have a bone marrow disease\n* Have certain types of cancers that involve your blood and bone marrow\n\n**What happens during a bone marrow test?**\n\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedures are usually done at the same time. A provider will collect the marrow samples for testing. The procedure may be done in a hospital, provider's office, or clinic.\n\nBefore the procedure:\n\n* You may be asked to put on a hospital gown\n* Your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be checked\n\nDuring the procedure:\n\n* You'll lie down on your side or stomach\n* The skin over the bone will be cleaned with an antiseptic\n* You will get an injection of medicine to numb your skin and the bone underneath\n* A hollow needle will be inserted into the bone to remove a sample of bone marrow fluid or tissue\n\nAfter the test:\n\n* Your provider will press on your skin to stop the bleeding and then cover the area with a bandage\n* If you didn't use medicine to relax or sleep, you'll usually need to stay lying down for about 15 minutes to make sure that the bleeding has stopped\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test. Tell your provider about everything you take. You may also need to fast (not eat or drink) for a few hours before the procedure.\n\nPlan to have someone take you home after the test, because you may be drowsy if you are given medicine to help you relax or sleep during the procedure.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nAfter a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days. Your provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help.\n\nDon't take any pain medicine your provider hasn't approved. Certain pain relievers, such as aspirin, could increase your risk of bleeding.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIt may take several days or even weeks to get your bone marrow test results. Your provider can explain what your results mean and whether you need further testing or treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Tests**\n\nBone marrow tests can help diagnose and monitor bone marrow disorders, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer.\n\n**Types of Procedures**\n\nThere are two types of procedures used to collect bone marrow samples for testing:\n\n*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration**: removes a small amount of fluid and cells from your bone marrow\n*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: removes a small piece of bone and bone marrow\n\nThese procedures are usually done at the same time.\n\n**What Are They Used For?**\n\nBone marrow tests are used to help find the cause of too many or too few blood cells, or blood cells that don't look normal. The results can help:\n\n*   Diagnose blood and bone marrow disorders, such as anemia, hemochromatosis, myelodysplastic syndromes, polycythemia vera, platelet disorders\n*   Plan and monitor treatment for conditions that involve your blood or bone marrow\n*   Find out if certain types of cancer, such as breast, lung, or prostate cancer, have spread to your bone marrow\n*   Find the cause of an unexplained fever, which could be from a bone marrow infection\n\n**Why Do I Need Bone Marrow Tests?**\n\nYou may need a bone marrow aspiration and a bone marrow biopsy if you:\n\n*   Had abnormal results on other blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) or a blood smear\n*   Have signs and symptoms, and a medical history that could mean you have a bone marrow disease\n*   Have certain types of cancers that involve your blood and bone marrow, and your health care provider needs to know how much cancer is in your body (This is called \"cancer staging.\")\n*   Have a type of cancer in another part of your body that commonly spreads to bone marrow\n*   Are being treated for a condition that affects your blood or bone marrow, and your provider needs to find out how well your treatment is working\n\n**What Happens During a Bone Marrow Test?**\n\nBone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy procedures are usually done at the same time. A provider will collect the marrow samples for testing. Usually, the samples can be collected in about ten minutes. The procedure may be done in a hospital, provider's office, or clinic.\n\nBefore the procedure, you may be asked to put on a hospital gown. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be checked.\n\nYou may choose to have a mild sedative, which is medicine to help you relax. You may also have the choice to use stronger medicine that will make you sleep. Your provider can help you decide which option is best for you.\n\nDuring the procedure:\n\n*   You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for the samples.\n*   The skin over the bone will be cleaned with an antiseptic.\n*   You will get an injection (shot) of medicine to numb your skin and the bone underneath. It may sting.\n*   When the area is numb, your provider will make a very small incision (cut) in your skin and insert a hollow needle.\n*   For the bone marrow aspiration, your provider pushes a thin needle into the bone and removes a sample of bone marrow fluid with a syringe attached to the needle. You may feel a brief some pressure or brief pain. The aspiration takes only a few minutes.\n*   For the bone marrow biopsy, your provider inserts a hollow needle into the bone and twists the needle to take out a small piece of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure or brief pain while the sample is being taken.\n\nAfter the test, your provider will press on your skin to stop the bleeding and then cover the area with a bandage.\n\nIf you didn't use medicine to relax or sleep, you'll usually need to stay lying down for about 15 minutes to make sure that the bleeding has stopped. If you used medicine to relax or sleep, you'll need to stay longer before you can go home.\n\nYour provider will tell you how to care for yourself after your test. You may need to avoid hard physical activity and keep the bandage dry for at least a day. You may feel sore for a week or more. Your provider can tell you which pain relievers are safe to use.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou'll receive complete instructions for how to prepare.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nTell your provider if you have a bleeding disorder.\n\nYour provider will tell you whether you need to fast (not eat or drink) for a few hours before the procedure.\n\nPlan to have someone take you home after the test, because you may be drowsy if you are given medicine to help you relax or sleep during the procedure.\n\nBe sure to ask your provider any questions you may have about the procedure.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nAfter a bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days. Your provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help.\n\nDon't take any pain medicine your provider hasn't approved. Certain pain relievers, such as aspirin, could increase your risk of bleeding.\n\nSerious symptoms are very rare, but may include:\n\n*   Increased pain or discomfort where the sample was taken\n*   Redness, swelling, bleeding, or other fluids leaking from the area where the needles were inserted\n*   Fever\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, call your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Tests**\n\nIf you're scheduled to undergo a bone marrow test, it's essential to understand what to expect and how the results will impact your treatment plan. In this article, we'll delve into the world of bone marrow tests, exploring their purpose, procedure, and interpretation of results.\n\n**Purpose of Bone Marrow Tests**\n\nBone marrow tests are used to diagnose and monitor various blood disorders, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and anemia. These tests help identify abnormalities in your bone marrow, which can indicate underlying health issues.\n\n**Procedure for Bone Marrow Tests**\n\nThe procedure for a bone marrow test typically involves inserting a needle into your hipbone (iliac crest) to collect a sample of bone marrow fluid or tissue. This may be done under local anesthesia to minimize discomfort.\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nIt may take several days or even weeks to receive your bone marrow test results. Your healthcare provider will analyze the data from various tests, including:\n\n*   Bone marrow biopsy: A procedure where a sample of bone marrow tissue is removed for examination.\n*   Bone marrow aspiration: A process where a sample of bone marrow fluid is collected through a needle.\n\nYour provider will explain the meaning of your test results, which may indicate:\n\n*   Abnormalities in your bone marrow cells\n*   Presence of cancerous cells\n*   Inflammation or infection in your bone marrow\n\n**What to Expect After the Test**\n\nIf your test results are not normal, you may need to undergo additional tests to confirm a diagnosis or determine the best course of treatment. Your healthcare provider will discuss the implications of your test results and develop a personalized plan to address any underlying health issues.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information on laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results, we recommend visiting reputable sources such as:\n\n*   American Society of Hematology\n*   Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n*   Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\n*   Mayo Clinic\n*   Merck Manual Consumer Version\n*   National Cancer Institute\n*   National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\n**What is Bone Marrow?**\n\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones, such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains immature cells, called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells, which fight infections, and platelets, which help the blood to clot.\n\n**What is a Bone Marrow Transplant?**\n\nA bone marrow transplant is a procedure that replaces a person's faulty bone marrow stem cells. Doctors use these transplants to treat people with certain diseases, such as:\n\n* Leukemia\n* Severe blood diseases such as thalassemias, aplastic anemia, and sickle cell anemia\n* Multiple myeloma\n* Certain immune deficiency diseases\n\n**How is a Bone Marrow Transplant Performed?**\n\nBefore you have a transplant, you need to get high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation. This destroys the faulty stem cells in your bone marrow. It also suppresses your body's immune system so that it won't attack the new stem cells after the transplant.\n\nIn some cases, you can donate your own bone marrow stem cells in advance. The cells are saved and then used later on. Or you can get cells from a donor. The donor might be a family member or unrelated person.\n\n**Risks of Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\nBone marrow transplantation has serious risks. Some complications can be life-threatening. But for some people, it is the best hope for a cure or a longer life.\n\n**Resources**\n\n* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n* Health Resources and Services Administration\n* American Cancer Society\n* National Marrow Donor Program\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\n**What is Bone Marrow Transplantation?**\n\nBone marrow transplantation, also known as a bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant, is a medical procedure that involves replacing a person's damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. This can be done using the patient's own stem cells, which are collected from their blood or bone marrow before treatment, or by using stem cells donated by another person.\n\n**Types of Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\nThere are two main types of bone marrow transplantation:\n\n* **Autologous transplantation**: The patient's own stem cells are used. This type of transplant is often used to treat cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma.\n* **Allogenic transplantation**: Stem cells are donated by another person, usually a family member or unrelated donor.\n\n**Risks and Complications**\n\nBone marrow transplantation has serious risks and complications, some of which can be life-threatening. These include:\n\n* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a condition where the donated stem cells attack the recipient's body\n* Infection and sepsis\n* Bleeding and clotting disorders\n* Organ damage\n\n**Living with Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\nAfter a bone marrow transplant, patients may experience a range of side effects, including:\n\n* Fatigue and weakness\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea and abdominal pain\n* Skin rash and itching\n\nPatients may also need to take medications to prevent GVHD and other complications.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nDonating stem cells and bone marrow is an important aspect of bone marrow transplantation. Patients who are considering donating should be aware of the risks and benefits involved.\n\nPlanning for a transplant, including finding a suitable donor and preparing for the procedure, is also crucial.\n\nTreatment before transplant, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may be necessary to prepare the patient's body for the transplant.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, bone marrow transplantation has been used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides information on clinical trials related to bone marrow transplantation.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent studies have investigated the use of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell administration combined with educational interventions to improve patient outcomes.\n\nBone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) has been studied as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis.\n\nCore decompression and bone marrow aspirate injection have been explored as treatments for avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nThe National Cancer Institute is a leading organization in research on bone marrow transplantation. Patients can find experts in this field through the NCI's website.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nBone marrow donation, bone marrow transplant, and bone marrow transplant discharge are all important topics for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.\n\nThese handouts provide information on the procedure, risks, and complications, as well as post-transplant care.",

Or, it can be taken from frozen, donated bone (allograft). In some cases, a manmade (synthetic) bone substitute is used.\n\nYou will be asleep and feel no pain (general anesthesia).\n\nDuring surgery, the surgeon makes a cut over the bone defect. The bone graft can be taken from areas close to the bone defect or more commonly from the pelvis. The bone graft is shaped and inserted into and around the area. The bone graft may need to be held in place with pins, plates, or screws.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nBone grafts are used to:\n\n* Fuse joints to prevent movement\n* Repair broken bones (fractures) that have bone loss\n* Repair injured bone that has not healed\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines, breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of this surgery include:\n\n* Pain at the body area where the bone was removed\n* Injury of nerves near the bone grafting area\n* Stiffness of the area\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about not eating or drinking anything before surgery.\n* Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* If you are going to the hospital from home, be sure to arrive at the scheduled time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nRecovery time depends on the injury or defect being treated and the size of the bone graft. Your recovery may take 2 weeks to 3 months. The bone graft itself will take up to 3 months or longer to heal.\n\nYou may be told to avoid extreme exercise for up to 6 months. Ask your surgeon or nurse what you can and cannot safely do.\n\nYou will need to keep the bone graft area clean and dry. Follow instructions about showering.\n\nDo not smoke. Smoking slows or prevents bone healing. If you smoke, the graft is more likely to fail. Be aware that nicotine patches slow healing just like smoking does. You may also be told not to take non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. These medicines can slow down bone fusion.\n\nYou may need to use a bone stimulator.

It contains stem cells, which are immature blood cells that become mature circulating blood cells.\n\n**Why is Bone Marrow Donation Important?**\n\nPeople with life-threatening cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, can be treated with a bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant. For this type of treatment, bone marrow is collected from a donor. Sometimes, people can donate their own bone marrow for future use.\n\n**Types of Bone Marrow Donation**\n\nThere are two types of bone marrow transplants and donations:\n\n* **Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant**: When people donate their own bone marrow. \"Auto\" means self.\n* **Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplant**: When another person donates bone marrow. \"Allo\" means other.\n\n**Bone Marrow Registries**\n\nThe 70% of people who do not have a relative who is a good match may be able to find one through a bone marrow registry. The largest one is called NMDP (nmdp.org). It registers people who would be willing to donate bone marrow and stores their information in a database.\n\n**How to Join a Bone Marrow Registry**\n\nTo be listed in a bone marrow donation registry, a person must be:\n\n* Between the ages of 18 and 60\n* Healthy and not pregnant\n\nPeople can register online or at a local donor registry drive. Those who are age 45 to 60 must join online. The local, in-person drives only accept donors who are younger than age 45.\n\n**What Happens During a Bone Marrow Donation?**\n\nDonor stem cells can be collected in two ways:\n\n* **Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection**: Most donor stem cells are collected through a process called leukapheresis.\n\t+ The donor is given 5 days of shots to help stem cells move from the bone marrow into the blood.\n\t+ During the collection, blood is removed from the donor through a line in a vein (IV). The part of white blood cells that contains stem cells is then separated in a machine and removed to be later given to the recipient.\n\t+ The red blood cells are returned to the donor through an IV in the other arm.\n* **Bone Marrow Harvest**: This minor surgery is done under general anesthesia. The bone marrow is removed from the back of your pelvic bones.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nThe side effects of a bone marrow donation include:\n\n* Headaches\n* Sore bones\n* Discomfort from needles in the arms\n* Nausea\n* Fatigue\n* Bruising or discomfort in the lower back\n\nYou can resume normal activity in about a week. There are very few risks for the donor and no lasting health effects.

    "content": "**Bone Marrow Aspiration**\n\nBone marrow aspiration is the removal of a small amount of bone marrow tissue in liquid form for examination.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nBone marrow aspiration may be done in your health care provider's office or in a hospital. The bone marrow is removed from your pelvic or breast bone. Sometimes, another bone is selected.\n\nMarrow is removed in the following steps:\n\n*   If needed, you are given medicine to help you relax.\n*   Your provider cleans the skin and injects numbing medicine into the area and surface of the bone.\n*   A special needle is inserted into the bone. The needle has a tube attached to it, which creates suction. A small sample of bone marrow fluid flows into the tube.\n*   The needle is removed.\n*   Pressure and then a bandage are applied to the skin.\n\nThe bone marrow fluid is sent to a lab and examined under a microscope.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nTell your provider:\n\n*   If you are allergic to any medicines\n*   If you are pregnant\n*   If you have bleeding problems\n*   What medicines you are taking\n\nYou will feel a sting and slight burning sensation when the numbing medicine is applied.

It is used to diagnose various blood disorders and cancers.\n\n**What is Bone Marrow?**\n\nBone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are produced. It is found in the hollow part of most bones.\n\n**How is Bone Marrow Aspiration Performed?**\n\nThe procedure is typically done in a healthcare provider's office or hospital. The bone marrow is removed from the pelvic or breast bone, and sometimes another bone is selected. The steps involved are:\n\n1. If needed, you may be given medicine to help you relax.\n2. Your provider cleans the skin and injects numbing medicine into the area and surface of the bone.\n3. A special needle is inserted into the bone, which has a tube attached to it that creates suction. A small sample of bone marrow fluid flows into the tube.\n4. The needle is removed, and pressure is applied to the skin before applying a bandage.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nBefore the procedure, you should inform your provider about:\n\n* Any allergies to medicines\n* If you are pregnant\n* If you have bleeding problems\n* What medicines you are taking\n\n**What Will I Feel During the Procedure?**\n\nYou may feel a sting and slight burning sensation when the numbing medicine is applied. You may also feel pressure as the needle is inserted into the bone, and a sharp and usually painful sucking sensation as the marrow is removed. This feeling lasts for only a few seconds.\n\n**Why is Bone Marrow Aspiration Performed?**\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have abnormal types or numbers of red or white blood cells or platelets on a complete blood count. It is used to diagnose various blood disorders and cancers, including anemia, infections, leukemia, and other blood cancers.\n\n**What are the Normal Results?**\n\nThe bone marrow should contain the proper number and types of:\n\n* Blood-forming cells\n* Connective tissues\n* Fat cells\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAbnormal results may indicate various blood disorders and cancers, including:\n\n* Cancers of the bone marrow (acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia)\n* Other causes such as aplastic anemia, bacterial or fungal infections, cancer of the lymph tissue, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, multiple myeloma, myelofibrosis, polycythemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks associated with bone marrow aspiration include pain, bleeding, infection, and damage to the surrounding tissues.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Aspiration**\n\n**What is it?**\nBone marrow aspiration, also known as bone marrow biopsy, is a medical procedure used to diagnose and monitor blood disorders. It involves removing a small sample of bone marrow tissue from the hipbone.\n\n**Purpose**\nThe purpose of bone marrow aspiration is to:\n\n* Diagnose blood disorders such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, thrombocytopenia, and myelofibrosis\n* Monitor the effectiveness of treatment for these conditions\n\n**Abnormal Results**\nAbnormal results may be due to cancers of the bone marrow, including:\n\n* Leukemia\n* Aplastic anemia\n* Myelodysplastic syndrome\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Myelofibrosis\n\nAbnormal results may also be due to other causes, such as:\n\n* Infections or inflammation in the bone marrow\n* Bone marrow failure or damage\n\n**Risks**\nThere may be some bleeding at the puncture site.

    "content": "**Bone Marrow Transplant in Children - Discharge**\n\nYour child had a bone marrow transplant. It will take 6 to 12 months or more for your child's blood counts and immune system to fully recover. During this time, the risk for infection, bleeding, and skin problems are higher than before the transplant. Follow instructions from your child's health care provider on how to care for your child at home.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYour child's body is still weak. It may take up to a year for your child to feel like they did before their transplant. Your child will likely get tired very easily and may also have a poor appetite.\n\nIf your child received bone marrow from someone else, look for signs of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Ask your child's provider to tell you what signs of GVHD you should watch for.\n\n**Preventing Infections**\n\nTake care to lessen the risk of your child getting infections as suggested by your health care team.\n\n* Keep your house clean is important to help prevent infection. But do not vacuum or clean while your child is in the room.\n* Keep your child away from crowds.\n* Ask visitors who have a cold or other respiratory infection to not visit or if necessary, to wear a mask.\n* Do not let your child play in the yard or handle soil until your provider says your child's immune system is ready.\n\nMake sure your child follows guidelines for safe eating and drinking during treatment.\n\n* Do not let your child eat or drink anything that may be undercooked or spoiled at home or when eating out.

    "content": "**Bone Marrow Transplant**\n\nA bone marrow transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells.\n\n**Description**\n\nBefore the transplant, chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be given. This may be done in two ways:\n\n* Ablative (myeloablative) treatment -- High-dose chemotherapy, radiation, or both are given to kill any cancer cells. This also kills all healthy bone marrow that remains, and allows new stem cells to grow in the bone marrow.\n* Reduced intensity treatment, also called a mini transplant -- Lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation are given before a transplant. This allows older people, and those with other health problems to have a transplant.\n\nThere are four kinds of bone marrow transplants:\n\n* Autologous bone marrow transplant -- The term auto means self. Stem cells are removed from you before you receive high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment. The stem cells are stored in a freezer. After high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatments, your stem cells are put back in your body to make normal blood cells. This is called a rescue transplant.\n* Allogeneic bone marrow transplant -- The term allo means other. Stem cells are removed from another person, called a donor. Most times, the donor's genes must at least partly match your genes. Special tests are done to see if a donor is a good match for you. A brother or sister is most likely to be a good match. Sometimes parents, children, and other relatives are good matches. Donors who are not related to you, yet still match, may be found through national bone marrow registries.\n* Umbilical cord blood transplant -- This is a type of allogeneic transplant. Stem cells are removed from a newborn baby's umbilical cord right after birth. The stem cells are frozen and stored until they are needed for a transplant. Umbilical cord blood cells are very immature so there is less of a need for perfect matching. Due to the smaller number of stem cells, blood counts take much longer to recover.\n* Haploidentical transplant -- This is a type of allogeneic transplant, in which the donor is not completely matched with the recipient. A haploidentical transplant may be from a family member. Children are always a half-match for their parents, and parents are a half-match for their children. Siblings have a 50% chance of being a half-match for each other. Special treatments are performed to decrease the chance of complications due to the incomplete match.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA bone marrow transplant replaces bone marrow that is either not working properly or has been destroyed (ablated) by chemotherapy or radiation. For many cancers, the donor's white blood cells may attack any remaining cancer cells, which are seen as foreign, similar to when white cells attack bacteria or viruses when fighting an infection.\n\n**Risks**\n\nA bone marrow transplant may cause the following symptoms:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Drop in blood pressure\n* Fever, chills, flushing\n* Headache\n* Hives\n* Nausea\n* Pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Strange taste in the mouth\n\nPossible complications of a bone marrow transplant depend on many things, including:\n\n* Your age\n* Your overall health\n* How good of a match your donor was\n* The type of bone marrow transplant you received (autologous, allogeneic, or umbilical cord blood)\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Anemia\n* Bleeding in the lungs, intestines, brain, and other areas of the body\n* Cataracts\n* Clotting in the small veins of the liver\n* Damage to the kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart\n* Delayed growth in children who receive a bone marrow transplant\n* Early menopause\n* Graft failure, which means that the new cells do not settle into the body and start producing stem cells\n* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a condition in which the donor cells attack your own body\n* Infections, which can be very serious\n* Inflammation and soreness in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach, called mucositis\n* Pain\n* Stomach or abdominal problems, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. You will have many tests before treatment begins.\n\nBefore transplant, you will have 1 or 2 tubes, called central venous catheters, inserted into a blood vessel in your neck or arms.

This means you do not have to stay in the hospital overnight.\n\nHow long you stay in the hospital depends on:\n\n* Whether you developed any complications related to the transplant\n* The type of transplant\n* Your medical center's procedures\n\nWhile you are in the hospital:\n\n* Your health care team will closely monitor your blood count and vital signs.\n* You will receive medicines to prevent GVHD and prevent or treat infections, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral medicine.\n* You will likely need many blood transfusions.\n* You will be fed through a vein (IV) until you can eat by mouth, and stomach side effects and mouth sores have gone away.\n\nAfter you leave the hospital, be sure to follow instructions on how to care for yourself at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do after the transplant depends on:\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Transplant**\n\nA bone marrow transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells.\n\n**What is Bone Marrow?**\n\nBone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your breastbone (sternum) and pelvic bones. Your bone marrow produces blood cells. Stem cells in your bone marrow give rise to all of your different blood cells.\n\n**Types of Bone Marrow Transplants**\n\nThere are four kinds of bone marrow transplants:\n\n* **Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant**: The term auto means self. Stem cells are removed from you before you receive high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment. The stem cells are stored in a freezer. After high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatments, your stem cells are put back in your body to make normal blood cells.\n* **Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant**: The term allo means other. Stem cells are removed from another person, called a donor. Most times, the donor's genes must at least partly match your genes. Special tests are done to see if a donor is a good match for you.\n* **Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant**: This is a type of allogeneic transplant. Stem cells are removed from a newborn baby's umbilical cord right after birth. The stem cells are frozen and stored until they are needed for a transplant.\n* **Haploidentical Transplant**: This is a type of allogeneic transplant, in which the donor is not completely matched with the recipient.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nBefore the transplant, chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be given. The stem cells are delivered into your bloodstream, usually through a tube called a central venous catheter. The process is similar to getting a blood transfusion. The stem cells travel through the blood into the bone marrow.\n\nDonor stem cells can be collected in two ways:\n\n* **Bone Marrow Harvest**: This minor surgery is done under general anesthesia. The bone marrow is removed from the back of both hip bones.\n* **Leukapheresis**: First, the donor is given several days of shots to help stem cells move from the bone marrow into the blood. During leukapheresis, blood is removed from the donor through an IV line.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA bone marrow transplant replaces bone marrow that is either not working properly or has been destroyed (ablated) by chemotherapy or radiation. For many cancers, the donor's white blood cells may attack any remaining cancer cells, which are seen as foreign.\n\nYour health care provider may recommend a bone marrow transplant if you have:\n\n* Certain cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplasia, or multiple myeloma.\n* A disease that affects the production of bone marrow cells, such as aplastic anemia, congenital neutropenia, severe immune system illnesses, sickle cell anemia, or thalassemia.\n\n**Risks**\n\nA bone marrow transplant may cause the following symptoms:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Drop in blood pressure\n* Fever, chills, flushing\n* Headache\n* Hives\n* Nausea\n* Pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Strange taste in the mouth\n\nPossible complications of a bone marrow transplant depend on many things, including:\n\n* Your age\n* Your overall health\n* How good of a match your donor was\n* The type of bone marrow transplant you received (autologous, allogeneic, or umbilical cord blood)\n\nComplications may include:\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n* Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\n* Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n* Bone Marrow Diseases\n* Bone Marrow Transplantation\n* Childhood Leukemia\n* Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n* Chronic Myeloid Leukemia\n* Leukemia\n* Lymphoma\n* Multiple Myeloma\n* Myelodysplastic Syndromes\n\n---\n\n**Bone Marrow Transplant**\n\nA bone marrow transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells.\n\n**What is Bone Marrow?**\n\nBone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your breastbone (sternum) and pelvic bones.

Stem cells in your bone marrow give rise to all of your different blood cells.\n\n**Description**\n\nBefore the transplant, chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be given. This may be done in two ways:\n\n*   **Ablative (myeloablative) treatment**: High-dose chemotherapy, radiation, or both are given to kill any cancer cells. This also kills all healthy bone marrow that remains, and allows new stem cells to grow in the bone marrow.\n*   **Reduced intensity treatment (mini transplant)**: Lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation are given before a transplant. This allows older people, and those with other health problems to have a transplant.\n\n**Types of Bone Marrow Transplants**\n\nThere are four kinds of bone marrow transplants:\n\n1.  Autologous bone marrow transplant\n2.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplant\n3.  Umbilical cord blood transplant\n4.

DEXA uses low-dose x-rays. (You receive more radiation from a chest x-ray.)\n\nThere are two types of DEXA scans:\n\n* **Central DEXA**: You lie on a soft table. The scanner passes over your lower spine and hip. In most cases, you do not need to undress. This scan is the best test to predict your risk for fractures, especially of the hip.\n* **Peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA)**: These smaller machines measure the bone density in your wrist, fingers, leg, or heel.

Along with other risk factors you may have, it helps predict your risk for having a bone fracture in the future. Your provider will help you understand the results.\n\nIf your T-score is:\n\n*   From -1 to -2.5, you may have bone loss (osteopenia)\n*   Below -2.5, you likely have osteoporosis\n\nTreatment recommendations depend on your total fracture risk. This risk can be calculated using the FRAX score. Your provider can tell you more about this. You can also find information about FRAX online.\n\n**Risks**\n\nBone mineral density uses a slight amount of radiation.

    "content": "**Bone Scan**\n\nA bone scan is an imaging test used to diagnose bone diseases and find out how severe they are.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA bone scan involves injecting a very small amount of radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein. This substance travels through your blood to your bones and organs. As it wears off, it gives off a bit of radiation. This radiation is detected by a camera that slowly scans your body. The camera takes pictures of how much radiotracer collects in your bones.\n\nIf a bone scan is done to see if you have a bone infection, images may be taken shortly after the radioactive material is injected and again 3 to 4 hours later, when it has collected in your bones. This process is called a 3-phase bone scan.\n\nTo evaluate whether cancer has spread to the bone (metastatic bone disease), images are taken only after the 3- to 4-hour delay.\n\nThe scanning part of the test will last about 1 hour. The scanner's camera may move above and around you. You may need to change positions.\n\nYou will probably be asked to drink extra water after you receive the radiotracer to help flush the material from your bladder.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou must remove jewelry and other metal objects. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown.\n\nTell your health care provider if you are or may be pregnant.\n\nDo not take any medicine with bismuth in it, such as Pepto-Bismol, for 4 days before the test.\n\nFollow any other instructions you are given.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is a small amount of pain when the needle is inserted. During the scan, there is no pain. You must remain still during the scan. The technologist will tell you when to change positions.\n\nYou may experience some discomfort due to lying still for a long period.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA bone scan can be used to:\n\n* Diagnose a bone tumor or cancer.\n* Determine if a cancer that began elsewhere in your body has spread to your bones. Common cancers that spread to the bones include breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, and kidney.\n* Diagnose a fracture, when it cannot be seen on a regular x-ray (most commonly hip fractures, stress fractures in the feet or legs, or spine fractures).\n* Diagnose a bone infection (osteomyelitis).\n* Diagnose or determine the cause of bone pain, when no other cause has been identified.\n* Evaluate metabolic disorders, such as osteomalacia, primary hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, complex regional pain syndrome, and Paget disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nTest results are considered normal if the radiotracer is present evenly throughout all the bones.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal scan will show hot spots or cold spots as compared to surrounding bone. Hot spots are areas where there is an increased collection of the radioactive material. Cold spots are areas that have taken up less of the radioactive material.\n\nBone scan findings must be compared with other imaging studies, such as x-rays or CT scans, in addition to clinical information. Your provider will discuss any abnormal findings with you.\n\n**Risks**\n\nIf you are pregnant or nursing, the test may be postponed to prevent exposing your baby to radiation. If you must have the test while breastfeeding, you should pump and throw away the breast milk for the next 2 days.\n\nThe amount of radiation injected into your vein is very small. All radiation is gone from your body within 2 to 3 days. The radiotracer that is used exposes you to a very small amount of radiation. The risk is probably no greater than with routine x-rays.\n\nRisks related to the bone radiotracer are rare, but may include:\n\n* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic response)\n* Rash\n* Swelling\n\nThere is a slight risk of infection or bleeding when the needle is inserted into a vein.\n\n---\n\n**Bone Scan**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA bone scan involves injecting a very small amount of radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein.

The material collects in areas where there is increased bone activity, such as in tumors or fractures. A special camera then takes pictures of the bones to show where the radioactive material has collected.\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of a bone scan?**\n\nThe benefits of a bone scan include its ability to detect problems in the bones that may not be visible on an X-ray. However, there are some risks associated with the test, such as exposure to small amounts of radiation.\n\n**How is a bone scan performed?**\n\nA bone scan is typically performed by injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream through a vein. The patient then lies down on a table while a special camera takes pictures of the bones.\n\n**What are the related health topics for a bone scan?**\n\nSome related health topics for a bone scan include:\n\n*   **Bone Cancer**: A type of cancer that affects the bones.\n*   **Bone Diseases**: Conditions that affect the bones, such as osteoporosis or Paget's disease.\n*   **Fractures**: Breaks in the bones.\n*   **Nuclear Scans**: Tests that use radioactive material to diagnose conditions in the body.\n*   **Paget's Disease of Bone**: A condition that affects the bones and causes them to become deformed.\n\n**Images**\n\nA bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream, which then collects in areas where there is increased bone activity.

    "content": "**Borderline Personality Disorder**\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental condition in which a person has long-term patterns of unstable or turbulent emotions. These inner experiences often result in impulsive actions and chaotic relationships with other people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of BPD is unknown. Genetic, family, and social factors are thought to play roles.\n\n* Risk factors include:\n\t+ Either real or fear of abandonment in childhood or adolescence\n\t+ Disrupted family life\n\t+ Poor communication in the family\n\t+ Sexual, physical, or emotional abuse\n\nBPD occurs equally in men and women, though women tend to seek treatment more often than men. Symptoms may get better in or after middle age.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with BPD lack confidence in how they view themselves and how they are judged by others. As a result, their interests and values can change rapidly. They also tend to view things and people in terms of extremes, such as either all good or all bad. Their views of other people can change quickly. A person who is looked up to one day may be looked down on the next day. These suddenly shifting feelings often lead to intense and unstable relationships.\n\nOther symptoms of BPD include:\n\n* Intense fear of being abandoned\n* Can't tolerate being alone\n* Feelings of emptiness and boredom\n* Displays of inappropriate anger\n* Impulsiveness, such as with substance use or sexual relationships\n* Self-injury, such as wrist cutting or overdosing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBPD is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long and how severe the person's symptoms are.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIndividual talk therapy may successfully treat BPD. Group therapy can sometimes be helpful.\n\nMedicines have less of a role in treating BPD than many other mental disorders. In some cases, they can improve mood swings and treat depression or other disorders that may occur with this disorder.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook of treatment depends on how severe the condition is and whether the person is willing to accept help. With long-term talk therapy, the person often gradually improves.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Depression\n* Misuse of medicines or illegal drug use\n* Problems with work, family, and social relationships\n* Suicide attempts and actual suicide\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSee your provider if you or someone you know has symptoms of borderline personality disorder. It is especially important to seek help right away if you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n---\n\n**Borderline Personality Disorder**\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental condition in which a person has long-term patterns of unstable or turbulent emotions.
