    "content": "**Eye and Orbit Ultrasound**\n\nAn eye and orbit ultrasound is a test to look at the eye area. It also measures the size and structures of the eye.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is most often done in the ophthalmologist's office or the ophthalmology department of a hospital or clinic.\n\nYour eye is numbed with anesthetic drops. The ultrasound wand (transducer) is placed against the front surface of the eye.\n\nThe ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves that travel through the eye. Reflections (echoes) of the sound waves form a picture of the structure of the eye. The test takes about 15 minutes.\n\nThere are two types of scans: A-scan and B-scan.\n\n* **A-scan**\n\t+ You will most often sit in a chair and place your chin on a chin rest. You will look straight ahead.\n\t+ A small probe is placed against the front of your eye.\n\t+ The test may also be done with you lying back. With this method, a fluid-filled cup is placed against your eye to do the test.\n* **B-scan**\n\t+ You will be seated and you may be asked to look in many directions. The test is most often done with your eyes closed.\n\t+ A gel is placed on the skin of your eyelids. The B-scan probe is gently placed against your eyelids to do the test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYour eye is numbed, so you should not have any discomfort. You may be asked to look in different directions to improve the ultrasound image or so it can view different areas of your eye.\n\nThe gel used with the B-scan may run down your cheek, but you will not feel any discomfort or pain.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may need this test if you have cataracts or other eye problems.\n\nAn A-scan ultrasound measures the eye to determine the right power of a lens implant before cataract surgery.\n\nA B-scan is done to look at the inside part of the eye or the space around and behind the eye (orbit) that cannot be seen directly. This may occur when you have cataracts or other conditions that make it hard for the doctor to see into the back of your eye. The test may help diagnose retinal detachment, tumors, or other disorders.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nFor an A-scan, measurements of the eye are in the normal range.\n\nFor a B-scan, the structures of the eye and orbit appear normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA B-scan may show:\n\n* Bleeding into the clear gel (vitreous) that fills the back of the eye (vitreous hemorrhage)\n* Cancer of the retina (retinoblastoma), under the retina, or in other parts of the eye (such as melanoma)\n* Damaged tissue or injuries in the bony socket (orbit) that surrounds and protects the eye\n* Foreign bodies\n* Pulling away of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment)\n* Swelling (inflammation)\n\n**Risks**\n\nTo avoid scratching the cornea, do not rub the numbed eye until the anesthetic wears off (about 15 minutes).

    "content": "**Eye Emergencies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Eye Emergencies?**\n\nEye emergencies include cuts, scratches, objects in the eye, burns, chemical exposure, and blunt injuries to the eye or eyelid. Certain eye infections and other medical conditions, such as blood clots or glaucoma, may also need medical care right away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt is important to get medical attention for eye or eyelid injuries and problems. Eye problems (such as a painful red eye or vision loss) that are not due to injury also need urgent medical attention.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Eye Emergencies**\n\n*   **Blunt Trauma**: Blunt trauma to the eye or face often causes bleeding under the skin that leaves a bruise called a \"black eye.\" The tissue around the eye turns black and blue, gradually becoming purple, green, and yellow over several days as the blood is absorbed.\n*   **Penetrating Trauma**: Penetrating trauma may be caused by things such as knives, ice picks, sticks, nails, and gun shots. Injuries can be serious and usually require repair by a surgeon.\n*   **Chemical Injury**: A chemical injury to the eye can be caused by a work-related accident or common household products such as cleaning solutions, garden chemicals, solvents, or other types of chemicals.\n*   **Foreign Object in the Eye and Corneal Injuries**: The cornea is the clear (transparent) tissue covering the front of the eye. Dust, sand, and other debris can easily become embedded in the cornea without entering the eyeball.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDepending on the type of injury, any of the following symptoms may be present:\n\n*   Bleeding or other discharge from or around the eye\n*   Bruising\n*   Decreased vision\n*   Double vision\n*   Eye pain\n*   Headache\n*   Itchy eyes\n*   Loss of vision, total or partial, one eye or both\n*   Pupils of unequal size\n*   Redness -- bloodshot appearance\n*   Sensation of something in the eye\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Stinging or burning in the eye\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**First Aid**\n\nTake prompt action and follow the steps below if you or someone else have an eye injury. Always wash your hands with soap and water before touching the eye or eyelid.\n\n*   **Small Foreign Object on the Eye or Eyelid**: The eye will often clear itself of tiny objects, like eyelashes and sand, through blinking and tearing.\n*   **Object Stuck or Embedded in the Eye**: Leave the object in place. Do not try to remove the object. Do not touch it or apply any pressure to it.\n*   **Chemical in the Eye**: Flush with a gentle stream of cool tap water right away.\n*   **Eye Cut, Scratch, or Blow to the Eye**: Gently apply a clean cold compress to the eye to reduce swelling and help stop bleeding.\n*   **Eyelid Cuts**: Carefully wash the eyelid. If the cut is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean, dry cloth until the bleeding stops.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek emergency medical care if:\n\n*   There appears to be a scratch, cut, or something has gone into (penetrated) the eyeball.\n*   Any chemical gets into the eye.\n*   The eye is painful and red.\n*   Nausea or headache occur with the eye pain (this may be a symptom of glaucoma or stroke).\n*   There is any change in vision (such as blurred or double vision).\n*   There is uncontrollable bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**Eye Emergencies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Power Tools, Hammers, or Other Striking Tools**\n\nWhen working with power tools, hammers, or other striking tools, be aware of the potential for eye injuries. Wear protective eyewear to prevent accidental strikes or flying debris.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Working with Toxic Chemicals**\n\nChemical exposure can cause severe eye damage. When handling chemicals, wear protective gear, including goggles and gloves. In case of an emergency, flush the affected eye with large amounts of clean water or salt water (saline) for at least 15 minutes before seeking medical attention.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cycling or When in Windy and Dusty Areas**\n\nWhen cycling or in windy and dusty areas, be cautious of flying debris that can cause eye injuries. Wear protective eyewear to prevent accidental strikes or flying particles.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Participating in Sports That Have a High Likelihood of Getting Hit in the Eye with a Ball**\n\nIndoor racket sports, such as tennis or squash, carry a high risk of eye injuries due to fast-moving balls. Wear protective eyewear to prevent accidental strikes or flying debris.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nGuluma K, Lee JE. Ophthalmology.

If not, don't rub the eye or squeeze the eyelids. Here's how to examine someone else's eye:\n\n*   Examine the eye in a well-lighted area. Do not press on the eye.\n*   To find the object, have the person look up and down, then from side to side.\n*   If you cannot find the object, grasp the lower eyelid and gently pull it down to look under the lower eyelid. To look under the upper lid, ask the person to open both eyes and look down. Place a clean cotton swab on the outside of the upper lid. Grasp the eyelashes and gently fold the lid over the cotton swab.\n*   If the object is on an eyelid, try to gently flush it out with clean water. If that does not work, try touching a second cotton swab to the object to remove it.\n*   If the object is on the surface of the eye, try gently rinsing the eye with clean water. If available, use an eye dropper or a bottle of eye drops, such as artificial tears, positioned above the outer corner of the eye. Do not touch the eye itself with the dropper or bottle tip.\n\nA scratchy feeling or other minor discomfort may continue after removing eyelashes and other tiny objects. This should go away within a day or two. If discomfort or blurred vision continues, get medical help.\n\n### Object Stuck or Embedded in the Eye\n\nLeave the object in place. Do not try to remove the object. Do not touch it or apply any pressure to it.\n\n*   Calm and reassure the person.\n*   Loosely bandage both eyes. Covering both eyes helps prevent eye movement. If the object is large, place a clean paper cup or something similar over the injured eye and tape it in place. This prevents the object from being pressed on, which can injure the eye further.\n*   Get medical help right away. Do not delay.\n\n### Chemical in the Eye\n\nFlush with a gentle stream of cool tap water right away. Turn the person's head so the injured eye is down and to the side. Holding the eyelid open, allow running water from the faucet to flush the eye for 15 minutes.\n\n*   If both eyes are affected, or if the chemicals are also on other parts of the body, have the person take a shower.\n*   If the person is wearing contact lenses and the lenses did not flush out from the running water, have the person try to remove the contacts after the flushing.\n*   Keep flushing the eye with clean water or saline solution for at least 15 minutes.\n*   Seek medical help right away. Do not delay.\n\n### Eye Cut, Scratch, or Blow to the Eye\n\nGently apply a clean cold compress to the eye to reduce swelling and help stop bleeding. Do not apply pressure to control bleeding.\n\n*   If blood is pooling in the eye, cover both eyes with a clean cloth or sterile dressing.\n*   Seek medical help right away. Do not delay.\n\n### Eyelid Cuts\n\nCarefully wash the eyelid. If the cut is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean, dry cloth until the bleeding stops. Do not press on the eyeball. The cut may go all the way through the eyelid, so there could also be a cut in the eyeball. It is usually safe to press on the bone around the eye.\n\n*   Cover with a clean dressing.\n*   Place a cold compress on the dressing to reduce pain and swelling.\n*   Seek medical help right away. Do not delay.\n\n---\n\n**Eye Emergencies**\n\nIf you or someone else has an eye injury, take prompt action and follow these steps:\n\n*   **Small Foreign Object on the Eye or Eyelid**: The eye will often clear itself of tiny objects, like eyelashes and sand, through blinking and tearing. If not, don't rub the eye or squeeze the eyelids.\n*   **Object Stuck or Embedded in the Eye**: Do not attempt to remove a foreign body or any object that appears to be embedded (stuck) in any part of the eye. Get medical help right away.\n\n**Chemical in the Eye**\n\nFlush with a gentle stream of cool tap water right away. Turn the person's head so the injured eye is down and to the side. Holding the eyelid open, allow running water from the faucet to flush the eye for 15 minutes.\n\n**Eye Cut, Scratch, or Blow to the Eye**\n\nGently apply a clean cold compress to the eye to reduce swelling and help stop bleeding. Do not apply pressure to control bleeding.\n\n**Eyelid Cuts**\n\nCarefully wash the eyelid. If the cut is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean, dry cloth until the bleeding stops. Do not press on the eyeball.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek emergency medical care if:\n\n*   There appears to be a scratch, cut, or something has gone into (penetrated) the eyeball.\n*   Any chemical gets into the eye.\n*   The eye is painful and red.\n*   Nausea or headache occur with the eye pain (this may be a symptom of glaucoma or stroke).\n*   There is any change in vision (such as blurred or double vision).\n*   There is uncontrollable bleeding.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSupervise children carefully. Teach them how to be safe.\n\nAlways wear protective eye gear when:\n\n*   Using power tools, hammers, or other striking tools\n*   Working with toxic chemicals\n*   Cycling or when in windy and dusty areas\n*   Participating in sports that have a high likelihood of getting hit in the eye with a ball, such as indoor racket sports\n\n---\n\n**Eye Emergencies**\n\n\\n\\n**Periorbital Soft Tissue Trauma**\n\nWhen evaluating and managing periorbital soft tissue trauma, it's essential to consider the severity of the injury. According to Drs. Ein A and Durairaj VD, in their book \"Ophthalmology,\" the approach should be based on the extent of the trauma.\n\n**Evaluation and Management**\n\nThe evaluation process involves assessing the patient's visual acuity, pupillary response, and intraocular pressure. The management plan depends on the severity of the injury:\n\n*   For minor injuries, topical antibiotics and lubricating eyedrops may be prescribed.\n*   For more severe cases, surgical intervention might be necessary to repair damaged tissue or remove foreign objects.\n\n**First Aid**\n\nIn case of an eye emergency, it's crucial to provide proper first aid. This includes:\n\n*   Applying a cold compress to reduce swelling\n*   Covering the injured eye with a protective shield or patch\n*   Seeking medical attention promptly\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   **Eye Injuries**: Learn more about common eye injuries and their treatment options.\n*   **First Aid Kit**: Find out what items you should include in your first aid kit for eye emergencies.\n\nBy understanding the proper evaluation, management, and first aid techniques, you can effectively respond to eye emergencies and promote optimal patient outcomes.",

A YAG laser treatment can break up floaters and possibly make them less visible, but it doesn't really remove the floaters. Research is being done on femtosecond lasers (like the ones often used in LASIK) since this method may prove to be safer.

This will help the eyes move correctly.\n\n**Who Needs It**\n\nEye muscle surgery is most often done on children. However, adults who have similar eye problems may also have it done. Children will most often have general anesthesia for the procedure. They will be asleep and will not feel pain.\n\nDepending on the problem, one or both eyes may need surgery.\n\nAfter the anesthesia has taken effect, the eye surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye. This tissue is called the conjunctiva. Then the surgeon will locate one or more of the eye muscles that needs surgery. Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.\n\nTo strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter. This step in the surgery is called a resection.\nTo weaken a muscle, it is reattached to a point farther toward the back of the eye. This step is called a recession.\n\nThe surgery for adults is similar. In most cases, adults are awake, but are given medicine to numb the area and help them relax.\n\nWhen the procedure is done on adults, an adjustable stitch is used on the weakened muscle so that minor changes can be made later that day or the next day. This technique often has a very good outcome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nStrabismus is a disorder in which the two eyes do not line up in the same direction. Therefore, the eyes do not focus on the same object at the same time. The condition is more commonly known as \"crossed eyes.\"\n\nSurgery may be recommended when strabismus does not improve with glasses or eye exercises.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any anesthesia are:\n\n* Reactions to anesthesia medicines\n* Breathing problems\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\nSome risks for this surgery include:\n\n* Wound infections\n* Damage to the eye (rare)\n* Permanent double vision (rare)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour child's eye surgeon may ask for:\n\n* A complete medical history and physical exam before the procedure\n* Orthoptic measurements (eye movement measurements)\n\n---\n\n**Eye Muscle Repair**\n\n**Description**\n\nThe goal of this surgery is to restore the eye muscles to a proper position.

It may also feel like you have a foreign object in your eye.\n\nThis article discusses eye pain that is not caused by injury or surgery.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nPain in the eye can be an important symptom of a health problem. Make sure you tell your health care provider if you have eye pain that does not go away.\n\nTired eyes or some eye discomfort (eyestrain) is most often a minor problem and it will often go away with rest. These problems may be caused by the wrong eyeglass or contact lens prescription. Sometimes they are due to a problem with the eye muscles.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany things can cause pain in or around the eye. If the pain is severe, does not go away, or causes vision loss, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nSome things that can cause eye pain are:\n\n* Infections\n* Inflammation\n* Contact lens problems\n* Dry eye\n* Acute glaucoma\n* Sinus problems\n* Neuropathy\n* Eyestrain\n* Headache\n* Flu\n\n**Home Care**\n\nResting your eyes should relieve discomfort due to eye strain.\n\nIf you wear contacts, try using glasses for a few days to see if the pain goes away.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* The pain is severe (call immediately), or it continues for more than 2 days\n* You have decreased vision along with the eye pain\n* You have chronic conditions like arthritis or autoimmune problems\n* You have pain along with redness, swelling, discharge, or pressure in the eyes\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will check your vision, eye movements, and the back of your eye. If there is a major concern, you should see an ophthalmologist. This is a doctor who specializes in eye problems.\n\nTo help find the source of the problem, your provider may ask:\n\n* Do you have pain in both eyes?\n* Is the pain in the eye or around the eye?\n* Does it feel like something is in your eye now?\n* Does your eye burn or throb?\n* Did the pain begin suddenly?\n* Is the pain worse when you move your eyes?\n* Are you light sensitive?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nThe following eye tests may be done:\n\n* Slit-lamp examination\n* Fluorescein examination\n* Eye pressure check if glaucoma is suspected\n* Pupillary response to light\n\nIf the pain seems to come from the surface of the eye, such as with a foreign body, the provider may put anesthetic drops in your eyes. If the pain goes away, that will often confirm the surface as the source of the pain.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOphthalmalgia; Pain - eye\n\n---\n\n**Eye Pain: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Considerations**\n\nPain in the eye can be an important symptom of a health problem.

If the pain is severe, does not go away, or causes vision loss, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nSome things that can cause eye pain are:\n\n*   Infections\n*   Inflammation\n*   Contact lens problems\n*   Dry eye\n*   Acute glaucoma\n*   Sinus problems\n*   Neuropathy\n*   Eyestrain\n*   Headache\n*   Flu\n\n**Home Care**\n\nResting your eyes should relieve discomfort due to eye strain.\n\nIf you wear contacts, try using glasses for a few days to see if the pain goes away.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   The pain is severe (call immediately), or it continues for more than 2 days\n*   You have decreased vision along with the eye pain\n*   You have chronic conditions like arthritis or autoimmune problems\n*   You have pain along with redness, swelling, discharge, or pressure in the eyes\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will check your vision, eye movements, and the back of your eye. If there is a major concern, you should see an ophthalmologist. This is a doctor who specializes in eye problems.\n\nTo help find the source of the problem, your provider may ask:\n\n*   Do you have pain in both eyes?\n*   Is the pain in the eye or around the eye?\n*   Does it feel like something is in your eye now?\n*   Does your eye burn or throb?\n*   Did the pain begin suddenly?\n*   Is the pain worse when you move your eyes?\n*   Are you light sensitive?\n*   What other symptoms do you have?\n\nThe following eye tests may be done:\n\n*   Slit-lamp examination\n*   Fluorescein examination\n*   Eye pressure check if glaucoma is suspected\n*   Pupillary response to light\n\nIf the pain seems to come from the surface of the eye, such as with a foreign body, the provider may put anesthetic drops in your eyes. If the pain goes away, that will often confirm the surface as the source of the pain.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOphthalmalgia; Pain - eye\n\n---\n\n**Eye Pain**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of Eye Pain**: According to Pane et al., eye pain can be caused by various factors, including unexplained causes, orbital pain or headache, and red and painful eye.\n*   **Digital Eye Strain**: Demirayak et al. found that digital eye strain is a significant concern among children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n*   **Therapeutic Approaches**: Rusciano et al. discussed various therapeutic approaches for eye pain, including editorial etiology and treatment options.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nCioffi GA, Liebmann JM.

    "content": "**Eye Redness**\n\nEye redness is most often due to swollen or dilated blood vessels, making the surface of the eye look red or bloodshot.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThere are many causes of a red eye or eyes, some being medical emergencies, others a cause for concern but not an emergency, and many that are nothing to worry about. Eye redness is often less of a concern than eye pain or vision problems.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBloodshot eyes appear red because the vessels at the surface of the white portion of the eye (sclera) become swollen due to:\n\n*   Eye dryness\n*   Too much sun exposure\n*   Dust or other particles in the eye\n*   Allergies\n*   Infection\n*   Injury\n\nEye infections or inflammation can cause redness along with possible itching, discharge, pain, or vision problems. These may be due to:\n\n*   Blepharitis: Swelling along the edge of the eyelid.\n*   Conjunctivitis: Swelling or infection of the clear tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the surface of the eye (the conjunctiva). This is often referred to as \"pink eye.\"\n*   Corneal ulcers: Sores on the cornea most often caused by a serious bacterial or viral infection.\n*   Uveitis: Inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. The cause is most often not known. It may be related to an autoimmune disorder, infection, or exposure to toxins. The type of uveitis that causes the worst red eye is called iritis, in which only the iris is inflamed.\n\nOther potential causes of eye redness include:\n\n*   Colds or allergies.\n*   Acute glaucoma: A sudden increase in eye pressure that is extremely painful and causes serious visual problems. This is a medical emergency. The more common form of glaucoma comes on gradually and is long-term (chronic).\n*   Corneal scratches: Injuries caused by sand, dust, or overuse of contact lenses.\n\nSometimes, a bright red spot, called a subconjunctival hemorrhage, will appear on the white of the eye. This often happens after straining or coughing, which causes a broken blood vessel on the surface of the eye. Most often, there is no pain and your vision is normal. It is almost never a serious problem. It may be more common in people who are taking aspirin or blood thinners. Because the blood leaks into the conjunctiva, which is clear, you cannot wipe or rinse the blood away. Like a bruise, the red spot will change colors (usually yellow) and then go away within a week or two.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nTry to rest your eyes if redness is due to fatigue or eye strain. No other treatment is needed.\n\nIf you have eye pain with a vision problem, contact your eye doctor right away.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the hospital or call 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   Your eye is red after a penetrating injury.\n*   You have a headache with blurred vision or confusion.\n*   You are seeing halos around lights.\n*   You have nausea and vomiting.\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n*   Your eyes are red longer than 1 to 2 days.\n*   You have eye pain or vision changes.\n*   You take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin.\n*   You may have an object in your eye.\n*   You are very sensitive to light.\n*   You have a yellow or greenish discharge from one or both eyes.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam, including an eye exam, and ask questions about your medical history. Questions may include:\n\n*   Are both of your eyes affected or just one?\n*   What part of the eye is affected?\n*   Do you wear contact lenses?\n*   Did the redness come on suddenly?\n*   Have you ever had eye redness before?\n*   Do you have eye pain? Does it get worse with movement of the eyes?\n*   Is your vision reduced?\n*   Do you have eye discharge, burning, or itching?\n*   Do you have other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or headache?\n\nYour provider may need to wash your eyes with a saline solution and remove any foreign bodies in the eyes. You may be given eye drops to use at home.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBloodshot eyes; Red eyes; Scleral injection; Conjunctival injection\n\n---\n\n**Eye Redness**\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam, including an eye exam, and ask questions about your medical history.

    "content": "**Eyelid Bump: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 1/3)**\n\n**What is an eyelid bump?**\n\nAn eyelid bump is usually a stye, which is an inflamed oil gland on the edge of your eyelid, where the eyelash meets the lid. It appears as a red, swollen bump that looks like a pimple.\n\n**Causes of eyelid bumps**\n\nA stye is caused by a blockage of one of the oil glands in the eyelids. This allows bacteria to grow inside the blocked gland. Styes are similar to common acne pimples and can occur simultaneously.\n\nStyes typically develop over a few days, may drain and heal on their own, or become a chalazion if the gland becomes fully blocked. A large chalazion can cause vision problems.\n\nDemodex, a mite found on human skin, can worsen styes by causing blepharitis. If you have blepharitis, you're more likely to get styes.\n\n**Other possible eyelid bumps**\n\n*   **Xanthelasma**: Raised yellow patches that can occur with age and are harmless but may indicate high cholesterol.\n*   **Papillomas**: Pink or skin-colored bumps that are harmless but can grow slowly, affect vision, or cause cosmetic issues. They can be surgically removed if necessary.\n*   **Cysts**: Small fluid-filled sacs that can impact vision.\n\n**Symptoms of eyelid bumps**\n\nIn addition to the red, swollen bump, symptoms may include:\n\n*   A gritty, scratchy sensation as if there's a foreign body in your eye\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Tearing of your eye\n*   Tenderness of the eyelid\n\n**Diagnosing and treating eyelid bumps**\n\nYour healthcare provider can usually diagnose a stye by examining it. Tests are rarely needed.\n\nTo treat eyelid bumps at home:\n\n*   Apply a warm, wet cloth to the area for 10 minutes, repeating this process 4 times a day.\n*   Do not attempt to squeeze a stye or any other type of eyelid bump; let it drain on its own.\n*   Avoid using contact lenses or wearing eye makeup until the area has healed.\n\nFor a stye, your provider may prescribe antibiotic ointment or make an opening in the stye to drain it (do not attempt this at home).\n\n**Outlook and prevention**\n\nStyes often get better on their own but may return. Treating blepharitis can help prevent recurrence. With simple treatment, the outcome is usually excellent.\n\nHowever, if left untreated, the infection may spread to the rest of the eyelid, causing eyelid cellulitis, which may require oral antibiotics. This can be a serious issue, especially in children.\n\nTo prevent styes, always wash your hands well before touching the skin around your eye. If you're prone to getting styes or have blepharitis, carefully clean off excess oils from the edges of your lids using a solution of warm water and no-tears baby shampoo.\n\n---\n\n**Eyelid Bump: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Causes**\n\nA stye is caused by a blockage of one of the oil glands in the eyelids. This allows bacteria to grow inside the blocked gland. Styes are a lot like common acne pimples that occur elsewhere on the skin. You may have more than one stye at the same time.\n\nStyes most often develop over a few days. They may drain and heal on their own. A stye can become a chalazion, which occurs when an inflamed oil gland becomes fully blocked. If a chalazion gets large enough, it can cause trouble with your vision.\n\nStyes can be made worse by the presence of Demodex, a mite commonly found on human skin. Demodex has been identified as a cause of blepharitis. If you have blepharitis, you are more likely to get styes.\n\n**Other Possible Common Eyelid Bumps**\n\n*   Xanthelasma: Raised yellow patches on your eyelids that can happen with age. These are harmless, although they are sometimes a sign of high cholesterol.\n*   Papillomas: Pink or skin-colored bumps. They are harmless, but can slowly grow, affect your vision, or bother you for cosmetic reasons. If so, they can be surgically removed.\n*   Cysts: Small fluid-filled sacs that can affect your vision.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn addition to the red, swollen bump, other possible symptoms of a stye include:\n\n*   A gritty, scratchy sensation, as if there is a foreign body in your eye\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Tearing of your eye\n*   Tenderness of the eyelid\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIn most cases, your health care provider can diagnose a stye just by looking at it. Tests are rarely needed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTo treat eyelid bumps at home:\n\n*   Apply a warm, wet cloth to the area for 10 minutes. Do this 4 times a day.\n*   Do NOT attempt to squeeze a stye or any other type of eyelid bump. Let it drain on its own.\n*   Do NOT use contact lenses or wear eye makeup until the area has healed.\n\nFor a stye, your provider may:\n\n*   Prescribe antibiotic ointment\n*   Make an opening in the stye to drain it (Do NOT try this at home)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nStyes often get better on their own. However, they may return. If bleparitis is present, treating it may help prevent a recurrence of the stye.\n\nThe outcome is almost always excellent with simple treatment.\n\nSometimes, the infection may spread to the rest of the eyelid. This is called eyelid cellulitis and may require oral antibiotics. This can look like orbital cellulitis, which can be a serious problem, especially in children.\n\n---\n\n**Eyelid Bump: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA stye, also known as a hordeolum, is a small bump on the eyelid caused by an infection of one of the oil glands.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A blockage in the oil gland, causing an infection\n*   Blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelids\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   A small, painful bump on the eyelid\n*   Redness and swelling of the eyelid\n*   Crusting or scaling of the eyelid\n*   Blistering or bleeding of the eyelid\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Warm compresses to help loosen the blockage\n*   Antibiotic ointment to help clear up the infection\n*   In some cases, oral antibiotics may be necessary to treat eyelid cellulitis\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   Always wash your hands very well before touching the skin around your eye\n*   Carefully clean off excess oils from the edges of your lids using a solution of warm water and no-tears baby shampoo\n*   Fish oil taken by mouth may help prevent plugging of the oil glands\n*   Treating for Demodex, a type of mite that can cause eyelid infections, may also be helpful\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   If you have problems with your vision\n*   If the eyelid bump worsens or does not improve within a week or two of self-care\n*   If the eyelid bump or bumps become very large or painful\n*   If you have a blister on your eyelid\n*   If you have crusting or scaling of your eyelids\n*   If your whole eyelid is red, or the eye itself is red\n*   If you are very sensitive to light or have excessive tears\n*   If another stye comes back soon after successful treatment of a stye\n*   If your eyelid bump bleeds",

    "content": "**Eyelid Drooping**\n\nEyelid drooping is excess sagging of the upper eyelid. The edge of the upper eyelid may be lower than it should be (ptosis) or there may be excess baggy skin in the upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). Eyelid drooping is often a combination of both conditions.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA drooping eyelid is most often due to:\n\n* Weakness of the muscle that raises the eyelid\n* Damage to the nerves that control that muscle\n* Looseness of the skin of the upper eyelids\n\nDrooping eyelid can be:\n\n* Caused by the normal aging process\n* Present before birth\n* The result of an injury or disease\n\nDiseases or illnesses that may lead to eyelid drooping include:\n\n* Tumor around or behind the eye\n* Diabetes\n* Horner syndrome\n* Myasthenia gravis\n* Stroke\n* Swelling in the eyelid, such as with a stye\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDrooping may be present in one or both eyelids depending on the cause. The lid may cover only the upper eye, or the entire pupil may be covered.\n\nProblems with vision will often be present:\n\n* At first, just a sense that the very upper field of vision is being blocked.\n* When the drooping eyelid covers the pupil of the eye, vision may become completely blocked.\n* Children may tip their head back to help them see under the eyelid.\n* Tiredness and achiness around the eyes may also be present.\n\nIncreased tearing despite a feeling of dry eyes may be noticed.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nWhen drooping is on one side only, it is easy to detect by comparing the two eyelids.

The edge of the upper eyelid may be lower than it should be (ptosis) or there may be excess baggy skin in the upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). Eyelid drooping is often a combination of both conditions.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA drooping eyelid is most often due to:\n\n* Weakness of the muscle that raises the eyelid\n* Damage to the nerves that control that muscle\n* Looseness of the skin of the upper eyelids\n\nDrooping eyelid can be:\n\n* Caused by the normal aging process\n* Present before birth\n* The result of an injury or disease\n\nDiseases or illnesses that may lead to eyelid drooping include:\n\n* Tumor around or behind the eye\n* Diabetes\n* Horner syndrome\n* Myasthenia gravis\n* Stroke\n* Swelling in the eyelid, such as with a stye\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDrooping may be present in one or both eyelids depending on the cause. The lid may cover only the upper eye, or the entire pupil may be covered.\n\nProblems with vision will often be present:\n\n* At first, just a sense that the very upper field of vision is being blocked.\n* When the drooping eyelid covers the pupil of the eye, vision may become completely blocked.\n* Children may tip their head back to help them see under the eyelid.\n* Tiredness and achiness around the eyes may also be present.\n\nIncreased tearing despite a feeling of dry eyes may be noticed.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nWhen drooping is on one side only, it is easy to detect by comparing the two eyelids. Drooping is more difficult to detect when it occurs on both sides, or if there is only a slight problem. Comparing the current extent of drooping with the amount shown in old photos may help you detect the progression of the problem.\n\nA physical exam will be done to determine the cause.\n\nTests that may be performed include:\n\n* Slit-lamp examination\n* Tensilon (edrophonium) test for myasthenia gravis\n* Visual field testing\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf a disease is found, it will be treated.

    "content": "**Eyelid Lift**\n\nAn eyelid lift is a surgical procedure done to repair sagging or drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and remove excess skin from the eyelids. The surgery is called ptosis repair and blepharoplasty.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe procedure is typically performed in a surgeon's office or as outpatient surgery in a surgery center. Here's what you can expect:\n\n* You'll be given medicine to help you relax.\n* The surgeon will inject numbing medicine (anesthesia) around the eye so you don't feel pain during the surgery. You may be awake while the surgery is done.\n* The surgeon makes tiny cuts (incisions) into the natural creases or folds of the eyelids.\n* Loose skin and extra fat tissue are removed. If a ptosis repair is also performed, the eyelid muscles will be tightened.\n* At the end of surgery, the incisions are closed with stitches.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nAn eyelid lift is needed when eyelid drooping reduces your vision. You may be asked to have your eye doctor test your vision before you have the surgery. Some people have an eyelid lift to improve their appearance, which is considered cosmetic surgery. The eyelid lift may be done alone or with other surgeries such as a browlift or facelift.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks specific to an eyelid lift may include:\n\n* Damage to eye or loss of vision (rare)\n* Difficulty closing the eyes while sleeping (rarely permanent)\n* Double or blurred vision\n* Dry eyes\n* Temporary swelling of the eyelids\n* Tiny whiteheads after stitches are removed\n* Slow healing\n* Uneven healing or scarring\n* Eyelids may not match\n\nMedical conditions that make blepharoplasty more risky include:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Dry eye or not enough tear production\n* Heart disease or disorders of the blood vessels\n* High blood pressure or other circulatory disorders\n* Thyroid problems, such as hypothyroidism and Graves disease\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou can usually go home the day of surgery. Arrange ahead of time for an adult to drive you home. Before you leave, the health care provider will cover your eyes and eyelids with ointment and a bandage.\n\n* Your eyelids may feel tight and sore as the numbing medicine wears off.\n* Keep your head raised as much as possible for several days.\n* Place cold packs over the area to reduce swelling and bruising. Wrap the cold pack in a towel before applying to prevent cold injury to the eyes and skin.\n* Your surgeon may recommend an antibiotic or lubricating eye drops to reduce burning or itching.\n\nYou should be able to see well after 2 to 3 days. Do not wear contact lenses for at least 2 weeks. Keep activities to a minimum for 3 to 5 days, and avoid strenuous activities that raise the blood pressure for about 3 weeks. This includes lifting, bending, and rigorous sports.\n\nYour surgeon will remove the stitches 5 to 7 days after surgery if they need to be removed. You will have some bruising, which may last 2 to 4 weeks. You may notice increased tears, more sensitivity to light and wind, and blurring or double vision for the first few weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Eyelid Lift Surgery**\n\nAn eyelid lift is a surgical procedure that repairs sagging or drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and removes excess skin from the eyelids.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nAn eyelid lift is needed when eyelid drooping reduces your vision.

    "content": "**Eyelid Twitch**\n\nAn eyelid twitch is a general term for spasms of the eyelid muscles. These spasms happen without your control. The eyelid may repeatedly close (or nearly close) and reopen.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, caffeine, and excessive alcohol intake. Rarely, they can be a side effect of a medicine used for migraine headaches. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear.\n\nYou may have more severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes. This form of eyelid twitching is called blepharospasm. It lasts much longer than the more common type of eyelid twitch. It is often very uncomfortable and may cause your eyelids to close completely.\n\nTwitching can be caused by irritation of:\n\n* Surface of the eye (cornea)\n* Membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva)\n\nSometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be found.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of eyelid twitch are:\n\n* Repeated uncontrollable twitching or spasms of your eyelid (most often the upper lid)\n* Light sensitivity (sometimes, this is the cause of the twitching)\n* Blurry vision (sometimes)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nEyelid twitching most often goes away without treatment. In the meantime, the following steps may help:\n\n* Get more sleep.\n* Drink less caffeine.\n* Consume less alcohol.\n* Lubricate your eyes with eye drops.\n\nIf twitching is severe or lasts a long time, small injections of botulinum toxin can control the spasms. In rare cases of severe blepharospasm, limited removal of some of the muscles around the eyelids or brain surgery may be helpful.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the specific type or cause of eyelid twitch. In most cases, the twitches stop within a week.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThere could be some loss of vision if the eyelid twitch is due to an undetected injury.

    "content": "**Ezetimibe**\n\n*pronounced as (e zet' i mibe)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEzetimibe is used along with diet, alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering medications (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins]) to reduce the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') in the blood in adults and children 10 years of age or older who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). It is also used along with diet, alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins] or fenofibrate) in adults who have too many fats in the blood. Ezetimibe is also used with other medications to reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood in adults and children 10 years of age or older who have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). It is also used to reduce the amount of other fatty substances in the blood in adults and children 9 years of age or older who have homozygous familial sitosterolemia (an inherited condition in which fatty substances from vegetable oils, nuts, and other plant-based foods cannot be removed from the body normally).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEzetimibe comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take ezetimibe, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ezetimibe exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nContinue to take ezetimibe even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ezetimibe without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n* None *\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n* Common side effects may include:\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Abdominal pain\n\t+ Nausea\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Muscle cramps\n\t+ Rash\n\t+ Itching\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\n* Store at room temperature (59-86°F) in a well-closed container.\n* Dispose of unused or expired tablets properly.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much ezetimibe, call your doctor or local poison control center immediately. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle cramps\n* Rash\n* Itching\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nEzetimibe is in a class of medications called cholesterol-lowering medications. It works by preventing the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine.\n\nAccumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\n\n**Brand names**\n\n* Zetia\n\n---\n\n**Ezetimibe: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.**\n\n*   Other uses for this medicine\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n    *   What special precautions should I follow?\n        *   Before taking ezetimibe,\n            1.  tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ezetimibe, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ezetimibe tablets.

It can also bind to many other proteins in the cell to carry out various functions, including:\n\n*   Attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion)\n*   Cell movement (migration)\n*   Determination of cell shape\n*   Relay of signals within cells\n*   Cell survival\n\nThese numerous functions involving filamin A have been found to play roles in regulating skeletal and brain development, the formation of heart tissue and blood vessels, blood clotting, skin elasticity, the maintenance of lung tissue, and the function of the digestive system.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral variants in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with various health conditions, including:\n\n*   **Frontometaphyseal dysplasia**: a condition characterized by abnormalities in skeletal development, particularly involving the joints, and other health problems, including kidney, heart, and airway defects.\n*   **Intestinal pseudo-obstruction**: a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis).\n*   **Melnick-Needles syndrome**: a condition typically the most severe of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, involving abnormalities in skeletal development.\n*   **Otopalatodigital syndrome type 1**: a condition characterized by hearing loss caused by malformations in tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), and skeletal abnormalities involving the fingers or toes (digits).\n\n---\n\n**FLNA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Otopalatodigital Syndrome Type 2**\n\nSeveral variants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, which is part of the otopalatodigital spectrum. This condition is similar to otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 and is characterized by hearing loss caused by malformations in the ossicles, a cleft palate, and skeletal abnormalities involving the digits.\n\nThe FLNA gene variants that cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 all result in changes to the filamin A protein in a region that binds to actin (known as the CH2 domain). Most of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein. These variants are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they appear to lead to a protein with an increased ability to bind to actin.\n\n**Periventricular Heterotopia**\n\nHundreds of FLNA gene variants have been identified in individuals with periventricular heterotopia, a condition in which nerve cells (neurons) do not move properly during the early development of the fetal brain. Most of these variants result in a lack of filamin A protein, which makes the cytoskeleton disorganized and impairs the attachment (adhesion) of cells to one another.\n\n**Terminal Osseous Dysplasia**\n\nAt least one variant in the FLNA gene has been found to cause terminal osseous dysplasia, which is part of the otopalatodigital spectrum. Terminal osseous dysplasia is characterized by skeletal abnormalities in the hands and feet, noncancerous (benign) tumors on the fingers and toes (digits), and dark patches of skin on the face.\n\n**X-linked Cardiac Valvular Dysplasia**\n\nVariants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, a condition characterized by abnormally thick heart valves. Most of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein. These variants likely alter the shape of the protein, impairing its ability to bind to actin and other proteins.\n\n**FG Syndrome**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about FG syndrome.\n\n**Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with frontometaphyseal dysplasia. This condition is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, frontometaphyseal dysplasia, and Melnick-Needles syndrome.\n\nFrontometaphyseal dysplasia involves abnormalities in skeletal development, particularly involving the joints, and other health problems, including kidney, heart, and airway defects. FLNA gene variants that cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia are described as \"gain of function\" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function.\n\nDifferent variants in the FLNA gene appear to produce specific changes in the protein, resulting in particular signs and symptoms that are classified as individual FLNA-related disorders. Researchers suspect that the variants involved in frontometaphyseal dysplasia may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**FLNA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n*   **Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n    *   Variants in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with frontometaphyseal dysplasia, a condition that involves abnormalities in skeletal development, particularly involving the joints.\n    *   The variants are described as \"gain of function\" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function.\n    *   Researchers suspect that the variants involved in frontometaphyseal dysplasia may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of the condition.\n*   **Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction**\n    *   Several variants in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis).\n    *   The FLNA gene variants that cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction include deletions or duplications of genetic material.\n    *   The variants are thought to reduce levels of the filamin A protein or impair its function; this type of variant is called \"loss of function.\"\n    *   Research suggests that decreased filamin A function may affect the shape of cells in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract during development before birth, causing abnormalities in the layering of these muscles.\n*   **Melnick-Needles Syndrome**\n    *   Several variants in a region of the FLNA gene called exon 22 have been identified in people with Melnick-Needles syndrome.\n    *   This condition is typically the most severe of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders and involves abnormalities in skeletal development, causing short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine, partial dislocation of joints, and other health problems.\n\n---\n\n**FLNA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 5/9)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Melnick-Needles Syndrome**\n\nSeveral variants in the FLNA gene, specifically in exon 22, have been identified in people with Melnick-Needles syndrome. This condition is typically the most severe of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders and involves abnormalities in skeletal development, causing short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine, partial dislocation of joints, and other health problems.\n\nThe FLNA gene variants associated with Melnick-Needles syndrome are described as \"gain of function\" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. Researchers believe that the variants involved in Melnick-Needles syndrome may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Otopalatodigital Syndrome Type 1**\n\nSeveral variants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 1. This condition is typically the mildest of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders and is characterized by hearing loss caused by malformations in tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), and skeletal abnormalities involving the fingers or toes (digits).\n\nThe FLNA gene variants that cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 all result in changes to the filamin A protein in a region that binds to actin (known as the CH2 domain). Many of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein. These variants are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they appear to lead to a protein with an increased ability to bind to actin.\n\nResearchers believe that the FLNA gene variants impair the stability of the cytoskeleton and disrupt cellular processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of otopalatodigital syndrome type 1.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Otopalatodigital Syndrome Type 2**\n\nSeveral variants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, which is part of the otopalatodigital spectrum. This condition is similar to otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 and is characterized by hearing loss caused by malformations in the ossicles, a cleft palate, and skeletal abnormalities involving the digits.\n\nThese abnormalities in skeletal development are typically more severe than in otopalatodigital syndrome type 1. The FLNA gene variants that cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 all result in changes to the filamin A protein in a region that binds to actin (known as the CH2 domain). Most of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein.\n\nThese variants are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they appear to lead to a protein with an increased ability to bind to actin. Researchers believe that the FLNA gene variants impair the stability of the cytoskeleton and disrupt cellular processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of otopalatodigital syndrome type 2.\n\n---\n\n**FLNA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Periventricular Heterotopia**\n\nHundreds of FLNA gene variants have been identified in individuals with periventricular heterotopia, a condition in which nerve cells (neurons) do not move (migrate) properly during the early development of the fetal brain leading to seizures and other neurological problems. Most of these variants result in a lack of filamin A protein, which makes the cytoskeleton disorganized and impairs the attachment (adhesion) of cells to one another.\n\nImpaired adhesion alters cells that line the fluid-filled cavities near the center of the brain (the ventricles), which is where neurons develop. Disruption of this lining prevents the movement of neurons to the surface of the brain. Neurons that do not migrate properly during development form clumps (nodules) around the ventricles, resulting in the signs and symptoms of periventricular heterotopia.\n\nIn some cases, variants result in the substitution of one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the protein sequence. These variants may result in the production of a partially functional protein, sometimes causing a milder form of the disorder.\n\n**Terminal Osseous Dysplasia**\n\nAt least one variant in the FLNA gene has been found to cause terminal osseous dysplasia, which is part of the otopalatodigital spectrum of disorders. Terminal osseous dysplasia is characterized by skeletal abnormalities in the hands and feet, noncancerous (benign) tumors on the fingers and toes (digits), and dark patches of skin on the face.\n\nThe FLNA gene variant that causes terminal osseous dysplasia changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene, substituting adenine for guanine at DNA position 5217 (written as 5217G>A). This DNA change alters the way the blueprint for making the filamin A protein is put together. The version of the protein made using this blueprint is abnormally short.\n\nResearchers suspect the altered protein may not be able to interact with other molecules normally. It is thought that the inability to bind to other proteins disrupts important processes involved in skeletal development and cell growth, leading to the bone and skin abnormalities characteristic of terminal osseous dysplasia.\n\n**X-linked Cardiac Valvular Dysplasia**\n\nVariants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, a condition characterized by abnormally thick heart valves. Most of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein. These variants likely alter the shape of the protein, impairing its ability to bind to actin and other proteins.\n\nAs a result, the cell cytoskeleton is weakened and valve cells and the extracellular matrix are disorganized. The cells are not positioned properly within the valve, so the valve becomes malformed.\n\n---\n\n**FLNA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 7/9)**\n\n**X-linked Cardiac Valvular Dysplasia**\n\nVariants in the FLNA gene have been found to cause X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, a condition characterized by abnormally thick heart valves. Most of these variants change single amino acids in the filamin A protein. These variants likely alter the shape of the protein, impairing its ability to bind to actin and other proteins.\n\nAs a result, the cell cytoskeleton is weakened and valve cells and the extracellular matrix are disorganized. The cells are not positioned properly within the valve, so the valve becomes malformed. In addition, the cells' decreased ability to change shape impairs the valves' ability to open and close when the heart pumps blood.\n\nIt appears that excess proteins are produced in the abnormal extracellular matrix, causing the valves to become thickened and further impairing their ability to open and close normally.\n\n**FG Syndrome**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about FG syndrome\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ABP-280\n* DKFZp434P031\n* filamin 1\n* filamin A, alpha\n* filamin A, alpha (actin binding protein 280)\n* FLN\n* FLN1\n* FLNA_HUMAN\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of FLNA\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ FILAMIN A; FLNA\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Brunetti-Pierri N, Torrado M, Fernandez Mdel C, Tello AM, Arberas CL, Cardinale A, Piccolo P, Bacino CA.

    "content": "**FTA-ABS Blood Test**\n\nThe FTA-ABS test is used to detect antibodies to the bacteria Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done routinely to confirm whether a positive screening test for syphilis (either VDRL or RPR) means you have a current syphilis infection.\n\nIt may also be done when other syphilis tests are negative, to check for a possible false-negative result.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA negative or nonreactive result means that you do not have a current or past infection with syphilis.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive FTA-ABS is often a sign of a syphilis infection (past or present). This test result will remain positive for life even if syphilis has been adequately treated. Therefore, it cannot be used to monitor the treatment of syphilis or determine that you have active syphilis.\n\nOther illnesses, such as yaws and pinta (two other kinds of skin diseases), may also result in positive FTA-ABS results. Sometimes, there can be a false-positive result, most often in women with lupus.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**FTA-ABS Blood Test**\n\n**What is the FTA-ABS blood test?**\n\nThe FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) blood test is a diagnostic tool used to detect syphilis infection.

    "content": "**Fabry Disease**\n\n_Fabry disease is an inherited disorder that results from the buildup of a type of fat, called globotriaosylceramide, in the body's cells._\n\n* _Beginning in childhood, this buildup causes signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body._\n* _Characteristic features of Fabry disease include episodes of pain, particularly in the hands and feet (acroparesthesias); clusters of small, dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas; a decreased ability to sweat (hypohidrosis); cloudiness or streaks in the front part of the eye (corneal opacity or corneal verticillata); problems with the gastrointestinal system; ringing in the ears (tinnitus); and hearing loss._\n* _Additional signs and symptoms are possible, which can vary among affected individuals._\n\n_Fabry disease also involves potentially life-threatening complications such as progressive kidney failure, heart failure, and stroke. Some affected individuals have milder forms of the disorder that appear later in life and typically involve only the heart, kidneys, or blood vessels in the brain._\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* _Fabry disease affects an estimated 1 in 1,000 to 9,000 people._\n* _Milder, late-onset forms of the disorder are probably more common than the classic, severe form._\n\n**Causes**\n\n* _Fabry disease is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the GLA gene._\n* _This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A._\n* _Variants in the GLA gene alter the structure and function of the enzyme, preventing it from breaking down globotriaosylceramide effectively._\n* _As a result, globotriaosylceramide builds up in cells throughout the body, particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system._\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* _Fabry disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome._\n* _Males have only one X chromosome, so a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition._\n* _Females can be carriers of the mutated gene, and they may experience mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic._\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* _Fabry disease_\n* _Anderson-Fabry disease_\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* _National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)_\n* _Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)_\n\n---\n\n**Fabry Disease**\n\n**Causes**\n\nFabry disease is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the GLA gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nAlpha-galactosidase A breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. Variants in the GLA gene alter the structure and function of the enzyme, preventing it from breaking down this substance effectively. As a result, globotriaosylceramide builds up in cells throughout the body.\n\n**Forms of Fabry Disease**\n\n*   Classic, severe form: caused by variants that result in an absence of alpha-galactosidase A activity\n*   Milder, late-onset forms: caused by variants that decrease but do not eliminate the enzyme's activity\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the GLA gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n**Impact on Females**\n\nUnlike other X-linked disorders, Fabry disease causes significant medical problems in many females who have one altered copy of the GLA gene. These women may experience many of the classic features of the disorder, including nervous system abnormalities, kidney problems, chronic pain, and fatigue.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency\n*   Anderson-Fabry disease\n*   Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum\n*   Angiokeratoma diffuse\n*   Ceramide trihexosidase deficiency\n*   Fabry's disease\n*   GLA deficiency\n*   Hereditary dystopic lipidosis\n\n---\n\n**Fabry Disease: Understanding the Condition**\n\nFabry disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in every 40,000 to 120,000 people worldwide. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-Gal A, which leads to the accumulation of a particular type of fat called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various parts of the body.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of Fabry disease can vary depending on the individual and may include:\n\n*   Painful swelling of the hands and feet\n*   Gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea\n*   Fatigue and weakness\n*   Cloudy corneas (in some cases)\n*   Nerve damage leading to numbness or tingling in the extremities\n\nDiagnosing Fabry disease typically involves a combination of genetic testing, enzyme assays, and clinical evaluation. Genetic testing can detect mutations in the GLA gene that cause the condition.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Fabry disease, various treatment options are available to manage its symptoms and slow down disease progression. These may include:\n\n*   Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to replace deficient alpha-Gal A enzyme\n*   Chaperone molecules to help stabilize the enzyme and improve its function\n*   Pain management strategies for individuals experiencing pain-related symptoms\n*   Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise\n\n**Prognosis and Quality of Life**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Fabry disease varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of their treatment. In some cases, the condition can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated or inadequately managed.\n\nHowever, with proper care and support, many people with Fabry disease are able to manage their symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. It is essential for individuals diagnosed with the condition to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their unique needs and concerns.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nFabry disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the mutated GLA gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Females can be carriers of the mutation, while males are more likely to express severe symptoms due to their single X chromosome.\n\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of Fabry disease is crucial for accurate diagnosis and counseling families affected by the condition. Genetic testing can help identify carriers and provide critical information for reproductive planning and family decision-making.\n\n**Resources and Support**\n\nFor individuals seeking more information about Fabry disease, several resources are available:\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\nThese resources offer a wealth of information on the condition's diagnosis, treatment, and management. Additionally, connecting with others who have experienced similar challenges can provide emotional support and help individuals feel less isolated.\n\nBy staying informed and seeking appropriate care, individuals with Fabry disease can better navigate their condition and improve their overall well-being.\n\n---\n\n\\n\\n**What is Fabry disease?**\n\nFabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by the buildup of a particular type of fat in the body's cells. It is usually inherited from one's parents and affects both males and females equally.\n\n\\n\\n**How common is Fabry disease?**\n\nFabry disease is relatively rare, affecting about 1 in every 117,000 people in the United States. However, it is more common among certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of Fabry disease?**\n\nThe symptoms of Fabry disease can vary from person to person, but they often include:\n\n*   Pain and cramping in the hands and feet\n*   Gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea or abdominal pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Heat intolerance\n*   Sweating\n*   Cloudy corneas (in some cases)\n\n\\n\\n**How is Fabry disease diagnosed?**\n\nDiagnosing Fabry disease typically involves a combination of genetic testing and clinical evaluation. Genetic testing can detect the presence of the defective gene, while clinical evaluation assesses the severity of symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n**What is the treatment for Fabry disease?**\n\nThere is no cure for Fabry disease, but various treatments can help manage its symptoms. These may include:\n\n*   Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to replace the deficient enzyme\n*   Pain management medications\n*   Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding triggers that exacerbate symptoms\n\n\\n\\n**Can Fabry disease be prevented?**\n\nFabry disease is a genetic disorder, so it cannot be prevented. However, early detection and treatment can significantly improve quality of life for those affected.\n\n\\n\\n**Where can I find more information about Fabry disease?**\n\nFor additional information on Fabry disease, you may want to consult reputable sources such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Fabry Support Network.",

    "content": "**Facelift**\n\n\\n\\n\nA facelift is a surgical procedure to repair sagging, drooping, and wrinkled skin of the face and neck.\n\n**Description**\n\nA facelift can be done alone or with nose reshaping, a forehead lift, or eyelid surgery. While you are sleepy and pain-free (conscious sedation), or deeply asleep and pain-free (general anesthesia), the plastic surgeon will make surgical cuts that begin above the hairline at the temples, extend behind the earlobe, and to the lower scalp. Often, this is one cut. An incision may be made beneath your chin.\n\nMany different techniques exist. The outcomes for each one are similar but how long the improvement lasts may vary.\n\n**During a Facelift**\n\nDuring a facelift, the surgeon may:\n\n* Remove and lift some of the fat and muscle underneath the skin (called the SMAS layer; this is the main lifting part of the facelift)\n* Remove or move loose skin\n* Tighten muscles\n* Perform liposuction of the neck and jowls\n* Use stitches (sutures) to close the cuts\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nSagging or wrinkled skin occurs naturally as you get older. Folds and fat deposits appear around the neck. Deep creases form between the nose and mouth. The jawline grows jowly and slack. Genes, poor diet, smoking, or obesity can make skin problems start sooner or get worse faster.\n\nA facelift can help improve some of the visible signs of aging. Fixing damage to skin, fat, and muscles can restore a younger, more refreshed and less tired look.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of face lift surgery include:\n\n* A pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgically\n* Damage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)\n* Wounds that do not heal well\n* Pain that does not go away\n* Numbness or other changes in skin sensation\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore your surgery, you will have a consultation. This will include a history, physical exam, and a psychological evaluation. You may want to bring someone (such as your spouse) with you during the visit.\n\nFeel free to ask questions. Be sure you understand the answers to your questions. You must understand fully the preoperative preparations, the facelift procedure, the improvement that can be expected, and the care after surgery.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\n**During the Week Before Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon may temporarily place a small, thin drainage tube under the skin behind the ear to drain any blood that might collect there. Your head will be wrapped loosely in bandages to reduce bruising and swelling.\n\nYou should not have much discomfort after surgery. You can relieve any discomfort you do feel with pain medicine the surgeon prescribes. Some numbness of the skin is normal and will disappear in a few weeks or months.\n\nYour head needs to be raised on 2 pillows (or at a 30-degree angle) for a couple of days after the surgery to keep the swelling down. The drainage tube will be removed 1 to 2 days after surgery if one was inserted. Bandages are usually removed after 1 to 5 days. Your face will look pale, bruised, and puffy, but in 4 to 6 weeks it will look normal.\n\nSome of the stitches will be removed in 5 days. The stitches or metal clips in the hairline might be left in for a few extra days if the scalp takes longer to heal.\n\nYou should avoid:\n\n* Taking any aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the first few days\n* Smoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke\n* Straining, bending, and lifting right after the surgery\n\nFollow instructions about using concealing makeup after the first week. Mild swelling may continue for several weeks. You may also have numbness of the face and ears for up to several months.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people are pleased with the results.\n\nYou will have swelling, bruising, skin discoloration, tenderness, and numbness for 10 to 14 days or longer after the surgery. Most of the surgical scars are hidden in the hairline or the natural lines of the face and will fade over time. Your surgeon will probably advise you to limit your sun exposure.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRhytidectomy; Facialplasty; Cosmetic surgery of the face\n\n---\n\n**Facelift: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\nA facelift is a surgical procedure to repair sagging, drooping, and wrinkled skin of the face and neck.\n\n**Description**\n\nA facelift can be done alone or with nose reshaping, a forehead lift, or eyelid surgery. While you are sleepy and pain-free (conscious sedation), or deeply asleep and pain-free (general anesthesia), the plastic surgeon will make surgical cuts that begin above the hairline at the temples, extend behind the earlobe, and to the lower scalp. Often, this is one cut. An incision may be made beneath your chin.\n\nMany different techniques exist. The outcomes for each one are similar but how long the improvement lasts may vary.\n\nDuring a facelift, the surgeon may:\n\n* Remove and lift some of the fat and muscle underneath the skin (called the SMAS layer; this is the main lifting part of the facelift)\n* Remove or move loose skin\n* Tighten muscles\n* Perform liposuction of the neck and jowls\n* Use stitches (sutures) to close the cuts\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of face lift surgery include:\n\n* A pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgically\n* Damage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)\n* Wounds that do not heal well\n* Pain that does not go away\n* Numbness or other changes in skin sensation\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore your surgery, you will have a consultation. This will include a history, physical exam, and a psychological evaluation. You may want to bring someone (such as your spouse) with you during the visit.\n\nFeel free to ask questions. Be sure you understand the answers to your questions. You must understand fully the preoperative preparations, the facelift procedure, the improvement that can be expected, and the care after surgery.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\n**During the Week Before Your Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon may temporarily place a small, thin drainage tube under the skin behind the ear to drain any blood that might collect there.

Folds and fat deposits appear around the neck. Deep creases form between the nose and mouth. The jawline grows jowly and slack. Genes, poor diet, smoking, or obesity can make skin problems start sooner or get worse faster.\n\nA facelift can help improve some of the visible signs of aging. Fixing damage to skin, fat, and muscles can restore a younger, more refreshed and less tired look.\n\nPeople have a facelift because they are not satisfied with the signs of aging on their face, but they are in otherwise good health.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n* A pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgically\n* Damage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)\n* Wounds that do not heal well\n* Pain that does not go away\n* Numbness or other changes in skin sensation\n* Unpleasant scarring\n* Unevenness of the face\n* Fluid that collects under the skin (seroma or sialocele)\n* Irregular skin shape (contour)\n* Changes in skin color\n* Sutures that are noticeable or cause irritation\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore your surgery, you will have a consultation. This will include a history, physical exam, and a psychological evaluation. You may want to bring someone (such as your spouse) with you during the visit.\n\nFeel free to ask questions.

In severe cases, they can affect sight, speech, breathing, and your ability to swallow. Fractures (broken bones), especially in the bones of your nose, cheekbone, and jaw, are common facial injuries.\n\nCertain diseases also lead to facial disorders. For example, nerve diseases like trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy sometimes cause facial pain, spasms, and trouble with eye or facial movement. Birth defects can also affect the face. They can cause underdeveloped or unusually prominent facial features or a lack of facial expression.

Mild cases involving just the lower lip may not be noticed at birth.\n*   A parent, grandparent, or other person may notice the problem later.\n*   If the movement of your infant's mouth looks different on each side when they cry, you should make an appointment with your child's provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   There is no guaranteed way to prevent pressure injuries in the unborn child.

This can cause weakness or paralysis of one side of the face.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to pressure on the facial nerve during delivery. This can occur when the baby's head is compressed or stretched during a difficult birth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma can vary depending on the severity of the condition. In some cases, the only symptom may be a slight drooping of one corner of the mouth. In more severe cases, there may be complete paralysis of one side of the face, causing the eye to close and the mouth to droop.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThis condition is usually diagnosed in the hospital shortly after birth. A healthcare provider will examine the baby's face and look for signs of facial nerve damage, such as weakness or paralysis of one side of the face.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no guaranteed way to prevent pressure injuries in the unborn child. However, proper use of forceps and improved childbirth methods have reduced the rate of facial nerve palsy.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSeventh cranial nerve palsy due to birth trauma; Facial palsy - birth trauma; Facial palsy - neonate; Facial palsy - infant\n\n**References**\n\nBalest AL, Riley MM, O' Donnell B, Zarit JS.

This is a condition in which the facial nerve becomes inflamed.\n\nStroke may cause facial paralysis that comes on rapidly. With a stroke, other muscles on one side of the body may also be involved.\n\nFacial paralysis that is due to a brain tumor usually develops slowly. Symptoms can include headaches, seizures, or hearing loss.\n\nIn newborns, facial paralysis may be caused by trauma during birth.\n\nOther causes include:\n\n*   Infection of the brain or surrounding tissues\n*   Lyme disease\n*   Sarcoidosis\n*   Tumor that presses on the facial nerve\n*   Side effects of medicines, such as botulinum toxin\n\n---\n\n**Facial Paralysis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Facial Paralysis**\n\nDamage or swelling of the facial nerve, which carries signals from the brain to the muscles of the face\nDamage to the area of the brain that sends signals to the muscles of the face\nWeakness of the facial muscles that can occur in neurologic diseases such as myasthenia gravis or some myopathies and muscular dystrophies\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Causes**\n\nBell palsy: a condition in which the facial nerve becomes inflamed\nStroke: may cause facial paralysis that comes on rapidly, with other muscles on one side of the body also involved\nBrain tumor: usually develops slowly, with symptoms including headaches, seizures, or hearing loss\nIn newborns: trauma during birth\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Causes**\n\nInfection of the brain or surrounding tissues\nLyme disease\nSarcoidosis\nTumor that presses on the facial nerve\nSide effects of medicines, such as botulinum toxin\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to take care of yourself at home.

An eye patch is sometimes required to protect the eye.\n\nPhysical and speech therapy can help preserve or restore function.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have weakness or numbness in your face. Seek emergency medical help right away if you have these symptoms along with a severe headache, seizure, or blindness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, including:\n\nAre both sides of your face affected?\nHave you recently been sick or injured?\nWhat other symptoms do you have? For example, drooling, excessive tears from one eye, headaches, facial pain, seizures, vision problems, weakness, or paralysis.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\nBlood tests, including blood sugar, CBC, (ESR), Lyme test\nCT scan of the head\nElectromyography\nMRI of the head\n\nTreatment depends on the cause. Follow your provider's treatment recommendations.\n\nThe provider may refer you to a physical, speech, or occupational therapist. If facial paralysis from Bell palsy lasts for more than 6 to 12 months, surgery may be recommended to help the eye close and improve the appearance of the face.\n\n---\n\n**Facial Paralysis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Facial Paralysis**\n\n*   **Viral infections**: Such as herpes simplex virus, which can cause facial paralysis by damaging the nerve that controls facial muscles.\n*   **Bells palsy**: A condition characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of one side of the face, often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve.\n*   **Stroke**: Can cause damage to the brainstem, leading to facial paralysis on one side of the face.\n*   **Tumors**: Such as acoustic neuroma, which can compress the facial nerve and cause paralysis.\n*   **Multiple sclerosis**: A disease that affects the central nervous system, causing symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or vision problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Facial Paralysis**\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A healthcare provider will examine the face to check for signs of paralysis, such as drooping eyelids or a weak smile.\n*   **Imaging tests**: Such as MRI or CT scans, may be ordered to rule out underlying conditions that could be causing the facial paralysis.\n*   **Electrodiagnostic tests**: Such as electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies (NCS), can help diagnose the cause of facial paralysis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options for Facial Paralysis**\n\n*   **Antiviral medications**: May be prescribed to treat viral infections that cause facial paralysis.\n*   **Corticosteroids**: Can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the facial nerve.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve compression on the facial nerve or repair damaged nerves.\n*   **Physical therapy**: A healthcare provider may recommend exercises to help improve facial muscle strength and coordination.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Facial Paralysis**\n\n*   **Get vaccinated**: Getting vaccinated against herpes simplex virus can help prevent outbreaks that can cause facial paralysis.\n*   **Manage underlying conditions**: If you have a condition such as multiple sclerosis, working with your healthcare provider to manage the disease can help reduce the risk of developing facial paralysis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Facial Injuries and Disorders",

    "content": "**Facial Tics**\n\nA facial tic is a repeated spasm, often involving the eyes and muscles of the face.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTics most often occur in children, but may last into adulthood. Tics occur 3 to 4 times as often in boys as girls. Tics may affect as many as one quarter of all children at some time.\n\nThe cause of tics is unknown, but stress appears to make tics worse.\n\nShort-lived tics (transient tic disorder) are common in childhood.\n\nA chronic motor tic disorder also exists. It may last for years. This form is very rare compared to the common short-lived childhood tic. Tourette syndrome is a separate condition in which tics are a major symptom.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nTics may involve repeated, uncontrolled spasm-like muscle movements, such as:\n\n* Eye blinking\n* Grimacing\n* Mouth twitching\n* Nose wrinkling\n* Squinting\n\nRepeated throat clearing or grunting may also be present. \n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will usually diagnose a tic during a physical examination. No special tests are needed. In rare cases, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be done to look for seizures, which can be the cause of tics.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nShort-lived childhood tics are usually not treated. Calling the child's attention to a tic may make it worse or cause it to continue. A non-stressful environment can make tics occur less often, and help them go away more quickly. Stress reduction programs or cognitive behavioral intervention may also be helpful.\n\nIf tics severely affect a person's life, medicines may help control them.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSimple childhood tics should go away on their own over a period of months. Chronic tics may continue for a longer period of time.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn most cases, there are no complications.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nMake an appointment with your provider if tics:\n\n* Affect many muscle groups\n* Are persistent\n* Are severe\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany cases cannot be prevented.

    "content": "**Factitious Hyperthyroidism**\n\n_Factitious hyperthyroidism_ is a condition characterized by higher-than-normal thyroid hormone levels in the blood and symptoms that suggest _hyperthyroidism_. This condition arises from taking too much _thyroid hormone medicine_.\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Hyperthyroidism_ can be caused by several factors, including:\n\n*   The thyroid gland producing excessive amounts of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).\n*   Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism, which is known as _factitious hyperthyroidism_. This can occur when the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high or when someone intentionally takes excess medication.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are similar to those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except for:\n\n*   The absence of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).\n*   No bulging eyes, as seen in Graves' disease.\n*   No thickening of the skin over the shins.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose factitious hyperthyroidism, blood tests may include:\n\n*   Free T4\n*   Thyroglobulin\n*   Total T3\n*   Total T4\n*   TSH\n\nOther tests that may be performed include radioactive iodine uptake or thyroid ultrasound.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour healthcare provider will instruct you to stop taking thyroid hormone. If necessary, they will reduce the dosage. You should be re-checked in 2-4 weeks to ensure that the signs and symptoms have resolved, which also helps confirm the diagnosis. Individuals with Munchausen syndrome may require mental health treatment and follow-up.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFactitious hyperthyroidism will resolve on its own once you stop taking or lower the dosage of thyroid hormone.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIf factitious hyperthyroidism persists, it may lead to complications similar to those experienced with untreated or poorly treated hyperthyroidism:\n\n*   Abnormal heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)\n*   Anxiety\n*   Chest pain (angina)\n*   Heart attack\n*   Loss of bone mass (potentially leading to osteoporosis)\n*   Weight loss\n*   Infertility\n*   Problems sleeping\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism, consult your provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThyroid hormone should only be taken by prescription and under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Regular blood tests may be necessary to adjust the dosage.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFactitious thyrotoxicosis; Thyrotoxicosis factitia; Thyrotoxicosis medicamentosa; Factitious hyperthyroxinemia\n\n---\n\n**Factitious Hyperthyroidism**\n\n**What is factitious hyperthyroidism?**\n\nFactitious hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid hormone levels in the blood are higher than normal, and symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism. It occurs when too much thyroid hormone medicine is taken for hypothyroidism.\n\n**Causes of Factitious Hyperthyroidism**\n\nThe causes of factitious hyperthyroidism include:\n\n*   **Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine**: This can happen when the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, or when someone takes too much thyroid hormone on purpose and may conceal this.\n*   **Mental disorders such as Munchausen syndrome**: People with mental disorders like Munchausen syndrome may intentionally take too much thyroid hormone to attract attention or sympathy.\n*   **Trying to lose weight**: Some individuals may take excessive amounts of thyroid hormone to aid in weight loss.\n*   **Being treated for depression or infertility**: In some cases, people being treated for depression or infertility may be prescribed high doses of thyroid hormone, leading to factitious hyperthyroidism.\n\n**Symptoms of Factitious Hyperthyroidism**\n\nThe symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are similar to those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except that:\n\n*   **There is no goiter**: The thyroid gland is often small.\n*   **The eyes do not bulge**: Unlike in Graves disease, the most common type of hyperthyroidism.\n*   **The skin over the shins does not thicken**: A characteristic feature of Graves disease.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose factitious hyperthyroidism, blood tests may include:\n\n*   **Free T4**\n*   **Thyroglobulin**\n*   **Total T3**\n*   **Total T4**\n*   **TSH**\n\nOther tests that may be done include radioactive iodine uptake or thyroid ultrasound.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for factitious hyperthyroidism involves:\n\n*   **Stopping thyroid hormone**: Your healthcare provider will instruct you to stop taking thyroid hormone.\n*   **Reducing dosage**: If necessary, your provider will reduce the dosage of thyroid hormone.\n*   **Follow-up**: You should be re-checked in 2 to 4 weeks to ensure that the signs and symptoms are gone.\n\nPeople with Munchausen syndrome may require mental health treatment and follow-up.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFactitious hyperthyroidism will resolve on its own when you stop taking or lower the dosage of thyroid hormone.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIf factitious hyperthyroidism lasts a long time, the same complications as untreated or poorly treated hyperthyroidism may develop:\n\n*   **Abnormal heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)**\n*   **Anxiety**\n*   **Chest pain (angina)**\n*   **Heart attack**\n*   **Loss of bone mass (if severe, osteoporosis)**\n*   **Weight loss**\n*   **Infertility**\n*   **Problems sleeping**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\n---\n\n**Factitious Hyperthyroidism**\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n----------------------------------------\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nPrevention\n------------\n\nThyroid hormone should be taken only by prescription and under the supervision of a provider.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/factor-v-leiden-thrombophilia/",
    "content": "**Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia**\n\n**What is Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia?**\n\nFactor V Leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. It's caused by a specific gene mutation that results in thrombophilia, which is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots that can block blood vessels.\n\n**Risk of Blood Clots**\n\nPeople with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have a higher than average risk of developing a type of blood clot called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVTs occur most often in the legs, although they can also occur in other parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys. Factor V Leiden thrombophilia also increases the risk that clots will break away from their original site and travel through the bloodstream. These clots can lodge in the lungs, where they are known as pulmonary emboli.\n\n**Pregnancy Complications**\n\nThe factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Women with this mutation are two to three times more likely to have multiple (recurrent) miscarriages or a pregnancy loss during the second or third trimester. Some research suggests that the factor V Leiden mutation may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), slow fetal growth, and early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption). However, the association between the factor V Leiden mutation and these complications has not been confirmed. Most women with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have normal pregnancies.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* 10% of individuals with the factor V Leiden mutation ever develop abnormal clots\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Inherited disorder of blood clotting caused by a specific gene mutation\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Factor V Leiden mutation\n* Thrombophilia due to factor V Leiden mutation\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)\n* American Society of Hematology (ASH)\n\nNote: The cleaned output is a rewritten version of the original content, with minor changes to improve clarity and readability.\n\n---\n\n**Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia**\n\n**What is Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia?**\n\nFactor V Leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder of blood clotting caused by a specific gene mutation in the F5 gene.\n\n**Causes of Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia**\n\nA particular mutation in the F5 gene causes factor V Leiden thrombophilia. The F5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor V, which plays a critical role in the coagulation system.\n\nThe coagulation system is controlled by several proteins, including activated protein C (APC). APC normally inactivates coagulation factor V, slowing down the clotting process and preventing clots from growing too large. However, in people with factor V Leiden thrombophilia, coagulation factor V cannot be inactivated normally by APC.\n\nAs a result, the clotting process remains active longer than usual, increasing the chance of developing abnormal blood clots. Other factors that increase the risk of developing blood clots in people with factor V Leiden thrombophilia include:\n\n* Increasing age\n* Obesity\n* Injury\n* Surgery\n* Smoking\n* Pregnancy\n* Use of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) or hormone replacement therapy containing estrogen\n\nThe risk of abnormal clots is also much higher in people who have a combination of the factor V Leiden mutation and another mutation in the F5 gene.\n\n**Frequency of Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia**\n\nFactor V Leiden is the most common inherited form of thrombophilia. Between 3 and 8 percent of people with European ancestry carry one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation in each cell, and about 1 in 5,000 people have two copies of the mutation.\n\n**Association with Pregnancy Loss**\n\nThe factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Women with this mutation are two to three times more likely to have multiple (recurrent) miscarriages or a pregnancy loss during the second or third trimester.\n\nSome research suggests that the factor V Leiden mutation may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy, including:\n\n* Pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia)\n* Slow fetal growth\n* Early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption)\n\nHowever, the association between the factor V Leiden mutation and these complications has not been confirmed.

DVTs occur most often in the legs, although they can also occur in other parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys.\n\nFactor V Leiden thrombophilia also increases the risk that clots will break away from their original site and travel through the bloodstream. These clots can lodge in the lungs, where they are known as pulmonary emboli.\n\nAlthough factor V Leiden thrombophilia increases the risk of blood clots, only about 10 percent of individuals with the factor V Leiden mutation ever develop abnormal clots.\n\n---\n\n**Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia**\n\n**What is Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia?**\n\nFactor V Leiden thrombophilia is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing abnormal blood clots.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe presence of one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk of developing an abnormal blood clot to 3 to 8 in 1,000. Having two copies of the mutation may raise the risk to as high as 80 in 1,000.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* APC resistance\n* Leiden type hereditary resistance to activated protein C\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Thrombophilia due to activated protein C resistance\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO ACTIVATED PROTEIN C RESISTANCE; THPH2\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nCalderwood CJ, Greer IA.

This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\n\n---\n\n**Factor V Assay**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA Factor V assay measures the level of Factor V in your blood. Factor V is a protein that helps your blood clot. If you have low levels of Factor V, your blood may not clot properly, which can increase your risk of bleeding.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe value is normally 50% to 200% of the laboratory control or reference value. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nDecreased factor V activity may be related to:\n\n* Factor V deficiency (a bleeding disorder that affects the ability of blood to clot)\n* Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive (disseminated intravascular coagulation)\n* Liver disease (such as cirrhosis)\n* Abnormal breakdown of blood clots (secondary fibrinolysis)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\nThis test is most often performed on people who have bleeding problems.

It affects the ability of the blood to clot.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\n\nFactor V deficiency is caused by a lack of factor V. When certain blood clotting factors are low or missing, your blood does not clot properly.\n\nFactor V deficiency is rare. It may be caused by:\n\n*   A variant factor V gene passed down through families (inherited)\n*   An antibody that interferes with normal factor V function\n\nYou can develop an antibody that interferes with factor V:\n\n*   After giving birth\n*   After being treated with a certain type of fibrin glue\n*   After surgery\n*   With autoimmune diseases and certain cancers\n\nSometimes the cause is unknown.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nExcessive bleeding with menstrual periods and after childbirth often occurs. Other symptoms can include:\n\n*   Bleeding into the skin\n*   Bleeding of the gums\n*   Excessive bruising\n*   Nosebleeds\n*   Prolonged or excessive loss of blood with surgery or trauma\n*   Umbilical stump bleeding\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests to detect factor V deficiency include:\n\n*   Factor V assay\n*   Blood clotting tests, including partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time (PT)\n*   Bleeding time\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou will be given fresh blood plasma or fresh frozen plasma infusions during a bleeding episode or after surgery.

The decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of factor X.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\n* A normal value is 50% to 200% of the laboratory control or reference value.\n* Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\n* Decreased factor X activity may be related to:\n\t+ Disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs (amyloidosis)\n\t+ Factor X deficiency (a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor X)\n\t+ Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive (disseminated intravascular coagulation)\n\t+ Fat malabsorption (not absorbing enough fat from your diet)\n\t+ Heparin use\n\t+ Liver disease\n\t+ Vitamin K deficiency\n\t+ Taking blood thinners\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n* Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\t+ Excessive bleeding\n\t+ Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n\t+ Multiple punctures to locate veins\n\t+ Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n\t+ Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\nThis test is most often performed on people who have bleeding problems. The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly greater than for people without bleeding problems.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Stuart-Prower factor\n\n**References**\n\n* Gailani D, Benjamin FT, Wheeler AP.

Bleeding ranges from mild to severe depending on how severe the deficiency is.\n\nFactor X deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines, known as acquired factor X deficiency. This is a common cause and can be caused by:\n\n*   Lack of vitamin K (some newborns are born with vitamin K deficiency)\n*   Buildup of abnormal proteins in the tissues and organs (amyloidosis)\n*   Severe liver disease\n*   Use of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Bleeding into the joints\n*   Bleeding into the muscles\n*   Bruising easily\n*   Heavy menstrual bleeding\n*   Mucus membrane bleeding\n*   Nosebleeds that do not stop easily\n*   Umbilical cord bleeding after birth\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Factor X assay\n*   Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)\n*   Prothrombin time (PT)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma or concentrates of clotting factors. If you lack vitamin K, your doctor will prescribe vitamin K for you to take by mouth, through injections under the skin, or through a vein (intravenously).\n\nIf you have this bleeding disorder, be sure to:\n\n*   Tell your health care providers before you have any kind of procedure, including surgery and dental work.\n*   Tell your family members because they may have the same disorder but do not know it yet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with factor X deficiency and their families can be found at:\n\n*   National Hemophilia Foundation -- www.hemophilia.org/community-resources\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/factor-x-deficiency/\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome is good if the condition is mild or you get treatment.\n\nInherited factor X deficiency is a lifelong condition.\n\nThe outlook for acquired factor X deficiency depends on the cause. If it is caused by liver disease, the outcome depends on how well your liver disease can be treated. Taking vitamin K supplements will treat vitamin K deficiency. If the disorder is caused by amyloidosis, there are several treatment options. Your provider can tell you more.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSevere bleeding or sudden loss of blood (hemorrhage) can occur. The joints may get deformed in severe disease from many bleeds.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nGet emergency medical help if you have an unexplained or severe loss of blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for inherited factor X deficiency. When a lack of vitamin K is the cause, using vitamin K supplements can help.\n\n---\n\n**Factor X Deficiency**\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\n\nFactor X is one such coagulation factor. Factor X deficiency is often caused by an inherited defect in the factor X gene. This is called inherited factor X deficiency. Bleeding ranges from mild to severe depending on how severe the deficiency is.\n\nFactor X deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired factor X deficiency. Acquired factor X deficiency is common. It can be caused by:\n\n* Lack of vitamin K (some newborns are born with vitamin K deficiency)\n* Buildup of abnormal proteins in the tissues and organs (amyloidosis)\n* Severe liver disease\n* Use of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin)\n\nWomen with factor X deficiency may first be diagnosed when they have very heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after childbirth. The condition may be first noticed in newborn boys if they have bleeding that lasts longer than normal after circumcision.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Bleeding into the joints\n* Bleeding into the muscles\n* Bruising easily\n* Heavy menstrual bleeding\n* Mucus membrane bleeding\n* Nosebleeds that do not stop easily\n* Umbilical cord bleeding after birth\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Factor X assay\n* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)\n* Prothrombin time (PT)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma or concentrates of clotting factors.

    "content": "**Facts about Monounsaturated Fats**\n\nMonounsaturated fat is a type of dietary fat, one of the healthy fats along with polyunsaturated fat. It's liquid at room temperature but starts to harden when chilled.\n\n*Saturated and Trans Fats*\n\nSaturated fats and trans fats are solid at room temperature. These unhealthy fats can increase your risk for heart disease and other health problems.\n\n*Sources of Monounsaturated Fats*\n\nMonounsaturated fats are found in plant foods, such as:\n\n* Nuts\n* Avocados\n* Vegetable oils\n\nEating moderate amounts of monounsaturated (and polyunsaturated) fats in place of saturated and trans fats can benefit your health.\n\n**How Monounsaturated Fats Affect Your Health**\n\nMonounsaturated fats are good for your health in several ways:\n\n* They can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level.\n* Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance that can cause clogged, or blocked, arteries (blood vessels). Keeping your LDL level low reduces your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n* Monounsaturated fats help develop and maintain your cells.\n\n**How Much You Can Eat**\n\nYour body needs some fats for energy and other functions. Monounsaturated fats are a healthy choice.\n\nAccording to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans:\n\n* Aim for getting no more than 10% of your total daily calories from saturated fat (found in red meat, butter, cheese, and whole-fat dairy products). For a 2,000 calorie diet, that is a total of 200 calories, or 22 grams a day.\n* Keep total fat consumption to no more than 25% to 30% of your daily calories. This includes monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.\n\nEating healthier fats is good for your health. But eating too much fat can lead to weight gain. All fats contain 9 calories per gram of fat. This is more than twice the amount found in carbohydrates and protein.\n\nIt's not enough to add foods high in unsaturated fats to a diet filled with unhealthy foods and fats. Instead, replace saturated or trans fats with healthier, unsaturated fats.\n\n**Reading Nutrition Labels**\n\nAll packaged foods have a nutrition label that includes fat content. Reading food labels can help you keep track of how much fat you eat.\n\nCheck the total fat in one serving. Be sure to add up the number of servings you will eat in one sitting.\nLook closely at the amount of saturated fat and trans fat in a serving. The rest is unsaturated fat. Some labels will list the monounsaturated fat content, some will not.\nMake sure most of your daily fats are from monounsaturated and polyunsaturated sources.\n\n**Making Healthy Food Choices**\n\nMost foods have a combination of all types of fats. Some have higher amounts of healthy fats than others. Foods and oils with higher amounts of monounsaturated fats include:\n\n* Nuts\n* Avocado\n* Canola oil\n* Olive oil\n* Safflower oil (high oleic)\n* Sunflower oil\n* Peanut oil and butter\n* Sesame oil\n\nTo get the health benefits, you need to replace unhealthy fats with healthy fats. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Eat nuts instead of cookies for a snack. Be sure to keep your portion small, as nuts are high in calories.\n* Add avocado to salads and sandwiches instead of dressings and mayonnaise.\n* Replace butter and solid fats with olive, avocado, or canola oil.\n\n**References**\n\nGrundy SM, Stone NJ, Bailey AL, et al. 2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.

    "content": "**Facts about Polyunsaturated Fats**\n\nPolyunsaturated fat is a type of dietary fat, one of the healthy fats along with monounsaturated fat.\n\nIt's found in plant and animal foods such as salmon, vegetable oils, and some nuts and seeds. Eating moderate amounts of polyunsaturated (and monounsaturated) fat in place of saturated and trans fats can benefit your health since saturated fat and trans fat can increase your risk for heart disease and other health problems.\n\n**How Polyunsaturated Fats Affect Your Health**\n\nPolyunsaturated fats can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance that can cause clogged or blocked arteries (blood vessels). Having low LDL cholesterol reduces your risk for heart disease.\n\nPolyunsaturated fats include omega-3 and omega-6 fats. These are essential fatty acids that the body needs for brain function and cell growth. Our bodies do not make essential fatty acids, so you must get them from food.\n\n* Omega-3 fatty acids help:\n\t+ Reduce triglycerides\n\t+ Reduce the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n\t+ Slow the buildup of plaque\n\t+ Slightly lower your blood pressure\n* Omega-6 fatty acids may help:\n\t+ Control your blood sugar\n\t+ Reduce your risk for diabetes\n\t+ Lower your blood pressure\n\n**How Much Should You Eat?**\n\nYour body needs some fat for energy and other functions. Polyunsaturated fats are a healthy choice. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends getting no more than 10% of your total daily calories from saturated fat (found in red meat, butter, cheese, and whole-fat dairy products). Keep total fat consumption to no more than 25% to 30% of your daily calories. This includes monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.\n\n**Replacing Unhealthy Fats with Healthy Ones**\n\nTo get the health benefits, you need to replace unhealthy fats with healthy fats. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Eat walnuts instead of cookies for a snack.\n* Replace some meats with fish. Try eating at least 2 meals with fish per week.\n* Sprinkle ground flax seed on your meal.\n* Add walnuts or sunflower seeds to salads.\n* Cook with corn or safflower oil instead of butter and solid fats.\n\n**Making Healthy Food Choices**\n\nFoods and oils with higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats include:\n\n* Walnuts\n* Sunflower seeds\n* Flax seeds or flax oil\n* Fish, such as salmon, mackerel, herring, albacore tuna, and trout\n* Corn oil\n* Soybean oil\n* Safflower oil\n\n---\n\n**Facts about Polyunsaturated Fats**\n\nPolyunsaturated fats are one of the healthy fats, along with monounsaturated fat.

Instead, replace saturated fats with healthier fats. Overall, eliminating saturated fats is twice as effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels as increasing polyunsaturated fats.\n\n**Reading Nutrition Labels**\n\nAll packaged foods have nutrition labels on them that include fat content.

    "content": "**Facts about Trans Fats**\n\nTrans fat is a type of dietary fat that's worst for your health. Eating too much trans fat increases your risk for heart disease and other health problems.\n\n**What are Trans Fats?**\n\nTrans fats are made when liquid oils are turned into solid fats, like shortening or margarine. These are called partially-hydrogenated oils (PHOs).\n\n**Why are Trans Fats Bad for You?**\n\nYour body doesn't need trans fat, and eating it increases your risk for health problems.\n\n* Cardiovascular disease risk:\n\t+ Trans fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol.\n\t+ They lower your HDL (good) cholesterol.\n\t+ High LDL along with low HDL levels can cause cholesterol to build up in your arteries (blood vessels), increasing your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n* Weight gain and diabetes risk: Consuming a lot of fat, including trans fat, can lead to unwanted weight gain. Excess weight increases the risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.\n\n**Where are Trans Fats Found?**\n\nTrans fats may still be found in many fried, packaged, or processed foods, including:\n\n* Anything fried and battered\n* Shortening and stick margarine\n* Commercially baked cakes, pies, and cookies\n* Refrigerated dough\n\nAnimal foods, such as red meats and dairy, have small amounts of trans fats, which is not cause for concern in its natural form. Most trans fats are artificially made and come from processed foods.\n\n**How to Avoid Trans Fats**\n\nYour body doesn't need trans fat, so it's best to avoid it or eat as little as possible. Here are some recommendations:\n\n* Get no more than 25% to 30% of your daily calories from fats.\n* Limit saturated fat to less than 10% of your daily calories.\n* Use nutrition facts labels to select foods with no trans fat whenever possible.\n\n**Reading Nutrition Labels**\n\nAll packaged foods have a nutrition label that includes fat content. Food makers are required to label trans fats on nutrition and some supplement labels. Reading food labels can help you keep track of how much trans fat you eat.\n\nCheck the total fat in one serving.\nLook closely at the amount of trans fat in a serving.\nLook for the words \"partially hydrogenated\" in the ingredient list. It means oils have been turned to solids and trans fats. Manufacturers can show 0 grams of trans fat if there are less than 5 grams per serving; often a small serving size shows 0 grams of trans fat, but it still might be in there. If there are multiple servings in a package, then the whole package may contain several grams of trans fat.\nWhen tracking trans fat, make sure you count the number of servings you eat in one sitting.\n\n**Making Healthy Food Choices**\n\nTrans fats are found in many processed and packaged foods. Note that these foods are often low in nutrients and have extra calories from both fat and sugar:\n\n* Cookies, pies, cakes, biscuits, sweet rolls, and donuts\n* Breads and crackers\n* Frozen foods, such as frozen dinners, pizza, ice cream, frozen yogurt, milkshakes, and pudding\n* Snack foods\n* Fast food\n* Solid fats, such as shortening and margarine\n* Nondairy creamer\n\nNot all packaged foods have trans fats. It depends on the ingredients that were used. That is why it is important to read labels.\n\nWhile it is fine to treat yourself to high-fat foods occasionally, it is best to avoid food with trans fats completely.\n\nYou can cut trans fat by substituting healthier foods for less nutritious options. Replace foods high in trans and saturated fats with foods that have polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Here is how to get started:\n\n* Use safflower or olive oil instead of butter, shortening, and other solid fats.\n* Switch from solid margarine to soft margarine.\n* Ask what type of fats foods are cooked in when you eat out at restaurants.\n* Avoid fried, packaged, and processed foods.\n* Replace meats with skinless chicken or fish a few days a week.\n* Replace whole-fat dairy with low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\n---\n\n**Facts about Trans Fats**\n\nTrans fats are a type of dietary fat that is detrimental to our health. Consuming too much trans fat increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.\n\n**How Trans Fats Are Made**\n\nTrans fats are created when liquid oils are turned into solid fats, such as shortening or margarine. This process is called partially-hydrogenated oil (PHO).\n\n**The Risks of Trans Fats**\n\nEating trans fats raises your LDL (bad) cholesterol and lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. High levels of LDL along with low levels of HDL can cause cholesterol to build up in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n*   Weight gain and diabetes risk: Consuming a lot of fat can lead to unwanted weight gain, which increases the risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.\n*   Cardiovascular disease risk: Trans fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol and lower your HDL (good) cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n**Where to Find Trans Fats**\n\nTrans fats can be found in many fried, packaged, or processed foods, including:\n\n*   Anything fried and battered\n*   Shortening and stick margarine\n*   Commercially baked cakes, pies, and cookies\n*   Refrigerated dough\n\nAnimal foods, such as red meats and dairy, have small amounts of trans fats, which is not cause for concern in its natural form. Most trans fats are artificially made and come from processed foods.\n\n**Reducing Trans Fat Intake**\n\nTo reduce your intake of trans fats, follow these tips:\n\n*   Use safflower or olive oil instead of butter, shortening, and other solid fats.\n*   Switch from solid margarine to soft margarine.\n*   Ask what type of fats foods are cooked in when you eat out at restaurants.\n*   Avoid fried, packaged, and processed foods.\n*   Replace meats with skinless chicken or fish a few days a week.\n*   Replace whole-fat dairy with low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\nBy being aware of the risks associated with trans fats and taking steps to reduce your intake, you can help protect your health.\n\n---\n\n**Facts about Trans Fats**\n\nTrans fats are a type of unhealthy fat that can harm your health.\n\n**How Trans Fats Affect Your Body**\n\nThey lower your HDL (good) cholesterol.\nHigh LDL along with low HDL levels can cause cholesterol to build up in your arteries (blood vessels). This increases your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n\n**Weight Gain and Diabetes Risk**\n\nMany high-fat foods such as baked goods and fried foods have a lot of trans fat.\nLike all fats, trans fat contains 9 calories per gram. Consuming a lot of fat can lead to unwanted weight gain. Excess weight increases the risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.\n\n**Cardiovascular Disease Risk**\n\nYour body does not need or benefit from trans fats. Eating these fats increases your risk for health problems.\n\n**How Much You Can Eat**\n\nYour body does not need trans fat. You should avoid it or eat as little as possible.\n\nHere are recommendations from the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans:\n\n*   You should get no more than 25% to 30% of your daily calories from fats.\n*   You should limit saturated fat to less than 10% of your daily calories.\n*   You should use nutrition facts labels to select foods with no trans fat whenever possible.\n\n**Reading Nutrition Labels**\n\nAll packaged foods have a nutrition label that includes fat content.

    "content": "**Failure to Thrive**\n\n Failure to thrive refers to children whose current weight or rate of weight gain is much lower than that of other children of similar age and sex.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\n Failure to thrive may be caused by medical problems or factors in the child's environment, such as abuse or neglect.\n\nThere are many medical causes of failure to thrive. These include:\n\n*   Problems with genes, such as Down syndrome\n*   Organ problems\n*   Hormone problems\n*   Damage to the brain or central nervous system, which may cause feeding difficulties in an infant\n*   Heart or lung problems, which can affect how nutrients move through the body\n*   Anemia or other blood disorders\n*   Gastrointestinal problems that make it hard to absorb nutrients or cause a lack of digestive enzymes\n*   Long-term (chronic) infections\n*   Metabolism problems\n*   Problems during pregnancy or low birth weight\n\nFactors in the child's environment include:\n\n*   Loss of emotional bond between parent and child\n*   Poverty\n*   Problems with child-caregiver relationship\n*   Parents do not understand the appropriate diet needs for their child\n*   Exposure to infections, parasites, or toxins\n*   Poor eating habits, such as eating in front of the television and not having formal meal times\n\nMany times, the cause cannot be determined.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n Children who fail to thrive do not grow and develop normally as compared to children of the same age. They seem to be much smaller or shorter. Teenagers may not have the usual changes that occur at puberty.\n\nSymptoms of failure to thrive include:\n\n*   Height, weight, and head circumference do not match standard growth charts\n*   Weight is lower than third percentile of standard growth charts or 20% below the ideal weight for their height\n*   Growth may have slowed or stopped\n\nThe following may be delayed or slow to develop in children who fail to thrive:\n\n*   Physical skills, such as rolling over, sitting, standing and walking\n*   Mental and social skills\n*   Secondary sexual characteristics (delayed in adolescents)\n\nBabies who fail to gain weight or develop often lack interest in feeding or have a problem receiving the proper amount of nutrition. This is called poor feeding.\n\nOther symptoms that may be seen in a child that fails to thrive include:\n\n*   Constipation\n*   Excessive crying\n*   Excessive sleepiness (lethargy)\n*   Irritability\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and check the child's height, weight, and body shape. Parents will be asked about the child's medical and family history.\n\nA special test called the Denver Developmental Screening Test may be used to show any delays in development. A growth chart outlining all types of growth since birth is created.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Electrolyte balance\n*   Genetic testing\n*   Hemoglobin electrophoresis to check for conditions such as sickle cell disease\n*   Hormone tests, including thyroid function tests\n*   X-rays to determine bone age\n*   Urinalysis\n\n---\n\n**Failure to Thrive**\n\n Failure to thrive refers to children whose current weight or rate of weight gain is much lower than that of other children of similar age and sex.\n\n**Causes**\n\n Failure to thrive may be caused by medical problems or factors in the child's environment, such as abuse or neglect.\n\nThere are many medical causes of failure to thrive.

This can be due to various reasons such as poor feeding, nutritional problems, or other medical conditions.\n\n**Symptoms of Failure to Thrive**\n\nOther symptoms that may be seen in a child that fails to thrive include:\n\n* Poor appetite\n* Lack of interest in feeding\n* Delayed growth and development\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and check the child's height, weight, and body shape. Parents will be asked about the child's medical and family history.\n\nA special test called the Denver Developmental Screening Test may be used to show any delays in development. A growth chart outlining all types of growth since birth is created.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Electrolyte balance\n* Genetic testing\n* Hemoglobin electrophoresis to check for conditions such as sickle cell disease\n* Hormone tests, including thyroid function tests\n* X-rays to determine bone age\n* Urinalysis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the delayed growth and development. Delayed growth due to nutritional problems can be helped by showing the parents how to provide a well-balanced diet.\n\nDo not give your child dietary supplements such as Boost or Ensure without talking to your provider first.\n\nOther treatment depends on how severe the condition is. The following may be recommended:\n\n* Increase the number of calories and amount of fluid the infant receives\n* Correct any vitamin or mineral deficiencies\n* Identify and treat any other medical conditions\n\nThe child may need to stay in the hospital for a little while.\n\nTreatment may also involve improving the family relationships and living conditions.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nNormal growth and development may be affected if a child fails to thrive for a long time.\n\nNormal growth and development may continue if the child has failed to thrive for a short time, and the cause is determined and treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPermanent mental, emotional, or physical delays can occur.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if your child does not seem to be developing normally.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nRegular checkups can help detect failure to thrive in children.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGrowth failure; FTT; Feeding disorder; Poor feeding\n\n**References**\n\nMarcdante KJ, Kliegman RM, Schuh AM.
