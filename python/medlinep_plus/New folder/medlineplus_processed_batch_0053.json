Do not take more or less of the medication than instructed, and do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nDesipramine may also be used to treat other conditions, such as anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nChildren younger than 18 years of age should not normally take desipramine. If you are considering taking desipramine, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with this medication or with other treatments.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDesipramine may cause side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and changes in appetite. In rare cases, it may also cause more serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**IMPORTANT WARNING:**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as desipramine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take desipramine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement.\n\n---\n\n**Desipramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Information for Patients**\n\nBefore taking desipramine, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also discuss the risks and benefits of not treating your condition.\n\nHaving depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide.\n\nTalk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants such as desipramine during clinical studies became suicidal.

You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.\n\n**Precautions**\n\nDesipramine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken one or more times a day and may be taken with or without food. Take desipramine at around the same time(s) every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take desipramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of desipramine and gradually increase your dose.\n\nIt may take 2 to 3 weeks for you to feel the full benefit of desipramine. Continue to take desipramine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking desipramine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking desipramine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, headache, and weakness.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDesipramine is used to treat depression. Desipramine is in a class of medications called tricyclic antidepressants. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain that are needed for mental balance.\n\n\\n\\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\n*   Treating other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic pain, and sleep disorders\n\n---\n\n**Desipramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking desipramine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to desipramine, clomipramine (Anafranil), imipramine (Tofranil), trimipramine (Surmontil), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in desipramine tablets.

    "content": "**Desmoid Tumor**\n\nA desmoid tumor is an abnormal growth that arises from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. Typically, a single tumor develops, although some people have multiple tumors. The tumors can occur anywhere in the body.\n\n* **Types of Desmoid Tumors:**\n\t+ Abdominal desmoid tumors (those that form in the abdominal wall)\n\t+ Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors (those that arise from the tissue connecting abdominal organs)\n\t+ Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors (those found in other regions of the body, occurring most often in the shoulders, upper arms, and upper legs)\n\nDesmoid tumors are fibrous, much like scar tissue. They are generally not considered cancerous because they do not spread to other parts of the body; however, they can aggressively invade surrounding tissue and be difficult to remove surgically.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom is pain. Other signs and symptoms vary based on size and location:\n\n* Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors: bowel blockage causing constipation\n* Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors: restricted joint movement, limping, or difficulty moving arms or legs\n\nDesmoid tumors occur frequently in people with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited form of colon cancer. These individuals typically develop intra-abdominal desmoid tumors along with abnormal growths and cancerous tumors in the colon. Desmoid tumors not part of an inherited condition are described as sporadic.\n\n---\n\n**Desmoid Tumor**\n\n**What are Desmoid Tumors?**\n\nDesmoid tumors are abnormal growths that arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles.\n\n**Types of Desmoid Tumors**\n\n*   Abdominal desmoid tumors: form in the abdominal wall\n*   Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors: form from the tissue that connects the abdominal organs\n*   Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors: occur in other regions of the body, most often in the shoulders, upper arms, and upper legs\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of desmoid tumors is pain. Other signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CTNNB1 gene or the APC gene cause desmoid tumors. CTNNB1 gene mutations account for around 85 percent of sporadic desmoid tumors. APC gene mutations cause desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis as well as 10 to 15 percent of sporadic desmoid tumors.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDesmoid tumors are rare, affecting an estimated 1 to 2 per 500,000 people worldwide. In the United States, 900 to 1,500 new cases are diagnosed per year. Sporadic desmoid tumors are more common than those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.\n\n---\n\n**Desmoid Tumor**\n\n**What is Desmoid Tumor?**\n\nDesmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare type of cancer that grows in the soft tissues of the body.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of desmoid tumors is still not fully understood. However, research has shown that mutations in the APC gene can lead to an increased risk of developing desmoid tumors. These mutations can be inherited or occur spontaneously during a person's lifetime.\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Desmoid disease, hereditary\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Desmoid tumor\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY; DESMD\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Alman BA, Li C, Pajerski ME, Diaz-Cano S, Wolfe HJ.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor. In other cases, watchful waiting or monitoring with regular check-ups may be recommended.\n*   **Prognosis**: The prognosis for individuals with desmoid tumors is generally good, especially if the tumor is small and not causing any symptoms.

However, in some cases, a doctor may decide that desvenlafaxine is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\n*   **What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n    You should not change your diet while taking this medication without consulting your doctor.\n*   **What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n    If you forget to take a dose of desvenlafaxine, take it as soon as you remember.

You should also discuss the risks and benefits of not treating your condition.\n*   **Suicidal Thoughts:** Having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide.\n*   **Children and Teenagers:** A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as desvenlafaxine during clinical studies became suicidal. Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDesvenlafaxine is used to treat depression. Desvenlafaxine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole with plenty of water; do not split, chew, crush, or dissolve them.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nDesvenlafaxine controls depression, but does not cure it. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of desvenlafaxine. Continue to take desvenlafaxine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking desvenlafaxine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking desvenlafaxine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness; confusion; nausea; headache; ringing in the ears; irritability; aggressive behavior; inability to control emotions; frequent mood changes; abnormally excited, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, diarrhea, anxiety; extreme tiredness; unusual dreams; seizures; sweating; uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body; blurred vision; or pain, burning or tingling in the hands or feet.

    "content": "**Detergent Poisoning**\n\nDetergents are powerful cleaning products that may contain strong acids, alkalis, or phosphates. Cationic detergents are often used as germ-killing cleansers (antiseptics) in hospitals. Anionic detergents are sometimes used to clean carpeting. Detergent poisoning occurs when someone swallows cationic or anionic detergents.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredients**\n\n* Damaging (corrosive) acids, including benzalkonium chloride\n* Simple soap\n\n**Where Found**\n\nDetergent is commonly found in household cleaning products such as laundry detergent and dish detergent.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDetergent poisoning can cause symptoms in many parts of the body.\n\n* **BLOOD**\n\t+ Severe change in acid level of blood (pH balance), which leads to damage in all of the body organs\n* **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n\t+ Loss of vision\n\t+ Severe pain in the throat\n\t+ Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n* **GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM**\n\t+ Blood in the stool\n\t+ Burns and possible holes in the throat and esophagus (swallowing tube)\n\t+ Severe abdominal pain\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Vomiting blood\n* **HEART AND CIRCULATION SYSTEM**\n\t+ Collapse\n\t+ Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n* **LUNGS AND AIRWAYS**\n\t+ Breathing difficulty (from breathing in the detergent)\n\t+ Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty)\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Burns\n\t+ Holes (necrosis) in the skin or tissues underneath\n\t+ Irritation\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSeek medical help right away. Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nGet the following information:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* Name of the product (and ingredients and strength, if known)\n* Time it was swallowed\n* Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was aspirated)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n* Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n* Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n* Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\n* Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed.\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n---\n\n**Detergent Poisoning**\n\n**What is Detergent Poisoning?**\n\nDetergent poisoning occurs when someone swallows cationic or anionic detergents, which are powerful cleaning products that may contain strong acids, alkalis, or phosphates.\n\n**Where is Detergent Found?**\n\nDetergent is commonly found in household cleaning products such as laundry detergent and dish detergent.\n\n**Symptoms of Detergent Poisoning**\n\nDetergent poisoning can cause symptoms in many parts of the body, including:\n\n* **BLOOD**\n\t+ Severe change in acid level of blood (pH balance), which leads to damage in all of the body organs\n* **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n\t+ Loss of vision\n\t+ Severe pain in the throat\n\t+ Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n* **GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM**\n\t+ Blood in the stool\n\t+ Burns and possible holes in the throat and esophagus (swallowing tube)\n\t+ Severe abdominal pain\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Vomiting blood\n* **HEART AND CIRCULATION SYSTEM**\n\t+ Collapse\n\t+ Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n* **LUNGS AND AIRWAYS**\n\t+ Breathing difficulty (from breathing in the detergent)\n\t+ Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty)\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Burns\n\t+ Holes (necrosis) in the skin or tissues underneath\n\t+ Irritation\n\n**Treatment for Detergent Poisoning**\n\nSeek medical help right away.

    "content": "**Deucravacitinib**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDeucravacitinib is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in adults 18 years of age or older whose psoriasis is too severe to be treated by topical medications alone. Deucravacitinib should not be taken with other medications that suppress the immune system. Deucravacitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cells to multiply.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDeucravacitinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take deucravacitinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take deucravacitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nDeucravacitinib controls psoriasis but does not cure it. Continue to take deucravacitinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking deucravacitinib without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking deucravacitinib,\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to deucravacitinib, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in deucravacitinib tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking deucravacitinib. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\ntell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, elevated triglycerides, or cancer.\n\ntell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking deucravacitinib, call your doctor.\n\ncheck with your doctor to see if you need to receive any vaccinations. It is important to have all vaccines appropriate for your age before beginning your treatment with deucravacitinib. Also tell your doctor if you have recently received any vaccinations. Do not have any vaccinations during your treatment without talking to your doctor.\n\nyou should know that deucravacitinib may decrease your ability to fight infection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi and increase the risk that you will get an infection. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you have or think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as herpes or cold sores), and chronic infections that do not go away. If you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment with deucravacitinib, call your doctor immediately: fever, sweats, or chills, muscle aches, shortness of breath, cough, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea, stomach pain, frequent, urgent, or painful urination, or other signs of infection.\n\nyou should know that using deucravacitinib increases the risk that you will develop tuberculosis (TB; a serious lung infection), especially if you are already infected with tuberculosis but do not have any symptoms of the disease. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB, if you have lived in a country where TB is common, or if you have been around someone who has TB. Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using deucravacitnib. If you have any of the following symptoms of TB, or if you develop any of these symptoms during your treatment, call your doctor immediately: cough, coughing up blood or mucus, weakness or tiredness, weight loss, loss of appetite, chills, fever, or night sweats.\n\n---\n\n**Deucravacitinib: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking deucravacitinib.

    "content": "**Developmental and Behavioral Screening Tests**\n\n**What are developmental and behavioral screening tests?**\n\nDevelopmental and behavioral screening tests look at how your child is developing. The screenings are made up of checklists and questionnaires for parents. They include questions about your child's language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions.\n\n**Many of the questions are based on developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are skills and behaviors that show up in babies and children reach at certain ages as they grow. They can include smiling for the first time, rolling over, and walking. The screenings compare your child's milestones to those of other children of the same age. If a screening shows your child is developing at a slower rate, it may be a sign of a developmental disability.**\n\n**Developmental disabilities are conditions that begin during a child's developmental period and can cause physical, learning, language, or behavior issues. These conditions may cause challenges in completing daily tasks and last through the person’s lifetime. They include:**\n\n*   **Intellectual disabilities (IDs).** These conditions cause limitations in mental abilities. People with IDs often need help with learning and daily living skills.\n*   **Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).** This is a disorder that affects behavior, communication, and social skills.\n*   **Cerebral palsy (CP).** This is a condition that affects movement, coordination, and balance.\n*   **Deafness or other hearing problems**\n\n**Developmental and behavioral screening tests don't diagnose these conditions, but they can show if your child is not developing on schedule. If the screening tool finds an area of concern, a trained specialist may do a formal developmental evaluation. This could involve observation of your child, tests, and/or having you complete a questionnaire.**\n\n**The results of a formal developmental evaluation help determine if your child needs treatment. When developmental disabilities are found and treated early, it can help to improve your child's life. Early treatment, known as early intervention, helps children learn important skills and make the most of their strengths.**\n\n**Other names: Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), Child Development Inventories (CDI)**\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nDevelopmental and behavioral screening tests are used to see if a child is meeting their developmental milestones. Children grow at different rates, and there is a range in what is considered normal development. But looking at milestones can help identify potential problems early.\n\n**Below are some examples of milestones for infants and toddlers:**\n\n*   **By 4 months:** Includes smiling, cooing, and bringing their hands to their mouth.\n*   **By 6 months:** Includes playing with others, looking at themselves in the mirror, sitting without support, and rolling over.\n*   **By 9 months:** Includes making sounds like \"mama\" and \"dada,\" understanding the word \"no,\" crawling, and pulling themselves up to standing.\n*   **By 1 year:** Includes playing peekaboo, following simple directions, and walking while holding on to furniture.\n*   **By 18 months:** Includes speaking and understanding several words, eating with a spoon, walking, and going up and down stairs.\n*   **By 2 years:** Includes noticing when others are upset, saying at least two words together, using more gestures such as nodding yes, and kicking a ball.\n*   **By 3 years:** Includes recognizing labels and colors, naming pictures of common objects, getting dressed and undressed, and walking and running easily.\n\n**Developmental milestones are general guidelines. If your child reaches one of the developmental milestones later than other children of the same age, they may have a developmental delay.**\n\n**If developmental delays don't go away on their own, early treatment may help your child catch up with other children their age. But if a provider identifies that your child has a developmental disability, early treatment may help, but these are usually lifelong conditions.**\n\n**Why does my child need a developmental and behavioral screening test?**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screenings for all children during regular well-child checkups at the following ages:\n\n*   **9 months**\n*   **18 months**\n*   **30 months**\n\nThe AAP also recommends that all children should be screened for autism spectrum disorder during regular checkups at:\n\n*   **18 months**\n*   **24 months**\n\nYour child's provider may want to do additional screening if your child is at a higher risk for developmental concerns, for example because of:\n\n*   **A premature birth**\n*   **A low birth weight**\n*   **Being one of a multiple birth**\n*   **Exposure to lead or other environmental risks**\n*   **An infection during pregnancy**\n\n**As a parent, you will probably be the first to notice any problems with how your child interacts, learns, speaks, or moves. Talk with your provider about a screening if you think there is a problem with your child's development.**\n\n**What happens during a developmental and behavioral screening test?**\n\nScreenings may be done by your child's provider and/or by you with guidance from your child's provider.\n\nThere are many different types of developmental and behavioral screening tests. Each asks questions about a child's development. You may be asked about your child's social interactions, language skills, and/or gross and fine motor skills. Motor skills are the ability to move muscles.\n\nGross motor skills involve moving large muscles, for example when walking and jumping. Fine motor skills involve the ability to move small muscles with precision, such as when picking up a toy or using a fork.\n\nThere are many screening tests. Some of the common ones include:\n\n*   **Ages and Stages Questionnaire.** This test is designed for children between the ages of 1 month and 5 1/2 years. It contains a series of questions with answer choices of \"yes,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"not yet.\"\n*   **Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS).** This test is designed for children from birth to age 8. It is a brief test that can be completed in about five minutes.\n*   **Child Development Inventories (CDI).** These are three different tests geared to age groups from infancy to preschool. Each contains 60 yes or no questions.\n*   **Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT).** This test is for toddlers between the ages of 16 and 30 months. It includes a series of 23 yes or no questions.\n\n**Are there any special preparations needed for this screening?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for this screening.\n\n**Are there any risks to the screening?**\n\nThere is no risk in taking a questionnaire.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf the results show that your child is not developing at the same rate as other children of the same age, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem. But your child may be referred to a specialist for further testing and treatment.\n\nIf you have questions about the results, talk to your child's provider. When deciding on the next steps, your provider may consider the results of the screening tests in combination with your child's health and family history.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about developmental and behavioral screening tests?**\n\nIf screening tests show a problem with your child's development, your child's provider may recommend at-home developmental monitoring. Developmental monitoring is a way to look at how your child grows and changes over time. To do it, parents and other caregivers use brief checklists to track the child's development.\n\nShow references\n\n---\n\n**Developmental and Behavioral Screening Tests**\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nDevelopmental and behavioral screening tests are used to see if a child is meeting their developmental milestones.

    "content": "**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\n**What are developmental differences of the female genital tract?**\n\nDevelopmental differences of the female reproductive tract affect the reproductive organs of a female infant. They occur while the baby is growing in the mother's womb.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\nThis development is a complex process. Many things can affect this process. The severity of the differences depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, if the problems occur earlier in the womb, the effect will be more widespread. Problems in the development of female reproductive organs may be caused by:\n\n* Missing or damaged genes (genetic variance)\n* Exposure to certain medicines during pregnancy\n\n**Types of Developmental Differences**\n\nSome babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal gland needs this enzyme to make hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. This condition is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nCertain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development. One medicine known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary according to the specific problem. They may include:\n\n* Breasts that do not grow\n* Inability to empty the bladder\n* Lump in the pelvic area, usually due to blood or mucus that cannot flow out of the uterus\n* Menstrual flow that occurs despite using a tampon (a sign of a second vagina)\n* Monthly cramping or pain, without menstruation\n* No menstruation (amenorrhea)\n* Pain with sex\n* Repeated miscarriages or preterm births (may be due to an abnormal uterus)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider may notice signs of a developmental difference right away. Such signs may include:\n\n* Abnormal vagina\n* Abnormal or missing cervix\n* Bladder on the outside of the body\n* Genitals that aren't clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)\n* Labia that are stuck together or unusual in size\n* No openings in the genital area or a single rectal opening\n* Swollen clitoris\n\nThe belly area may be swollen or a lump in the groin or abdomen may be felt. The provider may notice the uterus does not feel normal.\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Endoscopy of the abdomen\n* Chromosome testing or other forms of genetic testing\n* Hormone levels, especially testosterone and cortisol\n* Ultrasound or MRI of the pelvic area\n* Urine and serum electrolytes\n\n**Treatment**\n\nProviders often suggest surgery for people with developmental differences of the internal reproductive organs. For example, a blocked vagina can most often be corrected with surgery.\n\nIf the female is missing a vagina, the provider may prescribe a dilator when the person reaches young adulthood. A dilator is a device that helps stretch or widen the area where the vagina is supposed to be. This process takes 4 to 6 months. Surgery may also be done to create a new vagina.\n\nTreatment of cloacal abnormalities usually involves multiple complex surgeries. These surgeries fix problems with the rectum, vagina, and urinary tract.\n\nIf the birth defect could cause fatal complications, the first surgery is done shortly after birth. Surgeries for other developmental reproductive differences may also be done while the baby is an infant. Some surgeries may be delayed until the child is much older.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\n**Causes and Development**\n\nA baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy, continuing until the 20th week. Many things can affect this process, including missing or damaged genes (genetic variance) and exposure to certain medicines during pregnancy.\n\nSome babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, leading to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. If a developing female infant lacks this enzyme, the infant will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but with a more male-like appearance.\n\nCertain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development, such as diethylstilbestrol (DES), which has been linked to an abnormally shaped uterus and increased risk of vaginal cancer in female infants.\n\n**Developmental Differences**\n\nDevelopmental differences of the female reproductive tract include:\n\n*   **Differences of sex development (DSD)**\n*   **Ambiguous genitalia**\n*   **Cloacal abnormalities**, where the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into a single tube, leading to difficulties with urine and feces leaving the body.\n*   **Problems with external genitals**, such as a swollen clitoris or fused labia.\n*   **Imperforate hymen**, where the vaginal opening is completely blocked.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPregnant women should not take any substances that contain male hormones. They should check with their provider before taking any type of medicine or supplements.\n\nEven if the mother makes every effort to ensure a healthy pregnancy, development problems in a baby may still occur.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your child has:\n\n*   Genitals that do not look either male or female or have features of both\n*   Male traits\n*   Monthly pelvic pain and cramping, but does not menstruate\n*   Not started menstruation by age 16\n*   No breast development at puberty\n*   No pubic hair at puberty\n*   Unusual lumps in the abdomen or groin\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with developmental disorders of the female genital tract and their families can be found at:\n\n*   DES Action USA -- www.desaction.org\n*   InterAct -- interactadvocates.org\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\nIn this article, we will explore the developmental differences of the female genital tract, including vaginal, ovarian, uterus and cervix problems.\n\n**Vaginal Problems**\n\n*   A female infant may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is.\n*   Some females may have a heart-shaped uterus or a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary according to the specific problem. They may include:\n\n*   Breasts that do not grow\n*   Inability to empty the bladder\n*   Lump in the pelvic area, usually due to blood or mucus that cannot flow out of the uterus\n*   Menstrual flow that occurs despite using a tampon (a sign of a second vagina)\n*   Monthly cramping or pain, without menstruation\n*   No menstruation (amenorrhea)\n*   Pain with sex\n*   Repeated miscarriages or preterm births (may be due to an abnormal uterus)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider may notice signs of a developmental difference right away. Such signs may include:\n\n*   Abnormal vagina\n*   Abnormal or missing cervix\n*   Bladder on the outside of the body\n*   Genitals that aren't clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)\n*   Labia that are stuck together or unusual in size\n*   No openings in the genital area or a single rectal opening\n*   Swollen clitoris\n\nThe belly area may be swollen or a lump in the groin or abdomen may be felt. The provider may notice the uterus does not feel normal.\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Endoscopy of the abdomen\n*   Chromosome testing or other forms of genetic testing\n*   Hormone levels, especially testosterone and cortisol\n*   Ultrasound or MRI of the pelvic area\n*   Urine and serum electrolytes\n\n**Treatment**\n\nProviders often suggest surgery for people with developmental differences of the internal reproductive organs. For example, a blocked vagina can most often be corrected with surgery.\n\nIf the female is missing a vagina, the provider may prescribe a dilator when the person reaches young adulthood. A dilator is a device that helps stretch or widen the area where the vagina is supposed to be. This process takes 4 to 6 months. Surgery may also be done to create a new vagina. Surgery should be done when the person is able to use a dilator to keep the new vagina open.\n\nGood results have been reported with both surgical and nonsurgical methods.\n\nTreatment of cloacal abnormalities usually involves multiple complex surgeries. These surgeries fix problems with the rectum, vagina, and urinary tract.\n\nIf the birth defect could cause fatal complications, the first surgery is done shortly after birth. Surgeries for other developmental reproductive differences may also be done while the baby is an infant. Some surgeries may be delayed until the child is much older.\n\nDepending on the cause, surgery, hormone replacement, or other treatments are used to treat conditions that can cause ambiguous genitalia.\n\nThere have been significant changes in treating ambiguous genitalia. In the past, it was thought that it was best to assign a sex as quickly as possible. This was often based on the external genitals rather than the chromosomes. Expert opinion has shifted to understanding that chromosomal, neural, hormonal, psychological, and behavioral factors can all have an influence on an individual.\n\nMany experts now urge delaying definitive surgery unless it is needed for the health of the infant, and ideally involving the child in the decision. Working with your child’s health care team can help you make the best choices for your child. In addition, a support group can help provide families with the latest research and offer a community of other families, children, and adult individuals who are dealing with the same issues.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with developmental disorders of the female genital tract and their families can be found at:\n\n*   DES Action USA -- www.desaction.org\n*   InterAct -- interactadvocates.org\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCloacal abnormalities can cause fatal complications at birth.\n\nPotential complications may develop if the diagnosis is made late or is wrong. Children with ambiguous genitalia who have internal organs related to the sex opposite from which they were raised may experience severe psychological distress.\n\nUndiagnosed problems in a female's reproductive tract can lead to infertility and sexual difficulties.\n\nOther complications that occur later in life include:\n\n*   Endometriosis\n*   Going into labor too early (preterm delivery)\n*   Painful abdominal lumps requiring surgery\n*   Repeated miscarriages\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your child has:\n\n*   Genitals that do not look either male or female or have features of both\n*   Male traits\n*   Monthly pelvic pain and cramping, but does not menstruate\n*   Not started menstruation by age 16\n*   No breast development at puberty\n*   No pubic hair at puberty\n*   Unusual lumps in the abdomen or groin\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPregnant women should not take any substances that contain male hormones.

They occur while the baby is growing in the mother's womb.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Developmental Differences**\n\nA baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\nThis development is a complex process. Many things can affect this process. The severity of the differences depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, if the problems occur earlier in the womb, the effect will be more widespread. Problems in the development of female reproductive organs may be caused by:\n\n*   **Missing or damaged genes (genetic variance)**: Some babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase.\n*   **Exposure to certain medicines during pregnancy**: Certain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development. One medicine known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES).\n\n**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**\n\nSome babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal gland needs this enzyme to make hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. This condition is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nIf a developing female infant lacks this enzyme, the infant will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. However, the external genitals will have a more male-like appearance. Some babies with this syndrome have difficulties with the concentration of salts in their urine. It is very important that this issue be diagnosed early.\n\n**Diethylstilbestrol (DES)**\n\nCertain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development. One medicine known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Health care providers once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor.\n\nHowever, scientists learned that female infants born to women who took this medicine had an abnormally shaped uterus. The medicine also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.\n\n**Developmental Disorders**\n\nIn some cases, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the person is older.\n\nThe reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas. These areas may include the urinary tract, kidneys, intestine, and lower spine.\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Reproductive Tract**\n\nDevelopmental differences of the female reproductive tract include:\n\n*   **Differences of sex development (DSD)**\n*   **Ambiguous genitalia**\n\nOther developmental differences of the female reproductive tract include:\n\n*   **Cloacal abnormalities**: The cloaca is a tube-like structure in an unborn baby. In the early stages of development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this single tube.\n*   **Problems with external genitals**: Developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia.\n*   **Imperforate hymen**: The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening.\n*   **Ovarian problems**: A female infant may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.\n*   **Uterus and cervix problems**: A female infant may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus.\n*   **Vaginal problems**: A female infant may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe development of the female genital tract is a complex process that can be affected by various factors. In this article, we will discuss the different developmental differences of the female reproductive tract.\n\n**Differences of Sex Development (DSD)**\n\nDSD refers to conditions where an individual has physical characteristics that do not fit typical definitions of male or female. This can include ambiguous genitalia, where the external genitals are not clearly defined as male or female.\n\n**Cloacal Abnormalities**\n\nThe cloaca is a tube-like structure in an unborn baby that serves as a common opening for the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina. In some cases, the cloaca may persist as a female infant grows in the womb, resulting in only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. This can cause difficulty with urine and feces leaving the body, leading to stomach swelling.\n\n**Problems with External Genitals**\n\nDevelopmental problems can lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia. Fused labia is a condition where the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together.\n\n**Imperforate Hymen**\n\nThe hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening, often leading to painful swelling of the vagina.\n\n**Ovarian Problems**\n\nA female infant may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.\n\n**Uterus and Cervix Problems**\n\nA female infant may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, females born with a half-formed uterus and vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body.\n\n**Vaginal Problems**\n\nA female infant may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, which involves the absence of part or all of the internal reproductive organs.\n\n**Causes of Developmental Differences**\n\nDevelopmental differences of the female reproductive tract can be caused by various factors, including genetic variants, certain medicines that the mother takes during pregnancy, and developmental disorders. In some cases, these conditions may not be diagnosed until later in life.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Differences of the Female Genital Tract**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Breasts that do not grow\n* Inability to empty the bladder\n* Lump in the pelvic area, usually due to blood or mucus that cannot flow out of the uterus\n* Menstrual flow that occurs despite using a tampon (a sign of a second vagina)\n* Monthly cramping or pain, without menstruation\n* No menstruation (amenorrhea)\n* Pain with sex\n* Repeated miscarriages or preterm births (may be due to an abnormal uterus)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* Abnormal vagina\n* Abnormal or missing cervix\n* Bladder on the outside of the body\n* Genitals that aren't clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)\n* Labia that are stuck together or unusual in size\n* No openings in the genital area or a single rectal opening\n* Swollen clitoris\n\nThe belly area may be swollen or a lump in the groin or abdomen may be felt. The provider may notice the uterus does not feel normal.\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Endoscopy of the abdomen\n* Chromosome testing or other forms of genetic testing\n* Hormone levels, especially testosterone and cortisol\n* Ultrasound or MRI of the pelvic area\n* Urine and serum electrolytes\n\n**Treatment**\n\nProviders often suggest surgery for people with developmental differences of the internal reproductive organs.

    "content": "**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip**\n\n**What is Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip?**\n\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a dislocation of the hip joint that is present at birth. The condition is found in babies or young children.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of DDH is unknown, but low levels of amniotic fluid in the womb during pregnancy can increase a baby's risk for DDH. Other risk factors include:\n\n* Being the first child\n* Being female\n* Breech position during pregnancy, in which the baby's bottom is down\n* Family history of the disorder\n* Large birth weight\n\nDDH occurs in about 1 to 1.5 of 1,000 births.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere may be no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur in a newborn can include:\n\n* Leg with hip problem may appear to turn out more\n* Reduced movement on the side of the body with the dislocation\n* Shorter leg on the side with the hip dislocation\n* Uneven skin folds of thigh or buttocks\n\nAfter 3 months of age, the affected leg may turn outward or be shorter than the other leg.\n\nOnce the child begins walking, symptoms can include:\n\n* Waddling or limping while walking\n* One shorter leg, so the child walks on their toes on one side and not the other side\n* The child's lower back is rounded inward\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPediatric health care providers routinely screen all newborns and infants for hip dysplasia. There are several methods to detect a dislocated hip or a hip that is able to be dislocated.\n\nThe most common method of identifying the condition is a physical exam of the hips, which involves applying pressure while moving the hips. The provider listens for any clicks, clunks, or pops.\n\nUltrasound of the hip is used in younger infants to confirm the problem. An x-ray of the hip joint may help diagnose the condition in older infants and children.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen the problem is found during the first 6 months of life, a device or harness is used to keep the legs apart and turned outward (frog-leg position). This device will most often hold the hip joint in place while the child grows.\n\nThis harness works for most infants when it is started before age 6 months, but it is less likely to work for older children.\n\nChildren who do not improve or who are diagnosed after 6 months often need surgery. After surgery, a cast will be placed on the child's leg for a period of time.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf hip dysplasia is found in the first few months of life, it can almost always be treated successfully with a positioning device (bracing). In a few cases, surgery is needed to put the hip back in joint.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is unknown, but low levels of amniotic fluid in the womb during pregnancy can increase a baby's risk for DDH.

The provider listens for any clicks, clunks, or pops.\n\nUltrasound of the hip is used in younger infants to confirm the problem. An x-ray of the hip joint may help diagnose the condition in older infants and children.\n\nA hip that is truly dislocated in an infant should be detected at birth, but some cases are mild and symptoms may not develop until after birth, which is why multiple exams are recommended. Some mild cases are silent and cannot be found during a physical exam.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip**\n\n**What is Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip?**\n\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the hip joint does not form properly. It can cause the ball and socket of the hip to be misaligned, leading to a dislocated or unstable hip.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Clicks, clunks, or pops in the hip\n* Uneven legs or differences in leg length\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n* Physical exam: A healthcare provider will apply pressure while moving the hips to detect any clicks, clunks, or pops.\n* Ultrasound of the hip: Used in younger infants to confirm the problem.\n* X-ray of the hip joint: May help diagnose the condition in older infants and children.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* Bracing device (Pavlik harness): Used for most infants when started before 6 months old. It keeps the legs apart and turned outward, holding the hip joint in place while the child grows.\n* Surgery: Needed for children who do not improve or are diagnosed after 6 months. A cast will be placed on the child's leg for a period of time.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n* If DDH is found in the first few months of life, it can almost always be treated successfully with bracing.\n* Hip dysplasia found after early infancy may lead to a worse outcome and may need more complex surgery.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n* Bracing devices may cause skin irritation.\n* Differences in leg lengths may persist despite treatment.\n* Untreated DDH will lead to arthritis and deterioration of the hip, which can be severely debilitating.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you suspect that your child's hip is not properly positioned.\n\n---\n\n**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip**\n\n**What is developmental dysplasia of the hip?**\n\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the hip joint doesn't form correctly, leading to instability or dislocation of the hip. It can occur in one or both hips and is more common in females.\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of DDH is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified:\n\n*   Family history: Having a family history of DDH increases the risk.\n*   Female sex: Females are more likely to develop DDH than males.\n*   Premature birth: Babies born prematurely are at higher risk.\n*   Low birth weight: Babies with low birth weight are more susceptible.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn infants, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Asymmetrical skin folds on the thigh\n*   Limited hip movement or stiffness in the leg\n*   Uneven legs or feet\n\nIn older children and adults, symptoms may be less apparent but can include:\n\n*   Pain or discomfort in the hip or groin area\n*   Limited mobility or stiffness in the hip joint\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDDH is typically diagnosed through physical examination, imaging tests such as X-rays or ultrasound, and sometimes CT scans.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for DDH depends on the severity of the condition and the patient's age. In infants, treatment may involve:\n\n*   Pavlik harness: A device that helps keep the hip in place\n*   Splinting or casting: To stabilize the hip joint\n\nIn older children and adults, treatment may include:\n\n*   Observation: Closely monitoring the condition for any changes\n*   Physical therapy: To improve mobility and strength\n*   Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the hip joint.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent DDH, being aware of the risk factors and seeking medical attention if symptoms arise can help identify the condition early on.",

    "content": "**Developmental Milestones Record**\n\n**What are developmental milestones?**\n\nDevelopmental milestones are behaviors or physical skills seen in infants and children as they grow and develop. Rolling over, crawling, walking, and talking are all considered milestones.\n\n**Why is it important to track developmental milestones?**\n\nThere is a normal range in which a child may reach each milestone. For example, walking may begin as early as 8 months in some children. Others walk as late as 18 months and it is still considered normal. One of the reasons for well-child visits to the health care provider in the early years is to follow your child's development.\n\n**What can I do if I have concerns about my child's development?**\n\nTalk to your child's provider if you have concerns about your child's development. Closely watching a \"checklist\" or calendar of developmental milestones may trouble parents if their child is not developing normally. At the same time, milestones can help to identify a child who needs a more detailed check-up.\n\n**What are some examples of developmental services?**\n\nExamples of developmental services include: speech therapy, physical therapy, and developmental preschool. Research has shown that the sooner the developmental services are started, the better the outcome.\n\n**Below is a general list of some of the things you might see children doing at different ages. These are NOT precise guidelines.

Rolling over, crawling, walking, and talking are all considered milestones.\n\n**Why are Well-Child Visits Important?**\n\nOne of the reasons for well-child visits to the health care provider in the early years is to follow your child's development. Most parents also watch for different milestones. Talk to your child's provider if you have concerns about your child's development.\n\n**How can I Identify if my Child needs Extra Help?**\n\nClosely watching a \"checklist\" or calendar of developmental milestones may trouble parents if their child is not developing normally. At the same time, milestones can help to identify a child who needs a more detailed check-up. Research has shown that the sooner the developmental services are started, the better the outcome.\n\n**What Services are Available for Children with Developmental Delays?**\n\nExamples of developmental services include: speech therapy, physical therapy, and developmental preschool.\n\n**Age-Related Milestones**\n\nBelow is a general list of some of the things you might see children doing at different ages.

It is also called dyslexia.\n\n**Causes of DRD**\n\nDRD occurs when there is a problem in areas of the brain that help interpret languages. It is not caused by vision problems. The disorder is an information processing problem. It does not interfere with thinking ability. Most people with DRD have normal or above-average intelligence.\n\nDRD may appear with other problems, such as developmental writing disorder and developmental arithmetic disorder. The condition often runs in families.\n\n**Symptoms of DRD**\n\nA person with DRD may have trouble rhyming and separating sounds that make up spoken words. These abilities affect learning to read. A child's early reading skills are based on word recognition, which involves being able to separate out the sounds in words and match them with letters and groups of letters.\n\nPeople with DRD have trouble connecting the sounds of language to the letters of words. This may also create problems in understanding sentences. True dyslexia is much broader than simply confusing or transposing letters.\n\nIn general, symptoms of DRD may include:\n\n* Determining the meaning of a simple sentence\n* Learning to recognize written words\n* Rhyming words\n* Exams and Tests\n\n**Diagnosing DRD**\n\nIt is important for your health care provider to check for other causes of learning and reading disabilities, such as emotional disorders, intellectual disability, brain diseases, and certain cultural and education factors.\n\nBefore diagnosing DRD, your provider will:\n\n* Perform a complete medical exam, including a neurological exam.\n* Ask questions about the person's developmental, social, and school performance.\n* Ask if anyone else in the family has had dyslexia.\n\nPsychoeducational testing and psychological assessment may be done.\n\n**Treatment for DRD**\n\nA different approach is needed for each person with DRD. An individual education plan should be considered for each child with the condition.\n\nThe following may be recommended:\n\n* Extra learning assistance, called remedial instruction\n* Private, individual tutoring\n* Special day classes\n\nPositive reinforcement is important. Many students with learning disabilities have poor self-esteem. Psychological counseling may be helpful.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) and Possible Complications**\n\nSpecialized help (called remedial instruction) can help improve reading and comprehension.\n\nDRD may lead to:\n\n* Problems in school, including behavior problems\n* Loss of self-esteem\n* Reading problems that continue\n* Problems with job performance\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your child appears to be having trouble learning to read.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nLearning disorders tend to run in families.

    "content": "**Devices for Hearing Loss**\n\nIf you're living with hearing loss, you know it takes extra effort to communicate with others. But there are many devices that can improve your ability to communicate, reducing stress for you and those around you.\n\nThese devices can improve your life in numerous ways:\n\n* You can avoid becoming socially isolated.\n* You can remain more independent.\n* You can be safer wherever you are.\n\n**Hearing Aids**\n\nA hearing aid is a small electronic device that fits in your ear or behind it. It amplifies sounds so that you're better able to communicate and participate in everyday activities. A hearing aid has three parts:\n\n1. The microphone receives sounds and converts them into electric signals.\n2. The amplifier increases the strength of the signals.\n3. The speaker transmits the amplified sound into your ear.\n\nThere are three styles of hearing aids:\n\n* **Behind-the-Ear (BTE)**: The electronic components are contained in a hard plastic case worn behind the ear, connected to an ear mold that fits into the outer ear.\n* **In-the-Ear (ITE)**: The hard plastic case holding the electronics fits completely inside the outer ear. ITE hearing aids may use an electronic coil called a telecoil to receive sound rather than a microphone.\n* **Canal Hearing Aids**: These hearing aids are made to fit the size and shape of the person's ear. Completely-in-canal (CIC) devices are mostly hidden in the ear canal.\n\nAn audiologist will help you choose the proper device for your hearing needs and lifestyle.\n\n**Assistive Listening Devices**\n\nWhen many sounds are all mixed together in a room, it's harder to pick up the sounds you want to hear. Assistive technology helps people with hearing loss understand what's being said and communicate more easily. These devices bring certain sounds directly to your ears, improving your hearing in one-on-one conversations or in classrooms or theaters.\n\nTypes of assistive listening devices include:\n\n* **Hearing Loop**: A thin loop of wire that circles a room, transmitting amplified sound through the loop.\n* **FM Systems**: Radio signals send amplified sounds from a small microphone worn by the instructor, picked up by a receiver that the student wears.\n* **Infrared Systems**: Sound is converted into light signals sent to a receiver that the listener wears.\n* **Personal Amplifiers**: A small box about the size of a cell phone that amplifies sound and reduces background noise for the listener.\n\n**Alerting Devices**\n\nAlerting devices help make you aware of sounds, such as the doorbell or a ringing phone. They can also alert you to things happening nearby, like a fire, someone entering your home, or your baby's activity. These devices send you a signal that you can recognize, which may be a flashing light, a horn, or a vibration.\n\n**Devices for the Telephone**\n\nThere are many tools that can help you listen and talk on the telephone. Devices called amplifiers make sound louder. Some phones have amplifiers built-in, while others can be attached to your phone. Some amplifiers are held next to the ear, and many hearing aids work with these devices but may require special settings.\n\nOther devices make it easier to use your hearing aid with a digital phone line, helping prevent some distortion. Telecommunication relay services (TRS) allow people with severe hearing loss to place calls to standard telephones. Text telephones, called TTYs or TTDs, allow the typing of messages through a phone line rather than using voice. If the person on the other end can hear, the typed message is relayed as a voice message.\n\n---\n\n**Devices for Hearing Loss**\n\nIf you're living with hearing loss, you know that it takes extra effort to communicate with others.

    "content": "**Dexamethasone Suppression Test**\n\nThe dexamethasone suppression test measures whether cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland can be suppressed. It can also help assess the reason for an excess of cortisol in your body such as if it is due to an excess of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nDuring this test, you will receive dexamethasone. This is a strong man-made (synthetic) glucocorticoid medicine. Afterward, your blood is drawn so that the cortisol level in your blood can be measured.\n\nThere are two different types of dexamethasone suppression tests: low dose and high dose. Each type can either be done in an overnight (common) or standard (3-day) method (rare). There are different processes that may be used for either test. Examples of these are described below.\n\n**Common:**\n\n*   Low-dose overnight: You will get 1 milligram (mg) of dexamethasone at 11 p.m., and a health care provider will draw your blood the next morning at 8 a.m. for a cortisol measurement.\n*   High-dose overnight: The provider will measure your cortisol on the morning of the test. Then you will receive 8 mg of dexamethasone at 11 p.m. Your blood is drawn the next morning at 8 a.m. for a cortisol measurement.\n\n**Rare:**\n\n*   Standard low-dose: Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) to measure cortisol. On day 2, you will get a low dose (0.5 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n*   Standard high-dose: Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) for measurement of cortisol. On day 2, you will receive a high dose (2 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test, including:\n\n*   Antibiotics\n*   Anti-seizure medicines\n*   Medicines that contain corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone\n*   Estrogen\n*   Oral birth control (contraceptives)\n*   Water pills (diuretics)\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done when your provider suspects that your body is producing too much cortisol. It is done to help diagnose Cushing syndrome and identify the cause.\n\nThe low-dose test can help tell whether your body is producing too much ACTH. The high-dose test can help determine whether the problem is in the pituitary gland (Cushing disease) or from a different site in the body (ectopic).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nCortisol level should decrease after you receive dexamethasone.\n\n*   Low dose:\n    *   Overnight: 8 a.m. plasma cortisol lower than 1.8 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\n    *   Standard: Urinary free cortisol on day 3 lower than 10 micrograms per day (mcg/day) or 280 nmol/L\n*   High dose:\n    *   Overnight: greater than 50% reduction in plasma cortisol\n    *   Standard: greater than 90% reduction in urinary free cortisol\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal response to the low-dose test may mean that you have abnormal release of cortisol (Cushing syndrome). This could be due to:\n\n*   Adrenal tumor that produces cortisol\n*   Pituitary tumor that produces ACTH\n*   Tumor in the body that produces ACTH (ectopic Cushing syndrome)\n\nThe high-dose test can help tell a pituitary cause (Cushing disease) from other causes. An ACTH blood test may also help identify the cause of high cortisol.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Dexamethasone Suppression Test**\n\nThe dexamethasone suppression test measures whether cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland can be suppressed.

Then you will receive 8 mg of dexamethasone at 11 p.m. Your blood is drawn the next morning at 8 a.m. for a cortisol measurement.\n\n**Rare**\n\n* Standard low-dose: Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) to measure cortisol. On day 2, you will get a low dose (0.5 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n* Standard high-dose: Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) for measurement of cortisol. On day 2, you will receive a high dose (2 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\n**Read and Follow Instructions Carefully**\n\nThe most common cause of an abnormal test result is when instructions are not followed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test, including:\n\n* Antibiotics\n* Anti-seizure medicines\n* Medicines that contain corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone\n* Estrogen\n* Oral birth control (contraceptives)\n* Water pills (diuretics)\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done when your provider suspects that your body is producing too much cortisol. It is done to help diagnose Cushing syndrome and identify the cause.\n\nThe low-dose test can help tell whether your body is producing too much ACTH. The high-dose test can help determine whether the problem is in the pituitary gland (Cushing disease) or from a different site in the body (ectopic).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nCortisol level should decrease after you receive dexamethasone.\n\n* Low dose:\n\t+ Overnight: 8 a.m. plasma cortisol lower than 1.8 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\n\t+ Standard: Urinary free cortisol on day 3 lower than 10 micrograms per day (mcg/day) or 280 nmol/L\n* High dose:\n\t+ Overnight: greater than 50% reduction in plasma cortisol\n\t+ Standard: greater than 90% reduction in urinary free cortisol\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal response to the low-dose test may mean that you have abnormal release of cortisol (Cushing syndrome). This could be due to:\n\n* Adrenal tumor that produces cortisol\n* Pituitary tumor that produces ACTH\n* Tumor in the body that produces ACTH (ectopic Cushing syndrome)\n\nThe high-dose test can help tell a pituitary cause (Cushing disease) from other causes. An ACTH blood test may also help identify the cause of high cortisol.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Dexamethasone Suppression Test**\n\nThis test is done when your provider suspects that your body is producing too much cortisol.

On day 2, you will get a low dose (0.5 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\t+ Standard high-dose: Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) for measurement of cortisol. On day 2, you will receive a high dose (2 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test, including:\n\n* Antibiotics\n* Anti-seizure medicines\n* Medicines that contain corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone\n* Estrogen\n* Oral birth control (contraceptives)\n* Water pills (diuretics)\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done when your provider suspects that your body is producing too much cortisol. It is done to help diagnose Cushing syndrome and identify the cause.\n\nThe low-dose test can help tell whether your body is producing too much ACTH. The high-dose test can help determine whether the problem is in the pituitary gland (Cushing disease) or from a different site in the body (ectopic).\n\nDexamethasone is a man-made (synthetic) steroid that binds to the same receptor as cortisol. Dexamethasone reduces ACTH release in normal people. Therefore, taking dexamethasone should reduce ACTH level and lead to a decreased cortisol level.\n\nIf your pituitary gland produces too much ACTH, you will have an abnormal response to the low-dose test. But you can have a normal response to the high-dose test.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nCortisol level should decrease after you receive dexamethasone.\n\n* **Low dose**\n\t+ Overnight: 8 a.m. plasma cortisol lower than 1.8 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\n\t+ Standard: Urinary free cortisol on day 3 lower than 10 micrograms per day (mcg/day) or 280 nmol/L\n* **High dose**\n\t+ Overnight: greater than 50% reduction in plasma cortisol\n\t+ Standard: greater than 90% reduction in urinary free cortisol\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n---\n\n**Dexamethasone Suppression Test**\n\nThe dexamethasone suppression test is a medical procedure used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The test involves administering a low dose or high dose of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, and measuring the patient's response.\n\n**Low Dose:**\n\n* Day 3 lower than 10 micrograms per day (mcg/day) or 280 nmol/L\n\n**High Dose:**\n\n* Overnight -- greater than 50% reduction in plasma cortisol\n* Standard -- greater than 90% reduction in urinary free cortisol\n\n**Normal Value Ranges:**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean:**\n\nAn abnormal response to the low-dose test may mean that you have abnormal release of cortisol (Cushing syndrome). This could be due to:\n\n* Adrenal tumor that produces cortisol\n* Pituitary tumor that produces ACTH\n* Tumor in the body that produces ACTH (ectopic Cushing syndrome)\n\nThe high-dose test can help tell a pituitary cause (Cushing disease) from other causes. An ACTH blood test may also help identify the cause of high cortisol.\n\n**Abnormal Results:**\n\nAbnormal results vary based on the condition causing the problem.\n\n* Cushing syndrome caused by an adrenal tumor:\n\t+ Low-dose test -- no decrease in blood cortisol\n\t+ ACTH level -- low\n\t+ In most cases, the high-dose test is not needed\n* Ectopic Cushing syndrome:\n\t+ Low-dose test -- no decrease in blood cortisol\n\t+ ACTH level -- high\n\t+ High-dose test -- no decrease in blood cortisol\n* Cushing syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor (Cushing disease)\n\t+ Low-dose test -- no decrease in blood cortisol\n\t+ High-dose test -- expected decrease in blood cortisol\n\n**False Test Results:**\n\nFalse test results can occur due to many reasons, including different medicines, obesity, depression, and stress. False results are more common in women than men.\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names:**\n\nDST; ACTH suppression test; Cortisol suppression test\n\n**References:**\n\nBertholf RL, Cooper M, Winter WE.

    "content": "**Dexamethasone**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Dexamethasone?**\n\nDexamethasone is a corticosteroid similar to a natural hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It relieves inflammation and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis, skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders, severe allergies, asthma, and cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should I Use Dexamethasone?**\n\nDexamethasone comes as a tablet and a solution to take by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dexamethasone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking dexamethasone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to dexamethasone, aspirin, tartrazine, or any other drugs. Also, inform them about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking dexamethasone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Should I Know About Storage and Disposal of Dexamethasone?**\n\nStore dexamethasone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Dispose of unused medication properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIf you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets or oral liquid.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nDexamethasone is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. If you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug.\n\n---\n\n**Dexamethasone: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking dexamethasone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to dexamethasone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking dexamethasone. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with dexamethasone: ephedrine; aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking dexamethasone. Do not start any of these medications while taking dexamethasone without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nIf you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take dexamethasone without talking to your doctor. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking dexamethasone, call your doctor. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking dexamethasone.\n\nIf you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Dexamethasone makes your stomach and intestines more susceptible to the irritating effects of alcohol, aspirin, and certain arthritis medications: this effect increases your risk of ulcers.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor may instruct you to follow a low-sodium, low-salt, potassium-rich, or high-protein diet. Follow these directions. Dexamethasone may cause an upset stomach. Take dexamethasone with food or milk.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nWhen you start to take dexamethasone, ask your doctor what to do if you forget a dose. Write down these instructions so that you can refer to them later. If you take dexamethasone once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDexamethasone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: upset stomach, stomach irritation, vomiting, headache, dizziness, insomnia, restlessness, depression, anxiety, acne, increased hair growth, easy bruising, irregular or absent menstrual periods.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: skin rash, swollen face, lower legs, or ankles, vision problems, cold or infection that lasts a long time, muscle weakness, black or tarry stool. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Dexamethasone: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\n*   Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.\n*   Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n*   Dispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them.

Adderall is used to treat ADHD in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Adderall XR is used to treat ADHD in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Mydayis is used to treat ADHD in adults and children 13 years of age and older.

The immediate-release tablet (Adderall) is usually taken 2 to 3 times daily, 4 to 6 hours apart, with or without food. The extended-release capsule (Adderall XR) is usually taken upon awakening with or without food. The extended-release capsule (Mydayis) is usually taken upon awakening and must be taken consistently either with or without food.\n\nDextroamphetamine and amphetamine combination should not be taken in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dextroamphetamine and amphetamine exactly as directed.\n\nSwallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the extended-release capsule, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents on a teaspoonful of applesauce. Swallow this mixture right away without chewing. Do not store the applesauce and medication mixture for future use, and do not divide the contents of one capsule into more than one dose.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week.\n\nYour doctor may tell you to stop taking dextroamphetamine and amphetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.\n\nThe medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one dextroamphetamine and amphetamine product cannot be substituted for another product.

    "content": "**Dextrocardia**\n\nDextrocardia is a condition in which the heart is pointed toward the right side of the chest. Normally, the heart points toward the left. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\n\n**Causes**\n\nDuring the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops. Sometimes, it turns so that it points to the right side of the chest instead of the left side. The reasons for this are unclear.\n\nThere are several types of dextrocardia. Many types involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area.\n\nIn the simplest type of dextrocardia, the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart and there are no other problems. This condition is rare. When this occurs, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will often also be arranged in a mirror image. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right.\n\nSome people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages. This condition is called Kartagener syndrome.\n\nIn the more common types of dextrocardia, other heart defects are also present. The most common of these include:\n\n* Double outlet right ventricle (the aorta connects to the right ventricle instead of to the left ventricle)\n* Endocardial cushion defect (the walls separating all 4 chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent)\n* Pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve) or atresia (pulmonary valve does not form properly)\n* Single ventricle (instead of two ventricles, there is a single ventricle)\n* Transposition of the great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched)\n* Ventricular septal defect (hole in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart)\n\nThe abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. In this condition, many of the organs are not in their usual places and may not work properly. For example, the spleen may be completely missing. The spleen is an important part of the immune system, so babies born without this organ are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy, several small spleens exist, but they may not work correctly.\n\nHeterotaxy may also include:\n\n* Abnormal gallbladder system\n* Problems with the lungs\n* Problems with the structure or position of the intestines\n* Severe heart defects\n* Abnormalities of the blood vessels\n\nPossible risk factors for dextrocardia include a family history of the condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere are no symptoms of dextrocardia if the heart is normal.\n\nConditions that may include dextrocardia may cause the following symptoms:\n\n* Bluish skin (cyanosis)\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Failure to grow and gain weight\n* Fatigue\n* Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\n* Pale skin (pallor)\n* Repeated sinus or lung infections\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\n\nTests to diagnose dextrocardia include:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the heart\n* Electrocardiogram (measures the electrical activity of the heart)\n* MRI of the heart\n* Echocardiogram (to view the heart structures and blood flow inside the heart)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA complete mirror image dextrocardia with no heart defects requires no treatment. It is important, however, to let your child's provider know the heart is on the right side of the chest. This information can be important in some exams and tests.\n\nThe type of treatment needed depends on the heart or physical problems the infant may have in addition to dextrocardia.\n\nIf heart defects are present with dextrocardia, the baby will most likely need surgery. Babies who are very ill may need to take medicines before they can have surgery. These medicines help the baby grow larger so surgery is easier to perform.\n\nMedicines include:\n\n* Water pills (diuretics)\n* Medicines that help the heart muscle pump more forcefully (inotropic agents)\n* Medicines that lower blood pressure and ease the workload on the heart (ACE inhibitors)\n\nThe baby might also need surgery to correct problems in the organs of the abdomen.\n\nChildren with Kartagener syndrome will need repeated treatment with antibiotics for sinus and lung infections.\n\nChildren with a missing or abnormal spleen need long-term antibiotics.\n\nAll children with heart defects may need to take antibiotics before surgeries or dental treatments.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBabies with simple dextrocardia have a normal life expectancy and should have no problems related to the location of the heart.\n\nWhen dextrocardia appears with other defects in the heart and elsewhere in the body, how well the baby does depends on the severity of the other problems.\n\nBabies and children without a spleen may have frequent infections. This is at least partially preventable with daily antibiotics.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications depend on whether dextrocardia is part of a larger syndrome, and whether other problems exist in the body. Complications include:\n\n* Blocked intestines (due to a condition called intestinal malrotation)\n* Death\n* Heart failure\n* Infection (heterotaxy with no spleen)\n* Infertility in males (Kartagener syndrome)\n* Repeated pneumonias (Kartagener syndrome)\n* Repeated sinus infections (Kartagener syndrome)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your baby:\n\n* Seems to get frequent infections\n* Does not seem to gain weight\n* Tires easily\n\nSeek emergency care if your baby has:\n\n* A bluish color to the skin\n* Trouble breathing\n* Yellow skin\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSome syndromes that include dextrocardia may run in families. If you have a family history of heterotaxy, talk to your provider before becoming pregnant.\n\nThere are no known ways to prevent dextrocardia. However, avoiding the use of illegal drugs (especially cocaine) before and during pregnancy may lower the risk of this problem.\n\nTalk to your provider if you have diabetes. This condition may contribute to your risk of having a child with certain forms of dextrocardia.\n\n---\n\n**Dextrocardia**\n\n_Dextrocardia is a condition in which the heart is pointed toward the right side of the chest, instead of the left._\n\n**Causes**\n\nDuring the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops.

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDextromethorphan and bupropion is used to treat depression. Dextromethorphan is in a class of medications called NMDA receptor antagonists. The way it works in the brain to treat depression is not known. Bupropion is in a class of medications called antidepressants. It works by increasing certain types of activity in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDextromethorphan and bupropion comes as a tablet to take by mouth with or without food. Initially, it is usually taken once a day for 3 days. After 3 days, it is usually taken twice a day (at least 8 hours apart). Take dextromethorphan and bupropion at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dextromethorphan and bupropion exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\n**Stopping Treatment**\n\nDextromethorphan and bupropion controls depression but does not cure it. Do not stop taking dextromethorphan and bupropion without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking dextromethorphan and bupropion, you may experience serious side effects such as mood changes, agitation, irritability, dizziness, ringing in the ears, shock-like sensations, anxiety, confusion, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, numbness or tingling in the arms, legs, hands, or feet, headache, increased sweating, seizures, or nausea.\n\n---\n\n**Dextromethorphan and Bupropion: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**How to Take Dextromethorphan and Bupropion**\n\nTake dextromethorphan and bupropion exactly as directed.

Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), linezolid (Zyvox), methylene blue, phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate) or if you have stopped taking an MAO inhibitor within the past 14 days. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take the combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion.\n*   Do not take more than one product containing bupropion (Aplenzin, Forfivo, Wellbutrin) or dextromethorphan (in Nuedexta, in cough and cold products) at a time. You could receive too much bupropion or dextromethorphan and experience severe side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, anorexia nervosa (an eating disorder) or bulimia (an eating disorder).

    "content": "**Dextromethorphan**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDextromethorphan is used to temporarily relieve cough caused by the common cold, the flu, or other conditions. Dextromethorphan will relieve a cough but will not treat the cause of the cough or speed recovery. Dextromethorphan is in a class of medications called antitussives. It works by decreasing activity in the part of the brain that causes coughing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDextromethorphan comes as a liquid-filled capsule, a chewable tablet, a dissolving strip, a solution (liquid), an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (liquid), and a lozenge to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 4 to 12 hours as needed. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nDextromethorphan should only be used according to the label or package directions. Do not take more than the recommended amount of dextromethorphan in a 24-hour period. Refer to the package or prescription label to determine the amount contained in each dose. Taking dextromethorphan in large amounts can cause serious side effects or death.\n\nDextromethorphan comes alone and in combination with antihistamines, cough suppressants, and decongestants. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using 2 or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose.\n\nNonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain dextromethorphan, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4-11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.\n\nIf you are giving dextromethorphan or a combination product that contains dextromethorphan to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give dextromethorphan products that are made for adults to children.\n\nBefore you give a dextromethorphan product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.\n\nIf you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.\n\nIf you are using the dissolving strips, place them on your tongue and swallow after they melt.\n\nIf you are taking the chewable tablets you can allow them to melt in your mouth or you can chew them before swallowing.\n\nIf you are taking the extended-release suspension, shake the bottle well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nIf you are taking the lozenges, allow them to slowly melt in your mouth.\n\n---\n\n**Dextromethorphan: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n*   **How to Take Dextromethorphan**\n    *   If you are taking the extended-release suspension, shake the bottle well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n    *   If you are taking the lozenges, allow them to slowly melt in your mouth.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\n*   Stop taking dextromethorphan and call your doctor if your cough does not get better within 7 days, if your cough goes away and comes back, or if your cough occurs with a fever, rash, or headache.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\n*   This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Before taking dextromethorphan,\n    *   tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to dextromethorphan, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the product you plan to take. Check the package label for a list of the ingredients.\n    *   tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate).\n    *   tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking dextromethorphan. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n    *   tell your doctor if you smoke, if you have a cough that occurs with a large amount of phlegm (mucus), or if you have or have ever had breathing problems such as asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis.\n    *   tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking dextromethorphan, call your doctor.\n    *   if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that some brands of chewable tablets that contain dextromethorphan may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.\n\n**What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Forget A Dose?**\n\n*   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next regularly scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take the next one as directed.\n\n---\n\n**Dextromethorphan: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Follow Your Dosage Instructions**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n**What if I Forget a Dose?**\n\nDextromethorphan is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take dextromethorphan regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it.
