This means taking the medicines in a different way than the health care provider prescribed.\n*   Misusing over-the-counter medicines, including using them for another purpose and using them in a different way than you are supposed to.\n\n**Why are Drugs Especially Dangerous for Young People?**\n\nYoung people's brains are growing and developing until they are their mid-20's. This is especially true of the prefrontal cortex, which is used to make decisions. Taking drugs when young can interfere with developmental processes occurring in the brain. It can also affect their decision-making. They may be more likely to do risky things, such as unsafe sex and dangerous driving.\n\nThe earlier young people start using drugs, the greater their chances of continuing to use them and become addicted later in life.Taking drugs when you are young can contribute to the development of adult health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders.\n\n**Which Drugs Most Commonly Used by Young People?**\n\nThe drugs that are most commonly used by young people are alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Recently, more young people have started vaping tobacco and marijuana. There is still a lot we don't know about the dangers of vaping. Some people have unexpectedly gotten very ill or have even died after vaping. Because of this, young people should stay away from vaping.\n\n**Why Do Young People Take Drugs?**\n\nThere are many different reasons why a young person may take drugs, including:\n\n*   To fit in.

Some young people suffer from depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and physical pain. They may do drugs to try to get some relief.\n*   To do better in academics or sports. Some young people may take stimulants for studying or anabolic steroids to improve their athletic performance.\n*   To experiment. Young people often want to try new experiences, especially ones that they think are thrilling or daring.\n\n**Which Young People Are at Risk for Drug Use?**\n\nDifferent factors may raise a young person's risk for drug use, including:\n\n*   Stressful early life experiences, such child abuse, child sexual abuse, and other forms of trauma\n*   Genetics\n*   Prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs\n*   Lack of parental supervision or monitoring\n*   Having peers and/or friends who use drugs\n\n**What Are the Signs That a Young Person Has a Drug Problem?**\n\nChanging friends a lot\nSpending a lot of time alone\nLosing interest in favorite things\nNot taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth\nBeing really tired and sad\nEating more or eating less than usual\nBeing very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense\nBeing in a bad mood\nQuickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good\nMissing important appointments\nHaving problems at school - missing class, getting bad grades\nHaving problems in personal or family relationships\nLying and stealing\nMemory lapses, poor concentration, lack of coordination, slurred speech, etc.\n\n**Can Drug Use in Young People Be Prevented?**\n\nDrug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.\n\nYou can help prevent your children from using drugs through:\n\n*   Good communication with your children\n*   Encouragement, so your children can build confidence and a strong sense of self.\n*   Teaching your children problem-solving skills\n*   Setting limits, to teach your children self-control and responsibility, provide safe boundaries, and show them that you care\n*   Supervision, which helps parents recognize developing problems, promote safety, and stay involved\n*   Knowing your children's friends\n\n---\n\n**Drugs and Young People**\n\n**Why are drugs especially dangerous for young people?**\n\nYoung people's brains are growing and developing until they are their mid-20's.

Your health care provider or dentist will review your medical history, examine your mouth, and ask about any medicines you take.\n* They may suggest blood tests or a test that measures how much saliva you produce.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.\n* If a medicine is causing dry mouth, your provider or dentist may suggest adjusting the dosage or switching medicines.\n* In some cases, they might give you artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Living With**\n\n* There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms:\n\t+ Drink plenty of water\n\t+ Avoid drinks with caffeine, which can dry out your mouth\n\t+ Chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow\n\t+ Avoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry\n\t+ Avoid alcohol and tobacco\n\t+ Using a humidifier at night\n\t+ Use a mouthwash made for dry mouth\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Since dry mouth can raise your risk of tooth decay, it's essential to brush and floss your teeth regularly and see your dentist at least twice a year.\n\n---\n\n**Dry Mouth**\n\nHaving a dry mouth, also called xerostomia, means that you don't have enough saliva to keep your mouth wet. Everyone has a dry mouth once in a while, like when you are nervous or stressed. But if you have a dry mouth all or most of the time, it can be uncomfortable. It can make chewing, swallowing, and even talking difficult. It also raises your risk for tooth decay or infections in the mouth.\n\n**Causes of Dry Mouth**\n\nThere are many possible causes of dry mouth, including:\n\n* Medications that reduce saliva production\n* Certain medical conditions, such as Sjogren's syndrome\n* Radiation therapy to the head and neck\n* Smoking and tobacco use\n* Spicy or salty foods\n* Caffeine\n\n**Symptoms of Dry Mouth**\n\nThe symptoms of dry mouth may include:\n\n* A sticky, dry feeling in your mouth\n* Difficulty swallowing\n* Painful chewing\n* Tooth decay or infections in the mouth\n\n**Treatment for Dry Mouth**\n\nTreatment for dry mouth depends on the cause. For example, if a medicine is causing dry mouth, your provider or dentist may suggest adjusting the dosage or switching medicines. In some cases, they might give you artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better.\n\nThere are also several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms:\n\n* Drink plenty of water\n* Avoid drinks with caffeine, which can dry out your mouth\n* Chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow\n* Avoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry\n* Avoid alcohol and tobacco\n* Using a humidifier at night\n* Use a mouthwash made for dry mouth\n\nSince dry mouth can raise your risk of tooth decay, it's important to brush and floss your teeth regularly and see your dentist at least twice a year.\n\n**Living With Dry Mouth**\n\nIf you have dry mouth, there are several things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n* Use artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better\n* Chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow\n* Avoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry\n* Avoid alcohol and tobacco\n\nIt's also important to see your dentist regularly to prevent tooth decay and infections in the mouth.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nDry mouth can be related to other health issues, such as:\n\n* Sjogren's syndrome\n* Salivary gland disorders\n* Mouth disorders\n* Cancer treatment\n\nIf you have dry mouth, it's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider about any underlying health issues that may be contributing to your symptoms.",

You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\n*   Take the battery with you to the hospital, if possible.\n*   The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n*   The person will need immediate x-rays to make sure the battery is not stuck in the esophagus. Most swallowed batteries that pass through the esophagus will pass in the stool without complication. However, if a battery gets stuck in the esophagus, it can cause a hole in the esophagus very quickly.\n*   The person may receive:\n    *   Blood and urine tests\n    *   Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube from the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n    *   Bronchoscopy -- camera and tube placed down the throat into the lungs and airways to remove a battery that is stuck in the respiratory tract\n    *   Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n    *   Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n    *   Upper endoscopy -- a tube and camera through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach to remove a battery stuck in the swallowing tube (esophagus)\n    *   X-rays to look for the battery\n\nSymptoms will be treated as appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Dry Cell Battery Poisoning**\n\nIf a battery gets stuck in the esophagus, it can cause a hole in the esophagus very quickly.

Take the battery with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Full recovery is often possible if treated quickly.\n\nSerious problems are most often seen following industrial accidents. Most household exposures (such as licking some liquid from a leaking battery or swallowing a button battery) are minor. If a large battery does not pass through the intestinal tract within a limited period of time and is causing bowel blockage or threatens to leak, a surgical procedure with general anesthesia may be needed.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bregstein JS, Prabhu E, Sonnett M.

    "content": "**Dry Socket**\n\n_Dry socket is a complication of having a tooth pulled (tooth extraction)._\n\nThe socket is the hole in the bone where the tooth used to be. After a tooth is removed, a blood clot forms in the socket. This protects the bone underneath as it heals.\n\n_Dry socket occurs when the clot is lost or does not form well._ The bone is exposed to the air. This causes pain and delays healing.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nYou may be more at risk for dry socket if you:\n\n* Have poor oral health\n* Have a difficult tooth extraction\n* Use birth control pills, which may interfere with healing\n* Smoke or use tobacco, which slows healing\n* Do not take proper care of your mouth after having a tooth pulled\n* Have had dry socket in the past\n* Drink from a straw after the tooth is pulled, which can dislodge the clot\n* Rinse and spit a lot after the tooth is pulled, which can dislodge the clot\n\n---\n\n**Dry Socket**\n\nA dry socket, also known as alveolar osteitis, is a painful condition that can occur after a tooth extraction. It happens when the blood clot that forms in the empty socket dislodges or dissolves too quickly.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nYou may be more at risk for dry socket if you:\n\n* Have poor oral health\n* Have a difficult tooth extraction\n* Use birth control pills, which may interfere with healing\n* Smoke or use tobacco, which slows healing\n* Do not take proper care of your mouth after having a tooth pulled\n* Have had dry socket in the past\n* Drink from a straw after the tooth is pulled, which can dislodge the clot\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of dry socket are:\n\n* Severe pain 1 to 3 days after the tooth is pulled\n* Pain that radiates from the socket to your ear, eye, temple, or neck on the same side that your tooth was pulled\n* An empty socket with a missing blood clot\n* Bad taste in your mouth\n* Bad breath or a terrible smell coming from your mouth\n* Slight fever\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour dentist will treat the dry socket by:\n\n* Cleaning out the socket to flush out food or other materials\n* Filling the socket with a medicated dressing or paste\n* Having you come in often to have the dressing changed\n\nYour dentist may also decide to:\n\n* Start you on antibiotics\n* Have you rinse with salt water or special mouthwash\n* Give you a prescription for pain medicine or irrigation solution\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTo care for the dry socket at home:\n\n* Take pain medicine and antibiotics as directed\n* Apply a cold pack to the outside of your jaw\n* Carefully rinse the dry socket as directed by your dentist\n* Take antibiotics as instructed\n* Do not smoke, use tobacco, or drink alcohol\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent dry socket, follow your dentist's instructions for mouth care after you have a tooth pulled.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your dentist if you think you have:\n\n* Symptoms of dry socket\n* Increased pain or pain that does not respond to pain relievers\n* Worse breath or taste in your mouth (could be a sign of infection)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAlveolar osteitis; Alveolitis; Septic socket\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Dental Association website.

    "content": "**Dual Diagnosis**\n\n**What is Dual Diagnosis?**\n\nIf you have a dual diagnosis, that means you have both a mental disorder and a substance use disorder (SUD), either with alcohol or drugs. A dual diagnosis is a type of comorbidity, which is when someone has two disorders at the same time. Another name for this is co-occurring disorders.\n\n**Mental and Substance Use Disorders**\n\nMental and substance use disorders often occur together. Many people who develop SUDs are also diagnosed with mental disorders. And the reverse is true; many people with mental disorders will develop an SUD. Having both types of disorders is even more common in teenagers, people with serious mental illness, and people with certain mental disorders.\n\n**Why Do Substance Use Disorders and Mental Disorders Occur Together?**\n\nAlthough these problems often occur together, this does not mean that one caused the other, even if one appeared first. In fact, it can be hard to figure out which came first. Researchers think that there are three possible reasons as to why they often occur together:\n\n*   **Common Risk Factors**: These factors include genetics, stress, and trauma, especially in childhood. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also at risk for SUDs.\n*   **Mental Disorders Contributing to Drug Use**: People with mental disorders may use drugs or alcohol to try to feel better temporarily. This is known as self-medication. Also, mental disorders may change the brain to make it more likely that you will become addicted.\n*   **Substance Use and Addiction Contributing to Mental Disorder**: Substance use may change the brain in ways that make you more likely to develop a mental disorder.\n\n**Treatments for Dual Diagnosis**\n\nIf you have a dual diagnosis, it is usually better to treat both conditions at the same time rather than separately. You and your health care provider can work on a treatment plan that fits your needs. The plan should take into account your age, which substance(s) you are misusing, and which specific mental disorder(s) you have. The plan may include:\n\n*   **Behavioral Therapy**: Such as talk therapy (psychotherapy), long-term residential treatment (which combines housing and treatment services), and therapies to help you stay motivated to stick with your treatment plan.\n*   **Medicines**: There are effective medicines that treat opioid, alcohol, and nicotine addiction. There are also medicines that can lessen the symptoms of many mental disorders.

Many people who develop SUDs are also diagnosed with mental disorders. And the reverse is true; many people with mental disorders will develop an SUD. Having both types of disorders is even more common in teenagers, people with serious mental illness, and people with certain mental disorders.\n\n**Treating Dual Diagnosis**\n\nIf you have a dual diagnosis, it is usually better to treat both conditions at the same time rather than separately. You and your health care provider can work on a treatment plan that fits your needs. The plan should take into account your age, which substance(s) you are misusing, and which specific mental disorder(s) you have.\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   Learn More: Bipolar Disorder and Alcoholism: Are They Related?

The sons of women who are carriers of the disease each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease.\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms most often appear before age 6. They may start as early as infancy. Most boys show no symptoms in the first few years of life.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Learning difficulties (the IQ can be below 75)\n* Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time)\n\nMuscle weakness begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body. Problems with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping) may occur.\n\nFrequent falls are common due to trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs. Shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the feet due to a weakening of the heart muscle can also occur.\n\nProgressive difficulty walking may lead to loss of ability to walk by age 12, requiring the use of a wheelchair. Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA complete nervous system (neurological), heart, lung, and muscle exam may show:\n\n* Abnormal, weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) that becomes evident by age 10\n* Congestive heart failure or irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmias) that is present in all people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy by the age of 18\n* Deformities of the chest and back (scoliosis)\n* Enlarged muscles of the calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5).

Stem cells and gene therapy may be used in the future.\n\n---\n\n**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n**What is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?**\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy, affecting approximately 1 in every 5,000 to 10,000 births.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nDMD is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which provides instructions for building a protein called dystrophin. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle function. The mutation leads to a lack of functional dystrophin, resulting in muscle weakness and degeneration. DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that it affects males more frequently than females.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of DMD typically become apparent between 2 and 5 years of age. They may include:\n\n* Muscle weakness and wasting\n* Delayed motor milestones (e.g., sitting, standing, walking)\n* Gait disturbances (e.g., waddling, stiffness)\n* Muscle spasms and cramps\n* Respiratory problems (e.g., shortness of breath, coughing)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDMD is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, family history, and genetic testing. Genetic studies can detect the mutation in the dystrophin gene with high accuracy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known cure for DMD, but various treatments aim to control symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* Steroid drugs (e.g., prednisone) to slow muscle strength decline\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and function\n* Speech therapy to address communication difficulties\n* Assisted ventilation to support respiratory function\n* Orthopedic appliances (e.g., braces, wheelchairs) to improve mobility\n* Spine surgery to treat progressive scoliosis\n* Proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nDMD leads to progressively worsening disability. Death often occurs from lung disorders, although advances in supportive care have resulted in many men living to age 35 years.\n\n**Complications**\n\nPossible complications of DMD may include:\n\n* Cardiomyopathy\n* Congestive heart failure (rare)\n* Deformities\n* Heart arrhythmias (rare)\n* Mental impairment (varies, usually minimal)\n* Permanent, progressive disability, including decreased mobility and ability to care for self\n* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections\n* Respiratory failure\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPeople with a family history of the disease may want to seek genetic counseling. Genetic studies done during pregnancy are very accurate in detecting DMD.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nJoining a support group can help ease the stress of illness by connecting with others who share common experiences and problems. The Muscular Dystrophy Association is an excellent source of information on this disease.\n\n---\n\n**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**\n\nPeople with a family history of the disease may want to seek genetic counseling.

Dulaglutide injection is also used to reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Dulaglutide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated).\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to dulaglutide injection.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dulaglutide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDulaglutide injection may increase the risk that you will develop tumors of the thyroid gland, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; a type of thyroid cancer). Laboratory animals who were given dulaglutide developed tumors, but it is not known if this medication increases the risk of tumors in humans. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had MTC or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2; condition that causes tumors in more than one gland in the body). If so, your doctor will probably tell you not to use dulaglutide injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: a lump or swelling in the neck; hoarseness; difficulty swallowing; or shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of dulaglutide injection, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses of dulaglutide injection at one time.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had MTC or MEN 2. If so, your doctor will probably tell you not to use dulaglutide injection.\n\n---\n\n**Dulaglutide Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDulaglutide injection is used with a diet and exercise program to control blood sugar levels in adults and children 10 years of age or older with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Dulaglutide injection is also used to reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Dulaglutide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Dulaglutide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Dulaglutide injection also works by slowing the movement of food through the stomach.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDulaglutide injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) in your stomach, thigh, or upper arm. It is usually injected once a week without regard to meals. Use dulaglutide injection on the same day each week at any time of day. You may change the day of the week that you use dulaglutide as long as it has been 3 or more days since you used your last dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use dulaglutide injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDulaglutide injection controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use dulaglutide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using dulaglutide injection without talking to your doctor.\n\nDulaglutide comes in prefilled dosing pens that contain enough medication for one dose. Always inject dulaglutide in its own prefilled dosing pen; never mix it with any other medication.\n\nCarefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and inject a dose of dulaglutide injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication.\n\nAlways look at dulaglutide solution before you inject it. It should be clear, colorless, and free of solid particles.\n\nYou can inject dulaglutide in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach area. Never inject dulaglutide into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose. You can inject dulaglutide and insulin in the same body area, but you should not give the injections right next to each other.\n\nNever reuse or share dosing pens. Dispose of pens in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Dulaglutide Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using Dulaglutide Injection**\n\nYour doctor will show you how to use dulaglutide injection.

    "content": "**Duodenal Atresia**\n\n_Duodenal atresia_ is a condition in which the first part of the small bowel (the _duodenum_) has not developed properly. It is not open and does not allow the passage of stomach contents.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of duodenal atresia is not known, but it is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would. Many infants with duodenal atresia also have Down syndrome, and the condition is often associated with other birth defects.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes)\n* Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing bile)\n* Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours\n* No bowel movements after first few meconium stools\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA fetal ultrasound may show high amounts of amniotic fluid in the womb (polyhydramnios) and swelling of the baby's stomach and part of the duodenum. An abdominal x-ray may show air in the stomach and first part of duodenum, with no air beyond that, known as the double-bubble sign.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA tube is placed to decompress the stomach, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are corrected by providing fluids through an intravenous tube (IV), and checking for other congenital anomalies should be done. Surgery to correct the duodenal blockage is necessary, but not an emergency. The exact surgery will depend on the nature of the abnormality.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nRecovery from the duodenal atresia is expected after treatment.

This blockage prevents food and air from passing through, leading to severe symptoms.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe cause of duodenal atresia is not known, but it is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. Many infants with duodenal atresia also have Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of duodenal atresia include:\n\n* Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes)\n* Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing bile)\n* Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours\n* No bowel movements after first few meconium stools\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA fetal ultrasound may show high amounts of amniotic fluid in the womb (polyhydramnios).

Checking for other congenital anomalies should be done.\n\nSurgery to correct the duodenal blockage is necessary, but not an emergency. The exact surgery will depend on the nature of the abnormality. Other problems (such as those related to Down syndrome) must be treated as appropriate.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nRecovery from the duodenal atresia is expected after treatment. If not treated, the condition is deadly.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications may occur:\n\n* Other birth defects\n* Dehydration\n\nAfter surgery, there may be complications such as:\n\n* Swelling of the first part of the small bowel\n* Problems with movement through the intestines\n* Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if your newborn is:\n\n* Feeding poorly or not at all\n* Vomiting (not simply spitting up) or if the vomit is green\n* Not urinating or having bowel movements\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention.\n\n**References**\n\nDingeldein M.

    "content": "**Duplex Ultrasound**\n\n_A duplex ultrasound is a test to see how blood moves through your arteries and veins._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA duplex ultrasound combines:\n\n* Traditional ultrasound: This uses sound waves that bounce off blood vessels to create pictures.\n* Doppler ultrasound: This records sound waves reflecting off moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow.\n\nThere are different types of duplex ultrasound exams. Some include:\n\n* Arterial and venous duplex ultrasound of the abdomen. This test examines blood vessels and blood flow in the abdominal area.\n* Carotid duplex ultrasound looks at the carotid artery in the neck.\n* Duplex ultrasound of the extremities looks at the arms or legs.\n* Renal duplex ultrasound examines the kidneys and their blood vessels.\n\nYou may need to wear a medical gown. You will lie down on a table, and the ultrasound technician will spread a gel over the area being tested. The gel helps the sound waves get into your tissues.\n\nA wand, called a transducer, is moved over the area being tested. This wand sends out the sound waves. A computer measures how the sound waves reflect back, and changes the sound waves into pictures. The Doppler creates a \"swishing\" sound, which is the sound of your blood moving through the arteries and veins.\n\nYou need to stay still during the exam. You may be asked to lie in different body positions, or to take a deep breath and hold it.\n\nSometimes during a duplex ultrasound of the arteries of the legs, the health care provider may calculate an ankle-brachial index (ABI). You will need to wear blood pressure cuffs on your arms and legs for this test.\n\nThe ABI number is obtained by dividing the blood pressure in the ankle by the blood pressure in the arm. A value of 0.9 or greater is normal.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nUsually, there is no preparation for this test.\n\nIf you are having an ultrasound of your stomach area, you may be asked not to eat or drink after midnight. Tell the person doing the ultrasound exam if you are taking any medicines, such as blood thinners. These might affect the results of the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel some pressure as the wand is moved over the body, but there is no discomfort most of the time.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA duplex ultrasound can show how blood flows to many parts of the body. It can also tell the width of a blood vessel and reveal any blockages. This test is a less invasive option than arteriography and venography.\n\nA duplex ultrasound can help diagnose the following conditions:\n\n* Abdominal aneurysm\n* Arterial narrowing (stenosis) or blockage (occlusion)\n* Blood clot\n* Carotid occlusive disease (See: Carotid duplex)\n* Renal vascular disease\n* Varicose veins\n* Venous insufficiency\n\nA renal duplex ultrasound can also be used after kidney transplant surgery. This shows how well a new kidney is working.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result is normal blood flow through the veins and arteries. There is normal blood pressure and no sign of a narrowing or blockage of a blood vessel.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal result depends on the specific area being examined. An abnormal result may be due to a blood clot or plaque buildup in a blood vessel.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSmoking may change the results of an ultrasound of the arms and legs. This happens because nicotine can cause the arteries to shrink (constrict).\n\n---\n\n**A duplex ultrasound is a test to see how blood moves through your arteries and veins.**\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A duplex ultrasound combines traditional ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound:\n    *   Traditional ultrasound uses sound waves that bounce off blood vessels to create pictures.\n    *   Doppler ultrasound records sound waves reflecting off moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow.\n*   There are different types of duplex ultrasound exams, including:\n    *   Arterial and venous duplex ultrasound of the abdomen: examines blood vessels and blood flow in the abdominal area.\n    *   Carotid duplex ultrasound: looks at the carotid artery in the neck.\n    *   Duplex ultrasound of the extremities: looks at the arms or legs.\n    *   Renal duplex ultrasound: examines the kidneys and their blood vessels.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   Usually, there is no preparation for this test.\n*   If you are having an ultrasound of your stomach area, you may be asked not to eat or drink after midnight.\n*   Tell the person doing the ultrasound exam if you are taking any medicines, such as blood thinners.

The specific meaning depends on the area being examined.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks associated with this test.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSmoking can affect the results of an ultrasound of the arms and legs, as nicotine can cause arteries to shrink (constrict).\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nVascular ultrasound; Peripheral vascular ultrasound\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* If you have been scheduled for a duplex ultrasound, please follow any specific instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n* It's essential to arrive on time for your appointment to ensure the test is completed as scheduled.\n\n**Images**\n\n* A duplex/doppler ultrasound test involves using sound waves to create images of the body's blood vessels.\n\n---\n\n**Peripheral Arterial Disease**\n\n\\n\\n* **Vascular Diseases**: Peripheral arterial disease is a condition where the blood vessels, or arteries, become narrowed or blocked due to plaque buildup.\n\n\\n\\n* **Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**:\n\t+ Peripheral Arterial Disease\n\t+ Vascular Diseases\n\n\\n\\n**Images**\n\n* **Duplex/Doppler Ultrasound Test**: A duplex ultrasound uses both traditional ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound to produce images of the blood vessels. The Doppler ultrasound measures the speed at which the blood flows through the vessels.\n\n\\n\\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* **Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Peripheral Arteries - Discharge**: After an angioplasty procedure, it's essential to follow a specific discharge plan to ensure a smooth recovery.\n* **Deep Vein Thrombosis - Discharge**: For patients discharged after being treated for deep vein thrombosis, following the provided instructions is crucial for preventing complications and ensuring a successful recovery.",

It also works by not allowing thickening of the tissue to get worse. In some cases, it heals the tissue completely. Several treatments are usually needed.\n*   Collagenase is a substance that is an enzyme and it breaks down collagen, which is part of the thickened tissue. It is injected into the thickened tissue to break it down. This treatment is just as effective as surgery and can be done in the office.\n*   Surgery may be done to remove the affected tissue. Surgery is usually recommended in severe cases when the finger can no longer be extended. Physical therapy exercises after surgery help the hand recover normal movement.\n*   A procedure called aponeurotomy may be recommended. This involves inserting a small needle into the affected area to divide and cut the thickened bands of tissue. There is usually little pain afterward. Healing for this procedure is faster than surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   The disorder progresses at an unpredictable rate.\n*   Surgery can usually restore normal movement to the fingers.\n*   The symptoms can recur within 10 years after surgery in up to one half of cases.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   Worsening of the contracture may result in deformity and loss of function of the hand.\n*   There is a risk of injury to blood vessels and nerves during surgery or aponeurotomy.\n\n---\n\n**Dupuytren Contracture**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of Dupuytren contracture is unknown, but you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition. It does not seem to be caused by occupation or trauma.\n\nThe condition is more common after age 40 and affects men more often than women. Risk factors include alcohol use, diabetes, and smoking.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nOne or both hands may be affected, with the ring finger being the most commonly affected followed by the little, middle, and index fingers.\n\nA small nodule or lump develops in the tissue below the skin on the palm side of the hand, which over time thickens into a cord-like band. The condition is usually painless, but in rare cases, the tendons or joints may become inflamed and painful.\n\nOther possible symptoms include itching, pressure, burning, or tension. As time passes, it becomes difficult to extend or straighten the fingers, and in severe cases, straightening them is impossible.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour healthcare provider will examine your hands, and diagnosis can usually be made from the typical signs of the condition. Other tests are rarely needed.\n\nYour provider may also examine your feet and other parts of the body because in rare cases, Dupuytren disease lumps can develop in different areas of the body.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf the condition is not severe, your provider may recommend exercises, warm water baths, stretching, or splints.\n\nTreatment options include:\n\n*   Injecting corticosteroid medicine to relieve inflammation and pain\n*   Collagenase injection to break down collagen and reduce thickening of the tissue\n*   Surgery to remove affected tissue\n*   Aponeurotomy, a procedure that involves inserting a small needle into the affected area to divide and cut the thickened bands of tissue\n\nHealing for aponeurotomy is faster than surgery, and there is usually little pain afterward.\n\n---\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf the condition is not severe, your provider may recommend exercises, warm water baths, stretching, or splints.\n\nYour provider may recommend treatment that involves injecting medicine or a substance into the scarred or fibrous tissue:\n\n* Corticosteroid medicine relieves inflammation and pain.

Radiation therapy may stop or slow down thickening of the tissue. It is usually done only one time.\n\nTalk to your provider about the risks and benefits of the different kinds of treatments.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nWorsening of the contracture may result in deformity and loss of function of the hand.\n\nThere is a risk of injury to blood vessels and nerves during surgery or aponeurotomy.\n\n---\n\n**Dupuytren Contracture**\n\n\\n\\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nDupuytren contracture is a condition where one or more tendons in the palm contract, causing a curved deformity. The exact cause of Dupuytren contracture is unknown, but it is thought to be related to genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of Dupuytren contracture include:\n\n*   A lump or thickening in the palm\n*   A curved or bent finger\n*   Pain or stiffness in the hand\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through physical examination and imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for Dupuytren contracture depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may be treated with:\n\n*   Physical therapy to improve range of motion\n*   Splinting to prevent further contraction\n\nMore severe cases may require surgery to release the contracted tendon.\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis and Prevention**\n\nThe prognosis for Dupuytren contracture is generally good, especially if treatment is sought early. However, there is no known way to prevent the condition from developing.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n*   Skirven TM, Osterman AL, Fedroczyk JM, Amadio PC, Feldscher SB, Shin EK.
