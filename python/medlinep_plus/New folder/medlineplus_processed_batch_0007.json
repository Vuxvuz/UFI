    "content": "**Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\n**What is Adams-Oliver syndrome?**\n\nAdams-Oliver syndrome is a rare condition that is present at birth. The primary features are an abnormality in skin development (called aplasia cutis congenita) and malformations of the limbs.\n\n**Primary Features**\n\n* Aplasia cutis congenita: localized areas of missing skin typically occurring on the top of the head (the skull vertex)\n* Malformations of the limbs\n\n**Other Features**\n\n* Abnormalities of the hands and feet\n\t+ Syndactyly: fingers or toes that are fused together\n\t+ Brachydactyly or oligodactyly: abnormally short or missing fingers or toes\n\t+ Other bones in the hands, feet, or lower limbs may be malformed or missing\n* Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita: a disorder of the blood vessels causing a reddish or purplish net-like pattern on the skin\n* Pulmonary hypertension: high blood pressure in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs (life-threatening)\n* Other blood vessel problems and heart defects may occur\n\n**Neurological Problems**\n\n* Developmental delay\n* Learning disabilities\n* Abnormalities in the structure of the brain\n\n---\n\n**Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\n**What is Adams-Oliver Syndrome?**\n\nAdams-Oliver syndrome is a rare condition that is present at birth. The primary features are an abnormality in skin development (called aplasia cutis congenita) and malformations of the limbs.\n\n**Features of Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\n*   Aplasia cutis congenita: a condition characterized by localized areas of missing skin typically occurring on the top of the head (the skull vertex).\n*   Malformations of the limbs: abnormalities of the hands and feet are common in people with Adams-Oliver syndrome.\n*   Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita: a disorder of the blood vessels causes a reddish or purplish net-like pattern on the skin.\n*   Pulmonary hypertension: high blood pressure in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs, which can be life-threatening.\n*   Other blood vessel problems and heart defects: can occur in affected individuals.\n*   Neurological problems: developmental delay, learning disabilities, or abnormalities in the structure of the brain.\n\n**Causes of Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\nMutations in the ARHGAP31, DLL4, DOCK6, EOGT, NOTCH1, or RBPJ gene can cause Adams-Oliver syndrome. Each of the known genes plays an important role during embryonic development, and changes in any one of them can impair this tightly controlled process, leading to the signs and symptoms of Adams-Oliver syndrome.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\n*   ARHGAP31: involved in the regulation of proteins called GTPases, which transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development.\n*   DOCK6: turns on GTPases, and mutations lead to production of an abnormally short protein that is likely unable to turn on GTPases.\n*   NOTCH1: part of a signaling pathway known as the Notch pathway, which controls how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo.\n*   DLL4: fits together like a lock and its key to stimulate one part of the Notch pathway, important for development of blood vessels.\n*   RBPJ: attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and control the activity of genes that play a role in cellular development in multiple tissues throughout the body.\n*   EOGT: modifies certain proteins by transferring a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine to them, thought to modify Notch proteins.\n\n---\n\n**Adams-Oliver Syndrome: Understanding the Genetic Basis**\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the genetic basis of Adams-Oliver syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by scalp defects and limb abnormalities.\n\n**The Known Genes Involved in Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\nMutations in six genes have been identified as causing Adams-Oliver syndrome:\n\n*   **ARHGAP31**: This gene plays an important role in the regulation of proteins called GTPases, which transmit signals critical for embryonic development.\n*   **DLL4**: This gene is part of a signaling pathway known as the Notch pathway, which controls how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo.\n*   **DOCK6**: Similar to ARHGAP31, DOCK6 is involved in the regulation of GTPases and their activity during embryonic development.\n*   **EOGT**: The protein produced from this gene modifies certain proteins by transferring a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine to them. It is thought that the EOGT protein modifies Notch proteins, which stimulate the Notch signaling pathway.\n*   **NOTCH1**: This gene is also part of the Notch pathway and plays a crucial role in controlling how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo.\n*   **RBPJ**: This gene is involved in the regulation of genes that play a role in cellular development in multiple tissues throughout the body.\n\n**The Impact of Genetic Changes on Embryonic Development**\n\nChanges in any one of these genes can impair the tightly controlled process of embryonic development, leading to the signs and symptoms of Adams-Oliver syndrome. The proteins produced from these genes play critical roles during embryonic development, and mutations in them can disrupt this process.\n\n**The Mystery of EOGT Gene Mutations**\n\nLittle is known about how mutations in the EOGT gene cause Adams-Oliver syndrome. Further research is needed to understand the impact of the modification on Notch signaling.\n\nBy understanding the genetic basis of Adams-Oliver syndrome, we can gain insights into the complex processes involved in embryonic development and potentially identify new targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\n---\n\n**Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAdams-Oliver syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. When caused by mutations in the ARHGAP31, DLL4, NOTCH1, or RBPJ gene, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nThe altered gene is typically inherited from an affected parent. Some cases associated with NOTCH1 gene mutations result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nWhen caused by mutations in the DOCK6 or EOGT gene, Adams-Oliver syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In conditions with this pattern of inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAbsence defect of limbs, scalp, and skull\nAOS\nAplasia cutis congenita with terminal transverse limb defects\nCongenital scalp defects with distal limb reduction anomalies\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 1\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 2\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 3\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 4\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 5\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adams-Oliver syndrome 6\n\n    *   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adams-Oliver syndrome\n    *   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n    *   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 1; AOS1\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 5; AOS5\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 4; AOS4\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2; AOS2\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 3; AOS3\n        *   ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 6; AOS6\n\n---\n\n**Adams-Oliver Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Adams-Oliver syndrome?**\n    \\- A rare genetic disorder characterized by aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse limb defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of Adams-Oliver syndrome:**\n    \\- Mutations in the EOGT gene\n    \\- Mutations in the RBPJ gene\n    \\- Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DLL4 gene\n    \\- Gain-of-function mutations of ARHGAP31\n    \\- Haploinsufficiency of the NOTCH1 receptor\n    \\- Mutations in the DOCK6 gene\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Symptoms and characteristics:**\n    \\- Aplasia cutis congenita (absence of skin at birth)\n    \\- Terminal transverse limb defects (limb abnormalities)\n    \\- Vascular abnormalities\n    \\- Brain and eye anomalies\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **References:**\n\n    1.

The condition can be caused by mutations in several genes, including EOGT, DOCK6, NOTCH1, and ARHGAP31.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Adams-Oliver syndrome is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the development of skin and limb tissue. The condition can occur sporadically or be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Adams-Oliver syndrome can vary widely from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Absence of skin and underlying tissue on the scalp or lower back\n* Limb abnormalities, such as missing or deformed limbs\n* Vascular abnormalities, such as abnormal blood vessel formation\n* Cardiac anomalies, such as heart defects\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Adams-Oliver syndrome is generally poor, as the condition can be severe and may require multiple surgeries to correct. However, with proper medical care and management, some individuals may experience improved outcomes.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Adams-Oliver syndrome, but treatment may involve:\n\n* Surgical removal of affected tissue\n* Reconstruction of missing or deformed limbs\n* Vascular surgery to correct abnormal blood vessel formation\n* Cardiac surgery to correct heart defects\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify the underlying cause of Adams-Oliver syndrome and provide important information for families with a history of the condition.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Bone Diseases\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Skin Conditions",

    "content": "**Adapalene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAdapalene is used to treat acne in adults and children 12 years of age and older. It works by stopping pimples from forming under the surface of the skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nPrescription adapalene comes as a gel, a solution (liquid), lotion, a cream, and a pledget (individual medicated swab for one time use) to apply to the skin. Nonprescription (over the counter) adapalene comes as a gel to apply to the skin. Adapalene is usually applied once a day at bedtime.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAdapalene controls acne but does not cure it. Your acne may get worse during the first few weeks of treatment, and it may take 8 to 12 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of adapalene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDo not apply adapalene to skin that is sunburned, broken, or covered with eczema (a skin disease). If you have any of these conditions, do not apply adapalene until your skin has healed. Be careful not to get adapalene in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to apply adapalene at bedtime, do not apply it during the day unless instructed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nYour skin may become dry or irritated during the first 2–4 weeks of your treatment. If your skin stings, burns, or becomes irritated at any time during your treatment, talk to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nAdapalene should be stored in a cool, dry place away from children and pets. Discard any unused adapalene after the expiration date on the package or 3 months after opening the bottle.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience severe skin irritation, redness, or swelling after applying adapalene, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nAdapalene may cause your skin to become more sensitive to sunlight. Use a sunscreen with at least SPF 15 and wear protective clothing when going outside.\n\n---\n\n**Adapalene: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **To use the cream, gel, lotion, solution, or pledgets:** Gently wash the affected skin with a mild soap or soapless cleanser and pat dry with a soft towel. Do not use harsh or abrasive cleansers, and do not scrub your skin vigorously.\n    If you are using the gel or cream, use your fingers to spread a thin film of medication over the affected area. If you are using a pledget, remove it from the foil pouch and gently wipe the affected area. If you are using the solution, apply a thin layer to the affected area using a clean cotton swab or other applicator.\n    Adapalene lotion comes in a pump that dispenses measured amounts of the medication. If you are using the lotion, press down on the top of the pump 3–4 times so that the medication comes out onto your palm and apply a thin film of the medication over the affected area.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Before taking adapalene, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to adapalene, any other medications, or any ingredient in adapalene topical products. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n    Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n    Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had eczema or any other skin condition.\n    Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using adapalene, call your doctor. If you are breastfeeding while using adapalene, apply the smallest amount to the skin and do not apply it directly to the nipple and areola (the colored area around each nipple).\n    Plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to real and artificial sunlight (tanning beds and sunlamps) and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen, especially if you sunburn easily. Adapalene may make your skin sensitive to sunlight or ultraviolet light.\n    You should know that weather extremes, such as wind and cold, may be particularly irritating.\n    Tell your doctor about all skin products that you use, including soaps, cleansers, moisturizers, and cosmetics. Many skin care products can irritate your skin, if you use them with adapalene, especially those that are harsh, dry out the skin, or contain alcohol, spices, or lime rind.\n    Do not use hot wax to remove unwanted hair from the area you are treating with adapalene during your treatment with this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Adapalene: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Follow Your Treatment Plan**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What If I Forget a Dose?**\n\nApply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Side Effects of Adapalene**\n\nAdapalene may cause side effects. The following symptoms are likely to affect your skin during the first 2-4 weeks of treatment. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   redness\n*   scaling\n*   dryness\n*   burning or stinging\n*   pain at the application site\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n*   hives, itching, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat\n\nAdapalene may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Storage and Disposal of Adapalene**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website https://goo.gl/c4Rm4p for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. https://www.upandaway.org\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIf someone swallows adapalene, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Important Information**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor.\n\nDo not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital.

    "content": "**Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nAdenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is an inherited condition that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. The most common feature of this condition is recurrent kidney stones; urinary tract stones are also a frequent symptom.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Inherited condition affecting the kidneys and urinary tract\n*   Recurrent kidney stones and urinary tract stones are the most common features\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Pain during urination\n*   Difficulty releasing urine\n*   Fever\n*   Urinary tract infection\n*   Blood in the urine (hematuria)\n*   Abdominal cramps\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n**Sequelae**\n\nWithout treatment, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is a life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively.\n\n**Variability**\n\nThe features of this condition and their severity vary greatly among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of people with APRT deficiency do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. It is caused by mutations in the APRT gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called APRT.\n\n**Symptoms of Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\nThe most common feature of this condition is recurrent kidney stones; urinary tract stones are also a frequent symptom. Kidney and urinary tract stones can create blockages in the urinary tract, causing pain during urination and difficulty releasing urine. Other signs and symptoms include fever, urinary tract infection, blood in the urine (hematuria), abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n**Causes of Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\nMutations in the APRT gene cause APRT deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making APRT, an enzyme that helps to convert a DNA building block (nucleotide) called adenine to a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP). APRT gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal APRT enzyme with reduced function or prevent the production of any enzyme. A lack of functional enzyme impairs the conversion of adenine to AMP, resulting in the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) crystals in urine.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\n2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis\n2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria\nAPRT deficiency\nDHA crystalline nephropathy\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency\n\n---\n\n**Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency**\n\n**Registry Information**\n\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ADENINE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY; APRTD\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   ADENINE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY; APRTD\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The adenoid glands are located behind the nose and above the roof of the mouth in the nasopharynx.\n\n**Why is Adenoid Removal Performed?**\n\nA healthcare provider may recommend adenoid removal if:\n\n* Enlarged adenoids are blocking the child's airway, causing symptoms such as heavy snoring, breathing problems through the nose, and episodes of not breathing during sleep.\n* The child has chronic ear infections that occur frequently, continue despite antibiotic use, cause hearing loss, or result in missed school days.\n* The child has tonsillitis that keeps coming back.\n\n**Description of the Procedure**\n\nDuring surgery:\n\n* The surgeon places a small tool into the child's mouth to keep it open.\n* The surgeon removes the adenoid glands using a spoon-shaped tool (curette) or another tool that helps cut away soft tissue.\n* Some surgeons use electricity to heat the tissue, remove it, and stop bleeding (electrocautery or coblation).\n* A cutting tool called a microdebrider can also be used to remove the adenoid tissue.\n* Absorbent material called packing material may be used to control bleeding.\n\n**Risks of Adenoid Removal**\n\nRisks of any anesthesia:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n\nRisks of any surgery:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\n**Preparation for the Procedure**\n\nA week before surgery, do not give your child any medicine that thins the blood unless instructed by the surgeon. Such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\n\nThe night before surgery, have your child eat nothing after midnight, including water.\n\nYou will be told what medicines your child should take on the day of surgery. Have your child take the medicine with a sip of water.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour child will go home on the same day as surgery. Complete recovery takes about 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nFollow instructions on how to care for your child at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter adenoid removal, most children:\n\n* Breathe better through the nose\n* Have fewer and milder sore throats\n* Have fewer ear infections\n\nIn rare cases, adenoid tissue may grow back. This does not cause problems most of the time. However, it can be removed again if necessary.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAdenoidectomy; Removal of adenoid glands\n\n---\n\n**Adenoid Removal**\n\n**What is Adenoid Removal?**\n\nAdenoid removal is surgery to take out the adenoid glands. The adenoid glands sit behind your nose above the roof of your mouth in the nasopharynx. Air passes over these glands when you take a breath.\n\nThe adenoids are often taken out at the same time as the tonsils (tonsillectomy).\n\nAdenoid removal is also called adenoidectomy. The procedure is most often done in children.\n\n**Description**\n\nYour child will be given general anesthesia before surgery. This means your child will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\n\nDuring surgery:\n\n*   The surgeon places a small tool into your child's mouth to keep it open.\n*   The surgeon removes the adenoid glands using a spoon-shaped tool (curette). Or, another tool that helps cut away soft tissue is used.\n*   Some surgeons use electricity to heat the tissue, remove it, and stop bleeding. This is called electrocautery. Another method uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to do the same thing. This is called coblation. A cutting tool called a microdebrider can also be used to remove the adenoid tissue.\n*   Absorbent material called packing material may also be used to control bleeding.\n\nYour child will stay in the recovery room after surgery. You will be allowed to take your child home when your child is awake and can breathe easily, cough, and swallow. In most cases, this will be a few hours after surgery.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA health care provider may recommend this procedure if:\n\n*   Enlarged adenoids are blocking your child's airway. Symptoms in your child can include heavy snoring, problems breathing through the nose, and episodes of not breathing during sleep.\n*   Your child has chronic ear infections that occur often, continue despite use of antibiotics, cause hearing loss, or cause your child to miss a lot of school days.\n\nAdenoidectomy may also be recommended if your child has tonsillitis that keeps coming back.\n\nThe adenoids normally shrink as children grow older. Adults rarely need to have them removed.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any anesthesia are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n\nRisks of any surgery are:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n\n---\n\n**Adenoid Removal**\n\nAfter this procedure, most children:\n\n* Breathe better through the nose\n* Have fewer and milder sore throats\n* Have fewer ear infections\n\nIn rare cases, adenoid tissue may grow back.

It is a common problem in children.\n\n**What causes enlarged adenoids?**\n\nYour child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.\n\n**What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?**\n\nEnlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose. Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:\n\n* A dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breath\n* Cracked lips\n* A runny nose\n\nOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include:\n\n* Loud breathing\n* Snoring\n* Restless sleep\n* Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep\n* Ear infections\n\n**How can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if your child has enlarged adenoids, the health care provider will:\n\n* Ask about your child's medical history, including asking about your child's symptoms\n* Check your child's ears, throat, and mouth\n* Feel your child's neck\n\nSince the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth. To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:\n\n* A special mirror in the mouth\n* A long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)\n* An x-ray\n\n**What are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?**\n\nThe treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.\n\nIn some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.\n\n**What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?**\n\nAn adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:\n\n* Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.\n* Taking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.\n* The enlarged adenoids block the airways.\n\nIf there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.\n\n---\n\n**Adenoids**\n\n**What are adenoids?**\n\nAdenoids are a patch of tissue located high up in the throat, just behind the nose.

    "content": "**Adenomyosis**\n\nAdenomyosis is a thickening of the walls of the uterus. It occurs when endometrial tissue grows into the outer muscular walls of the uterus. Endometrial tissue forms the lining of the uterus.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause is not known. Sometimes, adenomyosis may cause the uterus to grow in size.\n\nThe condition most often occurs in women ages 35 to 50 who have had at least one pregnancy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn many cases, there are no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:\n\n* Long-term or heavy menstrual bleeding\n* Painful menstrual periods, which gets worse\n* Pelvic pain during intercourse\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will make the diagnosis if a woman has symptoms of adenomyosis that are not caused by other gynecologic problems. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is by examining the tissue of the uterus after a surgery to remove it.\n\nDuring a pelvic exam, the provider may find a soft and slightly enlarged uterus. The exam may also reveal a uterine mass or uterine tenderness.\n\nAn ultrasound of the uterus may be done. However, it may not give a clear diagnosis of adenomyosis. An MRI can help distinguish this condition from other uterine tumors. It is often used when an ultrasound exam does not provide sufficient information to make a diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost women have some adenomyosis as they get close to menopause. However, only a few will have symptoms. Most women do not need treatment.\n\nBirth control pills and an IUD that has progesterone can help decrease heavy bleeding.

    "content": "**Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nAdenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency is a disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various tissues. Signs and symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to adulthood. The severity of the disorder also varies, even among affected individuals in the same family.\n\n**What is Inflammation?**\n\nInflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). However, ADA2 deficiency causes abnormal, unprovoked inflammation that can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly blood vessels. (Inflammation of blood vessels is known as vasculitis.) Other tissues affected by abnormal inflammation can include the skin, gastrointestinal system, liver, kidneys, and nervous system.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nSigns and symptoms that can occur with ADA2 deficiency include:\n\n*   Fevers that are intermittent, meaning they come and go\n*   Areas of net-like, mottled skin discoloration called livedo racemosa\n*   An enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n*   Recurrent strokes affecting structures deep in the brain that can start in the first few years of life\n\n**Additional Immune System Abnormalities**\n\nIn some people, ADA2 deficiency causes additional immune system abnormalities that increase the risk of bacterial and viral infections.\n\n**Relationship to Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)**\n\nADA2 deficiency is sometimes described as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a disorder that causes inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body (systemic vasculitis). However, not all researchers classify ADA2 deficiency as a type of PAN.\n\n---\n\n**Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency?**\n\nAdenosine deaminase 2 deficiency is a disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various tissues. Signs and symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to adulthood.\n\n**Causes of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nADA2 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ADA2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenosine deaminase 2, which plays a critical role in the growth and development of certain immune system cells, including macrophages.\n\n**Frequency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nMore than 160 individuals with ADA2 deficiency have been described in the medical literature. However, researchers suspect that many more people may be affected, and ADA2 deficiency may not be a rare disease.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nSigns and symptoms that can occur with ADA2 deficiency include:\n\n* Fevers that are intermittent\n* Areas of net-like, mottled skin discoloration called livedo racemosa\n* An enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n* Recurrent strokes affecting structures deep in the brain\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nADA2 deficiency is sometimes described as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a disorder that causes inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body (systemic vasculitis). However, not all researchers classify ADA2 deficiency as a type of PAN.\n\n---\n\n**Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency?**\n\nAdenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, also known as DADA2, is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ADA2 gene. This condition affects the immune system and blood vessels, leading to inflammation and damage to various organs.\n\n**Symptoms of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nIndividuals with ADA2 deficiency may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis)\n* Stroke\n* Polyarteritis nodosa (a type of vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries)\n* Other autoimmune disorders\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with ADA2 deficiency typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition, but they are carriers of the mutated gene.\n\n**Other Names for Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency**\n\n* Childhood-onset polyarteritis nodosa\n* DADA2 Deficiency of ADA2\n* Sneddon syndrome\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Sneddon syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Vasculitis due to ADA2 deficiency\n\n**References**\n\n* Caorsi R, Penco F, Grossi A, et al.

    "content": "**Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder that affects the immune system. Specifically, ADA deficiency impairs the development and function of immune cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight infections.\n\n**Symptoms of Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\nPeople with ADA deficiency often develop pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Additional signs and symptoms include slow growth and developmental delays.\n\n**Forms of Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\nThere are three forms of ADA deficiency:\n\n* **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**: About 80 percent of individuals with ADA deficiency also have SCID. People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n* **Delayed or Late-Onset Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-CID)**: About 15 to 20 percent of people with ADA deficiency develop health problems that begin between 1 and 10 years of age or in adulthood. In this form of ADA deficiency, the immune deficiency tends to be less severe than in SCID.\n* **Partial ADA Deficiency**: In some individuals, ADA deficiency only impacts red blood cells. Since white blood cells are not affected, these individuals have normal immune systems.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nThe exact cause of ADA deficiency is unknown, but it is believed to be a genetic disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)\n* Delayed or Late-Onset Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-CID)\n* Partial ADA Deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on adenosine deaminase deficiency, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n* American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\n\nNote: The above text has been reformatted to improve readability and clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder that affects the immune system. Specifically, ADA deficiency impairs the development and function of immune cells called lymphocytes.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with ADA deficiency often develop pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Additional signs and symptoms include slow growth and developmental delays.\n\n**Types of Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\nThere are three types of ADA deficiency:\n\n* **ADA-SCID**: People with this form of ADA deficiency lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be serious or life-threatening.\n* **Delayed or Late-Onset Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-CID)**: This form of ADA deficiency tends to be less severe than ADA-SCID. People with ADA-CID typically have recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. Over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition, and other health problems.\n* **Partial ADA Deficiency**: In some individuals, ADA deficiency only impacts red blood cells. Since white blood cells are not affected, these individuals have normal immune systems.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAdenosine deaminase deficiency is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the ADA gene. This gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme adenosine deaminase. Variants in the ADA gene reduce or eliminate the activity of adenosine deaminase and allow deoxyadenosine to build up in cells.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAdenosine deaminase deficiency is very rare, estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 500,000 newborns worldwide. Approximately 15 percent of people with SCID have ADA deficiency.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for adenosine deaminase deficiency, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include antibiotics, antiviral medications, and other supportive care measures.\n\n---\n\n**Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\nThe adenosine deaminase enzyme works to get rid of a molecule called deoxyadenosine, which is generated when DNA is broken down. A buildup of deoxyadenosine in cells can lead to early cell death. Adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine to another molecule called deoxyinosine, which is not harmful. Variants in the ADA gene reduce or eliminate the activity of adenosine deaminase and allow deoxyadenosine to build up in cells.\n\n**Severity of ADA Deficiency**\n\nThe severity of ADA deficiency generally depends on how much working enzyme is available. Individuals with ADA-SCID have no enzyme activity. Those with ADA-CID have greatly reduced enzyme activity, and people with partial ADA deficiency have somewhat reduced enzyme activity.\n\n**Immature Lymphocytes in the Thymus**\n\nImmature lymphocytes in the thymus are particularly vulnerable to a toxic buildup of deoxyadenosine. These cells die before they can mature and help fight infection. The number of lymphocytes in other lymphoid tissues is also greatly reduced. The loss of infection-fighting cells results in the signs and symptoms of ADA deficiency.\n\n**Learn More About the Gene Associated with Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n\n*   **ADA**: Learn more about the gene associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.

People who do experience symptoms typically have fatigue, muscle pain (myalgia), or cramps after exercise or prolonged physical activity (exercise intolerance). Following strenuous activity, they often get tired more quickly and stay tired longer than would normally be expected.\n\nIn rare cases, affected individuals have more severe symptoms including severe muscle weakness, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and muscle wasting (atrophy), but it is unclear whether these symptoms are due solely to AMP deaminase deficiency or additional health conditions. Exercise intolerance associated with AMP deaminase deficiency usually becomes apparent in childhood or early adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAMP deaminase deficiency is one of the most common inherited muscle disorders in white populations, affecting 1 in 50 to 100 people. The prevalence is lower in African Americans, affecting an estimated 1 in 40,000 people, and the condition is even less common in the Japanese population.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAMP deaminase deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMPD1 gene, which provides instructions for producing an enzyme called AMP deaminase. This enzyme is found in skeletal muscles, where it plays a role in producing energy. Skeletal muscle cells need energy to function and move the body.\n\nMutations in the AMPD1 gene often result in an AMP deaminase enzyme that cannot function and as a result, energy production in skeletal muscle cells is decreased. Skeletal muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in energy during periods of exercise or increased activity when energy demands increase. The lack of AMP deaminase activity can result in fatigue, muscle weakness or pain, or other muscle problems in some people with AMP deaminase deficiency.\n\nIt is not known why some people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional factors, both genetic and environmental, may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of AMP deaminase deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency, also known as AMPD1 deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of energy in skeletal muscles. It is caused by mutations in the AMPD1 gene, which provides instructions for producing an enzyme called AMP deaminase.\n\n**How Does Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency Affect the Body?**\n\nIn individuals with AMPD1 deficiency, the AMP deaminase enzyme does not function properly, leading to a decrease in energy production in skeletal muscle cells. This can result in fatigue, muscle weakness or pain, and other muscle problems during periods of exercise or increased activity.\n\n**What is the Inheritance Pattern of Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency**\n\n* AMP deaminase deficiency\n* Exercise-induced myopathy\n* MAD deficiency\n* MADA deficiency\n* Muscle AMP deaminase deficiency\n* Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Muscle AMP deaminase deficiency\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: MYOPATHY DUE TO MYOADENYLATE DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY; MMDD\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a neurological disorder that causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) leading to delayed development of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor delay), autistic characteristics that affect communication and social interaction, and seizures.\n\n**Forms of the Condition**\n\nThe condition is classified into three forms based on the severity of the signs and symptoms:\n\n* **Neonatal Form**: The most severe form. Signs and symptoms can be detected at or before birth and include impaired growth during fetal development and a small head size (microcephaly). Affected newborns have severe encephalopathy, which leads to a lack of movement, difficulty feeding, and life-threatening respiratory problems.\n* **Type I (Severe Form)**: The most common form. Signs and symptoms begin in the first months of life. Affected babies have severe psychomotor delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and microcephaly. Many affected infants develop recurrent seizures that are difficult to treat, and some exhibit autistic traits.\n* **Type II (Moderate or Mild Form)**: Development is typically normal for the first few years of life but then slows. Psychomotor delay is considered mild or moderate. Some children with this form of the condition develop seizures and autistic traits.\n\n**Key Features**\n\nA key feature that can help with diagnosis of this condition is the presence of chemicals called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in body fluids.\n\n---\n\n**Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?**\n\nAdenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of purine nucleotides, which are building blocks of DNA and RNA. The condition is caused by mutations in the ADSL gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylosuccinate lyase.\n\n**Forms of Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n\nThere are three forms of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency:\n\n* **Neonatal Form**: This is the most severe form and can be detected at or before birth. Signs and symptoms include impaired growth during fetal development, microcephaly, severe encephalopathy, difficulty feeding, and life-threatening respiratory problems.\n* **Severe Form (Type I)**: This form begins in the first months of life and is characterized by severe psychomotor delay, weak muscle tone, microcephaly, recurrent seizures that are difficult to treat, and autistic traits such as repetitive actions and lack of eye contact.\n* **Moderate or Mild Form (Type II)**: In this form, development is typically normal for the first few years of life but then slows. Psychomotor delay is considered mild or moderate, and some children may develop seizures and autistic traits.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAll forms of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency are caused by mutations in the ADSL gene. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme, impairing its function. Reduced function of this enzyme leads to buildup of SAICAR and SAMP, which are converted through a different reaction to succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado). Researchers believe that SAICAr and S-Ado are toxic and damage to brain tissue caused by these substances likely underlies the neurological problems that occur in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAdenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare disorder, with fewer than 100 cases reported worldwide. The condition is most common in the Netherlands and Belgium but has been found globally.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n* Presence of chemicals called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in body fluids\n* Severe encephalopathy, psychomotor delay, weak muscle tone, microcephaly, recurrent seizures that are difficult to treat, and autistic traits\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to control seizures or other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n\n**Neurological Problems**\n\nThe neurological problems that occur in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency are a major concern for individuals with this condition.\n\n**Severity of Encephalopathy and Psychomotor Delay**\n\nStudies suggest that the amount of SAICAr relative to S-Ado reflects the severity of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Individuals with more SAICAr than S-Ado have more severe encephalopathy and psychomotor delay.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAdenylosuccinase deficiency\nADSL deficiency\nSuccinylpurinemic autism\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   ADENYLOSUCCINASE DEFICIENCY; ADSLD\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAriyananda Lde Z, Lee P, Antonopoulos C, Colman RF.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/adermatoglyphia/",
    "content": "**Adermatoglyphia**\n\n**Description**\n\nAdermatoglyphia is the absence of ridges on the skin on the pads of the fingers and toes, as well as on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The patterns of these ridges (called dermatoglyphs) form whorls, arches, and loops that are the basis for each person's unique fingerprints. Because no two people have the same patterns, fingerprints have long been used as a way to identify individuals. However, people with adermatoglyphia do not have these ridges, and so they cannot be identified by their fingerprints. Adermatoglyphia has been called the \"immigration delay disease\" because affected individuals have had difficulty entering countries that require fingerprinting for identification.\n\nIn some families, adermatoglyphia occurs without any related signs and symptoms. In others, a lack of dermatoglyphs is associated with other features, typically affecting the skin. These can include small white bumps called milia on the face, blistering of the skin in areas exposed to heat or friction, and a reduced number of sweat glands on the hands and feet. Adermatoglyphia is also a feature of several rare syndromes classified as ectodermal dysplasias, including a condition called Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome/dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis that affects the skin, hair, sweat glands, and teeth.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAdermatoglyphia appears to be a rare condition. Only a few affected families have been identified worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAdermatoglyphia is caused by mutations in the SMARCAD1 gene. This gene provides information for making two versions of the SMARCAD1 protein: a full-length version that is active (expressed) in multiple tissues and a shorter version that is expressed only in the skin. Studies suggest that the full-length SMARCAD1 protein regulates the activity of a wide variety of genes involved in maintaining the stability of cells' genetic information.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* \n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Adermatoglyphia\n* Immigration delay disease\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**Adermatoglyphia: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**The Function of the Skin-Specific Version of the SMARCAD1 Protein**\n\nLittle is known about the function of the skin-specific version of the SMARCAD1 protein, but it appears to play a critical role in dermatoglyph formation. Dermatoglyphs develop before birth and remain the same throughout life. The activity of this protein is likely one of several factors that determine each person's unique fingerprint pattern.\n\n**The Impact of SMARCAD1 Gene Mutations**\n\nThe SMARCAD1 gene mutations that cause adermatoglyphia affect only the skin-specific version of the SMARCAD1 protein. These mutations reduce the total amount of this protein available in skin cells. Although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause adermatoglyphia, researchers speculate that a shortage of the skin-specific version of the SMARCAD1 protein impairs signaling pathways needed for normal skin development and function, including the formation of dermatoglyphs.\n\n**Learn More About the Gene Associated with Adermatoglyphia**\n\n*   **SMARCAD1**: The SMARCAD1 gene provides information for making two versions of the SMARCAD1 protein: a full-length version that is active in multiple tissues and a shorter version that is expressed only in the skin.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAdermatoglyphia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SMARCAD1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In many cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **Absence of fingerprints**\n*   **ADERM**\n*   **Immigration delay disease**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: Isolated congenital adermatoglyphia\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: Adermatoglyphia; ADERM, BASAN SYNDROME\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Burger B, Fuchs D, Sprecher E, Itin P.

Normally, these surfaces are slippery, allowing them to shift easily as the body moves.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nAdhesions can occur anywhere in the body but often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don't cause any problems, but when they partly or completely block the intestines, they can cause:\n\n* Severe abdominal pain or cramping\n* Vomiting\n* Bloating\n* An inability to pass gas\n* Constipation\n\nAdhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nNo tests are available to detect adhesions. Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems.

    "content": "**Adiposis Dolorosa**\n\nAdiposis dolorosa is a rare condition characterized by painful folds of fatty (adipose) tissue or the growth of multiple noncancerous (benign) fatty tumors called lipomas.\n\n**Description**\n\nThis condition occurs most often in women who are overweight or have obesity, and signs and symptoms typically appear between ages 35 and 50. In people with adiposis dolorosa, abnormal fatty tissue or lipomas can occur anywhere on the body but are most often found on the torso, buttocks, and upper parts of the arms and legs.\n\nLipomas usually feel like firm bumps (nodules) under the skin. The growths cause burning or aching that can be severe, particularly if they are pressing on a nearby nerve. In some people, the pain comes and goes, while in others it is continuous. Movement or pressure on adipose tissue or lipomas can make the pain worse. In some cases, lipomas can impair normal movement.\n\nOther signs and symptoms that have been reported to occur with adiposis dolorosa include easy bruising, digestive system problems, a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), general weakness and tiredness (fatigue), sleep problems, depression, irritability, confusion, migraine headaches, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and a progressive decline in memory and intellectual function (dementia). These problems do not occur in everyone with adiposis dolorosa, and it is unclear whether they are directly related to the condition.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAdiposis dolorosa is a rare condition whose prevalence is unknown. For reasons that are unclear, it occurs up to 30 times more often in women than in men.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of adiposis dolorosa is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Adiposis Dolorosa**\n\n**What is Adiposis Dolorosa?**\n\nAdiposis dolorosa, also known as Dercum's disease, is a rare condition characterized by severe pain and inflammation in fatty tissue.\n\n**Causes of Adiposis Dolorosa**\n\nThe cause of adiposis dolorosa is unknown. However, several possible causes have been suggested:\n\n*   **Genetic Component**: The condition may have a genetic component, as some families with multiple affected members have been reported.\n*   **Medications**: The use of corticosteroids has been linked to the development of adiposis dolorosa.\n*   **Endocrine System Dysfunction**: Dysfunction of the endocrine system, which produces hormones, may contribute to the condition.\n*   **Adipose Tissue Metabolism**: Changes in the deposition and breakdown of fat (adipose tissue metabolism) have also been suggested as a possible cause.\n*   **Autoimmune Disorder**: Researchers have proposed that adiposis dolorosa could be an autoimmune disorder, but there is no firm evidence to support this theory.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of adiposis dolorosa are sporadic, occurring in individuals with no family history of the condition. However, some familial cases have been reported, suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n**Other Names for Adiposis Dolorosa**\n\nThe condition has been referred to by various names, including:\n\n*   **Adiposalgia**\n*   **Adipose Tissue Rheumatism**\n*   **Anders Syndrome**\n*   **Dercum Disease**\n*   **Lipomatosis Dolorosa**\n*   **Morbus Dercum**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor further information and resources on adiposis dolorosa, consider the following:\n\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: A comprehensive resource providing information on rare diseases, including adiposis dolorosa.\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: Organizations such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) offer support and advocacy for individuals affected by rare conditions.\n*   **Clinical Trials**: ClinicalTrials.gov provides a list of ongoing clinical trials related to adiposis dolorosa.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database offers information on genes and diseases, including adiposis dolorosa.\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: A collection of scientific articles related to adiposis dolorosa, available through the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on adiposis dolorosa, consider the following references:\n\n*   Campen R, Mankin H, Louis DN, Hirano M, Maccollin M.

    "content": "**Adjustment Disorder**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Adjustment Disorder?**\n\nAdjustment disorder is a group of symptoms, such as stress, anxiety, feeling sad or hopeless, and physical symptoms that can occur after you go through a stressful life event.\n\nThe symptoms occur because you are having a hard time coping. Your reaction is stronger than expected for the type of event that occurred.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany different events may trigger symptoms of an adjustment disorder. Whatever the trigger is, the event may become too much for you.\n\nStressors for people of any age include:\n\n*   Death of a loved one\n*   Divorce or problems with a relationship\n*   General life changes\n*   Illness or other health issues in yourself or a loved one\n*   Moving to a different home or a different city\n*   Unexpected catastrophes\n*   Worries about money\n\nTriggers of stress in teenagers and young adults may include:\n\n*   Family problems or conflict\n*   School problems\n*   Sexuality issues\n\nThere is no way to predict which people who are affected by the same stress are likely to develop adjustment disorder. Your social skills before the event and how you have learned to deal with stress in the past may play roles.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of adjustment disorder are often severe enough to affect work or social life. Symptoms include:\n\n*   Acting defiant or showing impulsive behavior\n*   Acting nervous or tense\n*   Crying, feeling sad or hopeless, and possibly withdrawing from other people\n*   Skipped heartbeats and other physical complaints\n*   Trembling or twitching\n\nTo have adjustment disorder, you must have the following:\n\n*   The symptoms clearly come after a stressor, most often within 3 months\n*   The symptoms are more severe than would be expected\n*   There do not appear to be other disorders involved\n*   The symptoms are not part of normal grieving for the death of a loved one\n\nSometimes, symptoms can be severe and the person may have thoughts of suicide or make a suicide attempt.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do a mental health assessment to find out about your behavior and symptoms. You may be referred to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and help you return to a similar level of functioning as before the stressful event occurred.\n\nMost mental health professionals recommend some type of talk therapy. This type of therapy can help you identify or change your responses to the stressors in your life.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy. It can help you deal with your feelings:\n\nFirst the therapist helps you recognize the negative feelings and thoughts that occur.\nThen the therapist teaches you how to change these into helpful thoughts and healthy actions.\n\nOther types of therapy may include:\n\n*   Long-term therapy, where you will explore your thoughts and feelings over many months or more\n*   Family therapy, where you will meet with a therapist along with your family\n*   Self-help groups, where the support of others may help you get better\n\nMedicines may be used, but only along with talk therapy. These medicines may help if you are:\n\n*   Nervous or anxious most of the time\n*   Not sleeping very well\n*   Very sad or depressed\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith the right help and support, you should get better quickly. The problem usually does not last longer than 6 months, unless the stressor continues to be present.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if you develop symptoms of adjustment disorder.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n---\n\n**Adjustment Disorder**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Adjustment Disorder?**\n\nAdjustment disorder is a group of symptoms that can occur after a stressful life event.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany different events may trigger symptoms of an adjustment disorder.

If not possible, at least some private space is necessary.\n\nTeasing an adolescent child about physical changes is inappropriate and may lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment.\n\nParents must remember that it's natural and normal for adolescents to be interested in body changes and sexual topics.\n\nAdolescents may experiment with a wide range of sexual orientations or behaviors before feeling comfortable with their own sexual identity. Parents should not call new behaviors \"wrong,\" \"sick,\" or \"immoral.\"\n\n---\n\n**Adolescent Development**\n\nAs parents navigate the challenges of raising teenagers, it's essential to understand that their children's quest for independence is a normal part of development. This process can be fraught with power struggles, conflicts, and emotional turmoil, but with open lines of communication and clear boundaries, parents can reduce major conflicts.\n\n**Independence and Power Struggles**\n\nThe teenager's desire for autonomy is a natural phase of growth, and parents should not see it as a rejection or loss of control. Instead, they should be constant and consistent in their approach, making themselves available to listen to their child's ideas without dominating their independent identity.\n\nPower struggles arise when authority is at stake or \"being right\" becomes the primary issue. These situations should be avoided whenever possible, as they can lead to feelings of embarrassment, inadequacy, resentment, and bitterness in the adolescent.\n\n**Physical Development**\n\nDuring adolescence, young people undergo significant physical changes as they move towards maturity. Girls may begin to develop breast buds as early as 8 years old, with breasts developing fully between ages 12 and 18. Boys may notice testicular growth as early as age 9, followed by penis lengthening and the development of pubic hair.\n\n**Behavior**\n\nThe rapid physical changes that adolescents experience can make them feel self-conscious, sensitive, and worried about their own body transformations. They may go through awkward stages in appearance and physical coordination, leading to anxiety and comparisons with peers.\n\nAs adolescents separate from their parents and form their own identity, they often turn to friends for support and validation. In some cases, this may lead to conflict with family members who struggle to maintain control.\n\n**Safety**\n\nAdolescents are prone to risk-taking behaviors, which can have severe consequences, such as becoming pregnant or contracting a sexually-transmitted disease. Parents must educate their children about the importance of safety, responsibility, and healthy relationships to mitigate these risks.\n\nBy understanding the physical, emotional, and social changes that occur during adolescence, parents can provide a supportive environment that fosters growth, self-discovery, and resilience in their teenagers.\n\n---\n\n**Adolescent Development**\n\nAs adolescents become stronger and more independent, they often engage in risk-taking behaviors that can have severe consequences. It's essential for parents to understand the physical and emotional changes their children are undergoing during this period.\n\n**Safety**\n\nAdolescents need guidance on safe behavior, particularly when it comes to motor vehicles. They should be taught about the risks of substance abuse and the importance of using seat belts. Additionally, they should learn how to use equipment and protective gear or clothing in sports, and how to handle firearms properly if they have access to them.\n\nAdolescents who appear isolated, uninterested in school or social activities, or doing poorly at school, work, or sports may need to be evaluated for potential issues such as depression or suicidal tendencies. If you or someone you know is struggling with these feelings, call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) or text \"HOME\" to 741741.\n\n**Parenting Tips About Sexuality**\n\nAdolescents need privacy to understand their physical changes, so it's essential to provide them with a private space, such as their own bedroom. Teasing them about their body changes can lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment. Parents should remember that it's natural for adolescents to be interested in body changes and sexual topics.\n\nIt's also crucial to acknowledge the Oedipal complex, where children may develop attractions to the opposite sex parent. Parents should deal with this by acknowledging their child's physical changes and attractiveness without crossing boundaries.\n\n**Independence and Power Struggles**\n\nThe adolescent quest for independence is a normal part of development. Parents should not see it as a rejection or loss of control but rather as an opportunity for growth. Establishing clear limits and being consistent can help reduce conflicts.\n\nPower struggles often arise when authority is at stake or \"being right\" becomes the main issue. Parents should be prepared to recognize common conflicts and maintain open lines of communication with their adolescents.\n\n**Physical Development**\n\nDuring adolescence, young people undergo significant physical changes. Girls may develop breast buds as early as 8 years old, while boys experience a growth spurt around age 12. Menarche typically occurs between ages 9 and 16, with an average age of 12 in the United States.\n\nBoys also experience physical changes during adolescence, including the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Understanding these changes is crucial for parents to provide appropriate guidance and support to their adolescents.\n\n**References**\n\nHazen EP, Abrams AN, Muriel AC.

Soon, the penis begins to lengthen. By age 17 or 18, their genitals are usually at their adult size and shape.\n\nPubic hair growth, as well as armpit, leg, chest, and facial hair, begins in boys at about age 12, and reaches adult patterns at about 17 to 18 years.\n\nBoys do not start puberty with a sudden incident, like the beginning of menstrual periods in girls. Having regular nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) marks the beginning of puberty in boys. Wet dreams typically start between ages 13 and 17. The average age is about 14 and a half years.\n\nBoys' voices change at the same time as the penis grows. Nocturnal emissions occur with the peak of the height spurt.\n\nBoys' growth spurt peaks around age 13 and a half and slows around age 18.\n\n**Behavioral Changes in Adolescents**\n\nThe sudden and rapid physical changes that adolescents go through make them very self-conscious. They are sensitive, and worried about their own body changes. They may make painful comparisons about themselves with their peers.\n\nPhysical changes may not occur in a smooth, regular schedule. Therefore, adolescents may go through awkward stages, both in their appearance and physical coordination.\n\nGirls may be anxious if they are not ready for the beginning of their menstrual periods. Boys may worry if they do not know about nocturnal emissions.\n\nDuring adolescence, it is normal for young people to begin to separate from their parents and make their own identity. In some cases, this may occur without a problem from their parents and other family members. However, this may lead to conflict in some families as the parents try to keep control.\n\nFriends become more important as adolescents pull away from their parents in a search for their own identity.\n\nTheir peer group may become a safe haven. This allows the adolescent to test new ideas.\n\nIn early adolescence, the peer group most often consists of non-romantic friendships. These often include \"cliques,\" gangs, or clubs. Members of the peer group often try to act alike, dress alike, have secret codes or rituals, and participate in the same activities.\n\nAs the youth moves into mid-adolescence (14 to 16 years) and beyond, the peer group expands to include romantic friendships.\n\nIn mid- to late adolescence, young people often feel the need to establish their sexual identity. They need to become comfortable with their body and sexual feelings. Adolescents learn to express and receive intimate or sexual advances. Young people who do not have the chance for such experiences may have a harder time with intimate relationships when they are adults.\n\n**Safety Concerns**\n\nAdolescents become stronger and more independent before they have developed good decision-making skills. A strong need for peer approval may tempt a young person to take part in risky behaviors.\n\nMotor vehicle safety should be stressed. It should focus on the role of the driver/passenger/pedestrian, the risks of substance abuse, and the importance of using seat belts. Adolescents should not have the privilege of using motor vehicles unless they can show that they can do so safely.\n\nOther safety issues are:\n\nAdolescents who are involved in sports should learn to use equipment and protective gear or clothing. They should be taught the rules of safe play and how to approach more advanced activities.\n\nYoung people need to be very aware of possible dangers including sudden death. These threats can occur with regular substance abuse, and with the experimental use of drugs and alcohol.\n\nAdolescents who are allowed to use or have access to firearms need to learn how to use them properly.\n\n**Parenting Tips**\n\nAdolescents most often need privacy to understand the changes taking place in their bodies. Ideally, they should be allowed to have their own bedroom. If this is not possible, they should have at least some private space.\n\nTeasing an adolescent child about physical changes is inappropriate. It may lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment.\n\nParents need to remember that it is natural and normal for their adolescent to be interested in body changes and sexual topics. It does not mean that their child is involved in sexual activity.\n\nAdolescents may experiment with a wide range of sexual orientations or behaviors before feeling comfortable with their own sexual identity. Parents must be careful not to call new behaviors \"wrong,\" \"sick,\" or \"immoral.\"\n\nThe Oedipal complex (a child's attraction to the parent of the opposite sex) is common during the adolescent years. Parents can deal with this by acknowledging the child's physical changes and attractiveness without crossing parent-child boundaries. Parents can also take pride in the youth's growth into maturity.\n\nIt is normal for the parent to find the adolescent attractive. This often happens because the teen often looks very much like the other (same-sex) parent did at a younger age. This attraction may cause the parent to feel awkward. The parent should be careful not to create a distance that may make the adolescent feel responsible. It is inappropriate for a parent's attraction to a child to be anything more than an attraction as a parent. Attraction that crosses the parent-child boundaries may lead to inappropriately intimate behavior with the adolescent. This is known as incest.\n\n**Independence and Power Struggles**\n\nThe teenager's quest to become independent is a normal part of development. The parent should not see it as a rejection or loss of control. Parents need to be constant and consistent. They should be available to listen to the child's ideas without dominating the child's independent identity.\n\nAlthough adolescents always challenge authority figures, they need or want limits. Limits provide a safe boundary for them to grow and function. Limit-setting means having pre-set rules and regulations about their behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Adolescent Development**\n\nDuring adolescence, children develop the ability to:\n\n* **Understand abstract ideas**: grasp higher math concepts, and develop moral philosophies, including rights and privileges.\n* **Establish and maintain satisfying relationships**: learn to share intimacy without feeling worried or inhibited.\n* **Move toward a more mature sense of themselves and their purpose**.\n* **Question old values without losing their identity**.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Physical Development**\n\nDuring adolescence, young people go through many changes as they move into physical maturity. Early, prepubescent changes occur when the secondary sexual characteristics appear.\n\n* **Girls**: breast buds may develop as early as 8 years old, breasts develop fully between ages 12 and 18, pubic hair, armpit, and leg hair usually begin to grow at about age 9 or 10, reach adult patterns at about 13 to 14 years, menarche typically occurs about 2 years after early breast and pubic hair appear, it may occur as early as age 9, or as late as age 16. The average age of menstruation in the United States is about 12 years.\n* **Boys**: testicles and scrotum grow as early as age 9, soon the penis begins to lengthen, by age 17 or 18, their genitals are usually at their adult size and shape, pubic hair growth, as well as armpit, leg, chest, and facial hair, begins in boys at about age 12, and reaches adult patterns at about 17 to 18 years.

Young people who do not have the chance for such experiences may have a harder time with intimate relationships when they are adults.\n\nAdolescents very often have behaviors that are consistent with several myths of adolescence:\n\n* **The first myth is that they are \"on stage\" and other people's attention is constantly centered on their appearance or actions**. This is normal self-centeredness.\n* **Another myth of adolescence is the idea that \"it will never happen to me, only the other person.\"** \"It\" may represent becoming pregnant or catching a sexually-transmitted disease after having unprotected sex, causing a car crash while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or any of the many other negative effects of risk-taking behaviors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Safety**\n\nAdolescents become stronger and more independent before they have developed good decision-making skills.

    "content": "**Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis**\n\n**What is Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis?**\n\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that appears in late childhood or adolescence. Instead of growing straight, the spine develops a side-to-side curvature, usually in an elongated \"S\" or \"C\" shape; the bones of the spine are also slightly twisted or rotated.\n\n**When Does Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Appear?**\n\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis appears during the adolescent growth spurt, a time when children are growing rapidly. In many cases the abnormal spinal curve is stable, although in some children the curve is progressive (meaning it becomes more severe over time). For unknown reasons, severe and progressive curves occur more frequently in girls than in boys. However, mild spinal curvature is equally common in girls and boys.\n\n**What Are the Signs of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis?**\n\nMild scoliosis generally does not cause pain, problems with movement, or difficulty breathing. It may only be diagnosed if it is noticed during a regular physical examination or a scoliosis screening at school. The most common signs of the condition include:\n\n* A tilt or unevenness (asymmetry) in the shoulders, hips, or waist\n* Having one leg that appears longer than the other\n\nA small percentage of affected children develop more severe, pronounced spinal curvature.\n\n**Is Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Related to Other Conditions?**\n\nScoliosis can occur as a feature of other conditions, including a variety of genetic syndromes. However, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically occurs by itself, without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.\n\n---\n\n**Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis**\n\n**What is Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis?**\n\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that appears in late childhood or adolescence. Instead of growing straight, the spine develops a side-to-side curvature, usually in an elongated \"S\" or \"C\" shape; the bones of the spine are also slightly twisted or rotated.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe term \"idiopathic\" means that the cause of this condition is unknown. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not been identified.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis affects an estimated 2 to 3 percent of children in the U.S.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. However, having a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis increases a child's risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAIS, Late onset idiopathic scoliosis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   SCOLIOSIS, ISOLATED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; IS1\n    *   SCOLIOSIS, ISOLATED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3; IS3\n    *   SCOLIOSIS, ISOLATED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2; IS2\n    *   SCOLIOSIS, ISOLATED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 4; IS4\n    *   SCOLIOSIS, ISOLATED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 5; IS5\n\n---\n\n**Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Altaf F, Gibson A, Dannawi Z, Noordeen H.

First, explain the reasons for the procedure. Let your teen take part and make as many decisions as possible.\n\n**PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE**\n\nExplain the procedure in correct medical terms. Tell your teen why the test is being done. (Ask your health care provider to explain it if you are not sure.) Understanding the need for the procedure may reduce your teen's anxiety.\n\nTo the best of your ability, describe how the test will feel. Allow your teen to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n\nBe honest about discomfort your teen may feel, but don't dwell on it. It may help to stress the benefits of the test, and to say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your teen may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them.\n\nTell your teen as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test. If the procedure will take place in a new location, it may help to tour the facility with your teen before the test.\n\n**Staying Calm During the Procedure**\n\nSuggest ways for your teen to stay calm, such as:\n\n* Blowing bubbles\n* Breathing deeply\n* Counting\n* Creating a quiet, peaceful environment\n* Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts)\n* Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure\n* Playing hand-held video games\n* Using guided imagery\n* Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed\n\n**Making Decisions and Participating in the Procedure**\n\nWhen possible, let your teen make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be.\n\nAllow your teen to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed.\n\n**Discussing Possible Risks**\n\nDiscuss possible risks. Teens are often concerned about risks, particularly about any effects on their appearance, mental function, and sexuality. Address these fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause.\n\n---\n\n**Preparing Your Teen for a Medical Test or Procedure**\n\nAs a parent, preparing your teen for a medical test or procedure can reduce anxiety, encourage cooperation, and help them develop coping skills.\n\n**Understanding the Procedure**\n\nExplain the reasons for the procedure in correct medical terms. Let your teen take part and make as many decisions as possible. This will help them understand the need for the procedure and reduce their anxiety.\n\n**Describing the Test Experience**\n\nDescribe how the test will feel to the best of your ability. Allow your teen to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n\n**Preparing Your Teen Before the Procedure**\n\nBe honest about discomfort your teen may feel, but don't dwell on it. Stress the benefits of the test and say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your teen may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home.\n\n**Providing Emotional Support**\n\nSuggest ways for your teen to stay calm, such as:\n\n*   Blowing bubbles\n*   Breathing deeply\n*   Counting\n*   Creating a quiet, peaceful environment\n*   Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts)\n*   Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure\n*   Playing hand-held video games\n*   Using guided imagery\n*   Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed\n\n**Letting Your Teen Make Decisions**\n\nWhen possible, let your teen make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be.\n\n**Discussing Possible Risks**\n\nDiscuss possible risks with your teen. Address their fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause.\n\n**During the Procedure**\n\nIf the procedure is done at a hospital or your provider's office, ask if you can stay with your teen. However, if your teen doesn't want you to be there, honor this wish. Out of respect for your adolescent's growing need for privacy and independence, don't allow peers or siblings to watch the procedure unless your teen asks them to be there.\n\n**Reducing Anxiety**\n\nDo not show your own anxiety. Looking anxious will make your adolescent more upset and worried. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures to reduce their own anxiety.\n\n**Other Considerations**\n\nAsk your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure. This can raise anxiety.\nAsk that the provider who has spent the most time with your teen be present during the procedure, if possible. Otherwise, your adolescent may show some resistance. Prepare your adolescent in advance for the possibility that the test will be done by someone they don't know.\nAsk if anesthesia is an option to reduce any discomfort.\nAssure your teen that their reactions are normal.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help your teen feel more prepared and comfortable during a medical test or procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Preparing Your Adolescent for a Medical Test or Procedure**\n\nAs a parent, preparing your adolescent for a medical test or procedure can be a challenging task. However, with the right approach, you can help reduce their anxiety and make the experience less painful.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n1. **Explain the reasons**: Let your teen understand why the test is being done.\n2. **Use correct medical terms**: Explain the procedure in simple terms that your teen can understand.\n3. **Describe how it will feel**: Be honest about any discomfort they may feel, but don't dwell on it.\n4. **Stress the benefits**: Emphasize the importance of the test and how it may provide more information.\n5. **Discuss possible risks**: Address any concerns or fears your teen may have.\n\n**Preparing Your Adolescent**\n\n1. **Let them take part**: Involve your teen in the decision-making process, such as choosing the time of day or date of the procedure.\n2. **Practice positions or movements**: Allow your teen to practice the positions or movements required for the test.\n3. **Discuss equipment**: Explain the equipment that will be used during the test.\n4. **Suggest ways to stay calm**: Encourage your teen to use relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or guided imagery.\n\n**During the Procedure**\n\n1. **Ask if you can stay**: Check with your provider if you can accompany your teen during the procedure.\n2. **Respect their wishes**: If your teen doesn't want you to be there, honor their request.\n3. **Don't show anxiety**: Keep your own emotions in check, as this can make your adolescent more anxious.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Limit strangers**: Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure.\n2. **Choose a familiar face**: If possible, ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your teen be present during the procedure.\n3. **Anesthesia options**: Discuss anesthesia as an option to reduce any discomfort.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help your adolescent feel more prepared and comfortable during a medical test or procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Preparing Adolescents for Tests and Procedures**\n\n\\n\\nWhen your child is getting ready for a test or procedure, it's natural to feel anxious. But did you know that there are ways to reduce anxiety and make the experience less stressful? In this article, we'll explore some effective strategies for preparing adolescents for tests and procedures.\n\n**Reducing Anxiety through Audiovisual Interventions**\n\nResearch has shown that audiovisual interventions can be an effective way to reduce preoperative anxiety in children undergoing elective surgery. A systematic review of 17 studies found that audiovisual interventions resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety levels compared to traditional preparation methods (Chow et al., 2016).\n\n**Web-Based Tailored Intervention for Preparation**\n\nAnother study developed a web-based tailored intervention called WebTIPS, which aimed to prepare parents and children for outpatient surgery. The results showed that the WebTIPS program was effective in reducing anxiety and improving parental knowledge about anesthesia (Kain et al., 2015).\n\n**Minimizing Pediatric Healthcare-Induced Anxiety**\n\nA study published in the World Journal of Clinical Pediatrics found that minimizing pediatric healthcare-induced anxiety and trauma can have a positive impact on a child's well-being. The author suggests that healthcare providers should take steps to minimize anxiety and trauma during medical procedures (Lerwick, 2016).\n\n**Resources for Parents**\n\nIf you're looking for more information on how to prepare your adolescent for tests and procedures, here are some resources that may be helpful:\n\n*   American Cancer Society website: When Your Child Has Cancer\n*   Chow et al. (2016) - Systematic review: audiovisual interventions for reducing preoperative anxiety in children undergoing elective surgery\n*   Kain et al. (2015) - Web-based tailored intervention for preparation of parents and children for outpatient surgery (WebTIPS): development\n*   Lerwick (2016) - Minimizing pediatric healthcare-induced anxiety and trauma\n\nBy being informed and taking steps to reduce anxiety, you can help make the experience less stressful for your adolescent.",

The adrenal glands make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work.\n\nThe adrenal glands make the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. They also make hormones that your body uses to make sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone). All of these hormones do many important jobs, including:\n\n* Turning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels\n* Balancing salt and water\n* Keeping blood pressure normal\n* Responding to illness and stress (your \"fight or flight\" response)\n* Timing when and how fast a child develops sexually\n* Supporting pregnancy\n\n**What are adrenal gland disorders?**\n\nWhen you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body.\n\nThere are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including:\n\n* Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol\n* Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time\n* Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure\n* Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous.\n* Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma\n* Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol\n\n**What causes adrenal gland disorders?**\n\nThe cause of adrenal gland disorders depends on the type of disorder you have. Causes can include:\n\n* Medicines such as steroids\n* A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland releases hormones that affect how the adrenal glands work.\n* Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones.\n* Infections\n\nIn many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear.\n\n**How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed?**\n\nHealth care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history. For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to look for tumors.\n\n**What are the treatments for adrenal gland disorders?**\n\nDifferent types of adrenal gland disorders have different treatments. They include medicines and surgery. Radiation therapy is sometimes a treatment for tumors. There are treatments to cure certain adrenal gland disorders.

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), and others.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk for problems. Ask your health care provider for help quitting.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n*   Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n*   Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nWhile in the hospital, you may:\n\n*   Receive special stockings to prevent blood clots\n*   Receive shots under your skin to prevent blood clots\n*   Receive pain medicine\n*   Have your blood pressure monitored and continue to receive blood pressure medicine\n\nYou will be discharged in 1 or 2 days after the surgery.\n\nAt home:\n\n*   Follow instructions on how to care for yourself as you recover.\n*   You can remove the dressing and shower the day after the surgery, unless your surgeon tells you otherwise.\n*   You may have some pain and may need to take medicine for pain.\n*   You can start doing some light activities.\n\nRecovering from open surgery may be painful because of where the surgical cut is located. Recovery after a laparoscopic procedure is most often quicker.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople who undergo the laparoscopic surgery mostly have faster recovery than with open surgery. How well you do after surgery depends on the reason for the surgery:\n\n*   If you had surgery for Conn syndrome, you may have to stay on blood pressure medicines.\n*   If you had surgery for Cushing syndrome, you are at risk for complications that may need to be treated. Your provider can tell you more about this.\n*   If you had surgery for pheochromocytoma, the outcome is usually good.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAdrenalectomy; Removal of adrenal glands\n\n---\n\n**Adrenalectomy; Removal of adrenal glands**\n\nYou will be discharged in 1 or 2 days after the surgery.\n\nAt home:\n\nFollow instructions on how to care for yourself as you recover.\nYou can remove the dressing and shower the day after the surgery, unless your surgeon tells you otherwise.\nYou may have some pain and may need to take medicine for pain.\nYou can start doing some light activities.\n\nRecovering from open surgery may be painful because of where the surgical cut is located.

    "title": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH): MedlinePlus Medical Test",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/adrenocorticotropic-hormone-acth/",
    "content": "**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Test**\n\n**What is an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test?**\n\nThis test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in a sample of your blood. A hormone is a chemical messenger in your bloodstream that controls the actions of certain cells or organs. ACTH tells your adrenal glands, two small glands that sit above your kidneys, to make another hormone called cortisol.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nCortisol affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It helps your body:\n\n* Respond to stress (cortisol is sometimes called the \"stress hormone\")\n* Reduce inflammation\n* Regulate blood glucose, also called blood sugar, and metabolism (how your body uses food for energy)\n* Control blood pressure\n\n**Why do I need an ACTH test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you had abnormal results on a cortisol test or have symptoms of too much or too little cortisol.\n\nSymptoms of too much cortisol may vary. They may include:\n\n* Weight gain\n* Thin arms and legs\n* Round face\n* Increased fat around the base of the neck or between the shoulder blades\n* Easy bruising\n* Wide purple streaks on the stomach, breasts, hips, and under the arms\n* Muscle weakness\n\nSymptoms of too little cortisol include:\n\n* Long-lasting fatigue\n* Muscle weakness\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\n**What happens during an ACTH test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour health care provider will tell you how to prepare for your test. You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Blood samples for ACTH testing are often taken early in the morning when ACTH levels are at their highest for the day.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nTo understand what the results of your ACTH test mean, your provider will usually compare your ACTH level with your cortisol level. If your results are abnormal, you may need other tests to confirm the specific cause. Ask your provider to explain what your test results say about your health.\n\nIn general:\n\n* High ACTH and high cortisol levels are a sign of pituitary tumor that makes ACTH (Cushing's disease).\n* Low ACTH and low cortisol levels are a sign of damage to your adrenal glands (Addison disease).\n* Low ACTH and high cortisol levels are a sign of Cushing's syndrome.\n* Low or normal ACTH and low cortisol levels are a sign of hypopituitarism.\n\n---\n\n**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Test**\n\n**What is an ACTH test?**\n\nAn ACTH test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in a sample of your blood. ACTH tells your adrenal glands to make another hormone called cortisol.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nCortisol affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It helps your body:\n\n* Respond to stress\n* Reduce inflammation\n* Regulate blood glucose and metabolism\n* Control blood pressure\n\nBecause ACTH controls how much cortisol you make, ACTH testing is usually done with a blood test to measure your cortisol levels.\n\n**What are the conditions that affect cortisol levels?**\n\nHigh cortisol levels may be from:\n\n* Cushing's disease (a tumor in the pituitary gland)\n* Cushing's syndrome (exposure to too much cortisol over a long period of time)\n\nLow cortisol levels may be from:\n\n* Addison disease (adrenal glands can't make enough cortisol due to damage)\n* Hypopituitarism (pituitary gland can't make enough hormones, including ACTH)\n\n**Why do I need an ACTH test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you had abnormal results on a cortisol test or have symptoms of too much or too little cortisol. Symptoms include:\n\nToo much cortisol: weight gain, thin arms and legs, round face, easy bruising, etc.\n\nToo little cortisol: long-lasting fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, etc.\n\n**What happens during an ACTH test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The procedure usually takes less than five minutes and you may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.\n\n---\n\n**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Test**\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe test is usually done by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. The blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider will tell you how to prepare for your test. You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Blood samples for ACTH testing are often taken early in the morning when ACTH levels are at their highest for the day.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nTo understand what the results of your ACTH test mean, your provider will usually compare your ACTH level with your cortisol level. If your results are abnormal, you may need other tests to confirm the specific cause. Ask your provider to explain what your test results say about your health.\n\nIn general:\n\n* High ACTH and high cortisol levels are a sign of pituitary tumor that makes ACTH (Cushing's disease).\n* Low ACTH and low cortisol levels are a sign of hypopituitarism.\n* Low or normal ACTH and low cortisol levels are a sign of damage to your adrenal glands (Addison disease).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Tests**\n\nSeveral other tests may be used to help diagnose the specific cause of abnormal cortisol levels. These tests measure changes in your ACTH or cortisol levels after you are given medicines that either trigger or stop the production of the hormones involved with making cortisol.\n\nFor example, an ACTH stimulation test is commonly used to help find out if a problem with your adrenal glands is causing low cortisol levels. This blood test measures your cortisol levels before and after you get an injection (shot) of ACTH. The results show whether your adrenal glands are able to respond normally to ACTH by making cortisol.\n\nIf your adrenal glands make a normal amount of cortisol after the shot, it suggests that a problem with your hypothalamus or pituitary gland is causing low cortisol levels. If your adrenal glands make little or no cortisol after the shot, you most likely have a problem that affects the health of your adrenal glands.\n\n---\n\n**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Test**\n\nThe Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) test is a medical procedure used to diagnose adrenal gland disorders, such as Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome. The test measures the level of ACTH in the blood, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.\n\n**How the Test Works**\n\nDuring the test, a small sample of blood is taken from a vein in the arm. The blood sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. In some cases, a synthetic form of ACTH may be injected into the patient's vein to stimulate the adrenal glands and measure their response.\n\n**Interpreting Test Results**\n\nThe results of the ACTH test are used to diagnose various adrenal gland disorders, including:\n\n* Addison's disease: a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol\n* Cushing's syndrome: a condition in which the body produces too much cortisol\n* Hypopituitarism: a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce enough hormones to stimulate the adrenal glands\n\nIf the test results show that the patient has low levels of ACTH, it may indicate a problem with the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. If the test results show that the patient's adrenal glands do not respond properly to the synthetic form of ACTH, it may indicate a problem with the adrenal glands themselves.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Addison Disease\n* Adrenal Gland Disorders\n* Cushing's Syndrome\n* Hormones\n* Pituitary Disorders\n* Pituitary Tumors\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* Aldosterone Test\n* Cortisol Test\n* DHEA Sulfate Test\n* Fasting for a Blood Test\n* How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n* How to Understand Your Lab Results\n* What You Need to Know About Blood Testing",

These disorders are often passed down (inherited) in families.\n\n**Causes**\n\nALD is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males. Some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races.\n\nSome cases of ALD occur when the gene changes on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited.\n\nThe condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body.\n\nThere are three major categories of disease:\n\n* Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8)\n* Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life\n* Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChildhood cerebral type symptoms include:\n\n* Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements\n* Crossed eyes\n* Handwriting that gets worse\n* Difficulty at school\n* Difficulty understanding what people are saying\n* Hearing loss\n* Hyperactivity\n* Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis\n* Seizures\n* Swallowing difficulties\n* Visual impairment or blindness\n\nAdrenomyelopathy symptoms include:\n\n* Difficulty controlling urination\n* Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness\n* Problems with thinking speed and visual memory\n\nAdrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include:\n\n* Coma\n* Decreased appetite\n* Increased skin color\n* Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting)\n* Muscle weakness\n* Vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIn most states, children will be screened for ALD as part of newborn screening tests.

It is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which leads to the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the body.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ALD can vary depending on the type of the disease. The childhood form of X-linked ALD is a progressive disease that leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs.\n\n**Types of Adrenoleukodystrophy**\n\nThere are four types of ALD:\n\n1. **X-linked ALD**: This is the most severe form of the disease, affecting boys and men.\n2. **Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)**: This type affects adults and is characterized by progressive damage to the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.\n3. **Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD)**: This type affects young boys and is characterized by rapid progression of neurological symptoms.\n4. **Infantile adrenoleukodystrophy**: This type affects infants and is characterized by severe neurological symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of ALD is typically made through a combination of:\n\n1. **Blood tests**: To measure the levels of very long chain fatty acids in the blood.\n2. **Chromosome study**: To look for changes in the ABCD1 gene that may make the person more likely to develop the disease.\n3. **MRI of the head**: To visualize any damage to the brain or spinal cord.\n4. **Skin biopsy**: To examine the skin cells for signs of the disease.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for X-linked ALD, but supportive care and careful monitoring of impaired adrenal gland function may help in improving comfort and quality of life. A bone marrow transplant may stop worsening of the condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked ALD. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked ALD is also available through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.\n\n**References**\n\nJames WD, Elston DM, Treat JR, Rosenbach MA, Neuhaus IM.

The risk factors include family history, as the disorder can be inherited from parents who have the mutated gene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ALD vary depending on the type of the disorder. They may include:\n\n*   **Adrenal insufficiency**: a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones\n*   **Spinal cord degeneration**: damage to the spinal cord that can lead to paralysis and loss of sensation\n*   **Cognitive impairment**: problems with thinking, memory, and behavior\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of ALD is typically made through genetic testing, which involves analyzing a sample of blood or tissue for mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans may also be used to evaluate the extent of spinal cord damage.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ALD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. This may include hormone replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, physical therapy to maintain mobility, and cognitive rehabilitation to improve thinking and memory skills.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ALD varies depending on the type of the disorder and the effectiveness of treatment.

    "content": "**Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD)**\n\n**Description**\n\nAdult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is a condition that affects the nervous system. People with APBD typically first experience signs and symptoms related to the condition between ages 35 and 60.\n\nInitial symptoms of the disorder include numbness and tingling in the legs (peripheral neuropathy) and progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity). As a result, affected individuals can have an unsteady gait, poor balance, and an increased risk of falling.\n\nDamage to the nerves that control bladder function, a condition called neurogenic bladder, is another feature that often occurs early in the course of APBD. Affected individuals have increasing difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine.\n\nEventually, most people with APBD lose the ability to control their bladder and bowel functions and their limbs. Damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls body functions that are mostly involuntary, leads to problems with blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, digestion, temperature regulation, and sexual response, and results in daily bouts of exhaustion. About half of people with APBD experience a decline in intellectual function (dementia).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAPBD is a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown. Approximately 200 affected individuals have been diagnosed worldwide. Recently these have included younger individuals who have not yet experienced signs or symptoms but who are diagnosed in the course of genetic screening when considering parenthood. Researchers suspect that the disorder may be underdiagnosed.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the GBE1 gene cause APBD. The GBE1 gene provides instructions for making the glycogen branching enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body.\n\n---\n\n**Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease**\n\n**What is Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease?**\n\nAdult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the GBE1 gene, which provides instructions for making the glycogen branching enzyme.\n\n**How Does APBD Affect the Body?**\n\nIn people with APBD, abnormal glycogen molecules called polyglucosan bodies accumulate within cells and cause damage. Nerve cells (neurons) appear to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of polyglucosan bodies, leading to impaired neuronal function.\n\n**Types of Mutations in the GBE1 Gene**\n\nMost GBE1 gene mutations that cause APBD result in a shortage (deficiency) of the glycogen branching enzyme. However, some mutations do not result in a shortage of this enzyme, and the activity of the enzyme is normal. In these individuals, the cause of the disease is unclear.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAPBD is also known as polyglucosan body disease, adult form.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on APBD, you can visit the following resources:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Adult polyglucosan body disease\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Adult polyglucosan body disease\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: POLYGLUCOSAN BODY NEUROPATHY, ADULT FORM; APBN\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease**\n\n**What is Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease?**\n\nAdult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of polyglucosan bodies in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. This condition affects adults and is caused by mutations in the GBE1 gene.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of APBD can vary widely among affected individuals but may include:\n\n*   **Cognitive decline**: Difficulty with memory, attention, and decision-making\n*   **Motor dysfunction**: Weakness, stiffness, or spasms in the muscles\n*   **Autonomic dysfunction**: Abnormalities in heart rate, blood pressure, or digestion\n*   **Neurological symptoms**: Seizures, tremors, or sensory disturbances\n\nDiagnosis of APBD is typically made through a combination of:\n\n1.  **Genetic testing**: Identifying mutations in the GBE1 gene\n2.  **Imaging studies**: MRI or CT scans to visualize changes in the brain and spinal cord\n3.  **Biopsy**: Examining tissue samples for polyglucosan bodies\n\n**Prognosis and Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for APBD, but various treatments can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. These may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: To alleviate cognitive, motor, or autonomic dysfunction\n*   **Physical therapy**: To maintain mobility and strength\n*   **Speech therapy**: To address communication difficulties\n*   **Palliative care**: To provide comfort and support for individuals with advanced disease\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAPBD is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that affected individuals must inherit two copies of the mutated GBE1 gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Carriers of the mutation may experience mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic.\n\n**Genetic Counseling**\n\nIf you have questions about APBD or are concerned about your family history, consult a genetic counselor or healthcare provider for personalized guidance and support.",

As the cancer grows, it may cause a lump or swelling that keeps growing over time. Most lumps are not due to cancer.\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n*   Pain, if it presses on a nerve, organ, blood vessel, bone, or muscle\n*   Blockage or bleeding in the stomach or intestines\n*   Breathing problems\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:\n\n*   X-rays\n*   CT scan\n*   MRI\n*   PET scan\n\nIf your provider suspects cancer, you might have a biopsy to check for cancer.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is the most common treatment for STS.\n\nIn early stages, the tumor and some healthy tissue around it is removed. Sometimes, just a small amount of tissue needs to be removed. Other times, a wider area of tissue must be removed.\n\nWith advanced cancers that form in an arm or leg, surgery may be followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Rarely, the limb may need to be amputated.\n\nYou also may have radiation therapy or chemotherapy:\n\n*   Used before surgery to help shrink the tumor to make it easier to remove the cancer\n*   Used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells\n\nChemotherapy may be used to help kill cancer that has metastasized. This means it has spread to different areas of the body.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nCancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have had the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone.\n\nAsk your provider to help you find a support group for people who have been diagnosed with STS.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook for people whose cancer is treated early is very good.

    "content": "**Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia**\n\n**What is Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia?**\n\nAdult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain. A hallmark of ALSP is leukoencephalopathy, which is the alteration of a type of brain tissue called white matter.\n\n**What are the Symptoms of ALSP?**\n\nSymptoms of ALSP usually begin in a person's forties and worsen over time. Personality changes, including depression and a loss of social inhibitions, are among the earliest symptoms of ALSP. Affected individuals may develop memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies.\n\n**How Does ALSP Progress?**\n\nOver time, motor skills are affected, and people with ALSP may have difficulty walking. Many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary trembling (tremor), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). The pattern of cognitive and motor problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family.\n\n**What is the Relationship Between ALSP, HDLS, and POLD?**\n\nALSP was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD), both of which cause very similar white matter damage and cognitive and movement problems. HDLS and POLD are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling ALSP.\n\n---\n\n**Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia**\n\n**What is Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia?**\n\nAdult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a rare neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain.

Personality changes, including depression and a loss of social inhibitions, are among the earliest symptoms of ALSP. Affected individuals may develop memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies.\n\n**Causes of ALSP**\n\nALSP is caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1 receptor), which is found in the outer membrane of certain types of cells, including glial cells. The CSF-1 receptor triggers signaling pathways that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation of the cell to take on specific functions (differentiation).\n\n**Frequency of ALSP**\n\nALSP is thought to be a rare disorder, although the prevalence is unknown. Because it can be mistaken for other disorders with similar symptoms, ALSP may be underdiagnosed.\n\n**Diagnosis of ALSP**\n\nAreas of damage to white matter in the brain (white matter lesions) can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another feature of ALSP is swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. Also common in ALSP are abnormally pigmented glial cells.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis of ALSP**\n\nThere is no cure for ALSP, and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Affected individuals ultimately become unable to walk, speak, and care for themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia**\n\n**What is Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia?**\n\nAdult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia, also known as ALSP, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain.

In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia**\n\nALSP is also known as hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on ALSP, please refer to the following references:\n\n*   Ali ZS, Van Der Voorn JP, Powers JM.

    "content": "**Advance Care Directives**\n\nWhen you are very ill or injured, you may not be able to make health care choices for yourself. If you are unable to speak for yourself, your health care providers may be unclear as to what type of care you would prefer. Your family members may be uncertain or disagree about the type of medical care you should receive. An advance care directive is a legal document that tells your providers and others involved in helping you what care you agree to or decline in advance of this type of situation.\n\n**Why Write an Advance Directive?**\n\nWith an advance care directive, you can tell your providers what medical treatment you do not want to have and what treatment you want no matter how ill you are.\n\n**Writing an Advance Care Directive May Be Difficult. You Need To:**\n\n* Know and understand your treatment options.\n* Decide future treatment options you may or may not want.\n* Discuss your choices with your family.\n\n**Living Wills**\n\nA living will (advance care directive) explains the care you do or do not want. In it, you can state your wishes about receiving:\n\n* CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating\n* Feedings through a tube into a vein (IV) or into your stomach\n* Extended care on a breathing machine\n* Tests, medicines, or surgeries\n* Blood transfusions\n\nEach state has laws about living wills. You can find out about the laws in your state from your providers, the state law organization, community social workers, and most hospitals.\n\nYou should also know that:\n\n* A living will does not deal with financial issues, and is not the same as a last will and testament after a person's death.\n* You are not able to name someone to make health care decisions for you in a living will.\n\n**Other Types of Advance Directives**\n\nOther types of advance directives include:\n\n* Special health care power of attorney: a legal document that allows you to name someone else (a health care agent or proxy) to make health care decisions for you when you cannot. It does not give power to anyone to make legal or financial decisions for you.\n* A do-not-resuscitate order (DNR): a document that tells providers not to do CPR if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating. Your provider talks to you, the proxy, or family about this choice. The provider writes the order on your medical chart.\n* Fill out an organ donation authorization card and carry it in your wallet if you wish to be an organ donor after death. Keep a second card with your important papers. You can find out about organ donation from your provider. You can also have this choice listed on your driver's license.\n* Verbal instructions: your choices about care that you tell providers or family members. Verbal wishes may supplement those you made previously in writing. It is best to avoid confusion by putting your wishes in writing whenever possible.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nWrite your living will or health care power of attorney according to your state's laws. Your attorney, provider, hospital or community social worker will be able to help you with proper documentation.\n\nGive copies to your family members, providers, and health care agent.\nCarry a copy with you in your wallet or the glove compartment of your car.\nTake a copy with you if you are in a hospital. Tell all medical staff involved in your care about these documents.\n\nYou can change your decisions at any time. Be sure to tell everyone involved, family members, proxies, and providers, if you make changes to your advance directive or a living will is changed. Copy, save, and share the new documents with them.\n\n---\n\n**Advance Care Directives**\n\nWhen you are very ill or injured, you may not be able to make health care choices for yourself. If you are unable to speak for yourself, your health care providers may be unclear as to what type of care you would prefer. Your family members may be uncertain or disagree about the type of medical care you should receive. An advance care directive is a legal document that tells your providers and others involved in helping you what care you agree to or decline in advance of this type of situation.\n\n**Why Write an Advance Directive?**\n\nWith an advance care directive, you can tell your providers what medical treatment you do not want to have and what treatment you want no matter how ill you are. Writing an advance care directive may be difficult. You need to:\n\n*   Know and understand your treatment options.\n*   Decide future treatment options you may or may not want.\n*   Discuss your choices with your family.\n\n**Living Wills**\n\nA living will (advance care directive) explains the care you do or do not want. In it, you can state your wishes about receiving:\n\n*   CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating\n*   Feedings through a tube into a vein (IV) or into your stomach\n*   Extended care on a breathing machine\n*   Tests, medicines, or surgeries\n*   Blood transfusions\n\nEach state has laws about living wills. You can find out about the laws in your state from your providers, the state law organization, community social workers, and most hospitals.\n\nYou should also know that:\n\n*   A living will does not deal with financial issues, and is not the same as a last will and testament after a person's death.\n*   You are not able to name someone to make health care decisions for you in a living will.\n\n**Other Types of Advance Directives**\n\nOther types of advance directives include:\n\n*   Special health care power of attorney: a legal document that allows you to name someone else (a health care agent or proxy) to make health care decisions for you when you cannot.\n*   Do-not-resuscitate order (DNR): a document that tells providers not to do CPR if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating.\n*   Organ donation authorization card: fill out an organ donation authorization card and carry it in your wallet if you wish to be an organ donor after death.\n*   Verbal instructions: your choices about care that you tell providers or family members.\n\n---\n\n**Advance Care Directives**\n\n\\n\\nTo avoid confusion by putting your wishes in writing whenever possible.\n\n**Other Types of Advance Directives**\n\n*   **Special health care power of attorney**: a legal document that allows you to name someone else (a health care agent or proxy) to make health care decisions for you when you cannot.\n*   **Do-not-resuscitate order (DNR)**: a document that tells providers not to do CPR if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating.\n*   **Organ donation authorization card**: a card that allows you to be an organ donor after death.\n*   **Verbal instructions**: your choices about care that you tell providers or family members.\n\n**Writing Your Living Will or Health Care Power of Attorney**\n\n*   Write your living will or health care power of attorney according to your state's laws.\n*   Give copies to your family members, providers, and health care agent.\n*   Carry a copy with you in your wallet or the glove compartment of your car.\n*   Take a copy with you if you are in a hospital.

    "content": "**Afamitresgene Autoleucel Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is used in adults to treat certain types of synovial sarcoma that cannot be treated with surgery or is unresponsive to other treatments. Afamitresgene autoleucel is in a class of medications called autologous cellular immunotherapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood. It works by causing the body's immune system (a group of cells, tissues, and organs that protects the body from attack by bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and other substances that cause disease) to fight the cancer cells.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAfamitresgene autoleucel comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. It is usually given in an hour or less as a one-time dose. Before you receive your afamitresgene autoleucel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for afamitresgene autoleucel.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nAfamitresgene autoleucel may cause a serious or life-threatening reaction called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). A doctor or nurse will monitor you carefully during your infusion, during your stay at the healthcare facility (at least 7 days), and for at least 4 weeks after your treatment. You will be given medications 30 to 60 minutes before your infusion to help prevent reactions to afamitresgene autoleucel. If you experience any of the following symptoms during and after your infusion, tell your doctor immediately: fever, chills/shivering, difficulty breathing, fast or irregular heartbeat, dizziness or lightheadedness, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, headache, or rash.\n\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is only available through a special restricted distribution program because of the risks of CRS. You can only receive the medication from a doctor and healthcare facility that participates in the program. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about this program.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with afamitresgene autoleucel. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risk(s) of receiving afamitresgene autoleucel.\n\n---\n\n**Afamitresgene Autoleucel Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Before Your Dose**\n\n*   A sample of your white blood cells will be taken at a cell collection center using a procedure called leukapheresis.\n*   Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you.\n*   It is important to be on time and not miss your scheduled cell collection appointment(s) or treatment dose.\n\n**Monitoring Side Effects**\n\n*   Your healthcare provider will check you daily for at least 7 days after receiving your afamitresgene autoleucel dose.\n*   You should plan to stay near where you received your treatment for at least 4 weeks after your dose.\n*   Your healthcare provider will monitor you for any possible side effects and check if your treatment is working.\n\n**Preparing for Leukapheresis**\n\n*   Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for leukapheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.\n\n**Administration of Afamitresgene Autoleucel**\n\n*   Afamitresgene autoleucel comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital.\n*   It is usually given in an hour or less as a one-time dose.\n*   Before receiving your afamitresgene autoleucel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for afamitresgene autoleucel.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\n*   Afamitresgene autoleucel is also sometimes used to treat other conditions.\n*   Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Afamitresgene Autoleucel Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Special Precautions/Warning Information, Clinical Warning**\n\nCall your doctor immediately.\n\nYou should know that afamitresgene autoleucel injection may make you drowsy and cause confusion, weakness, dizziness, seizures, and coordination problems.

    "content": "**African Iron Overload**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nAfrican iron overload is a condition that involves absorption of too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the liver, bone marrow, and spleen. Humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, although some iron is lost through bleeding or when cells of the intestine (enterocytes) are shed at the end of the cells' lifespan. Iron levels in the body are primarily regulated through control of how much iron is absorbed from the diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAfrican iron overload results from a diet high in iron. It is particularly associated with consumption of a traditional African beer that contains dissolved iron from the metal drums in which it is brewed. Some evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition to absorbing too much iron may also be involved.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThere is no known inheritance pattern for African iron overload.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAfrican iron overload is also known as siderosis or hemochromatosis of Africa.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about African iron overload, visit the MedlinePlus Genetics website at <https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/african-iron-overload/>\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\n---\n\n**African Iron Overload**\n\n**What is African Iron Overload?**\n\nAfrican iron overload is a condition characterized by excessive absorption and storage of iron in the body, particularly in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen.\n\n**Causes of African Iron Overload**\n\nThe condition was first noted in rural central and southern Africa among people who drink a traditional beer brewed in uncoated steel drums that allow iron to leach into the beer. Some evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition to absorbing too much iron may also be involved.\n\n**Symptoms and Effects of African Iron Overload**\n\nExcess iron can lead to tissue damage, chronic liver disease (cirrhosis), and an increased risk of developing infections such as tuberculosis. The excess iron also leads to a faster-than-normal breakdown of vitamin C in the body, making affected individuals more susceptible to scurvy.\n\n**Diagnosis and Detection of African Iron Overload**\n\nAffected individuals may have high levels of ferritin in their blood, which can be detected with a blood test. Ferritin stores and releases iron in cells, and cells produce more ferritin in response to excess amounts of iron.\n\n**Frequency and Prevalence of African Iron Overload**\n\nAfrican iron overload is common in rural areas of central and southern Africa, affecting up to 10 percent of the population in these regions. Men seem to be affected more often than women, possibly due to differences in dietary iron consumption and women's shedding of excess iron through blood loss.\n\n**Risk Factors for African Iron Overload**\n\nPeople of African descent may be at higher risk of developing mildly increased iron stores compared to people of European background. The prevalence of increased iron stores in these populations is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**African Iron Overload**\n\n**What is African iron overload?**\n\nAfrican iron overload, also known as African hemochromatosis or African nutritional hemochromatosis, is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from food. This excess iron can build up in various organs and tissues, leading to damage and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n**Causes of African iron overload**\n\nThe exact cause of African iron overload is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to both genetic and environmental factors. Some studies suggest that a variation in the SLC40A1 gene may increase the risk of developing increased iron stores in people of African descent. However, this variation is not associated with most cases of African iron overload.\n\n**Genetic component**\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a genetic contribution to African iron overload, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. People with a specific variation in the SLC40A1 gene may inherit an increased risk of this condition, but not the condition itself. Not all people with this condition have the variation in the gene, and not all people with the variation will develop the disorder.\n\n**Symptoms and diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of African iron overload can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, and skin problems. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests to measure iron levels in the blood.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nTreatment for African iron overload usually involves removing excess iron from the body through phlebotomy (bloodletting). In some cases, medications may be prescribed to reduce iron absorption or increase its excretion. Lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also help manage the condition.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nAfrican iron overload seems to run in families, and high iron in a family's diet is believed to be the major contributor to development of the condition. There may also be a genetic contribution, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.\n\n**Other names for this condition**\n\nThis condition is also known as African hemochromatosis, African nutritional hemochromatosis, or African siderosis.\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nFor more information on African iron overload, you can visit the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) or the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).\n\n---\n\n**African Iron Overload**\n\n**Port and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**: A comprehensive resource for individuals with rare disorders, including African iron overload.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: An online catalog of genes and diseases, providing information on the genetic basis of African iron overload.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**: A database of biomedical literature, containing articles on African iron overload and related topics.\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: A resource for individuals with rare genetic disorders, including African iron overload.\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**: A comprehensive resource for individuals with rare disorders, including African iron overload.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: An online catalog of genes and diseases, providing information on the genetic basis of African iron overload.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**: A database of biomedical literature, containing articles on African iron overload and related topics.\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: A resource for individuals with rare genetic disorders, including African iron overload.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Barton JC, Acton RT, Lee PL, West C.

Take advantage of the time to bond with your new baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby.\n\n**What to Expect after a C-section**\n\nRight after surgery you may feel:\n\n* Groggy from any medicines you received\n* Nausea for the first day or so\n* Itchy, if you received narcotics in your epidural\n\nYou will be brought to a recovery area right after surgery, where a nurse will:\n\n* Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of your vaginal bleeding\n* Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer\n* Bring you to a hospital room once you are stable, where you will spend the next few days\n\nAfter the excitement of finally delivering and holding your baby, you may notice just how tired you are.\n\nYour belly will be painful at first, but it will improve a lot over 1 to 2 days.\n\nYou may be required to wear compression stockings on your legs to improve blood flow and decrease the risk of blood clots. You will be asked to blow air into a device for the initial 24 hours to improve lung function and breathing.\n\nSome women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are not uncommon. Do not feel ashamed. Talk with your health care providers and partner.\n\n**Seeing and Caring for Your Baby**\n\nBreastfeeding can often begin right after surgery. The nurses can help you find the right position. Numbness from your anesthetic can limit your movement for a while, and pain in your cut (incision) can make it a little harder to become comfortable, but do not give up. The nurses can show you how to hold your baby so there is no pressure on your cut (incision) or abdomen.\n\nHolding and caring for your new infant is exciting, making up for the long journey of your pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.\n\nAlso take advantage of the babysitting and room service the hospital provides for you. You are going home to both the joys of being a mother and the demands of caring for a newborn infant.\n\n**Activity**\n\nBetween feeling exhausted after labor and managing the pain from the surgery, getting out of bed may seem like too big of a task.\n\nBut getting out of bed at least once or twice a day at first can help speed your recovery. It also decreases your chance of having blood clots and helps your bowels move.\n\n**Contractions and Bleeding**\n\nOnce you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful, but they are important.\n\nAs your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavy bleeding. Blood flow should gradually become slower during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when the nurse presses on your uterus to check it.\n\n**Pain Relief**\n\nYour epidural, or spinal, catheter can also be used for pain relief after surgery. It may be left in for up to 24 hours after delivery.\n\nIf you did not have an epidural, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous line (IV) after surgery.\n\nThis line runs through a pump that will be set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine.\nOften, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it.\nThis is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA).\n\nYou will then be switched to pain pills that you take by mouth, or you may receive shots of medicine. It is OK to ask for pain medicine when you need it.\n\n**What Else?**\n\nYou will have a urinary (Foley) catheter in place right after surgery, but this will be removed on the first day after surgery.\n\nYou will have a bandage on your belly to protect the cut (incision). A nurse may monitor the bandage for signs of drainage or bleeding. The area around your cut may be sore, numb, or both. Sutures or staples will usually be removed at a follow-up office visit with your provider.\n\nAt first you may be asked to only eat ice chips or take sips of water, at least until your provider is certain you are not likely to have very heavy bleeding. Most likely, you will be able to eat a light diet 8 hours after your C-section.\n\n---\n\n**After a C-section - in the hospital**\n\nYou'll be staying in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after a cesarean birth (C-section).
