    "content": "**Free Light Chains Test**\n\nA free light chains test measures the level of free light chains in your blood. Light chains are proteins made by plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. They usually link up with other proteins called heavy chains to make immunoglobulins, also called antibodies.\n\n**What is a Free Light Chain?**\n\nLight chains can be bound or free:\n\n* Bound light chains: When light chains link up with heavy chains.\n* Free light chains: Normally, your plasma cells will make a small amount of extra light chains that don't bind with heavy chains. Instead, they are put into your bloodstream.\n\nThere are two types of light chains: lambda and kappa light chains. You will usually have some of each in your blood. A free light chains test measures the amount of lambda and kappa free light chains in your blood.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nA free light chains test is used to measure the level of free light chains in the blood and compare the amount of kappa and lambda light chains. This ratio can help diagnose or monitor how well the treatment of plasma cell disorders is working.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Free Light Chains Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have symptoms of a plasma cell disorder, such as:\n\n* Bone pain, often in the back or ribs\n* Fractures (broken bones)\n* Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the arms or legs\n* Fatigue\n* Frequent infections and fevers\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Trouble breathing\n* Feeling very thirsty\n* Frequent urination\n* Tongue swelling\n* Purple spots on the skin\n\n**What Happens During a Free Light Chains Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a free light chains test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to a Free Light Chains Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour results will show the amounts of lambda and kappa free light chains in your blood. It will also provide a comparison between the two, called a ratio.\n\nIf your results were not normal, it may be a sign of a plasma cell disorder, such as:\n\n* Multiple myeloma.\n* Amyloidosis.\n* MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance).\n* Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a cancer of the white blood cells.\n\nYou may also have a higher level of free light chains if you have a kidney condition. In this case, a higher level may not mean that you have a plasma cell disorder.\n\nTo understand the results of a free light chains test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.\n\n---\n\n**Free Light Chains Test**\n\n**What is a Free Light Chains Test?**\n\nA free light chains test is a blood test used to detect abnormal proteins in the blood, specifically lambda and kappa free light chains.\n\n**Why is this test ordered?**\n\nThis test may be ordered if you have symptoms of a plasma cell disorder, such as:\n\n* Bone pain\n* Fractures (broken bones)\n* Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the arms or legs\n* Fatigue\n* Frequent infections and fevers\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Trouble breathing\n* Feeling very thirsty\n* Frequent urination\n* Tongue swelling\n* Purple spots on the skin\n\n**What happens during a free light chains test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

    "content": "**Free T4 Test**\n\nThe free T4 test measures the amount of thyroxine (T4) in your blood that is not attached to a protein. This hormone is produced by the thyroid gland and plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed for this test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour healthcare provider will inform you if you need to stop taking any medicines that may affect the test result. Certain supplements, including biotin (vitamin B7), can impact the results. If you're taking biotin, notify your provider.\n\nPregnancy and certain diseases, such as kidney and liver disease, can also influence the test outcomes.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some individuals may experience moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there might be some throbbing or a slight bruise, which usually subsides quickly.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour provider may recommend this test if you exhibit signs of a thyroid disorder, including:\n\n*   Abnormal findings in other thyroid blood tests, such as TSH or T3\n*   Symptoms of an overactive thyroid\n*   Symptoms of an underactive thyroid\n*   Hypopituitarism â€“ when the pituitary gland doesn't produce enough hormones, including the one that stimulates the thyroid\n*   A lump or nodule in the thyroid\n*   An enlarged or irregular thyroid gland\n*   Difficulty becoming pregnant\n\nThis test is also used to monitor individuals being treated for thyroid problems.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA typical normal range is 0.8 to 1.9 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) or 10.3 to 24.5 picomoles per liter (pmol/L).\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use distinct measurements or test different specimens. Discuss your specific test results with your provider.\n\nThe normal range is based on a large population and isn't necessarily normal for an individual. You might be experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism even if your free T4 is within the normal range. The TSH test can help determine if your symptoms are related to thyroid disease. Consult with your provider about your symptoms.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nTo fully comprehend the results of the free T4 test, consider the outcomes of other thyroid blood tests, such as TSH or T3.\n\nTest results may be influenced by pregnancy, estrogen levels, liver problems, more severe body-wide illnesses, and inherited changes in a protein that binds T4.\n\nA higher than normal level of T4 might be due to conditions involving an overactive thyroid, including:\n\n*   Graves' disease\n*   Taking excessive thyroid hormone medicine\n*   Thyroiditis\n*   Toxic goiter or toxic thyroid nodules\n*   Some tumors of the testes or ovaries (rare)\n*   Receiving medical imaging tests with contrast dye containing iodine (rare, and only if there's a thyroid issue)\n*   Consuming large amounts of foods rich in iodine (very rare, and only if there's a thyroid problem)\n\nA lower than normal level of T4 might be due to:\n\n*   Hypothyroidism (including Hashimoto disease and other disorders involving an underactive thyroid)\n*   Severe acute illness\n*   Malnutrition or fasting\n*   Use of certain medicines\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some individuals may be more challenging than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but might include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFree thyroxine test; Thyroxine test by equilibrium dialysis\n\n**References**\n\nFaix JD.

    "content": "**Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\n**What is Frequent or Urgent Urination?**\n\nFrequent urination means needing to urinate more often than usual. Urgent urination is a sudden, strong need to urinate. This causes a discomfort in your bladder. Urgent urination makes it difficult to delay using the toilet.\n\nA frequent need to urinate at night is called nocturia. Most people can sleep for 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCommon causes of these symptoms are:\n\n* Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n* Enlarged prostate in middle-aged and older men\n* Swelling and infection of the urethra\n* Vaginitis (swelling of or discharge from the vulva and vagina)\n* Nerve related problems\n* Caffeine intake\n\nLess common causes include:\n\n* Alcohol use\n* Anxiety\n* Bladder cancer (not common)\n* Spine problems\n* Diabetes that is not well controlled\n* Pregnancy\n* Interstitial cystitis\n* Medicines such as water pills (diuretics)\n* Overactive bladder syndrome\n* Radiation therapy to the pelvis, which is used to treat certain cancers\n* Stroke and other brain or nervous system diseases\n* Tumor or growth in the pelvis\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFollow the advice of your health care provider to diagnose and treat the cause of the problem.\n\nIt may help to write down the times when you urinate and the amount of urine you produce. Bring this record to your visit with the provider. This is called a voiding diary.\n\nIn some cases, you may have problems controlling urine (incontinence) for a period of time. You may need to take steps to protect your clothing and bedding.\n\nFor nighttime urination, avoid drinking too much fluid before going to bed. Cut down on the amount of liquids you drink that contain alcohol or caffeine.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if:\n\n* You have fever, back or side pain, vomiting, or shaking chills\n* You have increased thirst or appetite, fatigue, or sudden weight loss\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n* You have urinary frequency or urgency, but you are not pregnant and you are not drinking large amounts of fluid.\n* You have incontinence or you have changed your lifestyle because of your symptoms.\n* You have bloody or cloudy urine.\n* There is a discharge from the penis or vagina.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine culture\n* Cystometry or urodynamic testing (a measurement of the pressure within the bladder and the flow of urine)\n* Cystoscopy\n* Nervous system tests (for some urgency problems)\n* Ultrasound (such as an abdominal ultrasound or a pelvic ultrasound)\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the urgency and frequency. You may need to take antibiotics and medicine to ease your discomfort.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nUrgent urination; Urinary frequency or urgency; Urgency-frequency syndrome; Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome; Urge syndrome\n\n**References**\n\nConway B, Phelan PJ, Stewart GD.

Most people can sleep for 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCommon causes of these symptoms are:\n\n* Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n* Enlarged prostate in middle-aged and older men\n* Swelling and infection of the urethra\n* Vaginitis (swelling of or discharge from the vulva and vagina)\n* Nerve related problems\n* Caffeine intake\n\nLess common causes include:\n\n* Alcohol use\n* Anxiety\n* Bladder cancer (not common)\n* Spine problems\n* Diabetes that is not well controlled\n* Pregnancy\n* Interstitial cystitis\n* Medicines such as water pills (diuretics)\n* Overactive bladder syndrome\n* Radiation therapy to the pelvis, which is used to treat certain cancers\n* Stroke and other brain or nervous system diseases\n* Tumor or growth in the pelvis\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFollow the advice of your health care provider to diagnose and treat the cause of the problem.\n\nIt may help to write down the times when you urinate and the amount of urine you produce. Bring this record to your visit with the provider. This is called a voiding diary.\n\nIn some cases, you may have problems controlling urine (incontinence) for a period of time. You may need to take steps to protect your clothing and bedding.\n\nFor nighttime urination, avoid drinking too much fluid before going to bed. Cut down on the amount of liquids you drink that contain alcohol or caffeine.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if:\n\n* You have fever, back or side pain, vomiting, or shaking chills\n* You have increased thirst or appetite, fatigue, or sudden weight loss\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n* You have urinary frequency or urgency, but you are not pregnant and you are not drinking large amounts of fluid.\n* You have incontinence or you have changed your lifestyle because of your symptoms.\n* You have bloody or cloudy urine.\n* There is a discharge from the penis or vagina.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine culture\n* Cystometry or urodynamic testing (a measurement of the pressure within the bladder and the flow of urine)\n* Cystoscopy\n* Nervous system tests (for some urgency problems)\n* Ultrasound (such as an abdominal ultrasound or a pelvic ultrasound)\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the urgency and frequency. You may need to take antibiotics and medicine to ease your discomfort.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nUrgent urination; Urinary frequency or urgency; Urgency-frequency syndrome; Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome; Urge syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\n*   **Overactive bladder**: a condition where the bladder muscle becomes overactive and contracts too frequently, causing a sudden urge to urinate.\n*   **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: bacterial infections that can cause frequent or urgent urination, pain while urinating, and other symptoms.\n*   **Prostate problems**: enlarged prostate (BPH) or prostate cancer can compress the urethra and cause frequent or urgent urination.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\nTo diagnose the underlying cause of frequent or urgent urination, your doctor may perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and order diagnostic tests such as:\n\n*   **Urinalysis**: to check for UTIs or other conditions.\n*   **Imaging studies**: such as ultrasound or CT scans to visualize the urinary tract.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\nThe treatment of frequent or urgent urination depends on the underlying cause. Some possible treatments include:\n\n*   **Antibiotics**: for UTIs.\n*   **Alpha-blockers**: to relax the prostate muscle and improve urine flow.\n*   **Surgery**: in some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat underlying conditions such as an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Frequent or Urgent Urination**\n\nTo prevent frequent or urgent urination, you can take steps to maintain a healthy urinary tract. Some tips include:\n\n*   **Stay hydrated**: drinking enough water helps to flush out bacteria and other substances that can cause UTIs.\n*   **Avoid irritants**: certain foods and drinks, such as caffeine and spicy foods, can irritate the bladder and cause frequent or urgent urination.\n*   **Exercise regularly**: regular exercise can help to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor and improve bladder control.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   **Bladder Diseases**\n*   **Enlarged Prostate (BPH)**\n*   **Overactive Bladder**\n*   **Prostate Diseases**\n*   **Urinary Tract Infections**\n*   **Urine and Urination**",

    "content": "**Friedreich Ataxia**\n\nFriedreich ataxia is a rare disease passed down through families (inherited). It affects the muscles and heart.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFriedreich ataxia is caused by a defect in a gene called frataxin (FXN). Changes in this gene cause the body to make too much of a part of DNA called trinucleotide repeat (GAA). Normally, the body contains about 8 to 30 copies of GAA. People with Friedreich ataxia have as many as 1,000 copies. The more copies of GAA a person has, the earlier in life the disease starts and the faster it gets worse.\n\nFriedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means you must get a copy of the defective gene from both your mother and father.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms are caused by the wearing away of structures in areas of the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions. Symptoms most often begin before puberty. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Abnormal speech\n* Changes in vision, particularly color vision\n* Decrease in ability to feel vibrations in lower limbs\n* Foot problems, such as hammer toe and high arches\n* Hearing loss, this occurs in about 10% of people\n* Jerky eye movements\n* Loss of coordination and balance, which leads to frequent falls\n* Muscle weakness\n* No reflexes in the legs\n* Unsteady gait and uncoordinated movements (ataxia), which gets worse with time\n\nMuscle problems lead to changes in the spine. This may result in scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis.\n\nHeart disease most often develops and may lead to heart failure. Heart failure or dysrhythmias that do not respond to treatment may result in death. Diabetes may develop in later stages of the disease.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* ECG\n* Electrophysiological studies\n* EMG (electromyography)\n* Genetic testing\n* Nerve conduction tests\n* Muscle biopsy\n* X-ray, CT scan, or MRI of the head\n* X-ray of the chest\n* X-ray of the spine\n\nBlood sugar (glucose) tests may show diabetes or glucose intolerance. An eye exam may show damage to the optic nerve, which most often occurs without symptoms.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for Friedreich ataxia includes:\n\n* Counseling\n* Speech therapy\n* Physical therapy\n* Walking aids or wheelchairs\n\nOrthopedic devices (braces) may be needed for scoliosis and foot problems. Treating heart disease and diabetes help people live longer and improve their quality of life.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFriedreich ataxia slowly gets worse and causes problems doing everyday activities. Most people need to use a wheelchair within 15 years of the disease's start. The disease may lead to early death.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Heart failure or heart disease\n* Loss of ability to move around\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if symptoms of Friedreich ataxia occur, especially if there is a family history of the disorder.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPeople with a family history of Friedreich ataxia who intend to have children may want to consider genetic screening to determine their risk.\n\n---\n\n**Friedreich Ataxia**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFriedreich ataxia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system.

It is characterized by progressive damage to these systems, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, coordination problems, and speech difficulties.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Friedreich ataxia**\n\nThe exact cause of Friedreich ataxia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a genetic mutation that affects the production of a protein called frataxin. This mutation can be inherited from one's parents or occur spontaneously in some cases.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Friedreich ataxia**\n\nThe symptoms of Friedreich ataxia can vary widely from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n* Muscle weakness and stiffness\n* Coordination problems and balance issues\n* Speech difficulties and slurred speech\n* Difficulty with walking and maintaining posture\n* Decreased reflexes\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia**\n\nDiagnosing Friedreich ataxia typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. A genetic test can be used to detect the presence of the mutated gene that causes the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment and management of Friedreich ataxia**\n\nThere is currently no cure for Friedreich ataxia, but various treatments can help manage its symptoms and slow disease progression. These may include:\n\n* Physical therapy to improve mobility and strength\n* Speech therapy to improve communication skills\n* Medications to reduce muscle stiffness and spasms\n* Assistive devices such as walkers or wheelchairs\n\n\\n\\n**Genetic screening for Friedreich ataxia**\n\nPeople with a family history of Friedreich ataxia who intend to have children may want to consider genetic screening to determine their risk. This can help them make informed decisions about their reproductive choices.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\nMink JW. Movement disorders.

It is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, Melnick-Needles syndrome, and terminal osseous dysplasia.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nFrontometaphyseal dysplasia is distinguished from the other otopalatodigital spectrum disorders by the presence of joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of certain joints. People with frontometaphyseal dysplasia may also have bowed limbs, an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and abnormalities of the fingers and hands.\n\nCharacteristic facial features may include:\n\n* Prominent brow ridges\n* Wide-set and downward-slanting eyes\n* A very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia)\n* Small, missing, or misaligned teeth\n\nSome affected individuals have hearing loss.\n\n**Associated Health Problems**\n\nIn addition to skeletal abnormalities, individuals with frontometaphyseal dysplasia may have:\n\n* Obstruction of the ducts between the kidneys and bladder (ureters)\n* Heart defects\n* Constrictions in the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (the bronchi) that can cause problems with breathing\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are three types of frontometaphyseal dysplasia, known as type 1, type 2, and type 3. The three types differ in their genetic cause and the way they are inherited.\n\n---\n\n**Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia?**\n\nFrontometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare disorder that affects skeletal development and other health problems. It is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, Melnick-Needles syndrome, and terminal osseous dysplasia.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nPeople with frontometaphyseal dysplasia may have:\n\n* Joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of certain joints\n* Bowed limbs\n* An abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)\n* Abnormalities of the fingers and hands\n* Characteristic facial features, including:\n\t+ Prominent brow ridges\n\t+ Wide-set and downward-slanting eyes\n\t+ A very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia)\n\t+ Small, missing, or misaligned teeth\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants in the FLNA gene cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia type 1. Variants in the MAP3K7 gene cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia type 2, and TAB2 gene variants cause type 3.\n\nThe FLNA gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin A, which helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin A binds to another protein called actin, and helps the actin form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton.\n\nVariants in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with frontometaphyseal dysplasia. These mutations are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nWhen frontometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by variants in the FLNA gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The FLNA gene Â is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a variant in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\n\nWhen frontometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by variants in the MAP3K7 or TAB2 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nWhen frontometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by variants in the MAP3K7 or TAB2 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nWhen frontometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by variants in the FLNA gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The FLNA gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a variant in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\n\nA characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. Males with frontometaphyseal dysplasia type 1 generally have more severe signs and symptoms of the disorder than do females, who may show only the characteristic facial features.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* FMD\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Frontometaphyseal dysplasia 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Frontometaphyseal dysplasia 2\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Frontometaphyseal dysplasia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ FRONTOMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA 1; FMD1\n\t+ FRONTOMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA 2; FMD2\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Giuliano F, Collignon P, Paquis-Flucklinger V, Bardot J, Philip N.

It is similar to Alzheimer's disease, but tends to affect different parts of the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Frontotemporal Dementia**\n\nThe exact cause of FTD is unknown, but many abnormal genes have been found that can cause the disease. Some cases are passed down through families. FTD is rare and can occur in people as young as 20, but usually begins between ages 40 and 60.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Frontotemporal Dementia**\n\nThe disease gets worse slowly, with tissues in parts of the brain shrinking over time. Symptoms include behavior changes, speech difficulty, and problems with thinking. Early personality changes can help health care providers tell FTD apart from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Behavioral Changes:**\n\t+ Not able to keep a job\n\t+ Compulsive behaviors\n\t+ Impulsive or inappropriate behavior\n\t+ Inability to function or interact in social or personal situations\n\t+ Problems with personal hygiene\n\t+ Repetitive behavior\n\t+ Withdrawal from social interaction\n* **Emotional Changes:**\n\t+ Abrupt mood changes\n\t+ Decreased interest in daily living activities\n\t+ Failure to recognize changes in behavior\n\t+ Failure to show emotional warmth, concern, empathy, sympathy\n\t+ Inappropriate mood\n\t+ Not caring about events or environment\n* **Language Changes:**\n\t+ Cannot speak (mutism)\n\t+ Decreased ability to read or write\n\t+ Difficulty finding a word\n\t+ Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)\n\t+ Repeating anything spoken to them (echolalia)\n\t+ Shrinking vocabulary\n\t+ Weak, uncoordinated speech sounds\n* **Nervous System Problems:**\n\t+ Increased muscle tone (rigidity)\n\t+ Memory loss that gets worse\n\t+ Movement/coordination difficulties (apraxia)\n\t+ Weakness\n* **Other Problems:**\n\t+ Urinary incontinence\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be ordered to check for other causes of dementia, including dementia due to metabolic causes. FTD is diagnosed based on symptoms and results of tests, including:\n\n* Assessment of the mind and behavior (neuropsychological assessment)\n* Brain MRI\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* Examination of the brain and nervous system (neurological exam)\n* Examination of the fluid around the central nervous system (cerebrospinal fluid) after a lumbar puncture\n* Head CT scan\n* Tests of sensation, thinking and reasoning (cognitive function), and motor function\n* Positron emission tomography (PET) scan of brain\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for FTD. Medicines may help manage mood swings. Sometimes, people with FTD take the same medicines used to treat other types of dementia. In some cases, stopping or changing medicines that worsen confusion or that are not needed can improve thinking and other mental functions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of FTD by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe disorder steadily becomes worse, and the person becomes totally disabled early in the course of the disease.

Such medicines include:\n\n*   Analgesics\n*   Anticholinergics\n*   Central nervous system depressants\n*   Cimetidine\n*   Lidocaine\n\nIt is important to treat any disorders that can cause confusion. These include:\n\n*   Anemia\n*   Decreased blood oxygen (hypoxia) level\n*   Heart failure\n*   High blood carbon dioxide level\n*   Infections\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Liver failure\n*   Nutritional disorders\n*   Thyroid disorders\n*   Mood disorders, such as depression\n\nMedicines may be needed to control aggressive, dangerous, or agitated behaviors.\n\nBehavior modification can help some people control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. This consists of rewarding appropriate or positive behaviors and ignoring inappropriate behaviors (when it is safe to do so).\n\nTalk therapy (psychotherapy) does not always work. This is because it can cause further confusion or disorientation.\n\nReality orientation, which reinforces environmental and other cues, may help reduce disorientation.\n\nDepending on the symptoms and severity of the disease, monitoring and help with personal hygiene and self-care may be needed. Eventually, there may be a need for 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in a special facility. Family counseling can help the person cope with the changes needed for home care.\n\nCare may include:\n\n*   Adult protective services\n*   Community resources\n*   Homemakers\n*   Visiting nurses or aides\n*   Volunteer services\n\nPeople with FTD and their family may need to seek legal advice early in the course of the disorder. Advance care directive, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make decisions regarding the care of the person with FTD.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of FTD by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.

    "content": "**Frostbite**\n\n**What is Frostbite?**\n\nFrostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes.\n\n**Symptoms of Frostbite**\n\nIf you have frostbite, the skin in that area may turn white or grayish-yellow. It may feel firm or waxy when you touch it. The area will also feel numb.\n\n**What to Do If You Have Symptoms of Frostbite**\n\nIf you have symptoms of frostbite, seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available, here are steps to take:\n\n*   Get into a warm room as soon as possible.\n*   If possible, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.\n*   Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.\n*   You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example, use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers.\n*   Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage.\n*   Don't use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb, you could burn it.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nFrostbite can be prevented by avoiding exposure to cold temperatures. If you must work or play in the cold, dress warmly and take regular breaks to warm up.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nTreatment for frostbite usually involves rewarming the affected area slowly and carefully. In severe cases, amputation may be necessary.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nFrostbite can lead to other complications, such as chilblains or physical allergy.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nChilblains are a type of frostbite that affects the hands and feet. Physical allergy is a condition where the skin becomes sensitive to cold temperatures.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are currently conducting clinical trials to develop new treatments for frostbite.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent journal articles have discussed the use of skin organoid transplantation to promote tissue repair in frostbite, as well as the construction and validation of a risk prediction model for soldiers with frostbite.\n\n---\n\n**Frostbite**\n\n\\n\\n* **Organoid Transplantation**: n organoid transplantation promotes tissue repair with scarless in frostbite.\n* **Risk Prediction Model**: Construction and validation of a risk prediction model for soldiers with frostbite.\n* **The Occasional Frostbite**: Article about the occasional occurrence of frostbite.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Hypothermia\n* Winter Weather Emergencies\n\n**Preventing Frostbite and Hypothermia**\n\n* Frostbite (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* How to prevent frostbite and hypothermia (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\n* National Center for Environmental Health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health",

    "content": "**Frovatriptan**\n\n*pronounced as (froe va trip' tan)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFrovatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Frovatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels around the brain, blocking pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Frovatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFrovatriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take frovatriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take frovatriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Do not take more than three frovatriptan tablets in any 24-hour period.\n\nYou may take your first dose of frovatriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.\n\nCall your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after taking frovatriptan.\n\nIf you take frovatriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently. You should not take frovatriptan or any other headache medications for more than 10 days per month.

    "content": "**Frozen Shoulder - Aftercare**\n\nA frozen shoulder causes shoulder pain that leads to stiffness of your shoulder. Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time and can worsen before they get better.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nThe capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, it becomes stiff and the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder.\n\nFrozen shoulder may develop with no known cause. It can also occur in people who:\n\n* Are 40 to 70 years old (it's more common in women, but men can still get it)\n* Have thyroid disease, diabetes, or are going through menopause\n* Have a shoulder injury\n* Have had a stroke that makes them unable to use their arm\n* Have a cast on their arm that holds their arm in one position\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nSymptoms of frozen shoulder often follow this pattern:\n\nAt first, you have a lot of pain, which can come on abruptly even without an injury or trauma. The pain can worsen quickly even without aggravation. This is the inflammatory stage.\nYour shoulder can become very stiff and hard to move, even when the pain lessens. It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you. This is the freezing phase.\nFinally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end.\n\nIt can take a few months to go through each stage of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following:\n\n* Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint.\n* Refer you to a physical therapist.\n* Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include medicines to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint.\n* You may also need a shot of anti-inflammatory medicine or steroid directly into the joint to reduce the inflammation.\n\nMost people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nUsing moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness.\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**In Your Home**\n\nGet help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back.\n\n* Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.\n* Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.\n\nGet help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks.\n\nDo not lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength.\n\n**Shoulder Exercises**\n\nYou will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder.\n\nAt first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day.\nIt is more important to do the exercises often than to do them for a long time each time you do them.\nUse moist heat before the exercises to help lessen pain and increase movement.\nThe exercises should focus on stretching of the shoulder and range of motion.\nAvoid exercises to strengthen your shoulder until the range of motion has returned.\n\nSome of the exercises are:\n\n* Shoulder stretches\n* Pendulum\n* Wall crawl\n* Rope and pulley stretches\n* Movements to help with internal and external rotation, such as hand behind back\n\nYour provider or physical therapist will show you how to do these exercises.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\nThe pain in your shoulder is getting much worse even if you take pain medicine\nYou re-injure your arm or shoulder\nYour frozen shoulder is making you feel sad or depressed\n\n---\n\n**Frozen Shoulder - Aftercare**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In Your Home**\n\nGet help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back.\n\n*   Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.\n*   Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.\n*   Get help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks.\n\nDo not lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Shoulder Exercises**\n\nYou will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder.\n\nAt first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day.

The pain may be severe and prevent you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made just with a clinical exam when you are not able to rotate your shoulder.\n\nYou may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion.\n\nIt can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 9 months to a year for complete recovery. Physical therapy may be intense and needs to be done every day.\n\nLeft untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little residual loss of motion. However, your other medical conditions may make the process last longer.\n\nRisk factors for frozen shoulder, such as menopause, diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated.\n\nSurgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy.\n\nFollow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years.\n\nAfter surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you do not keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back.\n\n---\n\n**Frozen Shoulder**\n\nFrozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other.

It is characterized by the degeneration of the corneal endothelium, leading to vision problems and potentially blindness.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Fuchs dystrophy is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic factors. The risk of developing the condition increases with age, and it is more common in women.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Fuchs dystrophy can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   **Vision problems**: Cloudy vision, halos around lights, or difficulty seeing at night\n*   **Eye pain**: Pain or discomfort in the eye\n*   **Eye sensitivity to light**: Increased sensitivity to light\n*   **The feeling that something is in your eye when there is nothing there**: A sensation of having an object in the eye\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nFuchs dystrophy can be diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as:\n\n*   **Slit-lamp examination**: A detailed examination of the cornea using a specialized microscope\n*   **Corneal topography**: A test that maps the shape of the cornea\n*   **Visual acuity testing**: A test to measure vision\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known prevention for Fuchs dystrophy. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Cataract surgery**: Surgery to remove a cloudy lens (cataract) from the eye\n*   **Corneal transplant**: A surgical procedure to replace the damaged cornea with a healthy one\n*   **Other treatments**: Depending on the severity of the condition, other treatments such as medications or laser therapy may be recommended\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, contact your provider:\n\n*   Eye pain\n*   Eye sensitivity to light\n*   The feeling that something is in your eye when there is nothing there\n*   Vision problems such as seeing halos or cloudy vision\n*   Worsening vision\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for Fuchs dystrophy.

    "content": "**Fucosidosis**\n\nFucosidosis is a condition that affects many areas of the body, especially the brain. The symptoms of fucosidosis can vary from person to person.\n\n* Affected individuals have intellectual disabilities that worsen with age.\n* Over time, people with this condition tend to lose skills they had previously learned, such as sitting, standing, walking, or talking.\n* Additional signs and symptoms of fucosidosis can include:\n\t+ Slow growth\n\t+ Abnormal bone development (dysostosis multiplex)\n\t+ Rigid or stiff muscles (spasticity)\n\t+ Clusters of enlarged blood vessels that form small, dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas)\n\t+ Distinctive facial features that are often described as \"coarse\"\n\t+ Frequent respiratory infections\n\t+ An enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n\t+ Seizures\n\nIn the past, fucosidosis has been divided into two types based on the symptoms and age of onset. Type 1 was used to describe the more severe form of the disorder, with symptoms typically appearing in infancy. Type 2 was used to describe cases with milder symptoms and a slower progression. Currently, many researchers consider the condition to be a spectrum with a wide range in severity.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nFucosidosis is a rare condition. As of 2023, fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. The highest incidence of fucosidosis has been described in Italy, Cuba, and in certain populations of the Southwestern United States.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the FUCA1 gene cause fucosidosis. The FUCA1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase. This enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) that are attached to certain fats (glycolipids) and proteins (glycoproteins).\n\n---\n\n**Fucosidosis**\n\n**What is Fucosidosis?**\n\nFucosidosis is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in breaking down sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain fats (glycolipids) and proteins (glycoproteins).\n\n**How Does Fucosidosis Affect the Body?**\n\nIn fucosidosis, variants in the FUCA1 gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of alpha-L-fucosidase. As a result, glycolipids and glycoproteins accumulate within various cells and tissues throughout the body. Brain cells are particularly sensitive to this buildup, leading to neurological symptoms.\n\n**What is the Inheritance Pattern of Fucosidosis?**\n\nFucosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with fucosidosis typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for Fucosidosis**\n\nAlpha-L-fucosidase deficiency\nFucosidase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Fucosidosis\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Fucosidosis\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: FUCOSIDOSIS\n\n---\n\n**Fucosidosis**\n\nFucosidosis is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme fucosidase, which breaks down sugar molecules in the body. The disorder affects carbohydrate metabolism and can lead to various health problems.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of fucosidosis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's overall health. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Seizures\n* Intellectual disability\n* Delayed development\n* Muscle weakness\n* Joint problems\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the FUCA1 gene responsible for fucosidosis.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for fucosidosis, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Enzyme replacement therapy\n* Dietary modifications to reduce sugar intake\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility\n* Medications to control seizures and other symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with fucosidosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, some individuals may experience significant improvements in their quality of life, while others may require ongoing support and care.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nFucosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Carriers of the mutation may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the condition on to their children.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders\n* Genetic Brain Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Neurologic Diseases\n* Seizures\n\n**References**\n\n* Ben Turkia H, Tebib N, Azzouz H, Abdelmoula MS, Bouguila J, Sanhaji H, Miladi N, Maire I, Caillaud C, Kaabachi N, Ben Dridi MF.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/726.html",
    "content": "**Fucus Vesiculosus**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFucus vesiculosus is a type of brown seaweed that grows in the Baltic Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and North Pacific Ocean. The whole plant is used as medicine.\n\nIt contains varying amounts of iodine, which might help prevent or treat some thyroid disorders. Fucus vesiculosus also might have antidiabetic effects and affect hormone levels.\n\nPeople use Fucus vesiculosus for thyroid disorders, obesity, aging skin, constipation, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nDon't confuse Fucus vesiculosus with algin, bladderwort, blue-green algae, ecklonia cava, or laminaria. These are not the same.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThere is interest in using Fucus vesiculosus for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Fucus vesiculosus is possibly unsafe. It can contain high concentrations of iodine. Taking large amounts of iodine can cause or worsen some thyroid problems. It might also contain heavy metals, which can cause heavy metal poisoning.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Fucus vesiculosus is possibly safe.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n*   Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Fucus vesiculosus is possibly unsafe to use while pregnant or breast-feeding because it might contain iodine and heavy metals. Don't use it.\n*   Surgery: Fucus vesiculosus might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking Fucus vesiculosus at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n*   Thyroid disorders: Fucus vesiculosus may contain large amounts of iodine. Long-term use or high doses of iodine might make certain thyroid disorders worse. Also, people with autoimmune thyroid disease might be especially sensitive to the harmful effects of iodine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nAmiodarone (Cordarone)\nFucus vesiculosus and amiodarone both contain iodine. Taking fucus vesiculosus with amiodarone might increase the levels of iodine in the blood. Too much iodine in the blood can cause side effects that affect the thyroid.\n\nLithium\nFucus vesiculosus can contain large amounts of iodine. Large amounts of iodine can change thyroid function. Lithium can also change thyroid function. Taking Fucus vesiculosus along with lithium might increase the risk of thyroid function changes.\n\nMedications for an overactive thyroid (Antithyroid drugs)\nFucus vesiculosus can contain large amounts of iodine. Iodine can increase or decrease thyroid function. Taking Fucus vesiculosus along with medications for an overactive thyroid might change the effects of these medications.\n\nMedications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)\nFucus vesiculosus might slow blood clotting. Taking Fucus vesiculosus along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n\nThyroid hormone\nFucus vesiculosus contains iodine. Iodine can increase or decrease thyroid function. \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n*   Other seaweeds: Fucus vesiculosus may interact with other types of seaweed, such as kelp or dulse.\n*   Thyroid medications: Fucus vesiculosus may interact with thyroid medications, such as levothyroxine (T4) or liothyronine (T3).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nFucus vesiculosus may interact with certain foods, such as:\n\n*   Iodized salt: Consuming large amounts of iodized salt while taking Fucus vesiculosus may increase the risk of thyroid problems.\n*   Fish and seafood: Eating fish and seafood that are high in mercury or other heavy metals while taking Fucus vesiculosus may increase the risk of heavy metal poisoning.\n\n---\n\n**Fucus Vesiculosus: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Thyroid hormone**: Fucus vesiculosus contains iodine, which can increase or decrease thyroid function. Taking it with thyroid hormone medications might increase the effects of these medications.\n*   **Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) substrates)**: Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Fucus vesiculosus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications.\n*   **Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates)**: Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Fucus vesiculosus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications.\n*   **Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) substrates)**: Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Fucus vesiculosus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications.\n*   **Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)**: Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Fucus vesiculosus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting**: Fucus vesiculosus might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people.\n*   **Iodine-containing herbs and supplements**: Fucus vesiculosus contains iodine. Taking it with other products that contain iodine might cause iodine levels to go too high, leading to side effects such as changes in thyroid function.\n*   **Strontium**: Fucus vesiculosus contains alginate, which can reduce the absorption of strontium.

Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, seizures, or a decreased level of alertness.\n\nIf the person breathed in fumes, move them to fresh air right away.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* Name of the product, if known\n* Time it was swallowed\n* Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Fuel Oil Poisoning**\n\nIf you suspect someone has ingested fuel oil, call the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning who can give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n*   Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n*   Medicine to treat symptoms\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage)\n*   Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well someone does depends on how much fuel oil was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance is first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\nIf fuel oil gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and possibly permanent lung damage can occur.",

    "content": "**Fulvestrant Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFulvestrant injection is used alone or in combination with another chemotherapy medication to treat a certain type of hormone receptor positive, advanced breast cancer (breast cancer that depends on hormones such as estrogen to grow) or breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body in women who have experienced menopause (change of life; end of monthly menstrual periods) and have not previously been treated with an anti-estrogen medication such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex). Fulvestrant injection is also used alone or in combination with certain other chemotherapy medications to treat a certain type of hormone receptor positive, advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in adults whose cancer got worse during or after certain other treatments.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFulvestrant comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected slowly over 1 to 2 minutes into a muscle in the buttocks. Fulvestrant is administered by a doctor or nurse in a medical office. It is usually given once every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses (days 1, 15, and 29) and then once a month thereafter.

    "content": "**Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\nFundus albipunctatus is an eye disorder characterized by an impaired ability to see in low light (night blindness) and the presence of whitish-yellow flecks in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue in the inner lining of the back of the eye (the fundus). The flecks are detected during an eye examination.\n\n**Individuals with Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\nIndividuals with fundus albipunctatus experience night blindness from an early age. In particular, they have delayed dark adaptation, which means they have trouble adapting from bright light to dark conditions, such as when driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day. It often takes hours for adaptation to occur. Their vision in bright light is usually normal.\n\n**The Flecks**\n\nThe flecks are especially abundant near the outer edge (the periphery) of the retina. Their density varies among affected individuals; some people have numerous flecks that overlap, while others have fewer. For unknown reasons, the flecks get smaller or fade with age in some affected individuals, although night vision does not improve.\n\n**Other Eye Conditions**\n\nWhile fundus albipunctatus typically does not worsen (progress) over time, some individuals with the condition develop other eye conditions, such as breakdown of the central region of the retina known as the macula (macular degeneration) with loss of specialized light receptor cells called cones, which can affect vision in bright light.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nFundus albipunctatus is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFundus albipunctatus is primarily caused by mutations in the RDH5 gene. This gene is involved in a multi-step process called the visual cycle, by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are interpreted as vision.\n\n---\n\n**Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn rare cases, fundus albipunctatus is caused by mutations in other genes that play roles in the visual cycle. An integral operation of the visual cycle is the recycling of a molecule called 11-cis retinal, which is a form of vitamin A that is needed for the conversion of light to electrical signals.\n\n**The RDH5 Gene**\n\nThe RDH5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5, which performs one step in this recycling process. This enzyme converts a molecule called 11-cis retinol to 11-cis retinal.\n\n**Impact of RDH5 Gene Mutations**\n\nRDH5 gene mutations are thought to reduce or eliminate the function of the 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 enzyme, which results in a shortage of 11-cis retinal. Without this important molecule, electrical signals integral for vision are not stimulated, and vision is impaired.\n\n**Night Vision Impairment**\n\nFor vision in low-light conditions, the eyes primarily use 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 to generate 11-cis retinal, which is why a shortage of this enzyme's function impairs night vision.\n\n**Accumulation of Molecules**\n\nResearchers speculate that impairment of 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 also leads to the accumulation of 11-cis retinol and related molecules, forming the flecks characteristic of fundus albipunctatus.\n\n**Genes Associated with Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\n*   RDH5\n*   RPE65\n*   RLBP1\n\n---\n\n**Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\n**Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n\n*   Fundus albipunctatus is a rare genetic disorder that affects the retina.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Clinical trials for fundus albipunctatus are available on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   FUNDUS ALBIPUNCTATUS\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n*   Scientific articles on fundus albipunctatus can be found on PubMed.\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Pigmentary retinal dystrophy\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   FUNDUS ALBIPUNCTATUS\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Fundus Albipunctatus**\n\n\\n\\n* **Causes**: Fundus albipunctatus is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes.\n* **Symptoms**: The condition is characterized by a specific type of retinal degeneration, leading to vision loss.

    "content": "**Fungal Culture Test**\n\nA fungal culture test helps diagnose fungal infections. Fungal infections may happen if you are exposed to fungi (more than one fungus). Fungi are plant-like life forms, such as yeasts and molds. Fungi live everywhere:\n\n* Outdoors in air, soil and on plants\n* Indoors on surfaces and in the air\n* On your skin and inside your body\n\nUsually, if you are healthy, fungi will not make you sick. But many types of fungi can cause infections ranging from mild to life-threatening.\n\n**Fungal Culture Tests**\n\nFungal culture tests use different types of samples depending on the part of your body that's infected. Samples may include:\n\n* Skin cells\n* Blood\n* Urine (pee)\n* Other body fluid\n\nYour sample is sent to a lab and put in a dish with a special substance that helps grow any fungi in the sample. When there is enough material, it's checked under a microscope to see if it contains any fungi. Other tests may also be done to learn more about fungi in the sample.\n\n**Types of Fungal Infections**\n\nFungal infections may be grouped based on where they are in your body. These groups include:\n\n* **Superficial fungal infections**: These infections affect the surfaces of your body, including your skin, genital area, and nails.\n\t+ Ringworm (tinea)\n\t+ Yeast (candida)\n\nDeep and systemic fungal infections: These serious infections affect tissue deeper inside your body.\n\n* Aspergillosis\n* Histoplasmosis\n* Pneumocystis pneumonia\n* Invasive yeast infection (invasive candidiasis)\n* Sporotrichosis, or \"rose gardener's disease\"\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nFungal infections cause symptoms that can be a lot like bacterial and viral infections, but their treatment is different.

The most common samples are:\n\n* Skin scrapings or nail clippings\n* Body fluids (e.g., from the mouth, vagina, or an open skin sore)\n* Blood\n* Urine\n* Sputum Culture\n\n**How It's Done**\n\nYour provider will use a special tool to take a small sample of your skin or nails. In certain cases, a skin biopsy may be needed.\n\nFor body fluids:\n\n* Your provider will use a special swab to gather fluid and cells from your mouth, vagina, or an open skin sore.\n\nFor blood:\n\n* A health care professional will collect a blood sample. The sample is most often taken from a vein in your arm.\n\nFor urine:\n\n* You will collect a sterile sample of urine in a container, as instructed by your provider.\n\nFor sputum culture:\n\n* You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special container as instructed by your provider.\n\n**Many Types of Fungi Grow Slowly in the Lab**\n\nSo, your test results may not be ready for days or weeks.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations to test for a fungal infection.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having any of the fungal culture tests. If a sample of your skin is taken, you may have a little bleeding or soreness at the site. If you get a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nA positive test result means a fungus was found in your sample. You most likely have a fungal infection. Your test results will usually identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection.\n\nSometimes another test is done on your sample to help find out which type of medicine will kill the fungus or stop it from growing.\n\nA negative test result means that no fungi were found in your sample. Something else is probably causing your infection.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Fungal Culture Test?**\n\nIf you are being treated for a fungal infection, be sure to take all your medicine as prescribed, even if you feel better. Many fungal infections clear up within a few days to weeks, but some infections require months or even years of treatment.\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

(and other references)\n\n---\n\n**Fungal Culture Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Fungal Culture Test?**\n\nA fungal culture test, also known as a blood culture test, is used to diagnose fungal infections in the body. The test involves taking a sample of blood or other bodily fluid and culturing it in a laboratory to see if any fungi grow.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does a Fungal Culture Test Work?**\n\nThe process of a fungal culture test typically begins with a healthcare provider suspecting that a patient may have a fungal infection. They will then take a sample of the patient's blood or other bodily fluid, such as urine or sputum, and send it to a laboratory for testing.\n\nIn the laboratory, the sample is placed in a special medium that allows fungi to grow. The medium is then observed over time to see if any fungi appear. If fungi are present, they can be identified and tested to determine which type of fungus is causing the infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits of a Fungal Culture Test?**\n\nThe benefits of a fungal culture test include:\n\n*   **Accurate Diagnosis**: A fungal culture test provides an accurate diagnosis of fungal infections, allowing healthcare providers to develop effective treatment plans.\n*   **Early Detection**: The test can detect fungal infections early in their course, which is important for preventing serious complications and improving patient outcomes.\n*   **Identification of Fungal Types**: The test allows healthcare providers to identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection, which is essential for selecting the most effective treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Risks or Side Effects of a Fungal Culture Test?**\n\nThe risks or side effects of a fungal culture test are generally minimal and may include:\n\n*   **Pain or Discomfort**: The process of taking a blood sample can be painful or uncomfortable for some patients.\n*   **Allergic Reactions**: Some patients may experience allergic reactions to the materials used in the testing process.\n*   **False Negative Results**: There is a small risk of false negative results, which means that the test may not detect a fungal infection even if one is present.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When Should I Consider Getting a Fungal Culture Test?**\n\nYou should consider getting a fungal culture test if you are experiencing symptoms of a fungal infection, such as:\n\n*   **Fever**: A high fever can be a sign of a fungal infection.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling extremely tired or weak can be a symptom of a fungal infection.\n*   **Skin Lesions**: Skin lesions or rashes can be a sign of a fungal infection.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare provider to determine if a fungal culture test is necessary and to discuss any concerns you may have.",

Editorial team.\n\n**What is Fungal Arthritis?**\n\nFungal arthritis is a rare condition where a fungus infects the joint, leading to inflammation and damage. It can occur in any joint, but is most commonly found in the shoulder, knee, or hip.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of fungal arthritis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to:\n\n*   Trauma or surgery that allows fungi to enter the joint\n*   Weakened immune system, making it easier for fungi to infect the joint\n*   Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or liver disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of fungal arthritis can vary depending on the severity and location of the infection. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   Joint pain and stiffness\n*   Swelling and redness around the affected joint\n*   Fever and chills\n*   Fatigue and weakness\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing fungal arthritis can be challenging, as the symptoms are similar to those of other types of arthritis. A diagnosis is typically made through:\n\n*   Imaging tests, such as X-rays or MRI scans\n*   Laboratory tests, including blood cultures and joint fluid analysis\n*   Biopsy of the affected tissue\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for fungal arthritis usually involves a combination of antifungal medications and physical therapy to restore mobility and strength. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent fungal arthritis, taking steps to maintain good overall health can help reduce the risk of infection. This includes:\n\n*   Practicing good hygiene, especially after trauma or surgery\n*   Managing underlying medical conditions\n*   Getting regular check-ups with a healthcare provider",

    "content": "**Funnel-Web Spider Bite**\n\nThis article describes the effects of a bite from the funnel-web spider. Male funnel-web spider bites are more toxic than bites by females. The class of insects to which the funnel-web spider belongs, contains the largest number of venomous species known.\n\n**Warning: Do Not Use This Article for Treatment**\n\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage a bite from this type of spider. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nThe venom in the funnel-web spider contains the toxin called delta hetatoxin.\n\n**Where Found**\n\nSpecific types of funnel-web spiders are found in southeast Australia, around Sydney. Others are found in Europe, New Zealand, and Chile. They are not native to the United States, although some people may keep them as exotic pets. The webs that are built by this group of spiders consist of funnel-shaped tubes that extend into a protected space such as a hole in a tree or a burrow in the ground.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nFunnel-web spider bites are very painful and dangerous. They have been known to cause these symptoms in different parts of the body:\n\n* **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n\t+ Drooling\n\t+ Drooping eyelids\n\t+ Double vision\n\t+ Swallowing difficulty\n\t+ Tingling or numbness in the mouth or lips within 10 to 15 minutes\n* **HEART AND BLOOD**\n\t+ Collapse (shock)\n\t+ Rapid heart rate\n* **LUNGS**\n\t+ Difficulty breathing\n* **MUSCLES AND JOINTS**\n\t+ Joint pain\n\t+ Severe muscle spasms, usually in the legs and belly area\n* **NERVOUS SYSTEM**\n\t+ Agitation\n\t+ Confusion\n\t+ Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Numbness of mouth and lips\n\t+ Tremors (shaking)\n\t+ Shivering (chills)\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Heavy sweating\n\t+ Redness around the site of the bite\n* **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFunnel-web spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away. Call 911 or the Poison Control Center for guidance.\n\nImmediate treatment of a bite consists of the following 4 steps, which are modeled after the Australian snake bite treatment:\n\n1.

The wound will be treated as appropriate.\n\nThe person may receive:\n\n* Antivenin, a medicine to reverse the effects of the venom, if available\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFunnel-web spider bites can be life threatening, especially in children. They must be treated quickly with antivenin by an experienced provider. Even with appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks. The original bite may be small and may progress to a blood blister and look like a bull's eye. (This is similar to the appearance of a brown recluse spider bite.)\n\nThe area affected by the bite may become deeper.

This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n---\n\n**Furniture Polish Poisoning**\n\n**What is Furniture Polish Poisoning?**\n\nFurniture polish poisoning occurs when someone swallows or breathes in (inhales) liquid furniture polish.

    "content": "**Furosemide Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFurosemide injection is used in adults and children who cannot take medications by mouth or in emergency situations to treat edema (excess fluid held in body tissues) caused by various medical problems. Furosemide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFurosemide injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a muscle or into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital. Furosemide injection (FuroscixÂ®) comes in an on-body injector with a prefilled cartridge to be injected just under the skin at home.\n\nIf furosemide injection is given intramuscularly or intravenously to treat edema caused by various medical problems, it is usually given as a single dose or it may be given once or twice a day. Your dosing schedule will depend on your condition and on how you respond to treatment.\n\nFurosemide injection (FuroscixÂ®) is usually given in an on-body delivery system to be injected just under the skin over 5 hours. During this time, you will need to limit your activity and limit bending movements. You should notice an increased need to urinate starting about 1 hour after the injection begins. This may last up to 8 hours. Make sure that you have access to a bathroom for up to 8 hours after beginning the injection using the on-body injector.\n\nYour doctor may decide to allow you or a caregiver to perform the injections using the on-body delivery system at home. Your healthcare provider will show you how to prepare and perform the injections at home. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's instructions for use information for the patient. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use the on-body delivery system.\n\nCheck the cartridge to be sure that the expiration date printed on the cartridge has not passed. Look closely at the liquid in the cartridge. The liquid should be clear to slightly yellow and should not be cloudy or discolored. Do not drop the on-body injector or cartridge or allow the injector to get wet. After you apply the on-body injector, do not shower, bathe, swim, or do activities that will make you sweat when you are wearing the on-body injector. Call your pharmacist if there are any problems with the package or the cartridge and do not inject the medication.\n\nYou can apply the on-body injector on the abdomen (stomach area) on either side of your navel in a flat, hairless area above the belt line and below the rib cage. Choose a different spot each time you apply the on-body injector. Do not apply the on-body injector in an area directly under a belt or waistband. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply the on-body injector is clean, dry, and healthy. Do not apply the on-body injector to skin that is red, irritated, or not intact. Also do not apply the on-body injector to skin that you have recently treated with creams, lotions, oils, or other skin products. Dispose of used on-body delivery systems in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Furosemide Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **Administration**\n    *   Furosemide injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a muscle or into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital.\n    *   Furosemide injection (FuroscixÂ®) comes in an on-body injector with a prefilled cartridge to be injected just under the skin at home.\n*   **Dosage and Administration**\n    *   If furosemide injection is given intramuscularly or intravenously to treat edema caused by various medical problems, it is usually given as a single dose or it may be given once or twice a day.

About 1 in 10 African American males in the United States has it. G6PD deficiency mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. The most common medical problem it can cause is hemolytic anemia. That happens when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIf you have G6PD deficiency, you may not have symptoms. Symptoms happen if your red blood cells are exposed to certain chemicals in food or medicine, certain bacterial or viral infections, or stress. They may include:\n\n* Paleness\n* Jaundice\n* Dark urine\n* Fatigue\n* Shortness of breath\n* Enlarged spleen\n* Rapid heart rate\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nA blood test can tell if you have it. Treatments include medicines to treat infection, avoiding substances that cause the problem with red blood cells, and sometimes transfusions.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nAnemia, Nonspherocytic Hemolytic, Due to g6pd Deficiency  (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\nBlood Count Tests: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\nAlso in Spanish\nG6PD Deficiency (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)\nG6PD Test  (National Library of Medicine)\nAlso in Spanish\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Medical Encyclopedia)\nAlso in Spanish",

This deficiency:\n\n* Is a genetic disorder inherited from parent to child\n* Mainly affects men; women can be carriers of the defective gene without symptoms\n* Is more common in people of African, Mediterranean, or Asian descent\n\nG6PD deficiency can cause the destruction of your red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. When red blood cells are destroyed faster than your body can replace them, it's called hemolytic anemia.\n\nMost people with G6PD deficiency don't have symptoms until they're exposed to certain \"triggers\" that set off the destruction of red blood cells. Triggers include:\n\n* Fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (favism)\n* Viral infections\n* Bacterial infections\n* Certain antibiotics\n* Anti-malaria medicines\n* Other medicines, including NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA G6PD test checks if you have an inherited G6PD deficiency.\n\n**Why do I need a G6PD test?**\n\nYou may need a G6PD test if you have symptoms of hemolytic anemia, including:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Pale skin or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n* Rapid heart rate\n* Shortness of breath\n* Dark or yellow-orange colored urine\n\nYour newborn baby might need a G6PD test if they have jaundice that doesn't go away in two weeks and/or is not caused by another condition.

This enzyme helps break down a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called GABA when it is not needed.\n\n**How does GABA work in the brain?**\n\nGABA normally helps slow down (inhibit) brain cell activity when necessary, to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. For this reason, GABA is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n**What happens in GABA-transaminase deficiency?**\n\nMutations in the ABAT gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional GABA-transaminase enzyme. As a result, GABA is not properly broken down, so this neurotransmitter and another molecule called beta-alanine accumulate abnormally in brain cells.\n\n**What are the symptoms of GABA-transaminase deficiency?**\n\nThis accumulation alters the balance between the brain's neurotransmitters, leading to the neurological problems characteristic of GABA-transaminase deficiency. Excess GABA also leads to abnormal release of a protein that is necessary for growth of the body's bones and tissues (growth hormone), resulting in the accelerated linear growth that sometimes occurs in this disorder.\n\n**How is GABA-transaminase deficiency inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other names for GABA-transaminase deficiency**\n\n* 4 alpha aminobutyrate transaminase deficiency\n* ABAT deficiency\n* GABA transaminase deficiency\n* GABA transferase deficiency\n* GABA-T deficiency\n* Gamma aminobutyrate transaminase deficiency\n* Gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency\n* Gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase deficiency\n* Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency\n\n**References**\n\n* Besse A, Petersen AK, Hunter JV, Appadurai V, Lalani SR, Bonnen PE.

This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GM3 synthase, which carries out a chemical reaction that is the first step in the production of molecules called gangliosides.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nGM3 synthase deficiency appears to be a rare condition. About 50 cases have been reported, mostly from Old Order Amish communities.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Learn more about the gene associated with GM3 synthase deficiency**\n\nThe ST3GAL5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GM3 synthase.

    "content": "**Gabapentin**\n\n*pronounced as (ga' ba pen tin)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are used along with other medications to help control certain types of seizures in people who have epilepsy. Gabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are also used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; the burning, stabbing pain or aches that may last for months or years after an attack of shingles). Gabapentin extended-release tablets (Horizant) are used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS; a condition that causes discomfort in the legs and a strong urge to move the legs, especially at night and when sitting or lying down).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGabapentin comes as a capsule, a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Gabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are usually taken with a full glass of water (8 ounces [240 milliliters]), with or without food, three times a day.\n\nThese medications should be taken at evenly spaced times throughout the day and night; no more than 12 hours should pass between doses. The extended-release tablet (Horizant) is taken with food once daily at about 5 PM. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take gabapentin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nGabapentin extended-release tablets cannot be substituted for another type of gabapentin product. Be sure that you receive only the type of gabapentin that was prescribed by your doctor. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of gabapentin you were given.\n\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not cut, chew, or crush them.\n\nIf your doctor tells you to take one-half of a regular tablet as part of your dose, carefully split the tablet along the score mark. Use the other half-tablet as part of your next dose. Properly dispose of any half-tablets that you have not used within several days of breaking them.\n\nIf you are taking gabapentin to control seizures or PHN, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of gabapentin and gradually increase your dose as needed to treat your condition. If you are taking gabapentin to treat PHN, tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during your treatment.\n\nGabapentin may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take gabapentin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking gabapentin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking gabapentin tablets, capsules, or oral solution, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, pain, and sweating. If you are taking gabapentin to treat seizures and you suddenly stop taking the medication, you may experience seizures more often.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with gabapentin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Gabapentin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Take Gabapentin**\n\nTake gabapentin exactly as directed by your doctor.

If you are taking gabapentin to treat PHN, tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during your treatment.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nGabapentin is also sometimes used to relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy (numbness or tingling due to nerve damage in people who have diabetes), and to treat and prevent hot flashes (sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) in women who are being treated for breast cancer or who have experienced menopause (''change of life'', the end of monthly menstrual periods). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Gabapentin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Before Taking Gabapentin**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to gabapentin, any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in the type of gabapentin you plan to take. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the inactive ingredients.\n*   You should know that gabapentin is available in different forms that may be prescribed for different uses. Ask your doctor to be sure that you are not taking more than one product that contains gabapentin.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking gabapentin. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   If you are taking antacids such as Maalox or Mylanta, take them at least 2 hours before you take gabapentin tablets, capsules, or solution.\n*   The following nonprescription products may interact with gabapentin: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking gabapentin. Do not start any of these medications while taking gabapentin without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung or kidney disease. If you will be taking the extended-release tablets, also tell your doctor if you need to sleep during the day and stay awake at night.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking gabapentin, call your doctor.\n*   If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking gabapentin.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   This medication may make you drowsy or dizzy, may slow your thinking, and may cause loss of coordination. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you, and your doctor agrees that it is safe for you to begin these activities.\n*   If you are giving gabapentin to your child, you should know that your child's behavior and mental abilities may change while he or she is taking gabapentin. Your child may have sudden changes in mood, become hostile or hyperactive, have difficulty concentrating or paying attention, or be drowsy or clumsy. Have your child avoid activities that could be dangerous, such as riding a bicycle, until you know how gabapentin affects him or her.\n*   Remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts**\n\n*   You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking gabapentin for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as gabapentin to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication.\n\n**Dietary Instructions**\n\n*   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n---\n\n**Gabapentin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take gabapentin capsules, tablets, or oral solution, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose or if you forget to take gabapentin extended-release tablets, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nGabapentin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* drowsiness\n* tiredness or weakness\n* dizziness\n* headache\n* uncontrollable shaking of a part of your body\n* double or blurred vision\n* unsteadiness\n* anxiety\n* memory problems\n* strange or unusual thoughts\n* unwanted eye movements\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* heartburn\n* diarrhea\n* dry mouth\n* constipation\n* increased appetite\n* weight gain\n* swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* back or joint pain\n* fever\n* runny nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat, or flu-like symptoms\n* ear pain\n* red, itchy eyes (sometimes with swelling or discharge)\n\nSome side effects may be serious.

A low level of this substance can lead to serious health problems if not treated.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed for the test.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis is a screening test for galactosemia. Every state in the United States provides newborn screening tests to check for this disorder.\n\n**What are the Risks of the Test?**\n\nThere is little risk in taking blood from an infant. Veins and arteries vary in size from one infant to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some infants may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin, causing bruising)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**What do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAn abnormal result suggests galactosemia. Further tests must be done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIf your child has galactosemia, a genetics specialist should be consulted promptly. The child should be put on a no-milk diet right away. This means no breast milk and no animal milk. Soy milk and infant soy formulas are generally used as substitutes.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is less than 24.5 nmol/hour/mg of hemoglobin. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n---\n\n**Galactose-1-phosphate Uridyltransferase Blood Test**\n\n**What is the Galactose-1-phosphate Uridyltransferase Blood Test?**\n\nThis test checks for a genetic disorder called galactosemia in newborns. It measures the level of an enzyme called GALT, which helps break down a type of sugar called galactose.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some infants may feel moderate pain, while others may only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be slight bruising, but this usually goes away quickly.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is performed as a screening test for galactosemia. Galactosemia is a serious condition that can cause clouding of the lens of the eye, scarring of the liver, failure to thrive, yellow color of the skin or eyes, and intellectual disability if left untreated.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range for this test is less than 24.5 nmol/hour/mg of hemoglobin. However, normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs, so it's essential to talk to your healthcare provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAn abnormal result suggests galactosemia, and further tests must be done to confirm the diagnosis. If your child has galactosemia, a genetics specialist should be consulted promptly, and the child should be put on a no-milk diet right away. This means no breast milk and no animal milk, with soy milk or infant soy formulas used as substitutes.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in taking blood from an infant, but other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight and may include excessive bleeding, multiple punctures to locate veins, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection.\n\n---\n\n**Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase blood test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver disease, cataracts, and mental retardation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is galactosemia diagnosed?**\n\nThe galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase blood test is used to diagnose galactosemia. This test measures the levels of a specific enzyme in the blood that helps break down galactose. If the enzyme is not functioning properly, it can indicate a problem with galactose metabolism.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of galactosemia?**\n\nThe symptoms of galactosemia can vary depending on the severity of the disorder and whether treatment has been started. They may include:\n\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Abdominal distension\n*   Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n*   Cataracts\n*   Seizures\n*   Developmental delays\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is galactosemia treated?**\n\nGalactosemia can be treated with a special diet that eliminates milk and other dairy products.

    "content": "**Galactosemia Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Galactosemia Test?**\n\nA galactosemia test is a blood test given to newborns to check for a rare genetic metabolic disorder called galactosemia. Metabolic disorders affect metabolism, the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Galactosemia can be inherited (passed down through families), but to have the condition, your baby has to receive the gene from both parents. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia prevents a baby's body from breaking down a simple sugar called galactose. Galactose is in many foods, including:\n\n*   Milk, milk-based baby formulas, and dairy products. These foods contain lactose, which is made up of galactose and glucose, another type of sugar.\n*   Some fruits and vegetables.\n*   Breast milk.\n\nNormally, certain enzymes (proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body) break down galactose. Galactosemia happens when a genetic change affects the function of these enzymes. There are three types of galactosemia. The types are based on which enzyme is affected:\n\n*   GALT (galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase) deficiency, also known as classic galactosemia. It is the most common and severe form of the disorder.\n*   GALK (galactose kinase) deficiency.\n*   GALE (galactose epimerase) deficiency.\n\nIf a baby with a GALT, GALK, or GALE deficiency eats food with galactose, high levels of galactose and its byproducts build up in their blood. This can lead to serious health problems. These include liver disease, kidney failure, brain damage, and even death. But with early diagnosis and treatment, children with galactosemia can live healthy lives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Galactosemia Test Used For?**\n\nA galactosemia test is used to help diagnose galactosemia in a baby. It may also help identify whether it is a GALT, GALK, or GALE deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why Does My Baby Need a Galactosemia Test?**\n\nNewborns in the United States are required to get this test as part of a newborn screening. A newborn screening is a simple blood test that checks for various serious diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During a Galactosemia Test?**\n\nA health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke their heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Any Risks to This Test?**\n\nYour baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour baby's results will be either positive or negative for galactosemia.\n\nIf the results are negative, your child doesn't have the disorder.\n\nIf the results are positive, your baby will probably need more testing to confirm the diagnosis. These may include other blood tests, urine tests, and genetic tests.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Galactosemia Test?**\n\nThere is no cure for galactosemia. Infants diagnosed with the disorder can be fed soy formula or certain other lactose-free formulas. Children with classic galactosemia (GALT) must keep a special diet that avoids all milk and products that contain milk. They may need to take a calcium supplement to get enough calcium. Children with GALK and GALE deficiencies may be able to include a limited amount of dairy in their diets.\n\nIf your child has one of these deficiencies, talk to your child's provider about planning a safe and healthy diet in infancy and as your child grows up. Children with these deficiencies will probably need to stay on special diets for the rest of their lives.\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia Tests**\n\n**What is a galactosemia test?**\n\nA newborn screening is a simple blood test that checks for various serious diseases. Newborns in the United States are required to get this test as part of a newborn screening.\n\n**Who needs to take a galactosemia test?**\n\nSome older infants may need testing if they were adopted from another country and have symptoms of galactosemia. These symptoms can include:\n\n* Vomiting\n* Poor weight gain\n* Refusal to eat\n* Irritability\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n\nThe symptoms often go away once your child begins avoiding galactose in their diet.\n\n**What happens during a galactosemia test?**\n\nA health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke their heel with a small needle.

This test involves a physical examination, laboratory tests (such as a complete blood count and liver function tests), and genetic testing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Your Lab Results**\n\nWhen your lab results come back, you may be wondering what they mean. Here's a brief explanation:\n\n* **Galactose-1-phosphate**: This is the substance measured in the screening test. Elevated levels indicate galactosemia.\n* **Liver function tests**: These tests check for liver damage or dysfunction, which can occur in untreated galactosemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What You Need to Know About Blood Testing**\n\nBlood testing is a crucial part of diagnosing and managing galactosemia. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* **Sample collection**: A blood sample is collected from the newborn's heel or arm.\n* **Testing process**: The blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Importance of Early Detection**\n\nEarly detection of galactosemia is crucial for preventing long-term complications. If left untreated, galactosemia can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage and mental retardation.",

It is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas. The signs and symptoms of galactosemia result from an inability to use galactose to produce energy.\n\n**Types of Galactosemia**\n\nResearchers have identified several types of galactosemia. These conditions are each caused by mutations in a particular gene and affect different enzymes involved in breaking down galactose.\n\n* **Classic Galactosemia (Type I)**: The most common and most severe form of the condition.\n\t+ If infants with classic galactosemia are not treated promptly with a low-galactose diet, life-threatening complications appear within a few days after birth.\n\t+ Affected infants typically develop feeding difficulties, lethargy, failure to thrive, jaundice, liver damage, and abnormal bleeding.\n\t+ Other serious complications of this condition can include sepsis, shock, delayed development, cataract, speech difficulties, and intellectual disability.\n\t+ Females with classic galactosemia may develop reproductive problems caused by an early loss of function of the ovaries (premature ovarian insufficiency).\n* **Galactosemia Type II (Galactokinase Deficiency)**: Causes fewer medical problems than the classic type.\n\t+ Affected infants develop cataracts but otherwise experience few long-term complications.\n* **Galactosemia Type III (Galactose Epimerase Deficiency)**: Varies from mild to severe and can include cataracts, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, liver disease, and kidney problems.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe frequency of galactosemia is not well established due to the rarity of the condition. However, it is estimated that 1 in 60,000 newborns are affected by classic galactosemia.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGalactosemia is caused by mutations in specific genes that affect the enzymes involved in breaking down galactose.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nGalactosemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Classic galactosemia: also known as type I\n* Galactosemia type II: also called galactokinase deficiency\n* Galactosemia type III: also called galactose epimerase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on galactosemia, please visit the following resources:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n* American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\n\n**References**\n\nPlease note that references are not provided in this cleaned output as they were not relevant to the content.\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia**\n\n**What is Galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia is a disorder that affects how the body processes a simple sugar called galactose.

These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that are essential for processing galactose obtained from the diet.\n\n* **GALT Gene**: Mutations in this gene cause classic galactosemia (type I). Most of these genetic changes almost completely eliminate the activity of the enzyme produced from the GALT gene, preventing the normal processing of galactose and resulting in the life-threatening signs and symptoms of this disorder.\n* **GALK1 Gene**: Mutations in this gene result in galactosemia type II (galactokinase deficiency).\n* **GALE Gene**: Mutations in this gene underlie galactosemia type III (galactose epimerase deficiency).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nClassic galactosemia occurs in 1 in 30,000 to 60,000 newborns. Galactosemia type II and type III are less common; type II probably affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 newborns and type III appears to be very rare.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of galactosemia result from an inability to use galactose to produce energy. They can include:\n\n* **Feeding difficulties**\n* **Lack of energy (lethargy)**\n* **Failure to gain weight and grow as expected (failure to thrive)**\n* **Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)**\n* **Liver damage**\n* **Abnormal bleeding**\n* **Delayed development**\n* **Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract)**\n* **Speech difficulties**\n* **Intellectual disability**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPrompt treatment with a low-galactose diet is essential to prevent life-threatening complications.\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia**\n\n**What is Galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to process galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products.

    "content": "**Galactosemia**\n\nGalactosemia is a condition where the body cannot use (metabolize) the simple sugar galactose.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGalactosemia is an inherited disorder passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene, each child has a 25% chance of being affected. There are three forms:\n\n*   **Classic Galactosemia**: Most common and severe form due to GALT deficiency\n*   **Galactokinase Deficiency**\n*   **Galactose-6-phosphate Epimerase Deficiency**\n\nPeople with galactosemia cannot break down galactose, which is half of lactose in milk. If an infant consumes milk, substances build up and damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants show symptoms within days if fed formula or breast milk containing lactose:\n\n*   Convulsions\n*   Irritability\n*   Lethargy\n*   Poor feeding (refuses milk-based formula)\n*   Poor weight gain\n*   Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n*   Vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose galactosemia:\n\n*   Blood culture for E coli sepsis\n*   Enzyme activity in red blood cells\n*   Ketones in urine\n*   Prenatal diagnosis by measuring GALT enzyme\n*   \"Reducing substances\" in infant's urine, normal or low blood sugar while consuming lactose-containing formula\n\nNewborn screening tests check for galactosemia in many states.\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia**\n\n**Causes**\n\nGalactosemia is an inherited disorder passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene that can cause galactosemia, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected with it.\n\nThere are three forms of the disease:\n\n* Galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency: Classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form\n* Deficiency of galactose kinase (GALK)\n* Deficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase (GALE)\n\nPeople with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up one half of lactose, the sugar found in milk.\n\nIf an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.\n\nPeople with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants with galactosemia may show symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. They may develop a serious blood infection with the bacteria E coli.\n\nSymptoms of galactosemia are:\n\n* Convulsions\n* Irritability\n* Lethargy\n* Poor feeding - baby refuses to eat formula containing milk\n* Poor weight gain\n* Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Vomiting\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia**\n\n**What is Galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose. This condition can lead to serious health complications if left untreated.\n\n**Symptoms of Galactosemia**\n\nInfants with galactosemia may show symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. These symptoms include:\n\n* Convulsions\n* Irritability\n* Lethargy\n* Poor feeding - baby refuses to eat formula containing milk\n* Poor weight gain\n* Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests to check for galactosemia include:\n\n* Blood culture for bacterial infection (E coli sepsis)\n* Enzyme activity in the red blood cells\n* Ketones in the urine\n* Prenatal diagnosis by directly measuring the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase\n* \"Reducing substances\" in the infant's urine, and normal or low blood sugar while the infant is being fed breast milk or a formula containing lactose\n\nIn many states, newborn screening tests check for galactosemia.\n\n**Test Results**\n\nTest results may show:\n\n* Amino acids in the urine or blood plasma\n* Enlarged liver\n* Fluid in the abdomen\n* Low blood sugar\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with this condition must avoid all milk, products that contain milk (including dry milk), and other foods that contain galactose, for life. Read product labels to make sure you or your child with the condition are not eating foods that contain galactose.\n\nInfants can be fed:\n\n* Soy formula\n* Another lactose-free formula\n* Meat-based formula or Nutramigen (a protein hydrolysate formula)\n\nCalcium supplements are recommended.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with galactosemia and their families can be found at:\n\nGalactosemia Foundation -- www.galactosemia.org\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople who are diagnosed early and strictly avoid milk products and other foods that contain lactose can live a relatively normal life. However, mild mental impairment may develop, even in people who avoid galactose.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications can develop:\n\n* Cataracts\n* Cirrhosis of the liver\n* Delayed speech development\n* Irregular menstrual periods, reduced function of ovaries leading to ovarian failure and infertility\n* Mental disability\n* Severe infection with bacteria (E coli sepsis)\n* Tremors (shaking) and uncontrollable motor functions\n* Death (if there is galactose in the diet)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n* Your infant has galactosemia symptoms\n* You have a family history of galactosemia and are considering having children\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIt is helpful to know your family history. If you have a family history of galactosemia and want to have children, genetic counseling will help you make decisions about pregnancy and prenatal testing. Once the diagnosis of galactosemia is made, genetic counseling is recommended for other members of the family.\n\nMany states screen all newborns for galactosemia. If the newborn test shows possible galactosemia, they should contact the child's provider right away for advice about giving their infant milk products. They should also ask the provider about having blood tests that can be done to confirm a diagnosis of galactosemia.\n\n---\n\n**Galactosemia**\n\n**What is Galactosemia?**\n\nGalactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. There are three main types of galactosemia: classic galactosemia, galactosemia type II (also known as Duarte variant), and galactosemia type III.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGalactosemia is caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes needed to break down galactose. The most common enzyme deficiency is in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, which is responsible for converting galactose into glucose.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of galactosemia can vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. They may include:\n\n* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Failure to thrive\n* Seizures\n* Developmental delays\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nGalactosemia is typically diagnosed in newborns through a screening test that checks for elevated levels of galactose-1-phosphate in the blood. If the test is positive, further testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for galactosemia involves avoiding milk and other dairy products that contain lactose, a sugar that can cause symptoms to worsen. A special formula or diet may also be recommended to ensure that the child receives all the necessary nutrients.\n\n**References**\n\nBonnardeaux A, Bichet DG.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699058.html",
    "content": "**Galantamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGalantamine is used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD; a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and the ability to think, learn, communicate and handle daily activities). Galantamine is in a class of medications called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It works by increasing the amount of a certain natural substance in the brain that is needed for memory and thought. Galantamine may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities in people who have AD. However, galantamine will not cure AD or prevent the loss of mental abilities at some time in the future.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGalantamine comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablets and liquid are usually taken twice a day, preferably with the morning and evening meals. The extended-release capsules are usually taken once a day in the morning. Take galantamine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take galantamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not crush or chew them.\n\nGalantamine may upset your stomach, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Take galantamine with food and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water every day. This may decrease the chance that you will have an upset stomach during your treatment.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of galantamine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 4 weeks.\n\nContinue to take galantamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking galantamine without talking to your doctor. If you do stop taking galantamine for a few days or longer, call your doctor before you start to take galantamine again. Your doctor will probably tell you to start with the lowest dose of galantamine and gradually increase your dose to the dose you had been taking.\n\n**Before Taking Galantamine Oral Solution**\n\nBefore you take galantamine oral solution for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to take the oral solution. To take the oral solution, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the child-proof cap by pushing the cap down while turning it to the left.\n2. Remove the cap.\n3. Pull the pipette (the tube that you use to measure the dose of galantamine) out of its case.\n4. Place the pipette fully into the bottle of galantamine.\n5. While holding the bottom ring of the pipette, pull the pipette plunger up to the marking that shows the dose your doctor prescribed.\n6. Hold the bottom ring of the pipette and remove the pipette from the bottle. Be careful not to push the plunger in.\n7. Prepare 3 to 4 ounces (about 1/2 cup [90 to 120 milliliters]) of any non-alcoholic beverage.\n8. Empty all the medicine from the pipette into the beverage by pushing the plunger all the way in.\n9. Stir the beverage well.\n10. Drink all of the mixture right away.\n11. Put the plastic cap back on the bottle of galantamine and turn the cap to the right to close the bottle.\n12. Rinse the empty pipette by putting its open end into a glass of water, pulling the plunger out, and pushing the plunger in to remove the water.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Take galantamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not crush or chew them.\n*   Galantamine may upset your stomach, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Take galantamine with food and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water every day.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore galantamine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze galantamine oral solution. Throw away any unused galantamine oral solution after 2 months or when the expiration date on the label has passed.\n\n---\n\n**Galantamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Before You Take Galantamine**\n\n*   Your doctor will probably tell you to start with the lowest dose of galantamine and gradually increase your dose to the dose you had been taking.\n*   Before you take galantamine oral solution for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it.

    "content": "**Gallbladder Cancer**\n\n**What is Gallbladder Cancer?**\n\nYour gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver that stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through the common bile duct, which connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.\n\nCancer of the gallbladder is rare, but it's more common in women and Native Americans.

    "content": "**Gallbladder Disease**\n\n**What is the Gallbladder?**\n\nThe gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ located under the liver. It stores bile, a fluid produced by the liver to digest fat.\n\n**How Does the Gallbladder Function?**\n\nAs food passes through the stomach and intestines, the gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine through the common bile duct. This process helps break down fats for proper digestion.\n\n**What are the Common Problems with the Gallbladder?**\n\nThe most common issue is a blockage in the flow of bile due to a gallstone. These stones form when substances in bile harden. In rare cases, cancer can develop in the gallbladder.\n\n**Can I Live Without a Gallbladder?**\n\nFortunately, yes! Many gallbladder problems can be resolved by removing the gallbladder. The liver will continue to produce bile, which can reach the small intestine through other means.\n\n**Start Here**\n\n* Biliary Tract Disorders, Gallbladder Disorders, and Gallstone Pancreatitis (American College of Gastroenterology)\n* Overview of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disorders (Merck & Co., Inc.)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Abdominal Ultrasound (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)  (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n* Humble Gallbladder (Harvard Medical School)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* Cholecystectomy (Johns Hopkins Medicine)\n* Gallbladder Removal: Laparoscopic Method (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n\n---\n\n**Gallbladder Disease**\n\nBile has other ways of reaching your small intestine.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Abdominal Ultrasound**: A diagnostic test that uses sound waves to create images of the gallbladder.\n*   **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: A procedure that uses a flexible tube with a camera and balloon on the end to diagnose and treat problems in the bile ducts.\n*   **Hepatobiliary Nuclear Medicine**: A test that uses small amounts of radioactive material to create images of the gallbladder.\n*   **Laparoscopy**: A surgical procedure that involves making small incisions in the abdomen to insert a camera and instruments to diagnose and treat problems in the gallbladder.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n*   **Humble Gallbladder**: An article from Harvard Medical School discussing the importance of maintaining good health habits to prevent gallbladder disease.\n*   **Risk Factors**: Certain factors, such as obesity, family history, and age, can increase the risk of developing gallbladder disease.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **Cholecystectomy**: A surgical procedure that involves removing the gallbladder.
