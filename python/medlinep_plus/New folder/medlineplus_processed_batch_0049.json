    "content": "**Culture - Colonic Tissue**\n\nA colonic tissue culture is a lab test to check for the cause of disease. The sample of tissue for the test is taken from the large intestine during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe health care provider removes a piece of tissue from your large intestine. This is done during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n\n*   The sample is sent to a lab.\n*   It is placed in a special dish that contains a gel. Bacteria and other organisms can grow in this gel. The dish is then stored at a certain temperature.\n*   The lab team checks the sample daily. They check to see if bacteria, viruses, or fungi have grown.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no specific preparation needed for a culture itself. However, you will have to prepare for the sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy if that is how your provider is getting the tissue sample. Speak with your provider about how to prepare.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour providerÂ may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a large intestine infection. Colonic tissue culture is only done occasionally. More often, tests are done on stool to identify a large intestine infection. A colonic tissue culture is most often done only when other tests, such as a stool culture, could not identify the cause of infection.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means that no disease-causing organisms have grown in the lab dish.\n\nSome \"healthy\" bacteria, called bowel flora, are normally found in the gut. The growth of such bacteria during this test does not mean there is an infection.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about your test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal result means that disease-causing organisms have grown in the lab dish. These organisms may include:\n\n*   Clostridioides difficile bacteria\n*   Cytomegalovirus\n*   Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria\n*   Salmonella bacteria\n*   Shigella bacteria\n\nThese organisms may lead to colon infections or diarrhea.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is very minimal risk associated with the procedure. In rare cases, excessive bleeding could occur when a tissue sample is taken.\n\n---\n\n**Culture - Colonic Tissue**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe health care provider removes a piece of tissue from your large intestine.

    "content": "**Culture-negative Endocarditis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Culture-negative Endocarditis?**\n\nCulture-negative endocarditis is an infection and inflammation of the lining of one or more heart valves, but in which no endocarditis-causing germs (typically bacteria) can be found in a routine blood culture (most often 2 or 3 cultures are done when endocarditis is suspected). This is because certain germs do not grow well in a lab setting, or some people have received antibiotics in the past that keep such germs from growing outside of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does Endocarditis occur?**\n\nEndocarditis is usually a result of a bloodstream infection. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream during certain medical procedures, including dental procedures or through intravenous injection using non-sterile needles. Then bacteria can travel to the heart, where they can settle on heart valves.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Endocarditis (culture-negative)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Baddour LM, Anavekar NS, Crestanello JA, Wilson WR.

This can occur when the causative microorganism is not readily cultivable, or when the infection is caused by a fungus or other non-bacterial agent.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risk Factors and Symptoms**\n\n*   **Underlying medical conditions**: Patients with certain underlying medical conditions, such as intravenous drug abuse, are at higher risk of developing culture-negative endocarditis.\n*   **Symptoms**: The symptoms of culture-negative endocarditis can vary widely, but may include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and other nonspecific signs of infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis is often challenging and requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies. Blood cultures may be negative, but other diagnostic tests, such as echocardiography or serological tests, may help identify the underlying cause of the endocarditis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of culture-negative endocarditis depends on the underlying cause of the infection. In some cases, antibiotics may be effective, while in others, antifungal or other specialized treatments may be required. In all cases, prompt and appropriate treatment is essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes.",

It also has many other functions, including:\n\n* Controlling the body's use of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins\n* Reducing the immune system's response to swelling (inflammation)\n* Regulating blood pressure and the body's water balance\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of Cushing disease include:\n\n* Upper body obesity (above the waist) and thin arms and legs\n* Round, red, full face (moon face)\n* Slow growth rate in children\n* Skin changes:\n\t+ Acne or skin infections\n\t+ Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae, on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts\n\t+ Thin skin with easy bruising, most commonly on the arms and hands\n* Muscle and bone changes:\n\t+ Backache, which occurs with routine activities\n\t+ Bone pain or tenderness\n\t+ Collection of fat between the shoulders (buffalo hump)\n\t+ Weakening of the bones, which leads to rib and spine fractures\n\t+ Weak muscles causing exercise intolerance\n* Women may have:\n\t+ Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs\n\t+ Menstrual cycle that becomes irregular or stops\n* Men may have:\n\t+ Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido)\n\t+ Erection problems\n\nOther symptoms or problems may include:\n\n* Mental changes, such as depression, anxiety, or changes in behavior\n* Fatigue\n* Frequent infections\n* Headache\n* Increased thirst and urination\n* High blood pressure\n* Diabetes (high blood sugar)\n\n---\n\n**Cushing Disease**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Upper body obesity (above the waist) and thin arms and legs\n* Round, red, full face (moon face)\n* Slow growth rate in children\n* Skin changes:\n\t+ Acne or skin infections\n\t+ Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae, on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts\n\t+ Thin skin with easy bruising, most commonly on the arms and hands\n* Muscle and bone changes:\n\t+ Backache, which occurs with routine activities\n\t+ Bone pain or tenderness\n\t+ Collection of fat between the shoulders (buffalo hump)\n\t+ Weakening of the bones, which leads to rib and spine fractures\n\t+ Weak muscles causing exercise intolerance\n* Women may have:\n\t+ Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs\n\t+ Menstrual cycle that becomes irregular or stops\n* Men may have:\n\t+ Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido)\n\t+ Erection problems\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\n\nTests are done first to confirm there is too much cortisol in the body, and then to determine the cause.\n\nThese tests confirm too much cortisol:\n\n* 24-hour urine free cortisol\n* Dexamethasone suppression test (low dose)\n* Salivary cortisol levels (late at night and sometimes also early morning)\n\nThese tests determine the cause of the high cortisol once it is confirmed:\n\n* Blood ACTH level\n* Brain MRI\n* Corticotropin-releasing hormone test, which acts on the pituitary gland to cause the release of ACTH\n* Dexamethasone suppression test (high dose)\n* Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) -- measures ACTH levels in the veins that drain the pituitary gland compared to the veins in the chest\n\nOther tests that may be done include any of the following:\n\n* Fasting blood glucose and A1C to test for diabetes\n* Lipid and cholesterol testing\n* Bone mineral density scan to check for osteoporosis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment involves surgery to remove the pituitary tumor, if possible. After surgery, the pituitary gland may slowly start to work again and return to normal.\n\nDuring the recovery process from surgery, you may need cortisol replacement treatments becauseÂ the pituitary needs time to start making ACTH again.\n\nRadiation treatment of the pituitary gland may also be used if the tumor is not completely removed.\n\nIf the tumor does not respond to surgery or radiation, you may need medicines to stop your body from making cortisol.\n\nIf these treatments are not successful, the adrenal glands may need to be removed to stop the high levels of cortisol from being produced. Removal of the adrenal glands can cause the pituitary tumor to get much bigger (Nelson syndrome).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nUntreated, Cushing disease can cause severe illness, even death. Removal of the tumor may lead to full recovery, but the tumor can grow back.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHealth problems that may result from Cushing disease include:\n\n* Blood clots in veins (deep vein thrombosis)\n* Compression fractures in the spine\n* Diabetes\n* High blood pressure\n* Infections\n* Kidney stones\n* Mood or other psychiatric problems\n* Weight gain\n\n---\n\n**Cushing Disease**\n\n**Health Problems That May Result From Cushing Disease**\n\nWeight gain, psychiatric problems, and other health issues can arise from Cushing disease.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of Cushing disease. If you have had a pituitary tumor removed, call your provider if you have signs of complications, including signs that the tumor has returned.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPituitary Cushing disease; ACTH-secreting adenoma\n\n**References**\n\nNewell-Price JDC, Auchus RJ.

Causes of too much cortisol include:\n\n*   **Cushing Disease**: A pituitary gland tumor that makes too much adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), signaling the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol.\n*   **Adrenal Gland Tumor**: A tumor on one of the adrenal glands that produces excessive amounts of cortisol.\n*   **Tumors Elsewhere in the Body**: Tumors that produce corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to an overproduction of cortisol.\n\n---\n\n**Cushing Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cushing Syndrome?**\n\nCushing syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when your body produces too much cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. There are several causes of too much cortisol, including:\n\n*   **Cushing disease**: This occurs when the pituitary gland makes too much of the hormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. A pituitary gland tumor can cause this condition.\n*   **Tumor of the adrenal gland**\n*   **Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)**\n*   **Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces ACTH (ectopic Cushing syndrome)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Cushing Syndrome**\n\nThe most common cause of Cushing syndrome is taking too much glucocorticoid or corticosteroid medicine. This form of Cushing syndrome is called exogenous Cushing syndrome. Prednisone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone are examples of this type of medicine. Glucocorticoids mimic the action of the body's natural hormone cortisol. These drugs are used to treat many conditions such as asthma, skin inflammation, cancer, bowel disease, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nNot everyone with Cushing syndrome has the same symptoms. Some people have many symptoms while others have hardly any symptoms. Symptoms usually get worse over time.\n\nMost people with Cushing syndrome have:\n\n*   **Round, red, full face (moon face)**\n*   **Slow growth rate (in children)**\n*   **Weight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity)**\n\nSkin changes can include:\n\n*   **Skin infections**\n*   **Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide) called striae on the skin of the abdomen, upper arms, thighs, and breasts**\n*   **Thin skin with easy bruising (especially on the arms and hands)**\n\nMuscle and bone changes include:\n\n*   **Backache, which occurs with routine activities**\n*   **Bone pain or tenderness**\n*   **Collection of fat between the shoulders and above collar bones**\n*   **Rib and spine fractures caused by thinning of the bones**\n*   **Weak muscles, especially of the hips and shoulders**\n\nBody-wide (systemic) changes include:\n\n*   **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**\n*   **High blood pressure (hypertension)**\n*   **Increased cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia)**\n\nWomen with Cushing syndrome may have:\n\n*   **Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs**\n*   **Periods that become irregular or stop**\n\nMen may have:\n\n*   **Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido)**\n*   **Erection problems**\n\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease:\n\n*   **Mental changes, such as depression, anxiety, or changes in behavior**\n*   **Fatigue**\n*   **Headache**\n*   **Increased thirst and urination**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and the medicines you are taking. Tell your provider about all medicines you have been taking for the past several months. Also, tell your provider about shots that you received at a provider's office.\n\nLaboratory tests that may be done to diagnose Cushing syndrome and identify the cause are:\n\n*   **Blood cortisol level**\n*   **Blood sugar**\n*   **Saliva cortisol level**\n*   **Dexamethasone suppression test**\n*   **24-hour urine for cortisol and creatinine**\n*   **ACTH level**\n*   **ACTH stimulation test (in rare cases)**\n\nTests to determine the cause or complications may include:\n\n*   **Abdominal CT**\n*   **Pituitary MRI**\n*   **Bone mineral density**\n\nMaking the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome may be complicated. Usually, you will be asked to see a hormone specialist (endocrinologist).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the cause.\n\nCushing syndrome caused by corticosteroid use:\n\nYour provider will instruct you to slowly decrease the medicine dosage. Stopping the medicine suddenly can be dangerous.\n\nIf you cannot stop taking the medicine because of the disease it is treating, your high blood sugar, high cholesterol levels, and bone thinning or osteoporosis should be closely monitored and treated.\n\nWith Cushing syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor that releases too much ACTH (Cushing disease), you may need:\n\n*   **Surgery to remove the tumor**\n*   **Radiation after removal of the pituitary tumor (in some cases)**\n*   **Cortisol replacement therapy after surgery**\n*   **Medicines to replace pituitary hormones that become deficient**\n*   **Medicines to prevent the body from making too much cortisol**\n\nWith Cushing syndrome due to a pituitary tumor, adrenal tumor, or other tumors:\n\nYou may need surgery to remove the tumor.\n\nIf the tumor cannot be removed, you may need medicines to help block the release of cortisol or the ability of cortisol to signal.\n\n---\n\n**Cushing Syndrome**\n\n_Causes and Symptoms_\n\nCushing syndrome is a rare disorder caused by an overproduction of cortisol in the body. The causes of Cushing syndrome can be divided into three main categories:\n\n*   **Corticosteroid use**: Taking corticosteroids, such as prednisone, for a long period can lead to Cushing syndrome.\n*   **Pituitary tumor**: A benign tumor on the pituitary gland can cause an overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to an increase in cortisol production.\n*   **Adrenal tumor or other tumors**: Tumors on the adrenal glands or other parts of the body can produce excess cortisol.\n\nSymptoms of Cushing syndrome include:\n\n*   Weight gain, particularly in the midsection\n*   Fat accumulation around the neck (buffalo hump)\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Diabetes\n*   Osteoporosis\n*   Mood changes, such as depression or anxiety\n\n_Treatment_\n\nTreatment for Cushing syndrome depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, stopping corticosteroid use may be sufficient to resolve the condition.\n\nFor pituitary tumors:\n\n*   Surgery to remove the tumor\n*   Radiation therapy after surgery\n*   Cortisol replacement therapy after surgery\n*   Medicines to replace pituitary hormones that become deficient\n*   Medicines to prevent the body from making too much cortisol\n\nFor adrenal tumors or other tumors:\n\n*   Surgery to remove the tumor\n*   Medicines to help block the release of cortisol or the ability of cortisol to signal\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nRemoving the tumor may lead to full recovery, but there is a chance that the condition will return. Survival for people with Cushing syndrome caused by tumors depends on the tumor type.\n\nUntreated, Cushing syndrome can be life-threatening.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nHealth problems that may result from Cushing syndrome include:\n\n*   Diabetes\n*   Enlargement of pituitary tumor\n*   Bone fractures due to osteoporosis\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Serious infections\n\n_Prevention_\n\nIf you take a corticosteroid, know the signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome. Getting treated early can help prevent any long-term effects of Cushing syndrome.\n\nIf you use inhaled steroids, you can decrease your exposure to the steroids by using a spacer and by rinsing your mouth after breathing in the steroids.\n\n_Alternative Names_\n\nHypercortisolism; Cortisol excess; Glucocorticoid excess - Cushing syndrome; Cushing's syndrome",

If a hole forms in these organs, severe bleeding and infection can occur. Surgery may be needed to correct these and other complications.\n\n**References**\n\nHoyte C. Caustics. In: Walls RM, ed.

The following are more likely to become infected:\n\n* Bites\n* Punctures\n* Crush injuries\n* Dirty wounds\n* Wounds on the feet\n* Wounds that are not promptly treated\n\n**First Aid**\n\nIf the wound is bleeding severely, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\nMinor cuts and puncture wounds can be treated at home. Prompt first aid can help prevent infection and speed healing while reducing scarring.\n\n**Treating Minor Cuts**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap or antibacterial cleanser to prevent infection.\n2. Then, wash the cut thoroughly with mild soap and water.\n3. Use direct pressure to stop the bleeding.\n4. Apply antibacterial ointment and a clean bandage that will not stick to the wound.\n\n**Treating Minor Punctures**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap or antibacterial cleanser to prevent infection.\n2. Rinse the puncture for 5 minutes under running water. Then wash with soap.\n3. Look (but do not poke around) for objects inside the wound. If found, don't remove them. Go to your emergency or urgent care center.\n4. If you can't see anything inside the wound, but a piece of the object that caused the injury is missing, also seek medical attention.\n5. Apply antibacterial ointment and a clean bandage that will not stick to the wound.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\n* Do not assume that a minor wound is clean because you can't see dirt or debris inside. Always wash it.\n* Do not breathe on an open wound.\n* Do not try to clean a major wound, especially after the bleeding is under control.\n* Do not remove a long or deeply stuck object. Seek medical attention.\n* Do not push or pick debris from a wound. Seek medical attention.\n* Do not push body parts back in. Cover them with clean material until medical help arrives.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n* The bleeding is severe or cannot be stopped (for example, after 10 minutes of pressure).\n* The person cannot feel the injured area, or it doesn't work right.\n* The person is otherwise seriously injured.\n\nContact your health care provider right away if:\n\n* The wound is large or deep, even if the bleeding is not severe.\n* The wound is more than a quarter inch (0.64 centimeter) deep, on the face, or reaching the bone.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605007.html",
    "content": "**Cyanocobalamin Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCyanocobalamin injection is used to treat and prevent a lack of vitamin B12 that may be caused by any of the following:\n\n* Pernicious anemia (lack of a natural substance needed to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestine)\n* Certain diseases, infections, or medications that decrease the amount of vitamin B12 absorbed from food\n* A vegan diet (strict vegetarian diet that does not allow any animal products, including dairy products and eggs)\n\nLack of vitamin B12 may cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. Cyanocobalamin injection also may be given as a test to see how well the body can absorb vitamin B12.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCyanocobalamin comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a muscle or just under the skin. It is usually injected by a healthcare provider in an office or clinic.\n\nYou will probably receive cyanocobalamin injection once a day for the first 6-7 days of your treatment. As your red blood cells return to normal, you will probably receive the medication every other day for 2 weeks, and then every 3-4 days for 2-3 weeks. After your anemia has been treated, you will probably receive the medication once a month to prevent your symptoms from coming back.\n\nCyanocobalamin injection will supply you with enough vitamin B12 only as long as you receive injections regularly. You may receive cyanocobalamin injections every month for the rest of your life. Keep all appointments to receive cyanocobalamin injections even if you feel well. If you stop receiving cyanocobalamin injections, your anemia may return and your nerves may be damaged.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCyanocobalamin injection is also sometimes used to treat inherited conditions that decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 from the intestine.

    "content": "**Cyanocobalamin Nasal Gel**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nCyanocobalamin nasal gel is used to prevent a lack of vitamin B12 that may be caused by any of the following: pernicious anemia (lack of a natural substance needed to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestine); certain diseases, infections or medications that decrease the amount of vitamin B12 absorbed from food; or a vegan diet (strict vegetarian diet that does not allow any animal products including eggs and dairy products). Lack of vitamin B12 can cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. This anemia must be treated with vitamin B12 injections. After the red blood cells have returned to normal, cyanocobalamin nasal gel can be used to stop anemia and other symptoms of lack of vitamin B12 from coming back.

    "content": "**Cyanotic Heart Disease**\n\n_Cyanotic heart disease refers to a group of many different heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). They result in a low blood oxygen level. Cyanosis refers to a bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes._\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormally, blood returns from the body and flows through the heart and lungs.\n\nBlood that is low in oxygen returns from the body to the right side of the heart.\nThe right side of the heart then pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up more oxygen and becomes red.\nThe oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body.\n\nHeart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. These defects can cause less blood to flow to the lungs. They can also result in blue and red blood mixing together. This causes poorly oxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body. As a result:\n\nThe blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen.\nLess oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue (cyanosis).\n\nSome of these heart defects involve the heart valves. These defects force blue blood to mix with red blood through abnormal heart channels. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward.\n\nHeart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include:\n\n*   Tricuspid valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the right side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough.\n*   Pulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs) may be absent or unable to open wide enough.\n*   Aortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough.\n*   Mitral valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. This is very rare and a poorly formed left ventricle may also be present.\n\nOther heart defects may include abnormalities in valve development or in the location and connections between blood vessels. Some examples include:\n\n*   Coarctation or complete interruption of the aorta\n*   Ebstein anomaly\n*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n*   Tetralogy of Fallot\n*   Total anomalous pulmonary venous return\n*   Transposition of the great arteries\n*   Truncus arteriosus\n\nCertain medical conditions in the mother can increase the risk of certain cyanotic heart diseases in the infant. Some examples include:\n\n*   Chemical exposure\n*   Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome\n*   Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy\n*   Poorly controlled blood sugar level in women who have diabetes during pregnancy\n*   Medicines prescribed by your health care provider or bought on your own and used during pregnancy\n*   Street drugs used during pregnancy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome heart defects cause major problems right after birth.\n\nThe main symptom of cyanosis is a bluish color of the lips, fingers, and toes that is caused by the low oxygen content in the blood. It may occur while the child is resting or only when the child is active.\n\nSome children have breathing problems (dyspnea). They may get into a squatting position after physical activity to relieve breathlessness.\n\nOthers have spells, in which their bodies are suddenly starved of oxygen. During these spells, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Breathing too quickly (hyperventilation)\n*   Sudden increase in bluish color to the skin\n\nInfants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should.\n\nFainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur.\n\nOther symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include:\n\n*   Feeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth\n*   Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood\n*   Puffy eyes or face\n*   Tiredness all the time\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPhysical examination confirms cyanosis. Older children may have clubbed fingers.\n\nThe provider will listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Abnormal heart sounds, a heart murmur, and lung crackles may be heard.\n\nTests will vary depending on the cause, but may include:\n\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Checking oxygen level in the blood using an arterial blood gas test or by checking it through the skin with a pulse oximeter\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   ECG (electrocardiogram)\n*   Looking at the heart structure and blood vessels using echocardiogram or MRI of the heart\n*   Passing a thin flexible tube (catheter) into the right or left side of the heart, usually from the groin (cardiac catheterization)\n*   Transcutaneous oxygen monitor (pulse oximeter)\n*   Echo-Doppler\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome infants may need to stay in the hospital after birth so they can receive oxygen or be put on a breathing machine. They may receive medicines to:\n\n*   Get rid of extra fluids\n*   Help the heart pump harder\n*   Keep certain blood vessels open\n*   Treat abnormal heartbeats or rhythms\n\nThe treatment of choice for most congenital heart diseases is surgery to repair the defect. There are many types of surgery, depending on the kind of birth defect. Surgery may be needed soon after birth, or it may be delayed for months or even years. Some surgeries may be staged as the child grows.\n\nYour child may need to take water pills (diuretics) and other heart medicines before or after surgery. Be sure to follow the correct dosage. Regular follow-up with the provider is important.\n\nMany children who have had heart surgery must take antibiotics before, and sometimes after having any dental work or other medical procedures. Make sure you have clear instructions from your child's heart provider.\n\nAsk your child's provider before getting any immunizations. Most children can follow the recommended guidelines for childhood vaccinations.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the specific disorder and its severity.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of cyanotic heart disease include:\n\n*   Abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death\n*   Long-term (chronic) high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lung\n*   Heart failure\n*   Infection in the heart\n*   Stroke\n*   Death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your baby has:\n\n*   Bluish skin (cyanosis) or grayish skin\n*   Breathing difficulty\n*   Chest pain or other pain\n*   Dizziness, fainting, or heart palpitations\n*   Feeding problems or reduced appetite\n*   Fever, nausea, or vomiting\n*   Puffy eyes or face\n*   Tiredness all the time\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSome inherited factors may play a role in congenital heart disease. Many family members may be affected. If you are planning to get pregnant, talk to your provider about screening for genetic diseases.\n\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.\n\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\n\n*   Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\n*   Tell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\n*   Have a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\n*   Pregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRight-to-left cardiac shunt; Right-to-left circulatory shunt\n\n**References**\n\nBernstein D.

Some examples include:\n\n* Chemical exposure\n* Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome\n* Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy\n* Poorly controlled blood sugar level in women who have diabetes during pregnancy\n* Medicines prescribed by your health care provider or bought on your own and used during pregnancy\n* Street drugs used during pregnancy\n\n---\n\n**Cyanotic Heart Disease**\n\nCertain medical conditions in the mother can increase the risk of certain cyanotic heart diseases in the infant. Some examples include:\n\n* Chemical exposure\n* Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome\n* Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy\n* Poorly controlled blood sugar level in women who have diabetes during pregnancy\n* Medicines prescribed by your health care provider or bought on your own and used during pregnancy\n* Street drugs used during pregnancy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome heart defects cause major problems right after birth.\n\nThe main symptom of cyanosis is a bluish color of the lips, fingers, and toes that is caused by the low oxygen content in the blood. It may occur while the child is resting or only when the child is active.\n\nSome children have breathing problems (dyspnea). They may get into a squatting position after physical activity to relieve breathlessness.\n\nOthers have spells, in which their bodies are suddenly starved of oxygen. During these spells, symptoms may include:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Breathing too quickly (hyperventilation)\n* Sudden increase in bluish color to the skin\n\nInfants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should.\n\nFainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur.\n\nOther symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include:\n\n* Feeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth\n* Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood\n* Puffy eyes or face\n* Tiredness all the time\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPhysical examination confirms cyanosis. Older children may have clubbed fingers.\n\nThe provider will listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Abnormal heart sounds, a heart murmur, and lung crackles may be heard.\n\nTests will vary depending on the cause, but may include:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* Checking oxygen level in the blood using an arterial blood gas test or by checking it through the skin with a pulse oximeter\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* ECG (electrocardiogram)\n* Looking at the heart structure and blood vessels using echocardiogram or MRI of the heart\n* Passing a thin flexible tube (catheter) into the right or left side of the heart, usually from the groin (cardiac catheterization)\n* Transcutaneous oxygen monitor (pulse oximeter)\n* Echo-Doppler\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome infants may need to stay in the hospital after birth so they can receive oxygen or be put on a breathing machine. They may receive medicines to:\n\n* Get rid of extra fluids\n* Help the heart pump harder\n* Keep certain blood vessels open\n* Treat abnormal heartbeats or rhythms\n\nThe treatment of choice for most congenital heart diseases is surgery to repair the defect. There are many types of surgery, depending on the kind of birth defect. Surgery may be needed soon after birth, or it may be delayed for months or even years. Some surgeries may be staged as the child grows.\n\nYour child may need to take water pills (diuretics) and other heart medicines before or after surgery. Be sure to follow the correct dosage. Regular follow-up with the provider is important.\n\nMany children who have had heart surgery must take antibiotics before, and sometimes after having any dental work or other medical procedures. Make sure you have clear instructions from your child's heart provider.\n\nAsk your child's provider before getting any immunizations. Most children can follow the recommended guidelines for childhood vaccinations.\n\n---\n\n**Cyanotic Heart Disease**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of choice for most congenital heart diseases is surgery to repair the defect.

Many family members may be affected. If you are planning to get pregnant, talk to your provider about screening for genetic diseases.\n\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.\n\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\n\n* Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\n* Tell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\n* Have a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\n* Pregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRight-to-left cardiac shunt; Right-to-left circulatory shunt\n\n**Images**\n\n* Heart - section through the middle\n* Cardiac catheterization\n* Heart - front view\n* Tetralogy of Fallot\n* Clubbing\n* Cyanotic heart disease\n\n---\n\n**Cyanotic Heart Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cyanotic Heart Disease?**\n\nCyanotic heart disease refers to a group of congenital heart defects that are characterized by cyanosis, which is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. This condition occurs when there is an abnormality in the structure or function of the heart that affects the flow of blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of cyanotic heart disease is often unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations during fetal development. Some risk factors include:\n\n*   Family history: Having a family history of congenital heart defects increases the risk of developing cyanotic heart disease.\n*   Maternal health: Certain maternal health conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, may increase the risk of congenital heart defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cyanotic heart disease can vary depending on the specific type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   Cyanosis: A bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes.\n*   Respiratory distress: Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing.\n*   Fatigue: Feeling tired or weak due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's tissues.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of cyanotic heart disease typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests. These may include:\n\n*   Echocardiogram: An ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG): A test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n*   Cardiac catheterization: A procedure that involves inserting a thin tube into the heart through a blood vessel in the arm or leg.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of cyanotic heart disease depends on the specific type and severity of the condition. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged heart tissue.\n*   Medications: Certain medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or improve heart function.\n*   Lifestyle modifications: Making healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise, can also help manage the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with cyanotic heart disease varies depending on the specific type and severity of the condition. In some cases, the condition may be mild and require only minor treatment, while in other cases, it may be more severe and require more intensive treatment. With proper management and care, many individuals with cyanotic heart disease can lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects",

This condition is diagnosed most often in young children, but it can affect people of any age.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy last anywhere from an hour to 10 days. An affected person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (dehydration). Additional symptoms can include:\n\n* Unusually pale skin (pallor)\n* Abdominal pain\n* Diarrhea\n* Headache\n* Fever\n* Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or to sound (phonophobia)\n\n**Triggers**\n\nEpisodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy can occur regularly or apparently at random, or can be triggered by a variety of factors. The most common triggers are:\n\n* Emotional excitement\n* Infections\n\nOther triggers can include:\n\n* Periods without eating (fasting)\n* Temperature extremes\n* Lack of sleep\n* Overexertion\n* Allergies\n* Ingesting certain foods or alcohol\n* Menstruation\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 4 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less frequently in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition may begin in adulthood as commonly as it begins in childhood.\n\n**Relationship to Migraines**\n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome is often considered to be a variant of migraines, which are severe headaches often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is likely the same as or closely related to a condition called abdominal migraine, which is characterized by attacks of stomach pain and cramping.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nMost people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although some affected people have developmental delay or intellectual disability. Autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction, has also been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Additionally, muscle weakness (myopathy) and seizures are possible. People with any of these additional features are said to have cyclic vomiting syndrome plus.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf the condition is not treated, episodes usually occur four to 12 times per year. Between attacks, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. However, many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including pain, lethargy, digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, and fainting spells (syncope).\n\n---\n\n**Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlthough the causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n* Changes in brain function\n* Hormonal abnormalities\n* Gastrointestinal problems\n\nMany researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain. Many affected individuals have abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n\nBased on these abnormalities, cyclic vomiting syndrome is often classified as a type of dysautonomia.\n\nSome cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, particularly those that begin in childhood, may be related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).\n\nSeveral changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy.\n\nResearchers speculate that the impaired mitochondria may cause certain cells of the autonomic nervous system to malfunction, which could affect the digestive system. However, it remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function could cause episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy; abdominal pain; or migraines in people with this condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nIn most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family. However, many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, or depression, in their mothers and other maternal relatives.\n\nThis family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother.\n\nThese disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children. Occasionally, people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of the disorder that does not follow maternal inheritance. In these cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome**\n\n**What is Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome?**\n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare disorder characterized by recurring episodes of severe nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by headaches and abdominal pain.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of CVS is unknown, but it is believed to be related to changes in the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of CVS include:\n\n* Recurring episodes of severe nausea and vomiting\n* Headaches\n* Abdominal pain\n* Nausea and vomiting that may last for days or weeks\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing CVS can be challenging, as the symptoms are similar to those of other gastrointestinal disorders. A diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and family history.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for CVS, but treatment can help manage the symptoms. Treatment may include:\n\n* Medications to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting\n* Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding triggers that can bring on an episode\n* Alternative therapies, such as acupuncture or herbal remedies\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with CVS is generally good, especially if treatment is initiated early in the course of the disorder. However, some individuals may experience recurring episodes throughout their lives.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information and resources on CVS, please see the following references:\n\n* Abell TL, Adams KA, Boles RG, et al.

Despite its elusive nature, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective treatment strategies.\n\nIn 2008, a study published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition highlighted the importance of proper diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome. The authors emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach, involving gastroenterologists, pediatricians, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care.\n\n**Understanding Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome**\n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by recurring episodes of severe nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by headaches and abdominal pain. The exact cause of this condition remains unknown, but research suggests a possible link to genetic mutations, particularly in the mitochondrial DNA.\n\nA 2009 study published in the journal Cephalalgia found that two common mitochondrial DNA polymorphs were highly associated with migraine headache and cyclic vomiting syndrome. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the underlying biology of this condition.\n\n**Prognosis and Treatment**\n\nThe prognosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome varies depending on the individual patient's response to treatment. While there is no cure for this condition, various treatment strategies have been shown to be effective in managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\n\nA 2007 study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in treating cyclic vomiting syndrome. The authors emphasized the need for close collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and families to develop personalized treatment plans.\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome is often associated with genetic disorders, particularly those affecting the mitochondrial DNA. Understanding the genetic basis of this condition is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Migraine\n*   Nausea and Vomiting",

    "content": "**Cyclopentolate Ophthalmic**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic is used to cause mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye) before an eye examination. Cyclopentolate is in a class of medications called mydriatics. Cyclopentolate works by blocking certain receptors found in the eye to temporarily relax or provide short-term paralysis of the eye muscles.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCyclopentolate comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye. Your healthcare provider will instill the solution into the eye(s) prior to an eye examination.\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic may take about a half an hour or more to fully work after instillation. Effects generally may last for up to 24 hours, but may last several days in some people. People with dark eye colors may require increased cyclopentolate doses.\n\nIf cyclopentolate is given to a child, watch them closely for at least 30 minutes after instillation. Infants should not be fed for 4 hours after cyclopentolate instillation.\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic is for use only in the eye(s). Do not swallow cyclopentolate solution.\n\nBe careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that the drop(s) fall into the pocket made by the lower eyelid.\n*   Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye and tip your head down as though looking at the floor.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure for 2 to 3 minutes.\n*   If you require a second dose in the same eye, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before instilling the next drop(s) and repeat steps 1 to 8.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle.\n*   Wash your hands and if necessary your child's hands after instillation to remove any medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic may cause some people to become dizzy or disoriented. If you experience these symptoms, do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\nYou should be aware of the following:\n\n*   Cyclopentolate ophthalmic may cause your eyes to become sensitive to light.\n*   You may experience blurred vision after using cyclopentolate ophthalmic.\n*   If you have any eye problems, such as cataracts or glaucoma, talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no specific dietary instructions for using cyclopentolate ophthalmic. However, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider before taking any medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to instill a dose of cyclopentolate ophthalmic, do not take an extra dose. Simply continue with your regular schedule and contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic may cause some people to experience the following side effects:\n\n*   Dizziness or disorientation\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Increased eye pressure (in people with glaucoma)\n*   Allergic reactions, such as itching, redness, or swelling of the eyes\n\nIf you experience any of these side effects, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nCyclopentolate ophthalmic solution should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

Cyclosporine injection should only be used to treat people who are unable to take cyclosporine by mouth. Cyclosporine is in a class of medications called immunosuppressants. It works by decreasing the activity of the immune system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCyclosporine injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected over 2 to 6 hours into a vein, usually by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical facility. It is usually given 4 to 12 hours before transplant surgery and once a day after the surgery until medication can be taken by mouth.\n\nA doctor or nurse will watch you closely while you are receiving cyclosporine injection so that you can be treated quickly if you have a serious allergic reaction.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCyclosporine injection must be given under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in treating transplant patients and prescribing medications that decrease the activity of the immune system.\n\nReceiving cyclosporine injection may increase the risk that you will develop an infection or cancer, especially lymphoma (cancer of a part of the immune system) or skin cancer. This risk may be higher if you receive cyclosporine injection with other medications that decrease the activity of the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran), cancer chemotherapy, methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf). Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medications, and if you have or have ever had any type of cancer. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: sore throat, fever, chills, and other signs of infection; flu-like symptoms; coughing; difficulty urinating; pain when urinating; a red, raised, or swollen area on the skin; new sores or discoloration on the skin; lumps or masses anywhere in your body; night sweats; swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groin; difficulty breathing; chest pain; weakness or tiredness that does not go away; or pain, swelling, or fullness in the stomach.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of receiving cyclosporine injection.\n\n---\n\n**Cyclosporine Injection**\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nCyclosporine injection is also sometimes used to treat Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) and to prevent rejection in patients who have received pancreas or cornea transplants.

    "content": "**Cyclosporine Ophthalmic**\n\n*pronounced as (sye' kloe spor een)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOphthalmic cyclosporine is used to increase tear production in people with dry eye disease. Cyclosporine is in a class of medications called immunomodulators. It works by decreasing swelling in the eye to allow for tear production.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nOphthalmic cyclosporine comes as a solution (liquid) and as an emulsion (combination of two unmixable liquids) to instill in the eye. It is usually instilled in each eye twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Instill cyclosporine eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cyclosporine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nCyclosporine eye drops should be given at least 15 minutes before or after any other eye drops.\n\nCyclosporine eye drops are for use only in the eye(s). Do not swallow or apply cyclosporine eye drops to the skin.\n\nCyclosporine eye drops come in single-use vials (small bottles to be used for one dose) and in a multi-dose bottle (a bottle that can be used more than once). If you are using the single-use vials, the liquid from a vial should be used immediately after opening for one or both eyes.\n\nBe careful not to let the dropper tip touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   When using the multi-dose bottle for the first time, follow the instructions in the package to prepare the container for use.\n*   When using the emulsion, turn over the vial or bottle a few times until the liquid inside looks white and not see-through.\n*   Open the vial or remove the cap from the multi-use bottle.\n*   Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n*   Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n*   Discard the vial out of the reach of children even if it is not empty. Replace the cap on the multi-use bottle.\n*   Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCyclosporine eye drops should be given at least 15 minutes before or after any other eye drops.\n\nCyclosporine eye drops are for use only in the eye(s).

If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of cyclosporine eye drops, use it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not double the dose.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCyclosporine eye drops may cause some side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   Eye irritation\n*   Burning sensation in the eye\n*   Redness of the eye\n*   Itching of the eye\n*   Dryness of the eye\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore cyclosporine eye drops at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze. Keep cyclosporine eye drops out of the reach of children.\n\nDiscard any unused cyclosporine eye drops in a special container or a sealable bag to prevent accidental ingestion by children or pets.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCyclosporine eye drops may interact with other medications you are taking. Tell your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and supplements you take regularly.\n\nDo not use cyclosporine eye drops if you have had an allergic reaction to it or any of its ingredients in the past.\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as hives, itching, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Cyclosporine Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using cyclosporine eye drops, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in cyclosporine eye drops.

Original cyclosporine and cyclosporine (modified) are absorbed by the body in different amounts, so they cannot be substituted for one another.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nCyclosporine is available under several brand names, including Sandimmune and Neoral.\n\n---\n\n**Cyclosporine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/6)**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nTaking cyclosporine or cyclosporine (modified) may increase the risk that you will develop an infection or cancer, especially lymphoma (cancer of a part of the immune system) or skin cancer. This risk may be higher if you take cyclosporine or cyclosporine (modified) with other medications that decrease the functioning of the immune system.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any medications that decrease the functioning of the immune system and if you have or have ever had any type of cancer.

Do not take more or less of the medication or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably adjust your dose of cyclosporine or cyclosporine (modified) during your treatment. If you are taking either type of cyclosporine to prevent transplant rejection, your doctor will probably start you on a high dose of the medication and gradually decrease your dose. If you are taking cyclosporine (modified) to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of the medication and gradually increase your dose. Your doctor may also decrease your dose if you experience side effects of the medication. Tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.\n\n---\n\n**How to Take Cyclosporine**\n\nTo take cyclosporine or cyclosporine (modified), follow these steps:\n\n*   Fill a glass (not plastic) cup with the drink you have chosen.\n*   Remove the protective cover from the top of the dosing syringe that came with your medication.\n*   Place the tip of the syringe into the bottle of solution and pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe with the amount of solution your doctor has prescribed.\n*   Hold the syringe over the liquid in your glass and press down on the plunger to place the medication in the glass.\n*   Stir the mixture well.\n*   Drink all of the liquid in the glass right away.\n*   Pour a little more of the drink you have chosen into the glass, swirl the glass around to rinse, and drink the liquid.\n*   Dry the outside of the syringe with a clean towel and replace the protective cover.

This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes.\n\nCyclothymia usually begins early in life. Men and women are equally affected.\n\n---\n\n**Cyclothymic Disorder**\n\n_Causes and Risk Factors_\n\nThe causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown. However, major depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families, suggesting that these mood disorders share similar causes.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Periods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (hypomanic symptoms), or low mood, activity, or energy (depressive symptoms) for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents)\n* These mood swings are less severe than with bipolar disorder or major depression\n* Ongoing symptoms, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row\n\n_Treatment_\n\nTreatments for this disorder include:\n\n* Mood-stabilizing medicine\n* Antidepressants\n* Talk therapy\n* Some combination of these three treatments\n\nSome of the more commonly used mood stabilizers are lithium and antiseizure medicines. Compared with bipolar disorder, some people with cyclothymia may not respond as well to medicines.\n\n_Support Groups_\n\nYou can ease the stress of living with cyclothymic disorder by joining a support group whose members share common experiences and problems.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nLess than one half of people with cyclothymic disorder go on to develop bipolar disorder. In other people, cyclothymia continues as a chronic condition or disappears with time.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nThe condition can progress to bipolar disorder.\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nContact a mental health professional if you or a loved one has alternating periods of depression and excitement that do not go away and that affect work, school, or social life. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.\n\n_Alternative Names_\n\nCyclothymia; Mood disorder - cyclothymia\n\n_References_\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association website.

    "content": "**Cystic Fibrosis - Nutrition**\n\nPeople with cystic fibrosis (CF) need to eat foods that are high in calories and protein throughout the day. CF is a life-threatening disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract.\n\n**The Pancreas and Digestion**\n\nThe pancreas is an organ in the abdomen behind the stomach that makes enzymes to help the body digest and absorb protein and fats. A buildup of sticky mucus in the pancreas from CF can lead to serious problems, including:\n\n* Stools that contain mucus, are foul smelling, or float\n* Gas, bloating, or a distended belly\n* Problems getting enough protein, fat, and calories in the diet\n* Problems absorbing enough protein, fat, and calories from the diet\n\nBecause of these problems, people with CF may have a hard time staying at a normal weight. Even when weight is normal, a person may not be getting the right nutrition. Children with CF may not grow or develop correctly.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe following are ways for adding protein and calories to the diet. Be sure to follow other specific instructions from your health care provider:\n\n* **Enzymes, Vitamins, and Salt**\n\t+ Most people with CF must take pancreatic enzymes to help their body absorb fat and protein.\n\t+ Take enzymes with all meals and snacks.\n\t+ Talk to your provider about increasing or decreasing your enzymes, depending on your symptoms.\n\t+ Ask your provider about taking extra vitamins A, D, E, K, and extra calcium. There are special formulas for people with CF.\n\t+ People who live in hot climates may need a small amount of extra table salt.\n* **Eating Patterns**\n\t+ Eat whenever you are hungry. This may mean eating several small meals throughout the day.\n\t+ Keep a variety of nutritious snack foods around. Try to snack on something every hour, such as cheese and crackers, muffins, or trail mix.\n\t+ Try to eat regularly, even if it is only a few bites. Or, include a nutrition supplement or milkshake.\n\t+ Be flexible. If you aren't hungry at dinner time, make breakfast, mid-morning snacks, and lunch your main meals.\n\n**Getting More Calories and Protein**\n\nAdd the following foods to increase calories and protein:\n\n* Grated cheese to soups, sauces, casseroles, vegetables, mashed potatoes, rice, noodles, or meat loaf\n* Whole milk, half and half, cream, or enriched milk in cooking or beverages\n* Peanut butter on bread products or use it as a dip for raw vegetables and fruit. Add peanut butter to sauces or use on waffles.\n* Skim milk powder adds protein. Try adding 2 tablespoons (15.6 grams) of dry skim milk powder in addition to the amount of regular milk in recipes.\n* Marshmallows to fruit or hot chocolate\n* Raisins, dates, or chopped nuts and brown sugar to hot or cold cereals, or have them for snacks\n* A teaspoon (5 g) of butter or margarine adds 45 calories to foods. Mix it into hot foods such as soups, vegetables, mashed potatoes, cooked cereal, and rice.\n* Serve cottage cheese with canned or fresh fruit.\n* Add grated cheeses, tuna, shrimp, crabmeat, ground beef, diced ham or sliced boiled eggs to sauces, rice, casseroles, and noodles.\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis - Nutrition**\n\nPeople with cystic fibrosis (CF) need to eat foods that are high in calories and protein throughout the day.\n\n**The Pancreas and Digestion**\n\nThe pancreas is an organ in the abdomen behind the stomach. It makes enzymes that help the body digest and absorb protein and fats. A buildup of sticky mucus in the pancreas from CF can lead to serious problems, including:\n\n*   Stools that contain mucus, are foul smelling, or float\n*   Gas, bloating, or distended belly\n*   Problems getting enough protein, fat, and calories in the diet\n*   Problems absorbing enough protein, fat, and calories from the diet\n\nBecause of these problems, people with CF may have a hard time staying at a normal weight. Even when weight is normal, a person may not be getting the right nutrition. Children with CF may not grow or develop correctly.\n\n**Adding Protein and Calories to the Diet**\n\nThe following are ways for adding protein and calories to the diet. Be sure to follow other specific instructions from your health care provider.\n\n*   **Enzymes, Vitamins, and Salt**\n    *   Most people with CF must take pancreatic enzymes. These enzymes help your body absorb fat and protein.\n    *   Take enzymes with all meals and snacks.\n    *   Talk to your provider about increasing or decreasing your enzymes, depending on your symptoms.\n    *   Ask your provider about taking extra vitamins A, D, E, K, and extra calcium. There are special formulas for people with CF.\n    *   People who live in hot climates may need a small amount of extra table salt.\n*   **Eating Patterns**\n    *   Eat whenever you are hungry. This may mean eating several small meals throughout the day.\n    *   Keep a variety of nutritious snack foods around. Try to snack on something every hour, such as cheese and crackers, muffins, or trail mix.\n    *   Try to eat regularly, even if it is only a few bites. Or, include a nutrition supplement or milkshake.\n    *   Be flexible. If you aren't hungry at dinner time, make breakfast, mid-morning snacks, and lunch your main meals.\n\n**Getting More Calories and Protein**\n\nAdd the following high-calorie foods to your diet:\n\n*   Grated cheese to soups, sauces, casseroles, vegetables, mashed potatoes, rice, noodles, or meat loaf\n*   Whole milk, half and half, cream, or enriched milk in cooking or beverages\n*   Peanut butter on bread products or use it as a dip for raw vegetables and fruit\n*   Skim milk powder adds protein. Try adding 2 tablespoons (15.6 grams) of dry skim milk powder in addition to the amount of regular milk in recipes\n*   Marshmallows to fruit or hot chocolate\n*   Raisins, dates, or chopped nuts and brown sugar to hot or cold cereals, or have them for snacks\n*   A teaspoon (5 g) of butter or margarine adds 45 calories to foods. Mix it into hot foods such as soups, vegetables, mashed potatoes, cooked cereal, and rice. Serve it on hot foods.\n*   Hot breads, pancakes, or waffles absorb more butter.\n*   Use sour cream or yogurt on vegetables such as potatoes, beans, carrots, or squash. It can also be used as a dressing for fruit.\n*   Breaded meat, chicken, and fish have more calories than broiled or plain roasted.\n*   Add extra cheese on top of frozen prepared pizza.\n*   Add coarsely chopped hard cooked egg and cheese cubes to a tossed salad.\n*   Serve cottage cheese with canned or fresh fruit.\n*   Add grated cheeses, tuna, shrimp, crabmeat, ground beef, diced ham or sliced boiled eggs to sauces, rice, casseroles, and noodles.\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis - Nutrition**\n\n\\n\\n**Adding Protein and Calories to the Diet**\n\nBe sure to follow other specific instructions from your health care provider.\n\n**Enzymes, Vitamins, and Salt**\n\n*   Most people with CF must take pancreatic enzymes.

    "content": "**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nCystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs.\n\n**What is Cystic Fibrosis?**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. The most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems.\n\n**How Does Cystic Fibrosis Affect the Body?**\n\nMucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. In people with cystic fibrosis, the body produces mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This abnormal mucus can clog the airways, leading to severe problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs.\n\n**Digestive Problems**\n\nMost people with cystic fibrosis also have digestive problems. Some affected babies have meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that occurs shortly after birth. Other digestive problems result from a buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that produces insulin (a hormone that helps control blood glucose levels). It also makes enzymes that help digest food.\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nCystic fibrosis used to be considered a fatal disease of childhood. With improved treatments and better ways to manage the disease, many people with cystic fibrosis now live well into adulthood. Adults with cystic fibrosis experience health problems affecting the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems.\n\n**Reproductive Issues**\n\nMost men with cystic fibrosis have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a condition in which the tubes that carry sperm (the vas deferens) are blocked by mucus and do not develop properly. Men with CBAVD are unable to father children (infertile) unless they undergo fertility treatment. Women with cystic fibrosis may experience complications in pregnancy.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCystic fibrosis is an inherited disease, meaning it is passed down from parents to their children through genes. The severity of the disorder varies among affected individuals.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCystic fibrosis is also known as mucoviscidosis or CF.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information and resources on cystic fibrosis, please refer to the following sources:\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\n**What is Cystic Fibrosis?**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a common genetic disease within the white population in the United States. The disease occurs in 1 in 2,500 to 3,500 white newborns. Cystic fibrosis is less common in other ethnic groups, affecting about 1 in 17,000 African Americans and 1 in 31,000 Asian Americans.\n\n**Causes of Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nMutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis. The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a channel that transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. Chloride is a component of sodium chloride, a common salt found in sweat. Chloride also has important functions in cells; for example, the flow of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus.\n\nMutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of the chloride channels, preventing them from regulating the flow of chloride ions and water across cell membranes. As a result, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce mucus that is unusually thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the airways and various ducts, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nThe features of the disorder and their severity vary among affected individuals. The most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems.\n\nMucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. In people with cystic fibrosis, the body produces mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This abnormal mucus can clog the airways, leading to severe problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs.\n\nThese infections cause chronic coughing, wheezing, and inflammation. Over time, mucus buildup and infections result in permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs.\n\nMost people with cystic fibrosis also have digestive problems. Some affected babies have meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that occurs shortly after birth. Other digestive problems result from a buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is an organ that produces insulin (a hormone that helps control blood glucose levels). It also makes enzymes that help digest food. In people with cystic fibrosis, mucus often damages the pancreas, impairing its ability to produce insulin and digestive enzymes.\n\nProblems with digestion can lead to diarrhea, malnutrition, poor growth, and weight loss. In adolescence or adulthood, a shortage of insulin can cause a form of diabetes known as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRDM).\n\n**Living with Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nCystic fibrosis used to be considered a fatal disease of childhood. With improved treatments and better ways to manage the disease, many people with cystic fibrosis now live well into adulthood.\n\nAdults with cystic fibrosis experience health problems affecting the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. Most men with cystic fibrosis have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a condition in which the tubes that carry sperm (the vas deferens) are blocked by mucus and do not develop properly.\n\nMen with CBAVD are unable to father children (infertile) unless they undergo fertility treatment. Women with cystic fibrosis may experience complications in pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis: Understanding the Gene and Inheritance**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which provides instructions for making a channel that transports chloride ions into and out of cells. Chloride plays a crucial role in maintaining proper hydration levels within tissues, essential for producing thin, freely flowing mucus.\n\n**How Mutations Affect the Body**\n\nMutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of chloride channels, preventing them from regulating the flow of chloride ions and water across cell membranes. As a result, cells lining the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce thick and sticky mucus that clogs airways and ducts, leading to characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition typically carry one copy of the mutated gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nCF\nCystic fibrosis of pancreas\nFibrocystic disease of pancreas\nMucoviscidosis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Cystic fibrosis\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Cystic fibrosis\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CYSTIC FIBROSIS; CF\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAccurso FJ.

Cystic Fibrosis.\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\n**What is Cystic Fibrosis?**\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that helps regulate salt and water balance in the body.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe causes of cystic fibrosis are genetic, and it is usually inherited from parents who have the mutated gene. The risk factors for developing cystic fibrosis include having a family history of the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cystic fibrosis can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Respiratory problems such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath\n* Digestive problems such as constipation or intestinal blockage\n* Thick and sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and digestive tract\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCystic fibrosis can be diagnosed through a combination of:\n\n* Genetic testing to identify the mutated gene\n* Sweat test to measure the amount of salt in sweat\n* Respiratory function tests to assess lung function\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment may include:\n\n* Medications to thin mucus and loosen blockages\n* Physical therapy to help clear mucus from the lungs\n* Nutritional supplements to ensure proper nutrition\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with cystic fibrosis varies depending on the severity of the disease and access to treatment. With proper management, many people with CF can lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that helps regulate salt and water balance in the body.\n\n**Newborn Screening**\n\nNewborn screening can help identify infants with cystic fibrosis early in life, allowing for prompt treatment and management.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nUnderstanding genetics is crucial for identifying and managing genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis. Genetics can affect health and development, and knowing family medical history can help identify potential risks.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCystic fibrosis is usually inherited from parents who have the mutated gene. Understanding how genetic conditions are inherited can help families make informed decisions about testing and treatment.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.

    "content": "**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disorder that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas.\n\n* Many people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms.\n* A person must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent, to get CF.\n* It is more common among those of northern or central European descent.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nNewborns may experience:\n\n* Delayed growth\n* Failure to gain weight normally during childhood\n* No bowel movements in the first 24 to 48 hours of life\n* Salty-tasting skin\n\nSymptoms related to bowel function may include:\n\n* Belly pain from severe constipation\n* Increased gas, bloating, or a swollen belly (distended)\n* Nausea and loss of appetite\n* Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul-smelling, have mucus, or float\n* Weight loss\n* History of rectal prolapse\n\nSymptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include:\n\n* Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs\n* Fatigue\n* Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps\n* Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite)\n* Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps\n\nSymptoms that may be noticed later in life:\n\n* Infertility (in men)\n* Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n* Respiratory symptoms\n* Clubbed fingers\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA blood test is done to help detect CF. The test looks for changes in the CF gene. Other tests used to diagnose CF include:\n\n* Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) test: a standard newborn screening test for CF.\n* Sweat chloride test: the standard diagnostic test for CF.\n* Chest x-ray or CT scan\n* Fecal fat test\n* Lung function tests\n* Measurement of pancreatic function (stool pancreatic elastase)\n* Secretin stimulation test\n* Trypsin and chymotrypsin in stool\n* Upper GI and small bowel series\n* Lung cultures (obtained by sputum, bronchoscopy or throat swab)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAn early diagnosis of CF and treatment plan can improve both survival and quality of life. Follow-up and monitoring are very important.\n\nTreatment for lung problems includes:\n\n* Antibiotics to prevent and treat lung and sinus infections.\n* Inhaled medicines to help open the airways.\n* Other medicines that are given by a breathing treatment to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up.\n\nLung problems are also treated with therapies to thin the mucus. This makes it easier to cough the mucus out of the lungs.\n\nThese methods include:\n\n* Activity or exercise that causes you to breathe deeply\n* Devices used during the day to help clear the airways of too much mucus\n* Manual chest percussion (or chest physiotherapy), in which a family member or a therapist lightly claps the person's chest, back, and area under the arms\n\nTreatment for bowel and nutritional problems may include:\n\n* A special diet high in protein and calories for older children and adults.\n* Pancreatic enzymes to help absorb fats and protein, which are taken with every meal.\n* Vitamin supplements, especially vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\n**Care and Monitoring at Home**\n\nAvoiding smoke, dust, dirt, fumes, household chemicals, fireplace smoke, and mold or mildew is important. Giving plenty of fluids, especially to infants and children in hot weather, when there is diarrhea or loose stools, or during extra physical activity, is also crucial. Exercising 2 or 3 times each week can help.\n\nClearing or bringing up mucus or secretions from the airways must be done 1 to 4 times each day. Patients, families, and caregivers must learn about doing chest percussion and postural drainage to help keep the airways clear.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cystic fibrosis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help your family not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children with CF stay in good health until they reach adulthood. They are able to take part in most activities and attend school. Many young adults with CF finish college or find jobs.\n\nLung disease eventually worsens to the point where the person is disabled. Today, the average life span for people with CF who live to adulthood is about 44 years.\n\nDeath is most often caused by lung complications.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe most common complication is chronic respiratory infection.\n\nOther complications include:\n\n* Bowel problems, such as gallstones, intestinal blockage, and rectal prolapse\n* Coughing up blood\n* Chronic respiratory failure\n* Diabetes\n* Infertility\n* Liver disease or liver failure, pancreatitis, biliary cirrhosis\n* Malnutrition\n* Nasal polyps and sinusitis\n* Osteoporosis and arthritis\n* Pneumonia that keeps coming back\n* Pneumothorax\n* Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale)\n* Colorectal cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if an infant or child has symptoms of CF, and experiences:\n\n* Fever, increased coughing, changes in sputum or blood in sputum, loss of appetite, or other signs of pneumonia\n* Increased weight loss\n* More frequent bowel movements or stools that are foul-smelling or have more mucus\n* Swollen belly or increased bloating\n\nContact your provider if a person with CF develops new symptoms or if symptoms get worse, particularly severe breathing difficulty or coughing up blood.\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families.

It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas.\n\nThe buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system.\n\nMany people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because for a person to get CF, they must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent.\n\nMost children with CF are diagnosed by age 2, especially as newborn screening is performed across the United States. For a small number, the disease is not detected until age 18 or older. These children often have a milder form of the disease.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms in newborns may include:\n\n*   Delayed growth\n*   Failure to gain weight normally during childhood\n*   No bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life\n*   Salty-tasting skin\n\nSymptoms related to bowel function may include:\n\n*   Belly pain from severe constipation\n*   Increased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended)\n*   Nausea and loss of appetite\n*   Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float\n*   Weight loss\n*   History of rectal prolapse\n\nSymptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include:\n\n*   Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs\n*   Fatigue\n*   Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps\n*   Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite)\n*   Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps\n\nSymptoms that may be noticed later in life:\n\n*   Infertility (in men)\n*   Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   Respiratory symptoms\n*   Clubbed fingers\n\n---\n\n**Cystic Fibrosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms related to bowel function may include:**\n\n*   **Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float**\n*   **Weight loss**\n*   **History of rectal prolapse**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include:**\n\n*   **Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs**\n*   **Fatigue**\n*   **Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps**\n*   **Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite)**\n*   **Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms that may be noticed later in life:**\n\n*   **Infertility (in men)**\n*   **Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)**\n*   **Respiratory symptoms**\n*   **Clubbed fingers**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests:**\n\nA blood test is done to help detect CF.

The most common laboratory test used to diagnose cystic fibrosis is the sweat chloride test, which measures the amount of salt in a person's sweat. Other laboratory tests may include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and liver function tests.\n\nOnce diagnosed, the management of cystic fibrosis involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes respiratory therapy, physical therapy, and medication to help manage symptoms and prevent complications. The goal of treatment is to improve lung function, reduce the frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, and enhance quality of life.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment of cystic fibrosis typically involves a combination of the following:\n\n*   Respiratory therapy: This may include chest physiotherapy, postural drainage, and exercise programs to help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs.\n*   Medication: Patients with cystic fibrosis may be prescribed medications such as bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics to help manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n*   Nutritional therapy: Patients with cystic fibrosis may require enteral nutrition to ensure they are receiving adequate calories and nutrients.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nThe following patient instructions may be helpful for individuals with cystic fibrosis:\n\n*   Enteral nutrition - child - managing problems\n*   Gastrostomy feeding tube - bolus\n*   How to breathe when you are short of breath\n*   Jejunostomy feeding tube\n\n**Images**\n\nThe following images may be helpful in understanding cystic fibrosis:\n\n*   Clubbing\n*   Postural drainage\n*   Clubbed fingers\n*   Cystic fibrosis",

    "content": "**Cysticercosis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from Taenia solium (T solium). The eggs are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection occurs when a person who is already infected with adult T solium swallows its eggs, due to improper hand washing after a bowel movement (fecal-oral transmission).\n\nRisk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with T solium as a result of undercooking or improper food preparation. The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces.\n\nThe disease is rare in the United States.

    "content": "**Cystinuria**\n\nCystinuria is a condition characterized by the buildup of the amino acid cystine, a building block of most proteins, in the kidneys and bladder. As the kidneys filter blood to create urine, cystine is normally absorbed back into the bloodstream. People with cystinuria cannot properly reabsorb cystine into their bloodstream, so the amino acid accumulates in their urine.\n\nAs urine becomes more concentrated in the kidneys, the excess cystine forms crystals. Larger crystals become stones that may lodge in the kidneys or in the bladder. Sometimes cystine crystals combine with calcium molecules in the kidneys to form large stones. These crystals and stones can create blockages in the urinary tract and reduce the ability of the kidneys to eliminate waste through urine. The stones also provide sites where bacteria may cause infections.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCystinuria affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the SLC3A1 or SLC7A9 gene cause cystinuria. The SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes provide instructions for making the two parts (subunits) of a protein complex that is primarily found in the kidneys. Normally this protein complex controls the reabsorption of certain amino acids, including cystine, into the blood from the filtered fluid that will become urine. Mutations in either the SLC3A1 gene or SLC7A9 gene disrupt the ability of the protein complex to reabsorb amino acids, which causes the amino acids to become concentrated in the urine. As the levels of cystine in the urine increase, the crystals typical of cystinuria form. The other amino acids that are reabsorbed by the protein complex do not create crystals when they accumulate in the urine.\n\n---\n\n**Cystinuria**\n\n_Causes_\n\nMutations in the SLC3A1 or SLC7A9 gene cause cystinuria.\n\n_The Genes Involved_\n\n*   **SLC3A1**\n*   **SLC7A9**\n\n_How It Works_\n\nThe SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes provide instructions for making the two parts (subunits) of a protein complex that is primarily found in the kidneys.

As the levels of cystine in the urine increase, the crystals typical of cystinuria form.\n\n_Inheritance_\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n_Other Names for This Condition_\n\n*   **CSNU**\n\n_Additional Information & Resources_\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Cystinuria\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: Cystinuria\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials**\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   CYSTINURIA\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   PubMed\n\n_References_\n\n*   Claes DJ, Jackson E.

    "content": "**Cystinuria**\n\nCystinuria is a rare condition in which stones made from an amino acid called cysteine form in the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Cystine is formed when two molecules of an amino acid called cysteine are bound together. The condition is passed down through families.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTo have the symptoms of cystinuria, you must inherit a variant gene from both parents. Your children will also inherit a copy of the variant gene from you.\n\nCystinuria is caused by too much cystine in the urine. Normally, most cystine dissolves and returns to the bloodstream after entering the kidneys. People with cystinuria have a genetic change that interferes with this process. As a result, cystine builds up in the urine and forms crystals or stones. These crystals may get stuck in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.\n\nAbout one in every 7000 people have cystinuria. Cystine stones are most common in young adults under age 40. Less than 3% of urinary tract stones are cystine stones.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Blood in the urine\n* Flank pain or pain in the side or back. Pain is most often on one side. It is rarely felt on both sides. Pain is often severe. It may get worse over days.\n* You may also feel pain in the pelvis, groin, genitals, or between the upper abdomen and back.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe condition is most often diagnosed after an episode of kidney stones. Testing the stones after they are removed shows that they are made of cystine.\n\nUnlike calcium-containing stones, cystine stones do not show up well on plain x-rays.\n\nTests that may be done to detect these stones and diagnose the condition include:\n\n* 24-hour urine collection\n* Abdominal CT scan, or ultrasound\n* Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)\n* Urinalysis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent more stones from forming. A person with severe symptoms may need to go into the hospital.\n\nTreatment involves drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to produce large amounts of urine. You should drink at least 6 to 8 glasses per day. You should drink water at night as well so that you get up at night at least once to pass urine.\n\nIn some cases, fluids may need to be given through a vein (by IV).\n\nMaking the urine more alkaline may help dissolve the cystine crystals. This may be done with use of potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. Eating less salt can also decrease cystine release and stone formation.\n\nYou may need pain relievers to control pain in the kidney or bladder area when you pass stones. Smaller stones (5 mm or less in diameter) most often pass through the urine on their own. Larger stones (more than 5 mm) may need extra treatments. Some large stones may need to be removed using procedures such as:\n\n* Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\n* Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy or nephrolithotomy\n* Ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCystinuria is a chronic, lifelong condition. Without treatment, stones commonly return. However, the condition rarely results in kidney failure. It does not affect other organs.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Bladder injury from stone\n* Kidney injury from stone\n* Kidney infection\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* Ureteral obstruction\n* Urinary tract infection\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of urinary tract stones.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are medicines that can be taken so cystine in the urine does not form a stone. Ask your provider about these medicines and their side effects.\n\nAny person with a known history of stones in the urinary tract should drink plenty of fluids to regularly produce a high amount of urine.

These germs enter the urethra and then the bladder and can cause an infection. The infection commonly develops in the bladder. It can also spread to the kidneys.\n\nMost of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria when you urinate. But, the bacteria can stick to the wall of the urethra or bladder, or grow so fast that some stay in the bladder.\n\nWomen tend to get infections more often than men. This happens because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse. Using a diaphragm for birth control can also be a cause. MenopauseÂ also increases the risk for a urinary tract infection.\n\nThe following also increase your chances of having cystitis:\n\n*   A tube called a urinary catheter inserted in your bladder\n*   Blockage of the bladder or urethra\n*   Diabetes\n*   Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine\n*   Loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)\n*   Older age (most often in people who live in nursing homes)\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Problems fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention)\n*   Procedures that involve the urinary tract\n*   Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, when you are recovering from a hip fracture)\n\nMost cases are caused by Escherichia coli (E coli).

Urine may be examined under a microscope to look for cancerous cells.\n\nA urine culture (clean catch) is done to look for a bacterial infection.\n\nA cystoscopy (use of lighted instrument to look inside the bladder) may be done if you have:\n\n* Symptoms related to radiation therapy or chemotherapy\n* Symptoms that do not get better with treatment\n* Blood in the urine\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms.\n\nThis may include:\n\n* Medicines to help your bladder relax, such as anticholinergic medicines and beta 3 receptor blockers.\n* A medicine called phenazopyridine (Pyridium) to help relieve pain and burning with urination.\n* Medicines to help reduce pain.\n* Surgery is rarely done. It may be performed if a person has symptoms that do not go away with other treatments, trouble passing urine, or blood in the urine.\n\nOther things that may help include:\n\n* Avoiding foods and fluids that irritate the bladder.\n* Performing bladder training exercises to help you schedule times to try to urinate and to delay urination at all other times.\n* Avoiding pelvic muscle strengthening exercises called Kegel exercises.\n* Pelvic floor physical therapy to relieve pain in the abdominal and pelvic areas and to release tight and scarred tissues.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost cases of cystitis are uncomfortable, but the symptoms most often get better over time. Symptoms can improve if you are able to identify and avoid food triggers.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Ulceration of bladder wall\n* Painful sex\n* Sleep loss\n* Depression\n\n---\n\n**Cystitis - Noninfectious**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of noninfectious cystitis is often not known.

These include:\n\n* **Infection**: bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause cystitis.\n* **Medications**: certain medications such as antibiotics and painkillers can irritate the bladder and cause inflammation.\n* **Medical conditions**: conditions such as kidney stones, prostate enlargement, and spinal cord injuries can increase the risk of developing cystitis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cystitis can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* **Bladder pressure**: a feeling of fullness or pressure in the bladder.\n* **Pelvic pain**: pain in the pelvic area that may radiate to the lower back.\n* **Frequent urination**: needing to urinate more often than usual.\n* **Urgency**: a sudden, intense need to urinate.\n\n**Diagnosis and treatment**\n\nDiagnosing cystitis typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as urine analysis and imaging studies. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the condition and may include:\n\n* **Antibiotics**: for bacterial infections.\n* **Medications**: to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.\n* **Lifestyle changes**: making changes to diet, fluid intake, and physical activity can help manage symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile some cases of cystitis cannot be prevented, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\n* **Practicing good hygiene**: keeping the genital area clean and dry.\n* **Drinking plenty of water**: staying hydrated to help flush out bacteria and other substances that can irritate the bladder.\n* **Avoiding irritating substances**: avoiding foods, medications, and other substances that can irritate the bladder.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Urological Association website.

    "content": "**Cystometric Study**\n\nA cystometric study measures the amount of fluid in the bladder when you first feel the need to urinate, when you are able to sense fullness, and when your bladder is completely full.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nPrior to the cystometric study, you may be asked to urinate (void) into a special container that is interfaced with a computer. This type of study is called a uroflow, during which the following will be recorded by the computer:\n\n* The time it takes you to begin urinating\n* The pattern, speed, and continuity of your urinary stream\n* The amount of urine\n* How long it took you to empty your bladder\n\nYou will then lie down, and a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is gently placed in your bladder. The catheter measures any urine left in the bladder. A smaller catheter is sometimes placed in your rectum in order to measure abdominal pressure. Measuring electrodes, similar to the sticky pads used for an ECG, are placed near the rectum.\n\nA tube used to monitor bladder pressure (cystometer) is attached to the catheter. Water flows into the bladder at a controlled rate. You will be asked to tell your health care provider when you first feel the need to urinate and when you feel that your bladder is completely full.\n\n**Tests Included in Urodynamics**\n\nThe combination includes three tests:\n\n* Measured voiding without a catheter (uroflow)\n* Cystometry (filling phase)\n* Voiding or emptying phase test\n\nFor complete urodynamic testing, a much smaller catheter is placed in the bladder. You will be able to urinate around it. Because this special catheter has a sensor on the tip, the computer can measure the pressure and volumes as your bladder fills and as you empty it. You may be asked to cough or push so that the provider can check for urine leakage.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparations are needed for this test.\n\nFor infants and children, preparation depends on the child's age, past experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:\n\n* Preschooler test or procedure preparation (3 to 6 years)\n* School age test or procedure preparation (6 to 12 years)\n* Adolescent test or procedure preparation (12 to 18 years)\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is some discomfort associated with this test. You may experience:\n\n* Bladder filling\n* Flushing\n* Nausea\n* Pain\n* Sweating\n* Urgent need to urinate\n* Burning\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test will help determine the cause of bladder voiding (emptying) dysfunction.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal results vary and should be discussed with your provider.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Enlarged prostate\n* Multiple sclerosis\n* Overactive bladder\n* Reduced bladder capacity\n* Spinal cord injury\n* Stroke\n* Urinary tract infection\n\n---\n\n**Cystometric Study**\n\nA cystometric study measures the amount of fluid in the bladder when you first feel the need to urinate, when you are able to sense fullness, and when your bladder is completely full.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nPrior to the cystometric study, you may be asked to urinate (void) into a special container that is interfaced with a computer.

Existing infection increases the possibility of false test results. The test itself increases the possibility of spreading the infection.\n\n---\n\n**Cystometric Study**\n\nThe cystometric study is a test used to evaluate bladder function. It involves filling the bladder with water or a special fluid that shows up on an x-ray, and then measuring the pressure and volume of the bladder as it fills and empties.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is some discomfort associated with this test. You may experience:\n\n* Bladder filling\n* Flushing\n* Nausea\n* Pain\n* Sweating\n* Urgent need to urinate\n* Burning\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test will help determine the cause of bladder voiding (emptying) dysfunction.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal results vary and should be discussed with your provider.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Enlarged prostate\n* Multiple sclerosis\n* Overactive bladder\n* Reduced bladder capacity\n* Spinal cord injury\n* Stroke\n* Urinary tract infection\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a slight risk for urinary tract infection and blood in the urine.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThis test should not be done if you have a known urinary tract infection.

The exact cause of interstitial cystitis is still unknown, but it's believed to be related to an abnormal immune response or a defect in the bladder lining.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of interstitial cystitis can vary from person to person, but common complaints include:\n\n*   Painful urination\n*   Frequent and urgent need to urinate\n*   Suprapubic pain (pain in the area just above the pubic bone)\n*   Hematuria (blood in the urine)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing interstitial cystitis can be challenging, as the symptoms are similar to those of other urinary tract disorders. A diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of:\n\n*   Medical history\n*   Physical examination\n*   Urine tests\n*   Imaging studies (such as ultrasound or CT scans)\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThere is no cure for interstitial cystitis, but various treatment options can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n*   Medications to reduce pain and inflammation\n*   Bladder instillations (insertion of medication directly into the bladder)\n*   Dietary changes to avoid trigger foods\n*   Lifestyle modifications to reduce stress and promote relaxation\n\n**Cystometric Study**\n\nA cystometric study, also known as a urodynamic test, is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the function of the bladder and urinary sphincter. The test measures the pressure inside the bladder and the flow of urine during urination.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Bladder Diseases\n*   Male Reproductive Anatomy",

Il s'agit d'une tube spÃ©cial avec une petite camÃ©ra Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© (endoscope). Il existe deux types de cystoscopes :_\n\n_* Standard, rigid cystoscope_\n_* Flexible cystoscope_\n\n_La procÃ©dure prendra environ 5 Ã  20 minutes. L'urÃ¨tre est nettoyÃ©. Un mÃ©dicament anesthÃ©siant est appliquÃ© sur la peau qui entoure l'intÃ©rieur de l'urÃ¨tre. Cela est fait sans aiguilles.

The urethra is cleansed, and a numbing medicine is applied to the skin lining the inside of the urethra without needles. The scope is then inserted through the urethra into the bladder.\n\nWater or salt water (saline) flows through the tube to fill the bladder, stretching the bladder wall so that the doctor can see the entire bladder wall. You will feel the need to urinate when the bladder is full, but the bladder must stay full until the exam is finished.\n\nIf any tissue looks abnormal, a small sample can be taken (biopsy) through the tube and sent to a lab for testing.\n\n**How to Prepare for Cystoscopy?**\n\nAsk your doctor if you should stop taking any medicines that could thin your blood. The procedure may be done under anesthesia in a hospital or surgery center, so you will need to have someone take you home afterward.\n\n**What to Expect During Cystoscopy?**\n\nYou may feel slight discomfort when the tube is passed through the urethra into the bladder and an uncomfortable, strong need to urinate when your bladder is full. You may also feel a quick pinch if a biopsy is taken. After the tube is removed, the urethra may be sore, and you may have blood in the urine and a burning sensation during urination for a day or two.\n\n**Why is Cystoscopy Performed?**\n\nThe test is done to:\n\n* Check for cancer of the bladder or urethra\n* Diagnose the cause of blood in the urine\n* Diagnose the cause of problems passing urine\n* Diagnose the cause of repeated bladder infections\n* Help determine the cause of pain during urination\n\n---\n\n**Cystoscopy**\n\n_Catgory: general_\n\n**What is Cystoscopy?**\n\nCystoscopy is a procedure used to diagnose problems with the bladder and urethra. It involves inserting a small scope through the urethra into the bladder to visually examine the inside of the bladder.\n\n**When is Cystoscopy Done?**\n\nCystoscopy may be done for several reasons, including:\n\n* To investigate blood in the urine\n* To diagnose the cause of problems passing urine\n* To diagnose the cause of repeated bladder infections\n* To help determine the cause of pain during urination\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe bladder wall should look smooth. The bladder should be of normal size, shape, and position. There should be no blockages, growths, or stones.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal results could indicate several conditions, including:\n\n* Bladder cancer\n* Bladder stones (calculi)\n* Bladder wall decompression\n* Chronic urethritis or cystitis\n* Scarring of the urethra (called a stricture)\n* Congenital (present at birth) abnormality\n* Cysts\n* Diverticula of the bladder or urethra\n* Foreign material in the bladder or urethra\n\n**Other Possible Diagnoses**\n\nSome other possible diagnoses may include:\n\n* Irritable bladder\n* Polyps\n* Prostate problems, such as bleeding, enlargement, or blockage\n* Traumatic injury of the bladder and urethra\n* Ulcer\n* Urethral strictures\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a slight risk for excess bleeding when a biopsy is taken. Other risks include:\n\n* Bladder infection\n* Rupture of the bladder wall\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAfter the procedure, drink 4 to 6 glasses of water per day. You may notice a small amount of blood in your urine after this procedure. If the bleeding continues after you urinate 3 times, contact your doctor. Contact your doctor if you develop any of these signs of infection: chills, fever, pain, reduced urine output.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCystoscopy is also known as cystourethroscopy or endoscopy of the bladder.\n\n**Images**\n\n[Insert images of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy]\n\n**References**\n\nDuty BD, Conlin MJ.

    "content": "**Cytarabine Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCytarabine is used to treat certain types of leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells). Cytarabine is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCytarabine comes as a powder to mixed with liquid to be injected into a vein, under the skin, or into the fluid-filled space of the spinal canal by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. Your doctor will tell you how often you will receive cytarabine. The schedule depends on the condition you have and on how your body responds to the medication.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCytarabine is also sometimes used to treat certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (a type of cancer that begins in a type of white blood cells that normally fights infection). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving cytarabine injection, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had. Also, tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving cytarabine injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Additionally, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.

    "content": "**Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency?**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is a disorder of hormone production that affects steroid hormones, which are needed for normal development and reproduction. The hormonal changes associated with this condition can affect the development of the reproductive system, skeleton, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency vary from mild to severe. Mild cases may include:\n\n* Failure to begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea)\n* Inability to have biological children (infertility) in both men and women\n* Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess body hair (hirsutism), and weight gain\n\nModerate cases may include:\n\n* External genitalia that do not look clearly male or female\n* Infertility\n* No skeletal abnormalities\n\nSevere cases are also known as Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis. They may include:\n\n* Genital differences and infertility in both males and females\n* Skeletal abnormalities, particularly involving bones of the head and face, such as:\n\t+ Premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis)\n\t+ Flattened mid-face\n\t+ Prominent forehead\n\t+ Low-set ears\n\t+ Joint deformities (contractures) that limit movement\n\t+ Unusually long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly)\n\t+ Bowing of the thigh bones\n\t+ Radiohumeral synostosis, a bone abnormality that locks the elbows in a bent position\n\t+ Blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia)\n\t+ Intellectual disability\n\t+ Delayed development\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe frequency of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is not well established.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency are not well understood, but it is believed to be a genetic disorder.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nThis condition is also known as Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, please consult the following resources:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n* American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\n\nNote: The above text has been formatted to be easily readable and understand. The original content has been cleaned up and reformatted to make it more accessible to a general audience.\n\n---\n\n**Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency?**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is a disorder that affects hormone production, specifically steroid hormones needed for normal development and reproduction.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency vary from mild to severe. Mild cases can include:\n\n* Failure to begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea)\n* Inability to have biological children (infertility) in both men and women\n* Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), characterized by hormonal imbalance, irregular menstruation, acne, excess body hair (hirsutism), and weight gain\n\nModerate cases may include:\n\n* External genitalia that do not look clearly male or female\n* Infertility\n\nSevere cases are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis), a flattened mid-face, a prominent forehead, low-set ears, joint deformities (contractures), unusually long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly), bowing of the thigh bones, and radiohumeral synostosis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is caused by mutations in the POR gene, which reduces the activity of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, disrupting steroid hormone production. This can lead to problems with sexual development before birth and at puberty.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe prevalence of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is unknown, with about 65 cases reported worldwide. Researchers suspect that it may be underdiagnosed, and mild cases may be relatively common due to the difficulty in detecting signs and symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency?**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the POR gene. This condition affects the production of steroid hormones, which are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction.\n\n**Causes of Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the POR gene, which provides instructions for making the enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. This enzyme plays a critical role in the formation of steroid hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.\n\n**Symptoms of Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\nIn a woman who is pregnant with an affected fetus, abnormal levels of sex hormones in the fetus may cause her to have mild, temporary signs and symptoms of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency. The condition can also disrupt the production of cholesterol, which likely impairs normal bone formation in the severe form of the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Related Disorders**\n\nThe skeletal abnormalities found in the severe form of this disorder can also result from mutations in another gene, FGFR2. Some researchers use the name Antley-Bixler syndrome to describe these features, whether they are caused by mutations in the POR gene or in the FGFR2 gene. Others use the name Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis for cases caused by POR gene mutations, reserving the name Antley-Bixler syndrome for cases caused by FGFR2 gene mutations.\n\n---\n\n**Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase Deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

With proper management, many people can lead relatively normal lives, although some may experience ongoing health challenges.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Carriers of the mutation may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the altered gene to their offspring.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify individuals with cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and their family members who may be carriers of the mutated gene. This information can inform reproductive decisions and guide prenatal testing for future pregnancies.\n\nRemember, this is a rare condition, and most people will not be affected by it. If you have questions about your health or suspect you may be experiencing symptoms related to cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and support.",

    "content": "**Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n**What is Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nCytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is one form of a cancer of the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow) called acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n**How Does CN-AML Affect the Body?**\n\nIn normal bone marrow, early blood cells called hematopoietic stem cells develop into several types of blood cells: white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from infection, red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, and platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood clotting. In acute myeloid leukemia, the bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. Instead of developing into normal white blood cells, the myeloid blasts develop into cancerous leukemia cells.\n\nThe large number of abnormal cells in the bone marrow interferes with the production of functional white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. People with CN-AML have a shortage of all types of mature blood cells: a shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia) leads to increased susceptibility to infections, a low number of red blood cells (anemia) causes fatigue and weakness, and a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of CN-AML?**\n\nOther symptoms of CN-AML may include fever and weight loss.\n\n**Who Can Get CN-AML?**\n\nThe age at which CN-AML begins ranges from childhood to late adulthood. CN-AML is said to be an intermediate-risk cancer because the prognosis varies: some affected individuals respond well to normal treatment while others may require stronger treatments. The age at which the condition begins and the prognosis are affected by the specific genetic factors involved in the condition.\n\n**What Is the Prognosis for CN-AML?**\n\nThe prognosis for CN-AML varies, with some individuals responding well to standard treatment and others requiring more aggressive therapies.\n\n---\n\n**Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n**What is Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nCytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood-forming tissue, also known as bone marrow. In CN-AML, the bone marrow produces large numbers of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts.\n\n**Symptoms of CN-AML**\n\nPeople with CN-AML have a shortage of all types of mature blood cells:\n\n*   A shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia) leads to increased susceptibility to infections.\n*   A low number of red blood cells (anemia) causes fatigue and weakness.\n*   A reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.\n\n**Causes of CN-AML**\n\nCN-AML is classified as \"cytogenetically normal\" based on the type of genetic changes involved in its development. Cytogenetically normal refers to the fact that this form of acute myeloid leukemia is not associated with large chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nMutations in a large number of genes have been found in people with CN-AML; the most commonly affected genes are NPM1, FLT3, DNMT3A, CEBPA, IDH1, and IDH2. The proteins produced from these genes have different functions in the cell. Most are involved in regulating processes such as the growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), or survival of cells.\n\n**Frequency of CN-AML**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia occurs in approximately 3.5 per 100,000 individuals each year. Forty to 50 percent of people with acute myeloid leukemia have CN-AML.\n\n**Prognosis of CN-AML**\n\nCN-AML is said to be an intermediate-risk cancer because the prognosis varies: some affected individuals respond well to normal treatment while others may require stronger treatments. The age at which the condition begins and the prognosis are affected by the specific genetic factors involved in the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n**What is Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nCytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is a complex condition influenced by several genetic and environmental factors. It is characterized by the presence of small genetic changes that cannot be seen by cytogenetic analysis.\n\n**Causes of CN-AML**\n\nMutations in more than one gene are involved in the development of CN-AML. For example, people with an NPM1 gene mutation frequently also have a mutation in the FLT3 gene. Environmental factors such as smoking or exposure to radiation increase an individual's risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n**Genetic Changes Involved in CN-AML**\n\nThe most commonly affected genes in CN-AML are:\n\n*   **CEBPA**: regulates gene activity and helps control when cells divide and how they mature.\n*   **DNMT3A**: involved in regulating processes such as the growth and division of cells.\n*   **FLT3**: stimulates the proliferation and survival of cells.\n*   **IDH1** and **IDH2**: lead to impaired differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in CN-AML.\n*   **NPM1**: provides instructions for a protein that is likely involved in the regulation of cell growth and division.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCN-AML is not usually inherited but arises from genetic changes in the body's cells that occur after conception. Rarely, an inherited mutation in the CEBPA gene causes acute myeloid leukemia, following an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Acute myelogenous leukemia with normal karyotype\n*   CN-AML\n*   NK-AML\n*   Normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Acute myeloid leukemia\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOID; AML\n\n---\n\n**Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n**What is Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nCytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal cells in the bone marrow, which can spread to other parts of the body.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of cytogenetically normal AML are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people may be more susceptible to developing the disease due to their genetic makeup or exposure to certain toxins.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cytogenetically normal AML can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n* Loss of appetite\n* Fever\n* Sweating\n* Pain or discomfort in the bones, joints, or back\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing cytogenetically normal AML typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Flow cytometry\n* Cytogenetic analysis\n* Molecular testing\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for cytogenetically normal AML usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or stem cell transplantation. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer cells, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for people with cytogenetically normal AML varies depending on several factors, including age, overall health, and response to treatment. In general, the disease has a poor prognosis, especially in older adults.\n\n**References**\n\n* Dohner H. Implication of the molecular characterization of acute myeloid leukemia.

    "content": "**Cytology Exam of Pleural Fluid**\n\nA cytology exam of pleural fluid is a lab test to detect cancer cells and certain other cells in the fluid from the area that surrounds the lungs. This area is called the **pleural space**. Cytology means the study of cells.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A sample of fluid from the pleural space is needed.\n*   The sample is taken using a procedure called thoracentesis.\n*   You sit on a bed or on the edge of a chair or bed, with your head and arms resting on a table.\n*   A small area of skin on your back is cleaned. Numbing medicine (local anesthetic) is injected in this area.\n*   Your health care provider inserts a needle or a temporary catheter through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the pleural space.\n*   Fluid is collected.\n*   The needle is removed, and a bandage is placed on the skin.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed before the test. A chest x-ray or ultrasound will likely be done before and after the test. Do not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA cytology exam is used to look for cancer and precancerous cells. It may also be done for other conditions, such as identifying systemic lupus erythematosus cells. Occasionally, microorganisms can be seen in cytology too, but in general, they are best identified by culture.\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of fluid buildup in the pleural space. This condition is called **pleural effusion**. The test may also be done if you have signs of lung cancer.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal cells are seen.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIn an abnormal result, there are cancerous (malignant) cells.
