It is a medical condition in which you:\n\nDrink alcohol compulsively\nCan't control how much you drink\nFeel anxious, irritable, and/or stressed when you are not drinking\n\nAn AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.\n\n**Summary**\n\nMost people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people, using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness, it is important to get treatment for both.\n\nSome people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD.\n\n**Start Here**\n\n*   NIAAA Alcohol Treatment Navigator  (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism)\n*   Treatment for Alcohol Problems: Finding and Getting Help  (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Understanding Alcohol Use Disorders and Their Treatment (American Psychological Association)\n*   Also in Spanish\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Acamprosate (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Disulfiram (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Intervention: Help a Loved One Overcome Addiction (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Naltrexone (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)\n*   Naltrexone for Alcoholism (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Naltrexone Injection (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Support Strategies for Quitting  (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism)\n*   What Is Naltrexone?

It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking.\n\nDisulfiram causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol.\n\nNaltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking.\n\nYour health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups.\n\nMotivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan.\n\nMarital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking.\n\nBrief interventions are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change.\n\n**See, Play and Learn**\n\nNo links available\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment**\n\n**What is an Alcohol Use Disorder?**\n\nAn AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms.

But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills.\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment**\n\n**Relapse is Not a Failure**\n\nrelapse does not mean that you cannot recover.

Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of AUD**\n\nAUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.\n\nAUD is a disease that causes:\n\n*   **Craving**: a strong need to drink\n*   **Loss of control**: not being able to stop drinking once you've started\n*   **Negative emotional state**: feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking\n\n\\n\\n**What is Binge Drinking?**\n\nBinge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.\n\n\\n\\n**Dangers of Too Much Alcohol**\n\nToo much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your fetus. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.\n\n\\n\\n**How Do I Know If I Have an AUD?**\n\nYou may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:\n\n*   In the past year, have you:\n    *   Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?\n    *   Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't?\n    *   Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking?\n    *   Felt a strong need to drink?\n    *   Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school?\n    *   Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?\n    *   Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?\n    *   Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking?

The tests are usually quick and easy to complete, and may be done in person or online. Some questionnaires, including the AUDIT, are available online for self-testing.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for an alcohol use screening test. Simply answer the questions honestly, and your results will be used to determine if you have a problem with alcohol use disorder.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Test**\n\nThere is no risk associated with taking an alcohol use screening test. The tests are designed to help identify potential problems with alcohol use disorder, and are not meant to cause any harm.\n\n**Interpreting Your Results**\n\nYour results may show whether you have AUD, and if so, how severe your symptoms are. The severity of your symptoms will determine the course of treatment recommended by your provider. Depending on the severity of your disorder, your provider may recommend one or more of the following treatments:\n\n*   **Brief or long-term counseling**: To help you learn ways to change your drinking behavior and not start drinking again.\n*   **Support groups**: To provide peer support in stopping or cutting back on your drinking.\n*   **Medicines**: To reduce your cravings for alcohol and help you stop, cut back, quit, or not start drinking again.\n\nBy understanding the different types of alcohol use screening tests and what to expect during the testing process, you can take the first step towards identifying and addressing any potential problems with alcohol use disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Screening Tests**\n\nIf you're concerned about your drinking, there are several screening tests available to help you determine whether you have an alcohol use disorder (AUD). These tests can be administered by a healthcare professional or even online. Here are some of the most commonly used screening tests:\n\n*   **CAGE Questionnaire**: A simple four-question test that asks about your consumption, age, reactions, and consequences.\n*   **AUDIT Test**: A 10-question test that assesses your drinking behavior, including frequency, quantity, and problems associated with drinking.\n*   **MADRS Test**: A 10-question test that evaluates the severity of your drinking problem.\n\n**Interpreting Your Results**\n\nAfter completing one of these screening tests, you'll receive a score based on your responses. The scores are then used to determine whether you have an AUD and, if so, the severity of the disorder. Based on your results, your healthcare provider may recommend further evaluation or treatment.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nDepending on the severity of your disorder, your provider may recommend one or more of the following treatments:\n\n*   **Abstinence**: Stopping drinking completely.\n*   **Counseling**: Individual or group therapy to address underlying issues and develop coping strategies.\n*   **Medications**: Prescription medications that can help manage withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or co-occurring mental health conditions.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nIf you're struggling with alcohol use disorder, there are many resources available to support your recovery. Consider reaching out to:\n\n*   **Support groups**: Join a group like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or SMART Recovery to connect with others who understand your struggles.\n*   **Therapy**: Individual or group therapy can help you address underlying issues and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n*   **Hotlines**: Call a hotline like the National Helpline (1-800-662-HELP) for confidential support and guidance.\n\nRemember, seeking help is the first step towards recovery.

    "content": "**Alcohol and Pregnancy**\n\nPregnant women are strongly urged not to drink alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nDrinking alcohol while pregnant has been shown to cause harm to a baby as it develops in the womb. Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects.\n\n**Information**\n\nWhen a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby's blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby's body than in an adult. That means the baby's blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother's. This can harm the baby and can sometimes lead to lifelong damage.\n\n**Dangers of Alcohol During Pregnancy**\n\nDrinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Symptoms can include:\n\n*   Behavior and attention problems\n*   Heart defects\n*   Changes in the shape of the face\n*   Poor growth before and after birth\n*   Poor muscle tone and problems with movement and balance\n*   Problems with thinking and speech\n*   Learning problems\n\nThese medical problems are lifelong and can range from mild to severe.\n\nComplications seen in the infant may include:\n\n*   Cerebral palsy\n*   Premature delivery\n*   Pregnancy loss or stillbirth\n\n**How Much Alcohol is Safe?**\n\nThere is no known \"safe\" amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful.\n\nAlcohol includes beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor.\n\nOne drink is defined as:\n\n*   12 oz of beer\n*   5 oz of wine\n*   1.5 oz of liquor\n\nHow much you drink is just as important as how often you drink.\n\nEven if you don't drink often, drinking a large amount at one time can harm the baby.\nBinge drinking (5 or more drinks on one sitting) greatly increases a baby's risk of developing alcohol-related damage.\nDrinking moderate amounts of alcohol when pregnant may lead to miscarriage.\nHeavy drinkers (those who drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day) are at greater risk of giving birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.\nThe more you drink, the more you raise your baby's risk for harm.\n\n**Do Not Drink During Pregnancy**\n\nWomen who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. The only way to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is to not drink alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nIf you did not know you were pregnant and drank alcohol, stop drinking as soon as you learn you are pregnant. The sooner you stop drinking alcohol, the healthier your baby will be.\n\nChoose nonalcoholic versions of beverages you like.\n\nIf you cannot control your drinking, avoid being around other people who are using alcohol.\n\nPregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program.

Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been shown to cause harm to a baby as it develops in the womb. Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects.\n\n**Dangers of Alcohol During Pregnancy**\n\nDrinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Symptoms can include:\n\n*   Behavior and attention problems\n*   Heart defects\n*   Changes in the shape of the face\n*   Poor growth before and after birth\n*   Poor muscle tone and problems with movement and balance\n*   Problems with thinking and speech\n*   Learning problems\n\nThese medical problems are lifelong and can range from mild to severe. Complications seen in the infant may include:\n\n*   Cerebral palsy\n*   Premature delivery\n*   Pregnancy loss or stillbirth\n\n**How Much Alcohol is Safe?**\n\nThere is no known \"safe\" amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful.\n\nAlcohol includes beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor. One drink is defined as:\n\n*   12 oz of beer\n*   5 oz of wine\n*   1.5 oz of liquor\n\nHow much you drink is just as important as how often you drink. Even if you don't drink often, drinking a large amount at one time can harm the baby.\n\n**Binge Drinking and Heavy Drinking**\n\nBinge drinking (5 or more drinks on one sitting) greatly increases a baby's risk of developing alcohol-related damage. Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol when pregnant may lead to miscarriage. Heavy drinkers (those who drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day) are at greater risk of giving birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\n**Do Not Drink During Pregnancy**\n\nWomen who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. The only way to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is to not drink alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nIf you did not know you were pregnant and drank alcohol, stop drinking as soon as you learn you are pregnant.

    "content": "**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nAlcohol use disorder is a diagnosis made when an individual has severe problems related to drinking alcohol. It can cause major health, social, and economic problems, and can endanger affected individuals and others through behaviors prompted by impaired decision-making and lowered inhibitions, such as aggression, unprotected sex, or driving while intoxicated.\n\n**What is Alcohol Use Disorder?**\n\nAlcohol use disorder is a broad diagnosis that encompasses several commonly used terms describing problems with drinking. It includes:\n\n*   **Alcoholism**: A long-lasting (chronic) condition characterized by a powerful, compulsive urge to drink alcohol and the inability to stop drinking after starting.\n*   **Alcohol Abuse**: Problem drinking without addiction.\n\n**Effects of Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nHabitual excessive use of alcohol changes the chemistry of the brain and leads to tolerance, which means that over time the amount of alcohol ingested needs to be increased to achieve the same effect. Long-term excessive use of alcohol may also produce dependence, which means that when people stop drinking, they have physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal, such as:\n\n*   Sleep problems\n*   Irritability\n*   Jumpiness\n*   Shakiness\n*   Restlessness\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n\nIn severe cases, agitation, fever, seizures, and hallucinations can occur; this pattern of severe withdrawal symptoms is called delirium tremens.\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nChronic heavy alcohol use can also cause long-term problems affecting many organs and systems of the body. These health problems include:\n\n*   Irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis)\n*   Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   Brain dysfunction (encephalopathy)\n*   Nerve damage (neuropathy)\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Stroke\n*   Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n*   Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia)\n*   Immune system problems\n\nLong-term overuse of alcohol also increases the risk of certain cancers, including cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and breast. Alcohol use in pregnant women can cause birth defects and fetal alcohol syndrome, which can lead to lifelong physical and behavioral problems in the affected child.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Genetic predisposition\n*   Environmental factors\n*   Psychological issues\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlcohol use disorder has a strong genetic component, with certain individuals being more prone to developing the condition due to their genetic makeup. However, environmental factors and psychological issues can also contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Alcoholism\n*   Alcohol addiction\n*   Problem drinking\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on alcohol use disorder, please visit:\n\n*   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\n*   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\n\nReferences:\n\n*   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

It can cause major health, social, and economic problems, and can endanger affected individuals and others through behaviors prompted by impaired decision-making and lowered inhibitions, such as aggression, unprotected sex, or driving while intoxicated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nThe symptoms of alcohol use disorder include:\n\n*   **Physical Symptoms**: headache, nausea, sweating, anxiety, and depression. In severe cases, agitation, fever, seizures, and hallucinations can occur; this pattern of severe withdrawal symptoms is called delirium tremens.\n*   **Behavioral Symptoms**: heavy drinking that often occurs in alcohol use disorder, and can also occur in short-term episodes called binge drinking, can lead to a life-threatening overdose known as alcohol poisoning.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Long-Term Effects of Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nChronic heavy alcohol use can cause long-term problems affecting many organs and systems of the body. These health problems include:\n\n*   **Liver Disease**: irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis)\n*   **Pancreatitis**: inflammation of the pancreas\n*   **Brain Dysfunction**: brain dysfunction (encephalopathy)\n*   **Nerve Damage**: nerve damage (neuropathy)\n*   **High Blood Pressure**: high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   **Stroke**: stroke\n*   **Weakening of the Heart Muscle**: weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n*   **Irregular Heartbeats**: irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia)\n*   **Immune System Problems**: immune system problems\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risk of Certain Cancers**\n\nLong-term overuse of alcohol also increases the risk of certain cancers, including:\n\n*   **Mouth Cancer**\n*   **Throat Cancer**\n*   **Esophageal Cancer**\n*   **Liver Cancer**\n*   **Breast Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder in Pregnant Women**\n\nAlcohol use in pregnant women can cause birth defects and fetal alcohol syndrome, which can lead to lifelong physical and behavioral problems in the affected child.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nAccording to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 16 million Americans have alcohol use disorder, which affects:\n\n*   **8 percent of adult men**\n*   **4 percent of adult women**\n*   **2.5 percent of adolescents ages 12 to 17**\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nAccording to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 16 million Americans have alcohol use disorder, which affects about 8 percent of adult men, 4 percent of adult women, and 2.5 percent of adolescents ages 12 to 17. In total, approximately 38 million people in the United States are considered by public health experts to drink too much alcohol, which includes high weekly use (15 or more drinks per average week for men, and 8 for women), binge drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or individuals under age 21.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nHeavy drinking, either with or without a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, accounts for approximately 88,000 preventable deaths in the United States every year, including almost a third of driving fatalities, and is the third leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States after tobacco use and poor diet coupled with physical inactivity.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of alcohol use disorder are complex. This condition results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, some of which have not been identified.\n\n* Variations in genes that affect the metabolism (breakdown) of alcohol in the body have been studied as factors that can increase or decrease the risk of alcohol use disorder.\n* Gene variations that result in skin flushing, nausea, headaches, and rapid heartbeat when drinking alcohol discourage its consumption and reduce the risk of alcohol use disorder. Populations that have a higher prevalence of such gene variations, such as people of Asian or Jewish descent, tend to have a lower risk of alcohol use disorder than other populations.\n* The risk of alcohol use disorder is also related to variations in genes involved in nervous system function. Some of these genes play roles in various neurotransmitter pathways, in which chemicals in the nervous system called neurotransmitters and their receptors relay signals from one nerve cell (neuron) to another.\n* Nongenetic factors also play a critical role in alcohol use disorder. Factors that increase the risk of this condition include depression or other psychiatric disorders and certain psychological traits, including impulsivity and low self-esteem. Stress, associating with others who abuse alcohol, and having easy access to alcohol also contribute to a person's risk.\n\n**Genetic Associations**\n\n* COMT\n* OPRM1\n* SLC6A3\n* ADH1B\n* ADH1C\n* ADH4\n* ALDH2\n* CHRM2\n* DRD2\n* DRD3\n* GABRA2\n* GABRG3\n* HTR2A\n* SLC6A4\n* TAS2R16\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\n**What is Alcohol Use Disorder?**\n\nAlcohol use disorder, also known as alcoholism or alcohol dependence, is a pattern of drinkings that results in significant problems or distress.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nResearch suggests that genetic factors play a role in the development of alcohol use disorder. Studies have identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing this condition.\n\n*   **COMT**: The catechol-O-methyltransferase gene has been linked to alcohol dependence.\n*   **OPRM1**: The opioid receptor mu 1 gene has been associated with alcohol dependence.\n*   **SLC6A3**: The solute carrier family 6 member 3 gene has been implicated in alcohol dependence.\n\nOther genes that have been studied include:\n\n*   **ADH1B**\n*   **ADH1C**\n*   **ADH4**\n*   **ALDH2**\n*   **CHRM2**\n*   **DRD2**\n*   **DRD3**\n*   **GABRA2**\n*   **GABRG3**\n*   **HTR2A**\n*   **SLC6A4**\n*   **TAS2R16**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAlcohol use disorder does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. However, many affected individuals have a family history of problems with alcohol or other substances.\n\nChildren of people with alcohol use disorder are two to six times more likely than the general public to develop alcohol problems. This increased risk is likely due in part to shared genetic factors, but it may also be related to environment, lifestyle, and other nongenetic influences that are shared by members of a family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlcohol use disorder has several other names, including:\n\n*   **Alcohol addiction**\n*   **Alcohol dependence**\n*   **Alcoholism**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on alcohol use disorder, you can visit the following resources:\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry**: Alcohol dependence\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials**: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide more information on the genetics of alcohol use disorder:\n\n*   Abrahao KP, Salinas AG, Lovinger DM.

    "content": "**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nAlcohol use disorder is a diagnosis made when an individual has severe problems related to drinking alcohol. It can cause major health, social, and economic problems, and can endanger affected individuals and others through behaviors prompted by impaired decision-making and lowered inhibitions, such as aggression, unprotected sex, or driving while intoxicated.\n\n**What is Alcohol Use Disorder?**\n\nAlcohol use disorder is a broad diagnosis that encompasses several commonly used terms describing problems with drinking. It includes:\n\n*   **Alcoholism**: A long-lasting (chronic) condition characterized by a powerful, compulsive urge to drink alcohol and the inability to stop drinking after starting.\n*   **Alcohol Abuse**: Problem drinking without addiction.\n\n**Effects of Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nHabitual excessive use of alcohol changes the chemistry of the brain and leads to tolerance, which means that over time the amount of alcohol ingested needs to be increased to achieve the same effect. Long-term excessive use of alcohol may also produce dependence, which means that when people stop drinking, they have physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal, such as:\n\n*   Sleep problems\n*   Irritability\n*   Jumpiness\n*   Shakiness\n*   Restlessness\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n\nIn severe cases, agitation, fever, seizures, and hallucinations can occur; this pattern of severe withdrawal symptoms is called delirium tremens.\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nChronic heavy alcohol use can also cause long-term problems affecting many organs and systems of the body. These health problems include:\n\n*   Irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis)\n*   Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   Brain dysfunction (encephalopathy)\n*   Nerve damage (neuropathy)\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Stroke\n*   Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n*   Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia)\n*   Immune system problems\n\nLong-term overuse of alcohol also increases the risk of certain cancers, including cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and breast. Alcohol use in pregnant women can cause birth defects and fetal alcohol syndrome, which can lead to lifelong physical and behavioral problems in the affected child.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Genetic predisposition\n*   Environmental factors\n*   Psychological issues\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlcohol use disorder has a strong genetic component, with certain individuals being more prone to developing the condition due to their genetic makeup. However, environmental factors and psychological issues can also contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Alcoholism\n*   Alcohol addiction\n*   Problem drinking\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on alcohol use disorder, please visit:\n\n*   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\n*   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\n\nReferences:\n\n*   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

    "content": "**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nAlcohol use disorder is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking. You may also need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nNo one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person's:\n\n* Genes\n* Environment\n* Psychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteem\n\nLong-term risks of drinking an excessive amount of alcohol are more likely if:\n\n* You are a man who has more than 2 drinks per day, or 15 or more drinks a week, or often has 5 or more drinks at a time\n* You are a woman who has more than 1 drink per day, or 8 or more drinks a week, or often has 4 or more drinks at a time\n\nOne drink is defined as 12 ounces or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content), 5 ounces or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content), or a 1.5-ounce or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content).\n\nIf you have a parent with alcohol use disorder, you are more at risk for alcohol problems.\n\nYou also may be more likely to have problems with alcohol if you:\n\n* Are a young adult under peer pressure\n* Have depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or schizophrenia\n* Can easily obtain alcohol\n* Have low self-esteem\n* Have problems with relationships\n* Live a stressful lifestyle\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nHealth care providers have developed a list of symptoms that a person has to have in the past year to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Drinking more or longer than you planned to at times\n* Wanting to or trying to cut down or stop drinking, but could not\n* Spending a lot of time and effort to get alcohol, use it, or recover from its effects\n* Craving alcohol or having a strong urge to use it\n* Missing work or school, or not performing as well because of drinking\n* Continuing to drink, even when it harms your relationships with family and friends\n* No longer taking part in activities that you used to enjoy\n* Getting into situations that can cause you to get hurt, such as driving, using machinery, or having unsafe sex while or after drinking\n* Continuing to drink, even though it is making a health problem caused by alcohol worse\n* Needing more and more alcohol to feel its effects or to get drunk (this is called tolerance)\n* Getting withdrawal symptoms when the effects of alcohol wear off\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will:\n\n* Examine you\n* Ask about your medical and family history\n* Ask about your alcohol use, and if you have any of the symptoms listed above\n\nYour provider may order tests to check for health problems that are common in people who use alcohol. These tests may include:\n\n* Blood alcohol level (This shows if you have recently been drinking alcohol. It does not diagnose alcohol use disorder.)\n* Complete blood count\n* Liver function tests\n* Magnesium blood test\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMany people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking.\n\nSome people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not totally give up alcohol, you may be able to drink less. This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school.\n\nHowever, many people who drink too much find they can't just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**DECIDING TO QUIT**\n\nLike many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of your control. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink. It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol.\n\nIf you decide to quit drinking, talk with your provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives of those around you.\n\nDepending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a provider. Talk with your provider about how to stop using alcohol.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**LONG-TERM SUPPORT**\n\nAlcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer:\n\n* Education about alcohol use and its effects\n* Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors\n* Physical health care\n\nFor the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available:\n\n* You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient)\n* You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient)\n\nYou may be prescribed medicines along with counseling and behavioral therapy to help you quit. This is called medication-assisted treatment (MAT). While MAT doesn't work for everyone, it is another option in treating the disorder. These medicines are often used for MAT.\n\nAcamprosate helps reduce cravings and dependence on alcohol in people who have recently stopped drinking.\nDisulfiram should only be used after you stop drinking. It causes a very bad reaction when you drink, which helps prevent you from drinking.\nNaltrexone blocks pleasurable feelings of intoxication, which may help you cut back or stop drinking.\n\nIt's a common misconception that taking medicine to treat alcohol use disorder is trading one addiction for another. These medicines are not addictive. They can help some people manage the disorder, just as people with diabetes or heart disease take medicine to treat their condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nSupport groups help many people who are dealing with alcohol use. Talk to your provider about a support group that might be right for you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking.\n\nIt may take several tries to stop drinking for good. If you are struggling to quit, do not give up hope. Getting treatment, if needed, along with support and encouragement from support groups and those around you can help you remain sober.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAlcohol use disorder can increase your risk of many health problems, including:\n\n* Bleeding in the digestive tract\n* Brain cell damage\n* A brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome\n* Cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, liver, colon, and breast\n* Changes in the menstrual cycle\n* Delirium tremens (DTs)\n* Dementia and memory loss\n* Depression and suicide\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Heart damage\n* High blood pressure\n* Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n* Liver disease, including cirrhosis\n* Nerve and brain damage\n* Poor nutrition\n* Sleeping problems (insomnia)\n* Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\nAlcohol use also increases your risk for violence.\n\nDrinking alcohol while you are pregnant can lead to severe birth defects in your baby. This is called fetal alcohol syndrome. Drinking alcohol while you are breastfeeding can also cause problems for your baby.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nTalk with your provider if you or someone you know may have an alcohol problem.\n\nSeek immediate medical care or call 911 or the local emergency number if you or someone you know has an alcohol problem and develops severe confusion, seizures, or bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**Alcohol Use Disorder**\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

Symptoms tend to peak by 24 to 72 hours, but may go on for weeks.\n\n*   Common symptoms include:\n    *   Anxiety or nervousness\n    *   Depression\n    *   Fatigue\n    *   Irritability\n    *   Jumpiness or shakiness\n    *   Mood swings\n    *   Nightmares\n    *   Not thinking clearly\n*   Other symptoms may include:\n    *   Sweating, clammy skin\n    *   Enlarged (dilated) pupils\n    *   Headache\n    *   Insomnia (sleeping difficulty)\n    *   Loss of appetite\n    *   Nausea and vomiting\n    *   Pallor\n    *   Rapid heart rate\n    *   Sweating, clammy skin\n    *   Tremor of the hands or other body parts\n\n**Delirium Tremens**\n\nDelirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It can cause:\n\n*   Agitation, irritability\n*   Sudden, severe confusion (delirium)\n*   Fever\n*   Seeing or feeling things that aren't there (hallucinations)\n*   Seizures\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease is only considered in people who have completely avoided alcohol for 6 months.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with alcoholic liver disease and their families can be found by joining support groups for alcoholism or liver disease.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAlcoholic liver disease is treatable if it is caught before it causes severe damage. However, continued excessive drinking can shorten your lifespan.\n\nCirrhosis further worsens the condition and can lead to serious complications. In case of severe damage, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Bleeding disorders (coagulopathy)\n* Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and infection of the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - SBP)\n* Enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines that bleed easily (esophageal varices)\n* Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension)\n* Kidney failure (hepatorenal syndrome)\n* Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)\n* Mental confusion, change in the level of consciousness, or coma (hepatic encephalopathy)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n* Develop symptoms of alcoholic liver disease\n* Develop symptoms after a long period of heavy drinking\n* Are worried that drinking may be harming your health\n\nGet emergency medical help right away if you have:\n\n---\n\n**Alcoholic Liver Disease**\n\n**Symptoms of Alcoholic Liver Disease**\n\nDevelop symptoms after a long period of heavy drinking.\nAre worried that drinking may be harming your health.\n\nGet emergency medical help right away if you have:\n\n*   Abdominal or chest pain\n*   Abdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worse\n*   A fever (temperature greater than 101°F, or 38.3°C)\n*   Diarrhea\n*   New confusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worse\n*   Rectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urine\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Vomiting more than once a day\n*   Yellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n*   Develop symptoms of alcoholic liver disease\n*   Develop symptoms after a long period of heavy drinking\n*   Are worried that drinking may be harming your health.\n\nGet emergency medical help right away if you have:\n\n*   Abdominal or chest pain\n*   Abdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worse\n*   A fever (temperature greater than 101°F, or 38.3°C)\n*   Diarrhea\n*   New confusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worse\n*   Rectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urine\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Vomiting more than once a day\n*   Yellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTalk openly to your provider about your alcohol intake.

It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.\n\nIn severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of this condition include any of the following:\n\n*   Numbness in the arms and legs\n*   Abnormal sensations, such as \"pins and needles\"\n*   Painful sensations in the arms and legs\n*   Muscle problems, including weakness, cramps, aches, or spasms\n*   Heat intolerance, especially after exercise\n*   Erection problems (impotence)\n*   Problems urinating, incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate\n*   Constipation or diarrhea\n*   Nausea, vomiting\n*   Problems swallowing or talking\n*   Unsteady gait (walking)\n\nChanges in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.\n\nExcessive alcohol use often makes the body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will be ordered to check for a deficiency (lack) of:\n\n*   Thiamine (vitamin B1)\n*   Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)\n*   Vitamin B12\n*   Folic acid\n\nOther tests may be ordered to check for other possible causes of neuropathy or damage to body systems due to neuropathy. Tests may include:\n\n*   Electrolyte levels, including glucose to check for diabetes\n*   Electromyography (EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles\n*   Hemoglobin A1c test to check for diabetes\n\n---\n\n**Alcoholic Neuropathy**\n\nDamage to nerves from excessive drinking of alcohol.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown.

People will often need counseling from alcohol use disorder specialists. If there are other medical problems that can also cause nerve damage, such as diabetes, they should be treated as well.\n\nOnce the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:\n\n* Controlling symptoms\n* Maximizing ability to function independently\n* Preventing injury\n\nIt is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.\n\nPhysical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position.\n\nMedicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use.\n\nPositioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain.\n\nPeople with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms.

This may include:\n\n* Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns\n* Changing footwear\n* Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes\n* Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure\n\nAlcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling, social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or medicines.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDamage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent.

    "content": "**Aldosterone Test**\n\n**What is an Aldosterone (ALD) Test?**\n\nAn aldosterone test measures the amount of aldosterone (ALD) in your blood or urine. ALD is a hormone made by your adrenal glands that helps keep your blood pressure stable.\n\n**Abnormal ALD Levels Can Cause Serious Health Conditions**\n\nHigh blood pressure\nLow blood pressure\nComplications from abnormal levels of sodium and potassium, which can affect your heart, kidneys, and other parts of your body\n\n**ALD Testing May Be Used to Diagnose Adrenal Gland Disorders**\n\nIt can also help find out if other medical conditions are affecting the way your adrenal glands work.\n\n**An ALD Test Is Commonly Combined with a Renin Test**\n\nRenin is a hormone that your kidneys make when your blood pressure gets too low. It's part of a complex system that triggers your adrenal glands to make ALD.\n\n**Comparing Renin and ALD Levels Helps Show Whether Abnormal Levels of ALD Are Caused by a Problem with Your Adrenal Glands or a Problem with Your Kidneys or Other Parts of the System That Triggers the Production of ALD**\n\nOther names: aldosterone, serum; aldosterone urine; aldosterone-renin ratio test; aldosterone-plasma renin activity\n\n**What Is It Used For?**\n\nAn aldosterone (ALD) test is mainly used with a renin test to find out whether too much ALD is the cause of high blood pressure that:\n\nHappens with low potassium levels\nDoesn't improve with usual blood pressure medicines\nDevelops at a young age\n\n**You May Need an Aldosterone Test If Your Health Care Provider Thinks You May Have Too Much or Too Little Aldosterone (ALD)**\n\nSigns and symptoms of too much ALD include:\n\nHigh blood pressure\nLow potassium test results and/or high sodium test results\nMuscle weakness, cramps, and/or spasms\nFatigue\nHeadache\nArrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\nIncreased thirst and urination\n\nSigns and symptoms of too little ALD include:\n\nLow blood pressure\nTest results that show high potassium and/or low sodium levels\nFatigue\nMuscle weakness\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nAbdominal (belly) pain\n\n---\n\n**Aldosterone Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn aldosterone (ALD) test measures the amount of ALD in your blood or urine (pee). ALD is a hormone made by your adrenal glands, two small glands that sit above your kidneys. It helps keep your blood pressure stable by balancing the levels of sodium and potassium in your blood.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nIf your blood pressure gets too low, ALD signals your kidneys to release more sodium into your blood and to get rid of potassium through urine. This helps keep more water in your bloodstream, which makes your blood pressure increase. When your blood pressure returns to normal, your ALD levels decrease.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn aldosterone (ALD) test is mainly used with a renin test to find out whether too much ALD is the cause of high blood pressure that:\n\n* Happens with low potassium levels\n* Doesn't improve with usual blood pressure medicines\n* Develops at a young age\n\nIt's also used to help diagnose adrenal gland disorders, find the cause of abnormal sodium or potassium levels on an electrolyte test, and find the cause of orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure that makes you dizzy when you get up from sitting or lying down).\n\n**Why do I need an aldosterone test?**\n\nYou may need this test if your health care provider thinks you may have too much or too little ALD. Signs and symptoms of too much ALD include high blood pressure, low potassium test results and/or high sodium test results, muscle weakness, cramps, and/or spasms, fatigue, headache, arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat), and increased thirst and urination.\n\nSigns and symptoms of too little ALD include low blood pressure, test results that show high potassium and/or low sodium levels, fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain.\n\n**What happens during an aldosterone test?**\n\nAn aldosterone (ALD) test uses a sample of blood or urine. A test that compares your ALD and renin levels uses a blood sample. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.\n\nFor an ALD urine test, you may be asked to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFollow the instructions your provider gives you. You may need to stop taking certain medicines for a period of time before the test, including certain over-the-counter medicines. Be sure to tell your provider everything you're taking. You may also be asked to limit the amount of salt you eat each day for about two weeks before your test.\n\n---\n\n**Aldosterone Test**\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nBefore your test, you may be asked to:\n\n* Stop taking certain medicines for a period of time\n* Limit the amount of salt you eat each day for about two weeks\n* Avoid eating natural black licorice for at least two weeks, as it can affect your results\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere are no known risks to having a urine test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nTo understand what your test results mean, your provider will consider your aldosterone (ALD) levels along with the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your results say about your health.\n\nIn general, higher than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have:\n\n* Primary aldosteronism (also called Conn syndrome), a disorder usually caused by a benign tumor on an adrenal gland that produces extra ALD\n* Secondary aldosteronism, which means another medical condition is causing your adrenal glands to make too much ALD. Conditions that can cause high ALD levels include kidney disease, cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, preeclampsia, and dehydration\n\nIn general, lower than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have:\n\n* Addison's disease (also called adrenal insufficiency), a condition where damage to your adrenal glands causes low ALD. The damage may be from conditions such as an immune disorder, certain infections, cancer cells in the adrenal glands, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, secondary adrenal insufficiency, or tertiary adrenal insufficiency\n\nLow levels of ALD may also be linked to:\n\n* Certain other health conditions, such as diabetes and lead poisoning\n* Certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, and some heart failure medicines\n\nIf you have questions about your results and treatment options, talk with your provider.\n\n**References**\n\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

    "content": "**Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma**\n\nAn aldosterone-producing adenoma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops in an adrenal gland. In most cases, individuals develop a single tumor in one of the adrenal glands. The adrenal tumor produces too much of the hormone aldosterone, which is a condition known as primary hyperaldosteronism.\n\n**Description**\n\nAn aldosterone-producing adenoma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops in an adrenal gland, which is a small hormone-producing gland located on top of each kidney. In most cases, individuals develop a single tumor in one of the adrenal glands. The adrenal tumor produces too much of the hormone aldosterone, which is a condition known as primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone helps regulate the body's fluid levels and blood pressure by controlling the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which increases the body's fluid levels and blood pressure. People with an aldosterone-producing adenoma may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), and they have an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, or an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAldosterone-producing adenomas cause up to 60 percent of cases of primary hyperaldosteronism. It is estimated that primary hyperaldosteronism accounts for 5 to 15 percent of cases of hypertension, which affects approximately 3 in 10 adults worldwide. However, the prevalence of aldosterone-producing adenomas is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAldosterone-producing adenomas are caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is KCNJ5, accounting for an estimated 40 percent of the tumors, followed by the CACNA1D and ATP1A1 genes, which are mutated in about 9 percent and 6 percent of aldosterone-producing adenomas, respectively. Changes in other genes cause a small percentage of cases. Only about 60 percent of affected individuals have a mutation in one of the identified genes; additional unidentified genes are also thought to be involved in the condition.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nThe genes known to be involved in aldosterone-producing adenomas have roles in balancing the amounts of positively charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca2+) in cells. Each of the proteins produced from these genes transports certain ions across cell membranes. The flow of these ions creates an electrical charge across the cell membrane, which affects certain biochemical processes. In adrenal gland cells, this flow of ions helps control the production of aldosterone. Mutations in the KCNJ5, CACNA1D, or ATP1A1 gene lead to abnormal electrical charges across cell membranes. These abnormalities overactivate a biochemical process that increases adrenal cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. Overactivation of this biochemical process also increases aldosterone production, resulting in hyperaldosteronism and leading to hypertension.\n\n---\n\n**Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma**\n\n**Causes of Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma**\n\nAldosterone-producing adenomas are caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is **KCNJ5**, accounting for an estimated 40 percent of the tumors, followed by the **CACNA1D** and **ATP1A1** genes, which are mutated in about 9 percent and 6 percent of aldosterone-producing adenomas, respectively.\n\n**Genes Involved in Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma**\n\nThe genes known to be involved in aldosterone-producing adenomas have roles in balancing the amounts of positively charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca2+) in cells. Each of the proteins produced from these genes transports certain ions across cell membranes.\n\n*   **ATP1A1**: transports sodium ions\n*   **CACNA1D**: transports calcium ions\n*   **CTNNB1**: involved in cell-cell adhesion\n*   **KCNJ5**: transports potassium ions\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\n*   **ATP2B3**: involved in muscle contraction and relaxation\n\n**Inheritance of Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma**\n\nAldosterone-producing adenomas are generally not inherited but arise from a mutation in the body's cells that occurs after conception. In particular, the alteration occurs in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumor.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **Aldosterone-secreting adenoma**\n*   **Aldosteronoma**\n*   **Conn adenoma**\n*   **Primary aldosteronism due to Conn adenoma**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aldosterone-producing adrenal cortex adenoma\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n---\n\n**Aldosterone-producing adenoma: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aldosterone-producing adrenal cortex adenoma\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Aldosterone-producing adrenal cortex adenoma\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n1.

    "content": "**Alendronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlendronate is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause (''change of life,'' end of menstrual periods) and to treat osteoporosis in men. Alendronate is also used to treat osteoporosis in men and women who are taking corticosteroids (a type of medication that may cause osteoporosis in some patients). Alendronate is also used to treat Paget's disease of bone (a condition in which the bones are soft and weak and may be deformed, painful, or easily broken).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlendronate comes as a tablet, an effervescent tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The solution is usually taken on an empty stomach once a week in the morning. The 5-mg and 10-mg tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once a day in the morning, and the 35-mg and 70-mg tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once a week in the morning. The 40-mg tablets are usually taken once a day in the morning for six months to treat Paget's disease of bone. The effervescent tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once weekly in the morning.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take alendronate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Important Instructions:**\n\nYou must take alendronate just after you get out of bed in the morning, before you eat or drink anything. Never take alendronate at bedtime or before you wake up and get out of bed for the day.\n\nAfter you take alendronate, do not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for at least 30 minutes. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after you take alendronate. Sit upright or stand upright until at least 30 minutes have passed and you have eaten your first food of the day.\n\nIf you are taking the alendronate tablets, swallow the tablet with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 mL]) of plain water. Never take alendronate tablets with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water.\n\nIf you are taking the alendronate oral solution, drink at least 2 ounces (60 milliliters [1/4 cup]) of water after taking alendronate oral solution. Never take alendronate solution with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water.\n\nIf you are taking the alendronate effervescent tablets, dissolve one effervescent tablet in a full glass (4 ounces [120 milliliters]) of plain, non-carbonated drinking water before drinking. Never dissolve alendronate effervescent tablets with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAlendronate controls osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone but does not cure these conditions. It may take 3 months or longer before your bone density begins to increase. Alendronate helps to treat and prevent osteoporosis only as long as it is taken regularly. Continue to take alendronate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking alendronate without talking to your doctor, but talk to your doctor from time to time about whether you still need to take alendronate.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nAlendronate may not work properly and may damage the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach) or cause sores in the mouth if it is not taken according to the instructions. Tell your doctor if you do not understand, you do not think you will remember, or you are unable to follow these instructions.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nDo not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after you take alendronate. Sit upright or stand upright until at least 30 minutes have passed and you have eaten your first food of the day.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake alendronate exactly as directed. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at one time.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAlendronate may cause esophagus problems, such as difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing. It may also cause mouth sores or stomach ulcers. If you experience any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore alendronate at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze alendronate tablets. Dispose of unused alendronate in a safe manner.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much alendronate, call your doctor or local poison control center right away. If the victim has collapsed or is having trouble breathing, call 911 or your local emergency number.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nAlendronate is available under several brand names, including Fosamax and Binosto. It is also available in combination with other medications to treat osteoporosis.\n\n---\n\n**Alendronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Important Instructions**\n\nTake alendronate exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more or less of it, or take it more often than prescribed.\n\nAlendronate may not work properly and can damage the esophagus or cause mouth sores if taken incorrectly. If you are unsure about taking alendronate, ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.\n\n**Taking Alendronate Correctly**\n\n1. Take alendronate just after getting out of bed in the morning.\n2. Do not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate.\n3. Sit upright or stand upright for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate.\n\n**Specific Instructions for Different Forms of Alendronate**\n\n*   **Tablets**: Swallow the tablet with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of plain water. Do not take with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water.\n*   **Oral Solution**: Drink at least 2 ounces of water after taking alendronate oral solution. Do not take with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water.\n*   **Effervescent Tablets**: Dissolve one effervescent tablet in a full glass (4 ounces) of plain, non-carbonated drinking water before drinking. Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops, stir the solution for 10 seconds, and drink it.\n\n**What Alendronate Controls**\n\nAlendronate controls osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone but does not cure these conditions. It may take 3 months or longer before your bone density begins to increase. Continue to take alendronate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking alendronate without talking to your doctor.\n\n**Other Uses for Alendronate**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore taking alendronate:\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to alendronate or any other medications.\n*   Inform your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking alendronate.\n*   Be aware of potential interactions with aspirin and other NSAIDs, mineral oils, calcium supplements, or medications for heartburn and indigestion.\n\n**Important Warnings**\n\n*   If you have difficulty swallowing, a low level of vitamin D in your body, or any condition that affects your blood's ability to clot normally, inform your doctor.\n*   Alendronate may cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), especially if you have dental surgery or treatment while taking the medication. Consult with your dentist before starting alendronate.\n\n**Severe Pain**\n\nAlendronate may cause severe bone, muscle, or joint pain. If you experience severe pain at any time during your treatment, call your doctor right away.\n\n---\n\n**Alendronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking alendronate, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to alendronate or any other medications. Also, inform them about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while on alendronate.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with alendronate: aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mineral oils, calcium supplements, or medications for heartburn and indigestion. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking alendronate.\n\nIf you are taking any other medications including supplements, vitamins, or antacids by mouth, take them at least 30 minutes after you take alendronate.\n\nTell your doctor if you are unable to sit upright or stand upright for at least 30 minutes, if you have or have ever had a low level of calcium in your blood, a risk of breathing in food or fluids into the lungs, or if you have any problems with your esophagus. Your doctor may tell you that you should not take alendronate.\n\nAlso inform your doctor about:\n\n*   Undergoing radiation therapy\n*   Being on a sodium-restricted diet (if taking the effervescent tablets)\n*   Having anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to all the parts of the body), a low level of vitamin D in your body, difficulty swallowing, heartburn, ulcers or other stomach problems, cancer, any type of infection, especially in your mouth, problems with your mouth, teeth, or gums, any condition that stops your blood from clotting normally, or dental or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding. Also inform your doctor if you plan to become pregnant at any time in the future, because alendronate may remain in your body for years after you stop taking it.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nYou should eat and drink plenty of foods and drinks that are rich in calcium and vitamin D while you are taking alendronate. Your doctor will tell you which foods and drinks are good sources of these nutrients and how many servings you need each day. If you find it difficult to eat enough of these foods, tell your doctor. In that case, your doctor can prescribe or recommend a supplement.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of once-daily alendronate, do not take it later in the day. Skip the missed dose and take one dose the next morning as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\nIf you miss a dose of once-weekly alendronate, take the dose the morning after you remember. Then return to taking one dose once each week on your regularly scheduled day. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one, and never take more than one dose in one day.\n\n---\n\n**Alendronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Missing Doses**\n\nIf you miss a dose of once-daily alendronate, do not take it later in the day. Skip the missed dose and take one dose the next morning as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\nIf you miss a dose of once-weekly alendronate, take the dose the morning after you remember. Then return to taking one dose once each week on your regularly scheduled day. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one, and never take more than one dose in one day.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nAlendronate may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* nausea\n* stomach pain\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* gas\n* bloating or fullness in the stomach\n* change in ability to taste food\n* headache\n* dizziness\n* swelling of the joints, hands, or legs\n* muscle spasms, twitches, or cramps\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms or those listed in the SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS section, call your doctor immediately before you take any more alendronate:\n\n* new or worsening heartburn\n* difficulty swallowing\n* pain on swallowing\n* chest pain\n* bloody vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds\n* black, tarry, or bloody stools\n* fever\n* blisters or peeling skin\n* rash (may be made worse by sunlight)\n* itching\n* hives\n* swelling of eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat\n* difficulty breathing\n* hoarseness\n* painful or swollen gums\n* loosening of the teeth\n* numbness or heavy feeling in the jaw\n* poor healing of the jaw\n* eye pain\n* dull, aching pain in the hips, groin, or thighs\n\nTaking a bisphosphonate medication such as alendronate for osteoporosis may increase the risk that you will break your thigh bone(s). You may feel pain in your hips, groin, or thighs for several weeks or months before the bone(s) break, and you may find that one or both of your thigh bones have broken even though you have not fallen or experienced other trauma. It is unusual for the thigh bone to break in healthy people, but people who have osteoporosis may break this bone even if they do not take alendronate. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking alendronate.\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/alexander-disease/",
    "content": "**Alexander Disease**\n\n**Description**\n\nAlexander disease is a rare disorder of the nervous system. It is one of a group of disorders, called leukodystrophies, that involve the destruction of myelin. Myelin is the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. If myelin is not properly maintained, the transmission of nerve impulses could be disrupted. As myelin deteriorates in leukodystrophies such as Alexander disease, nervous system functions are impaired.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of Alexander disease is still unknown, but it is believed to be a genetic disorder that affects the production of myelin. Research suggests that mutations in the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may contribute to the development of the disease.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlexander disease is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. However, some cases may occur spontaneously without a family history of the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Leukodystrophy\n* Myelin disorder\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on Alexander disease, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)\n* Leukodystrophy Association\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\nNote: The cleaned output is a rewritten version of the original content, formatted to meet the specified requirements. The text has been reorganized to improve clarity and readability, while maintaining the essential medical information.\n\n---\n\n**Alexander Disease**\n\n**What is Alexander disease?**\n\nAlexander disease occurs within the first month of life and is associated with severe intellectual disability and developmental delay, a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), and seizures.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nAlexander disease is also characterized by abnormal protein deposits known as Rosenthal fibers. These deposits are found in specialized cells called astroglial cells, which support and nourish other cells in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).\n\n**Leukodystrophy**\n\nAlexander disease is a rare disorder of the nervous system. It is one of a group of disorders, called leukodystrophies, that involve the destruction of myelin. Myelin is the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. If myelin is not properly maintained, the transmission of nerve impulses could be disrupted.\n\n**Forms of Alexander Disease**\n\nMost cases of Alexander disease begin before age 2 and are described as the infantile form. Signs and symptoms of the infantile form typically include an enlarged brain and head size (megalencephaly), seizures, stiffness in the arms and/or legs (spasticity), intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Less frequently, onset occurs later in childhood (the juvenile form) or in adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of Alexander disease is unknown. About 500 cases have been reported since the disorder was first described in 1949.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the GFAP gene cause Alexander disease. The GFAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein. Several molecules of this protein bind together to form intermediate filaments, which provide support and strength to cells.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlexander's disease ALX AxD Demyelinogenic leukodystrophy Dysmyelinogenic leukodystry Fibrinoid degeneration of astrocytes Leukodystrophy with Rosenthal fibers\n\n---\n\n**Alexander Disease**\n\n**What is Alexander disease?**\n\nAlexander disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by the accumulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes, leading to progressive degeneration of the central nervous system.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nAlexander disease is caused by mutations in the GFAP gene, which codes for a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of astrocytes. The disorder can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Alexander disease vary depending on the age of onset and the severity of the condition. In infants and young children, the disorder may present with megalencephaly (enlarged head), seizures, and developmental delays. In older children and adults, the symptoms may include progressive weakness and paralysis of the limbs, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of Alexander disease is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies (such as MRI or CT scans), and genetic testing to identify mutations in the GFAP gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Alexander disease, and treatment is primarily focused on managing the symptoms and slowing down the progression of the condition. This may involve medications to control seizures, muscle spasms, and other symptoms, as well as physical therapy and occupational therapy to maintain mobility and independence.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Alexander disease varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. In general, the disorder is progressive and debilitating, and most individuals will require significant support and care as they age.\n\n**References**\n\n* Gorospe JR, Maletkovic J.

    "content": "**Alfalfa**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\nAlfalfa (Medicago sativa) is an herb that some people consume as a source of calcium, potassium, phosphorous, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K.\n\nIt's most commonly grown as food for livestock animals. In humans, it's often eaten as a garnish, and seems to prevent cholesterol absorption in the stomach.\n\nPeople use alfalfa for high cholesterol, diabetes, indigestion, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using alfalfa for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Alfalfa leaves are possibly safe when used short-term. But taking alfalfa in high doses or long-term is likely unsafe. Long-term use might cause reactions similar to the autoimmune disease called lupus in some people.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Using alfalfa in amounts larger than what is commonly found in food is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Alfalfa might act like estrogen in the body.\n* \"Auto-immune diseases\" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Alfalfa might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have an auto-immune condition, avoid using alfalfa until more is known.\n* Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Alfalfa might have some of the same effects as estrogen. If you have any condition that is sensitive to estrogen, don't use alfalfa.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nMajor\nDo not take this combination.\nWarfarin (Coumadin)\nAlfalfa contains large amounts of vitamin K. Vitamin K is used by the body to help blood clot. By helping the blood clot, alfalfa might decrease the effects of warfarin. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin might need to be changed.\n\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nBirth control pills (Contraceptive drugs)\nLarge amounts of alfalfa might have some of the same effects as estrogen. Taking alfalfa along with birth control pills might decrease the effects of birth control pills. If you take birth control pills along with alfalfa, use an additional form of birth control such as a condom.\n\nEstrogens\nLarge amounts of alfalfa might have some of the same effects as estrogen. Taking alfalfa along with estrogen might change the effects of estrogen.\n\nMedications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)\nAlfalfa might lower blood sugar levels. Taking alfalfa along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n\nMedications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)\nAlfalfa can increase the activity of the immune system. Some medications, such as those used after a transplant, decrease the activity of the immune system. Taking alfalfa along with these medications might decrease the effects of these medications.\n\nMedications that increase sensitivity to sunlight (Photosensitizing drugs)\nSome medications might make the skin more sensitive to sunlight.

    "content": "**Alkaline Phosphatase Test**\n\n**What is an Alkaline Phosphatase Test?**\n\nAn alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test measures the amount of ALP in your blood. ALP is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up certain chemical reactions in your body. ALP is found in all your body tissues, but higher amounts can be found in your liver, bile ducts, and bones.\n\n**Abnormal Levels of ALP**\n\nAbnormal levels of ALP in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including:\n\n* Liver disease\n* Bone disorders\n* Chronic kidney disease\n\nThe amount of ALP released into your blood can be affected by liver damage, conditions that affect bone growth, and certain gastrointestinal diseases.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nALP, ALK, PHOS, Alkp, ALK PHOS\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nAn alkaline phosphatase test is often used to screen for or help diagnose diseases of the liver or bones. The test may also help diagnose or monitor other health conditions.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Alkaline Phosphatase Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an alkaline phosphatase test as part of a routine checkup. Many conditions may affect ALP levels, so the test is often done with other blood tests. These other tests can include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or liver function tests, which check how well your liver is working.\n\nAn alkaline phosphatase test may also be ordered if you have symptoms of liver damage or a bone disorder.\n\n**Symptoms of Liver Disease**\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\n**Symptoms of Bone Disorders**\n\n* Bone pain\n* Inflammation and arthritis in your joints\n* Bones that are unusually shaped and/or too large\n* Broken bones\n\n**What Happens During an Alkaline Phosphatase Test?**\n\nAn alkaline phosphatase test is a type of blood test. During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know if there are any special instructions. An ALP test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before these tests.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nHigh alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels may be a sign of a liver problem or a bone disorder. Liver problems and bone disorders create different types of ALP. But your ALP test results can't tell which type of ALP is high.\n\nIf your test results show high ALP levels, your provider may order other tests to help figure out what's causing the problem. These tests may include:\n\n* An ALP isoenzyme test\n* Liver function tests\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nHigh alkaline phosphatase levels may be a sign of:\n\n* Blockages in your bile ducts\n* Cirrhosis\n* Hepatitis\n* Mononucleosis, which can sometimes cause swelling in the liver\n\nIf alkaline phosphatase levels are high and the results of liver tests are normal, the problem may be a bone disorder, such as Paget's disease of bone.\n\nModerately high levels of ALP may be a sign of many different types of conditions, including:\n\n* Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Heart failure\n* Certain infections\n\nLow levels of ALP are less common. They may be a sign of:\n\n* Zinc deficiency\n* Protein deficiency\n* Malnutrition\n* Pernicious anemia\n* Thyroid disease\n* Wilson disease\n* Hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disease that affects bones and teeth\n\n---\n\n**Alkaline Phosphatase Test**\n\n**What is an alkaline phosphatase test?**\n\nAn alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test is a type of blood test that checks how well your liver and bones are working.\n\n**When is an ALP test ordered?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ALP test as part of a routine checkup or if you have symptoms of liver damage or a bone disorder.\n\n**Symptoms of liver disease can include:**\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\n**Symptoms of bone disorders can include:**\n\n* Bone pain\n* Inflammation and arthritis in your joints\n* Bones that are unusually shaped and/or too large\n* Broken bones\n\n**What happens during an ALP test?**\n\nAn ALP test is a type of blood test.

    "content": "**Alkaptonuria**\n\nAlkaptonuria is an inherited condition that causes arthritis, kidney stones, spots of dark pigmentation, and dark urine. Ochronosis, a buildup of dark (blue-black) pigment in certain tissues, is a characteristic feature of alkaptonuria.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe first symptom of alkaptonuria is often urine that turns black or very dark when it is exposed to air (oxidation). However, this color change may not occur immediately after urination. Ochronosis occurs in connective tissues throughout the body, such as the joints, tendons, and ligaments. Pigment changes can be easily seen in the whites of the eyes (sclera), the outer ears, and the hands.\n\n**Effects on Joints**\n\nOchronosis in the joints causes people with alkaptonuria to develop arthritis, typically in early adulthood. Arthritis usually affects the spine and large joints (such as the hips and knees). Many affected individuals require joint replacements later in life.\n\n**Calcification and Kidney Stones**\n\nOver time, the deposits of pigment can harden (calcify). Calcification in joints or ligaments causes them to become rigid and brittle, decreasing their flexibility and making them prone to damage. Calcification of the discs that separate the bones of the spine can cause further back pain.\n\n**Impact on Heart Valves and Kidneys**\n\nThis calcification can also affect the cartilage that makes up the valves of the heart, which allow blood to move through the heart and prevent blood from flowing backward. As a result, the heart valves narrow (stenosis), which can cause the valves to leak (regurgitation). The body removes the excess pigment in urine. However, removing the large pigment deposits found in people with alkaptonuria can put strain on the kidneys, and this can lead to kidney (renal) failure.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nWith appropriate medical management, people with alkaptonuria generally have a normal life expectancy.\n\n---\n\n**Alkaptonuria**\n\n**What is Alkaptonuria?**\n\nAlkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 250,000 to 1 million people in the United States. It is more common in certain areas of Slovakia and the Dominican Republic.\n\n**Causes of Alkaptonuria**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the HGD gene cause alkaptonuria. The HGD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. This enzyme helps break down the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.\n\n**Symptoms of Alkaptonuria**\n\nThe first symptom of alkaptonuria is often urine that turns black or very dark when it is exposed to air (oxidation). Ochronosis, a buildup of dark (blue-black) pigment in certain tissues, is a characteristic feature of alkaptonuria. The pigment changes can be easily seen in the whites of the eyes (sclera), the outer ears, and the hands.\n\n**Effects on Joints**\n\nOchronosis in the joints causes people with alkaptonuria to develop arthritis, typically in early adulthood. Arthritis usually affects the spine and large joints (such as the hips and knees). Many affected individuals require joint replacements later in life.\n\n**Calcification of Tissues**\n\nOver time, the deposits of pigment can harden (calcify). Calcification in joints or ligaments causes them to become rigid and brittle, decreasing their flexibility and making them prone to damage. Calcification of the discs that separate the bones of the spine can cause further back pain.\n\n**Effects on Heart Valves**\n\nThis calcification can also affect the cartilage that makes up the valves of the heart, which allow blood to move through the heart and prevent blood from flowing backward. As a result, the heart valves narrow (stenosis), which can cause the valves to leak (regurgitation).\n\n**Kidney Effects**\n\nThe body removes the excess pigment in urine. However, removing the large pigment deposits found in people with alkaptonuria can put strain on the kidneys, and this can lead to kidney (renal) failure.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nWith appropriate medical management, people with alkaptonuria generally have a normal life expectancy.\n\n---\n\n**Alkaptonuria**\n\n**What is Alkaptonuria?**\n\nAlkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in the HGD gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. This enzyme helps break down the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are important building blocks of proteins.\n\n**How Does Alkaptonuria Affect the Body?**\n\nVariants in the HGD gene cause the cell to produce a version of the enzyme that does not function well. As a result, phenylalanine and tyrosine are not completely broken down. Instead, a substance called homogentisic acid accumulates in the body.\n\n**Symptoms of Alkaptonuria**\n\nExcess homogentisic acid settles in connective tissues, forming a substance called ochronotic pigment, which causes cartilage and skin to darken. Over time, a buildup of this pigment calcifies, leading to many of the health problems seen in people with alkaptonuria.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAKU, Alcaptonuria, Homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency, Homogentisic acidura\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Alkaptonuria\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Alkaptonuria\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ALKAPTONURIA; AKU\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Alkaptonuria**\n\n**What is Alkaptonuria?**\n\nAlkaptonuria is a rare condition in which a person's urine turns a dark brownish-black color when exposed to air. It is part of a group of conditions known as an inborn error of metabolism.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria. The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine, resulting in a build-up of homogentisic acid in the skin and other body tissues. This acid leaves the body through the urine, causing it to turn brownish-black when it mixes with air.\n\nAlkaptonuria is inherited, meaning it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nUrine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The disease is most often discovered in mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time\n* Darkening of the ear\n* Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA urine test is done to test for alkaptonuria. If ferric chloride is added to the urine, it will turn the urine black in people with this condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nManagement of alkaptonuria has traditionally been focused on controlling symptoms. Eating a low protein diet may be helpful, but many people find this restriction difficult. Medicines, such as NSAIDs and physical therapy, may help relieve joint pain.\n\nClinical trials are underway for other drugs to treat this condition and to assess whether the drug nitisinone provides long-term help with this illness.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome is expected to be good.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe build-up of homogentisic acid in the cartilage causes arthritis in many adults with alkaptonuria. Homogentisic acid can also build up on the heart valves, especially the mitral valve, which may lead to the need for valve replacement. Coronary artery disease may develop earlier in life in people with alkaptonuria. Kidney stones and prostate stones may be more common in people with alkaptonuria.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you notice that your own urine or your child's urine becomes dark brown or black when it is exposed to air.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for people with a family history of alkaptonuria who are considering having children. A blood test can be done to see if you carry the gene for alkaptonuria. Prenatal tests (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) can be done to screen a developing baby for this condition if the genetic change has been identified.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAKU; Alkaptonuria; Homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency; Alkaptonuric ochronosis\n\n---\n\n**Alkaptonuria**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAlkaptonuria is a rare condition in which a person's urine turns a dark brownish-black color when exposed to air.

    "content": "**Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAllan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is a rare disorder of brain development that causes moderate to severe intellectual disability and problems with movement. This condition, which occurs exclusively in males, disrupts development from before birth.\n\nAlthough affected males have impaired speech and a limited ability to communicate, they seem to enjoy interaction with other people.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost children with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and underdevelopment of many muscles (muscle hypoplasia). As they get older, they usually develop joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints. Abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), muscle weakness, and involuntary movements of the arms and legs also limit mobility.\n\nAs a result, many people with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome are unable to walk independently and become wheelchair-bound by adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAllan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome appears to be a rare disorder. About 25 families with individuals affected by this condition have been reported worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the SLC16A2 gene cause Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. The SLC16A2 gene, also known as MCT8, provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system.\n\nThis protein transports triiodothyronine (T3), a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, into nerve cells in the developing brain. T3 is essential for normal formation and growth of nerve cells, as well as the development of junctions between nerve cells (synapses).\n\nGene mutations alter the structure and function of the SLC16A2 protein, making it unable to transport T3 into nerve cells effectively. A lack of this critical hormone in certain parts of the brain disrupts normal brain development, resulting in intellectual disability and problems with movement.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAllan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and only affects males. Females can be carriers of the mutation but typically do not exhibit symptoms themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome**\n\n**What is Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome?**\n\nAllan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males. It is caused by mutations in the SLC16A2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system.\n\n**How does the SLC16A2 gene work?**\n\nThe SLC16A2 gene, also known as MCT8, produces a protein that transports a hormone called triiodothyronine (T3) into nerve cells in the developing brain. T3 is produced by the thyroid gland and is essential for the normal formation and growth of nerve cells, as well as the development of junctions between nerve cells.\n\n**What are the effects of SLC16A2 gene mutations?**\n\nMutations in the SLC16A2 gene alter the structure and function of the protein, making it unable to transport T3 into nerve cells effectively. This leads to a lack of T3 in certain parts of the brain, resulting in intellectual disability and problems with movement.\n\n**How is Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\n\n**What is the role of female carriers?**\n\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the mutated gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Carriers of SLC16A2 mutations have normal intelligence and do not experience problems with movement.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Allan-Herndon syndrome\n* MCT8 (SLC16A2)-specific thyroid hormone cell transporter deficiency\n* Mental retardation, X-linked, with hypotonia\n* Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ALLAN-HERNDON-DUDLEY SYNDROME; AHDS\n\n---\n\n**Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome**\n\n**What is Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome?**\n\nAllan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development and function of the thyroid gland, leading to severe intellectual disability, delayed speech, and other developmental delays.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nAHDS is caused by mutations in the MCT8 gene, which codes for a protein responsible for transporting thyroid hormones into cells. The syndrome is inherited in an X-linked pattern, meaning it affects males more frequently than females.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of AHDS include:\n\n* Severe intellectual disability\n* Delayed speech and language development\n* Delayed motor skills development\n* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland)\n* High levels of T3 (a type of thyroid hormone) in the blood\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the MCT8 gene. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Thyroid function tests (TFTs)\n* T3 test\n* Genetic testing for MCT8 mutations\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for AHDS, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Thyroid hormone replacement therapy to manage hypothyroidism\n* Speech and language therapy to improve communication skills\n* Physical therapy to improve motor skills\n* Genetic counseling to inform families about the risk of inheritance\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with AHDS is generally poor, with most experiencing severe intellectual disability and significant developmental delays. However, with proper treatment and management, some individuals may experience improved outcomes.\n\n**References**\n\n* Dumitrescu AM, Liao XH, Weiss RE, Millen K, Refetoff S.

    "content": "**Allergic Asthma**\n\nAsthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction.\n\n**What Are Allergens?**\n\nAllergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common allergens include:\n\n*   Pollen\n*   Dust\n*   Animal dander\n*   Mold\n\nThe immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder.\n\n**Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness**\n\nA hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as:\n\n*   Physical activity\n*   Respiratory infections\n*   Exposure to tobacco smoke\n\n**Symptoms of an Asthma Attack**\n\nAn asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus.\n\nDuring an attack, an affected individual can experience:\n\n*   Chest tightness\n*   Wheezing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Coughing\n\nOver time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.\n\n**The Atopic March**\n\nSome people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma.\n\nHowever, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Asthma**\n\n**What is Allergic Asthma?**\n\nAllergic asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways.\n\n**Symptoms of Allergic Asthma**\n\nThe symptoms of allergic asthma include:\n\n*   Chest tightness\n*   Wheezing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Coughing\n\nOver time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.\n\n**Relationship with Other Allergic Disorders**\n\nSome people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma.\n\n**Frequency of Allergic Asthma**\n\nApproximately 235 million people worldwide have asthma. In the United States, the condition affects an estimated 8 percent of the population. In nearly 90 percent of children and 50 percent of adults with asthma, the condition is classified as allergic asthma.\n\n**Causes of Allergic Asthma**\n\nThe cause of allergic asthma is complex. It is likely that a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of the condition. Doctors believe genes are involved because having a family member with allergic asthma or another allergic disorder increases a person's risk of developing asthma.\n\nStudies suggest that more than 100 genes may be associated with allergic asthma, but each seems to be a factor in only one or a few populations. Many of the associated genes are involved in the body's immune response. Others play a role in lung and airway function.\n\nThere is evidence that an unbalanced immune response underlies allergic asthma. While there is normally a balance between type 1 (or Th1) and type 2 (or Th2) immune reactions in the body, many individuals with allergic asthma predominantly have type 2 reactions. Type 2 reactions lead to the production of immune proteins called IgE antibodies and the generation of other factors that predispose to bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n\nNot everyone with a variation in one of the allergic asthma-associated genes develops the condition; exposure to certain environmental factors also contributes to its development. Studies suggest that these exposures trigger epigenetic changes to the DNA. Epigenetic changes modify DNA without changing the DNA sequence. They can affect gene activity and regulate the production of proteins, which may influence the development of allergies in susceptible individuals.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAllergic asthma is a complex condition with multiple genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. Understanding the causes of allergic asthma can help identify potential treatments and preventions for this common breathing disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Asthma**\n\n**What is Allergic Asthma?**\n\nAllergic asthma is a type of asthma that is triggered by allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   Sorder increases a person's risk of developing asthma.\n*   Studies suggest that more than 100 genes may be associated with allergic asthma, but each seems to be a factor in only one or a few populations.\n*   Many of the associated genes are involved in the body's immune response. Others play a role in lung and airway function.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAllergic asthma can be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. People with mutations in one or more of the associated genes inherit an increased risk of allergic asthma, not the condition itself.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nExtrinsic asthma\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Inherited susceptibility to asthma\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n*   ASTHMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\n*   PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Asthma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n*   What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n*   How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   Allergic asthma is caused by an overreaction of the immune system to substances like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\n*   The exact cause of allergic asthma is still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Allergy\n*   Asthma\n*   Asthma in Children\n*   Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Allergic Conjunctivitis**\n\nThe conjunctiva is a clear layer of tissue lining the eyelids and covering the white of the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes swollen or inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen your eyes are exposed to allergens (which cause allergies), a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy, and teary very quickly.\n\nThe pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever.\n\nYour symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground.\n\nMold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also.\n\nAllergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term \"allergy\" even when they might not truly be an allergy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Intense itching or burning eyes\n*   Puffy eyelids, most often in the morning\n*   Red eyes\n*   Stringy eye discharge\n*   Tearing (watery eyes)\n*   Widened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider may look for the following:\n\n*   Small, raised bumps on the inside of the eyelids (papillary conjunctivitis)\n*   Positive skin test for suspected allergens on allergy tests\n\nAllergy testing may identify the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms.\n\nSkin testing is the most common method of allergy testing.\nSkin testing is more likely to be done if symptoms do not respond to treatment.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe best treatment is to avoid what causes your allergy symptoms as much as possible. Common triggers to avoid include dust, mold and pollen.\n\nSome things you can do to ease symptoms are:\n\n*   Use lubricating eye drops.\n*   Apply cool compresses to the eyes.\n*   Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.\n*   Take over-the-counter oral antihistamines or antihistamine or decongestant eye drops. These medicines can offer more relief, but they can sometimes make your eyes dry. Do not use the eye drops if you have contact lenses in place. Also, do not use the decongestant eye drops for more than 5 days, as rebound congestion can occur.\n\nIf home-care does not help, you may need to see a provider for treatments such as eye drops that contain antihistamines or eye drops that reduce swelling.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSymptoms often go away with treatment. However, they can persist if you continue to be exposed to the allergen.\n\nLong-term swelling of the outer lining of the eyes may occur in those with chronic allergies or asthma. It is called vernal conjunctivitis. It is most common in young males, and most often occurs during the spring and summer.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn severe cases of allergic conjunctivitis, there could be more severe inflammation. This can, rarely, affect your vision.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis that do not respond to self-care steps and over-the-counter treatment.\n*   Your vision is affected.\n*   You develop eye pain that is severe or becoming worse.\n*   Your eyelids or the skin around your eyes becomes swollen or red.\n*   You have a headache in addition to your other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Conjunctivitis**\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen your eyes are exposed to allergens (which cause allergies), a substance called histamine is released by your body.

They can be breathed into the lungs, swallowed, or injected.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\n*   Allergic reactions are common.\n*   The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever.\n*   Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen.\n*   Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life threatening.\n*   They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body.\n*   The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock.\n*   Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nCommon allergens include:\n\n*   Animal dander\n*   Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants\n*   Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish\n*   Medicines\n*   Pollens\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include:\n\n*   A few hives (especially over the neck and face)\n*   Itching\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Rashes\n*   Watery, red eyes\n\nSymptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds\n*   Anxiety\n*   Chest discomfort or tightness\n*   Cough\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Difficulty breathing, wheezing\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Flushing or redness of the face\n*   Hives all over\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Palpitations\n*   Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue\n*   Unconsciousness\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**First Aid**\n\nFor a mild to moderate reaction:\n\n*   Calm and reassure the person having the reaction. Anxiety can make symptoms worse.\n*   Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact with it.\n*   If the person develops an itchy rash, apply cool compresses and an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.\n*   Watch the person for signs of increasing distress.\n*   Get medical help. For a mild reaction, a health care provider may recommend over-the-counter medicines, such as antihistamines.\n\nFor a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):\n\n*   Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABC's of Basic Life Support). A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.\n*   Call 911 or the local emergency number.\n*   Calm and reassure the person.\n*   If the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something firm (such as a fingernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers -- squeezing the stinger will release more venom.\n*   If the person has injectable emergency allergy medicine (Epinephrine), administer it at the beginning of a reaction. Do not wait to see if the reaction gets worse. Avoid oral medicine if the person is having difficulty breathing.\n*   Take steps to prevent shock. Have the person lie flat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover them with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected or if it causes discomfort.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent allergic reactions:\n\n*   Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past.\n*   Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Carefully check ingredient labels.\n*   If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction.\n*   People who have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag and carry emergency such as a two-pack of injectable epinephrine, according to their provider's instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Allergic Reactions**\n\nAllergic reactions are sensitivities to substances called allergens that come into contact with the skin, nose, eyes, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. They can be breathed into the lungs, swallowed, or injected.\n\n**Causes of Allergic Reactions**\n\nSubstances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medicines, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people. First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction, but repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions.\n\nOnce a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (and thus is sensitized to an allergen), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction. Most severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen, but some reactions can occur after several hours.\n\n**Symptoms of Allergic Reactions**\n\nCommon symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include:\n\n*   A few hives (especially over the neck and face)\n*   Itching\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Rashes\n*   Watery, red eyes\n\nSymptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds\n*   Anxiety\n*   Chest discomfort or tightness\n*   Cough\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Difficulty breathing, wheezing\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Flushing or redness of the face\n*   Hives all over\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Palpitations\n*   Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue\n*   Unconsciousness\n\n**First Aid for Allergic Reactions**\n\nFor a mild to moderate reaction:\n\n*   Calm and reassure the person having the reaction.

    "content": "**Allergic Rhinitis - Self-Care**\n\n**What is allergic rhinitis?**\n\nAllergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a group of symptoms that affect your nose when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust mites, animal dander, or pollen.\n\n**Avoid Your Triggers**\n\nThings that make allergies worse are called triggers. To limit your exposure to them:\n\n* Reduce dust and dust mites in the home.\n* Control molds indoors and out.\n* Avoid exposure to plant pollen and animals.\n\nSome changes you may need to make include:\n\n* Installing furnace filters or other air filters\n* Removing furniture and carpets from your floors\n* Using a dehumidifier to dry the air in your house\n* Changing where your pets sleep and eat\n* Avoiding certain outdoor tasks\n* Changing how you clean your house\n\n**Medicines for Allergic Rhinitis**\n\nNasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment. Many brands are available, and some can be bought without a prescription.\n\nThey work best when used every day:\n\n* It may take 2 or more weeks of steady use for symptoms to improve.\n* They are safe for children and adults.\n\nAntihistamines are medicines that work well for treating allergy symptoms. They come in various forms, including pills, capsules, liquids, and nasal sprays.\n\n* Many can be bought without a prescription.\n* Older antihistamines can cause sleepiness and affect a child's ability to learn or make it unsafe for adults to drive or use machinery.\n* Newer antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness or learning problems.\n\nDecongestants are medicines that help dry up a runny or stuffy nose. They come as pills, liquids, capsules, or nasal sprays and can be bought over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription.\n\n**Nasal Wash**\n\nFor mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from your nose. You can buy a saline spray at a drugstore or make one at home using 1 cup of purchased distilled water, 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, and a pinch of baking soda.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nMake an appointment with your provider if:\n\n* You have severe allergy or hay fever symptoms.\n* Your symptoms do not get better when you treat them.\n* You are wheezing or coughing more.\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Rhinitis - Self-Care**\n\n**Avoid Your Triggers**\n\nThings that make allergies worse are called triggers. It may be impossible to completely avoid all triggers. But, you can do many things to limit your or your child's exposure to them:\n\n* Reduce dust and dust mites in the home.\n* Control molds indoors and out.\n* Avoid exposure to plant pollen and animals.\n\nSome changes you may need to make include:\n\n* Installing furnace filters or other air filters\n* Removing furniture and carpets from your floors\n* Using a dehumidifier to dry the air in your house\n* Changing where your pets sleep and eat\n* Avoiding certain outdoor tasks\n* Changing how you clean your house\n\nThe amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop. More pollen is in the air on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground.\n\n**Medicines for Allergic Rhinitis**\n\nNasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment. Many brands are available. You can buy some brands without a prescription. For other brands, you need a prescription.\n\nThey work best when you use them every day.\nIt may take 2 or more weeks of steady use for your symptoms to improve.\nThey are safe for children and adults.\n\nAntihistamines are medicines that work well for treating allergy symptoms. They are often used when symptoms do not occur very often or do not last very long.\n\nMany can be bought as a pill, capsule, or liquid without a prescription.\nOlder antihistamines can cause sleepiness. They may affect a child's ability to learn and make it unsafe for adults to drive or use machinery.\nNewer antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness or learning problems.\n\nAntihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. They are only available with a prescription.\n\nDecongestants are medicines that help dry up a runny or stuffy nose. They come as pills, liquids, capsules, or nasal sprays. You can buy them over-the-counter (OTC), without a prescription.\n\nYou can use them along with antihistamine pills or liquids.\nDo not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days in a row.\nTalk to your child's health care provider before giving decongestants to your child.\n\n**Nasal Wash**\n\nFor mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from your nose.

    "content": "**Allergic Rhinitis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Allergic Rhinitis?**\n\nAllergic rhinitis is a group of symptoms affecting the nose when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to.\n\nThis article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms.\n\nHay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen.\n\nPlants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area.\n\nThe amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not.\n\nHot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air.\nOn cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground.\n\nHay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include:\n\n* Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area\n* Problems with smell\n* Runny nose\n* Sneezing\n* Watery eyes\n\nSymptoms that may develop later include:\n\n* Stuffy nose (nasal congestion)\n* Coughing\n* Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell\n* Sore throat\n* Dark circles under the eyes\n* Puffiness under the eyes\n* Fatigue and irritability\n* Headache\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens.\n\nAllergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing.\n\nIf your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances.\n\nA blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure.\n\nYou may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered.\n\nFor mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda.\n\nTreatments for allergic rhinitis include:\n\n* **Antihistamines**: Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long.\n* **Corticosteroids**: Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time.\n* **Decongestants**: Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness.\n* **Leukotriene inhibitors**: These are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms.\n* **Allergy shots**: Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control.\n* **Sublingual immunotherapy treatment (SLIT)**: Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots.\n\nSome people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\n\n* You have severe hay fever symptoms\n* Treatment that once worked for you no longer works\n* Your symptoms do not respond to treatment\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHay fever; Nasal allergies; Seasonal allergy; Seasonal allergic rhinitis; Allergies - allergic rhinitis; Allergy - allergic rhinitis\n\n---\n\n**Allergic Rhinitis**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy.

When they get released into the air, you can see and hear the result.*\nWhen allergens first encounter nasal tissue, sneezing is triggered. This is part of the body’s immune defense.\nPollen allergens then encounter the plasma cells in the nose, which respond by producing antibodies. These antibodies attach to mast cells, which are white blood cells containing the chemical histamine. As more antibodies are produced, they cause the mast cells to release histamine, which produces allergy symptoms such as a stuffy and runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

Editorial team.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Learn how to cite this page**\nBrowse the Encyclopedia\n\n---\n\n**Allergies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are allergies?**\n\nAn allergy is an overreaction of the immune system to a harmless substance, such as pollen or peanuts. When an allergen enters the body, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it off. This can lead to symptoms like sneezing, itching, and difficulty breathing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of allergies**\n\nThere are several types of allergies, including:\n\n*   **Allergic rhinitis**: an allergy to pollen, dust, or pet dander that causes congestion, sneezing, and itchy eyes\n*   **Food allergy**: an immune reaction to certain foods like peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy, or wheat\n*   **Skin allergy**: an allergic reaction to substances like latex, poison ivy, or nickel\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of allergies**\n\nThe symptoms of an allergy can vary depending on the type and severity of the reaction. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   Congestion and sneezing (allergic rhinitis)\n*   Hives, itching, and swelling (skin allergy)\n*   Stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting (food allergy)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment for allergies**\n\nThe treatment for an allergy depends on the severity of the reaction and may include:\n\n*   **Avoiding triggers**: staying away from substances that cause allergic reactions\n*   **Medications**: using antihistamines, decongestants, or corticosteroids to relieve symptoms\n*   **Immunotherapy**: receiving shots or sublingual tablets to desensitize the body to allergens\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing allergies**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent allergies, some strategies may help reduce the risk of developing an allergy. These include:\n\n*   **Breastfeeding**: nursing babies for at least four months may lower their risk of developing allergies\n*   **Early introduction of allergens**: introducing common allergenic foods like peanuts and eggs to infants may help prevent allergies later in life\n\n\\n\\n",

This can be done through skin tests, blood tests, or elimination diets.\n*   **Treatment and prevention**\n    Treatment for allergies depends on the severity of the symptoms and may involve medications such as antihistamines or corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. In some cases, immunotherapy (allergy shots) may be recommended to desensitize the person to the allergen.

It is important to know your triggers because avoiding them is your first step toward feeling better. Dust is a common trigger.\n\n**Dust and Dust Mites**\n\nWhen your asthma or allergies become worse due to dust, you are said to have a dust allergy.\n\nVery tiny insects called dust mites are the main cause of dust allergies. Dust mites can only be seen under a microscope. Most dust mites in your home are found in bedding, mattresses, and box springs.\nHouse dust may also contain tiny particles of pollen, mold, fibers from clothing and fabrics, and detergents. All of these can also trigger allergies and asthma.\n\n**Choose the Right Home Furnishings**\n\nYou can do many things to limit your or your child's exposure to dust and dust mites.\n\nReplace blinds that have slats and cloth draperies with pull-down shades. They will not collect as much dust.\n\nDust particles collect in fabrics and carpets.\n\nIf you can, get rid of fabric or upholstered furniture. Wood, leather, and vinyl are better.\nAvoid sleeping or lying on cushions and furniture that are covered in cloth.\nReplace wall-to-wall carpet with wood or other hard flooring.\n\nSince mattresses, box springs, and pillows are hard to avoid:\n\nWrap them with mite-proof covers.\nWash bedding and pillows once a week in hot water (130°F [54.4°C] to 140°F [60°C]).\n\n**Other Tips**\n\nKeep indoor air dry.

Schwartz, MD, FAAP**\n\nAs we discussed in our previous articles on allergies and asthma, dust is a common allergen that can trigger symptoms in people with respiratory issues. In this final part of our series, we'll delve deeper into the world of indoor allergens.\n\n**Indoor Allergens**\n\nAccording to Dr. Ts-Mills TAE's chapter in Middleton's Allergy: Principles and Practice, indoor allergens are a significant concern for individuals with allergies and asthma. Dust mites, in particular, are a common culprit behind allergy symptoms. These tiny creatures thrive in warm, humid environments and leave behind waste products that can trigger allergic reactions.\n\n**Reducing Exposure to Indoor Allergens**\n\nTo alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life, it's essential to reduce exposure to indoor allergens. Here are some practical tips:\n\n*   Use dust mite-proof pillow covers to prevent these pesky creatures from inhabiting your bedding.\n*   Install HEPA air filters in your home to trap airborne allergens and reduce their concentration.\n\nBy implementing these simple measures, you can significantly reduce your exposure to indoor allergens and alleviate symptoms associated with allergies and asthma.",

    "content": "**Allergies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nAn **allergy** is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAllergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies.\n\nThe immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system can also react to foreign substances called allergens. These allergens are usually harmless, and in most people do not cause a problem.\n\nIn a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**Common Allergens**\n\n*   Drugs\n*   Dust\n*   Food\n*   Insect venom\n*   Mold\n*   Pet and other animal dander\n*   Pollen\n\nSome people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example:\n\n*   Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing.\n*   Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes.\n*   Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or skin peeling.\n\nAt times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur.\n\nAllergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food (food poisoning) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSevere allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital.\n\nThe best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and medicine allergies.\n\nThere are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your provider recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health.\n\n**Medicines**\n\n*   **ANTIHISTAMINES**: Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including capsules and pills, eye drops, injection, liquid, nasal spray.\n*   **CORTICOSTEROIDS**: These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms, including creams, lotions, and ointment for the skin, eye drops, nasal spray, lung inhaler, pills, injection.\n*   **DECONGESTANTS**: Decongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution.\n*   **OTHER MEDICINES**: Leukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. People with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines.\n*   **ALLERGY SHOTS**: Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. Allergy shots are only used for environmental allergies (pollens, pet dander, dust) or venom allergies. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the provider often.\n*   **SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)**: Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass, ragweed, and dust mite allergies.\n*   **ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY (OIT)**: For people with peanut allergy, oral immunotherapy may be an option. This treatment involves eating tiny amounts of peanut powder and slowly increasing the dose over time until they are eating the equivalent of about 1 peanut every day. OIT is a treatment rather than a cure of food allergy and there is a risk of allergic reaction with the dosing of the peanut powder. This requires a significant commitment of time for visits to the provider and dosing at home.\n*   **XOLAIR**: Xolair (omalizumab) is a medication that was recently approved for the treatment of food allergies. Xolair does not cure food allergies but can decrease a person’s likelihood of reacting to a tiny amount of their food allergen. Xolair is an injection that is given either once a month or every 2 weeks, depending on the results of a blood test. People can be allergic to Xolair and there may be an increased risk of certain cancers or heart issues in people taking Xolair. Talk to your provider about Xolair if you have food allergies.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nAsk your provider if there are any asthma and allergy support groups in your area.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost allergies can be easily treated with medicine.\n\nSome children may outgrow an allergy, especially food allergies. But once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it usually continues to affect the person.\n\nAllergy shots are most effective when used to treat hay fever and insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction.\n\nAllergy shots may need years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis). Talk with your provider whether allergy drops (SLIT) are right for you.\n\n---\n\n**Allergies**\n\nAn allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful. Allergies are very common, and both genes and environment play a role.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIf both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies. The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. However, in a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response, releasing chemicals like histamines that cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**Common Allergens**\n\nSome common allergens include:\n\n* Drugs\n* Dust\n* Food\n* Insect venom\n* Mold\n* Pet and other animal dander\n* Pollen\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example:\n\n* Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing.\n* Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes.\n* Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or skin peeling.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur. Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSevere allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital. The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and medicine allergies.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBreastfeeding may help prevent certain food allergies when you feed babies this way only for 4 to 6 months. However, changing a mother's diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding does not seem to help prevent allergies. For most children, changing the diet or using special formulas does not seem to prevent allergies.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result from allergies or their treatment include:\n\n* Anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction)\n* Breathing problems and discomfort during the allergic reaction\n* Drowsiness and other side effects of medicines\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\n\n* Severe symptoms of allergy occur\n* Treatment for allergies no longer works\n\n---\n\n\\n\\n**What Are Allergies?**\n\nAn allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.\n\n**Causes of Allergies**\n\nAllergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies.\n\n\\n\\n**How Does the Immune System React to Allergens?**\n\nThe immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system can also react to foreign substances called allergens. These allergens are usually harmless, and in most people do not cause a problem.\n\nIn a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n**Common Allergens**\n\nCommon allergens include:\n\n*   Pollen\n*   Dust mites\n*   Pet dander\n*   Mold\n*   Insect stings\n\n---\n\n**Allergies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens in the Body During an Allergy?**\n\nAs an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Allergens**\n\n*   Drugs\n*   Dust\n*   Food\n*   Insect venom\n*   Mold\n*   Pet and other animal dander\n*   Pollen\n\nSome people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.\n\nAllergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma, worse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Allergies**\n\nAllergies are very common.

For example, eating contaminated food (food poisoning) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection.\n\nSkin testing is the most common method of allergy testing:\n\n*   The prick test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substances on the skin, and then slightly pricking the area so the substance goes under the skin. The skin is closely watched for signs of a reaction, which include swelling and redness.\n*   The intradermal test involves injecting a tiny amount of allergen under your skin, then watching the skin for a reaction.\n*   Both the prick and intradermal tests are read 15 minutes after application of the test.\n*   The patch test involves placing a patch with the suspected allergen on your skin. The skin is then closely watched for signs of a reaction. This test is used to determine contact allergy. It is usually read 48 to 72 hours after application of the test.\n\nThe provider may also check your reaction to physical triggers by applying heat, cold, or other stimulation to your body and watching for an allergic response.\n\nBlood tests that may be done include:\n\n*   Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which measures levels of allergy-related substances\n*   Complete blood count (CBC) during which an eosinophil white blood cell count is done\n\n---\n\n**Allergies**\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nlood tests that may be done include:\n\n* Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which measures levels of allergy-related substances\n* Complete blood count (CBC) during which an eosinophil white blood cell count is done\n\nIn some cases, the provider may tell you to avoid certain items to see if you get better, or to use suspected items to see if you feel worse. This is called \"use or elimination testing.\" This is often used to check for food or medicine allergies.\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur.\n\nAllergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems.

If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital.\n\nThe best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and medicine allergies.\n\nThere are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your provider recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health.\n\nIllnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments.\n\nMedicines that can be used to treat allergies include:\n\n* **ANTIHISTAMINES**\n\t+ Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including:\n\t\t- Capsules and pills\n\t\t- Eye drops\n\t\t- Injection\n\t\t- Liquid\n\t\t- Nasal spray\n* **CORTICOSTEROIDS**\n\t+ These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms, including:\n\t\t- Creams, lotions, and ointment for the skin\n\t\t- Eye drops\n\t\t- Nasal spray\n\t\t- Lung inhaler\n\t\t- Pills\n\t\t- Injection\n* **DECONGESTANTS**\n\t+ Decongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution.\n* **OTHER MEDICINES**\n\t+ Leukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. People with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines.\n* **ALLERGY SHOTS**\n\t+ Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. Allergy shots are only used for environmental allergies (pollens, pet dander, dust) or venom allergies. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the provider often.\n* **SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)** \n\t+ Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass, ragweed, and dust mite allergies.\n* **ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY (OIT)**\n\t+ For people with peanut allergy, oral immunotherapy may be an option. This treatment involves eating tiny amounts of peanut powder and slowly increasing the dose over time until they are eating the equivalent of about 1 peanut every day. OIT is a treatment rather than a cure of food allergy and there is a risk of allergic reaction with the dosing of the peanut powder. This requires a significant commitment of time for visits to the provider and dosing at home.\n* **XOLAIR**\n\t+ Xolair (omalizumab) is a medication that was recently approved for the treatment of food allergies. Xolair does not cure food allergies but can decrease a person’s likelihood of reacting to a tiny amount of their food allergen. Xolair is an injection that is given either once a month or every 2 weeks, depending on the results of a blood test. People can be allergic to Xolair and there may be an increased risk of certain cancers or heart issues in people taking Xolair. Talk to your provider about Xolair if you have food allergies.\n\n---\n\n**Allergies**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Medicines for Allergies**\n\nThere are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies.

However, changing a mother's diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding does not seem to help prevent allergies.\n\nFor most children, changing the diet or using special formulas does not seem to prevent allergies. If a parent, brother, sister, or other family member has a history of eczema and allergies, discuss feeding with your child's doctor. Infants with eczema or food allergy often benefit from early introduction (before 12 months of life) of peanuts and/or eggs. Discuss with your child’s provider if this is something that you should do.\n\nThere is also evidence that being exposed to certain allergens (such as dust mites and cat dander) in the first year of life may prevent some allergies. This is called the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" It came from the observation that infants on farms tend to have fewer allergies than those who grow up in more sterile environments. However, older children do not seem to benefit.\n\nOnce allergies have developed, treating the allergies and carefully avoiding allergy triggers can prevent reactions in the future.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Allergy - allergies\n* Allergy - allergens\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* Allergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - adult\n* Allergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - child\n* Asthma - quick-relief drugs\n\n**Images**\n\n* Hives (urticaria) on the arm\n* Hives (urticaria) on the chest\n* Introduction to allergy treatment\n* Allergies\n* Antibodies\n* Histamine is released\n\n**References**\n\n* Chiriac AM, Bousquet J, Demoly P.

Do you know what's causing your symptoms?\n\n**What is an allergy?**\n\nAn allergy is a condition where your body reacts too strongly to a harmless substance, like pollen or peanuts. When this happens, your immune system thinks the substance is a threat and sends out chemicals to fight it.\n\n**Types of allergies**\n\nThere are many types of allergies, including:\n\n* **Food allergies**: reactions to foods like peanuts, milk, or eggs\n* **Insect sting allergy**: severe reactions to insect bites\n* **Environmental allergies**: reactions to pollen, dust, or mold\n\n**Symptoms of an allergy**\n\nThe symptoms of an allergy can vary depending on the type of allergy and how severe it is. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* **Hives**\n* **Itching**\n* **Swelling**\n* **Stomach cramps**\n* **Diarrhea**\n\n**How to treat an allergy**\n\nIf you have a mild allergy, you may be able to treat your symptoms with over-the-counter medications or home remedies. However, if you have a severe allergy, you may need to see a doctor for further treatment.\n\n**Preventing allergies**\n\nWhile there's no surefire way to prevent allergies, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n* **Avoid exposure**: try to avoid coming into contact with substances that trigger your allergies\n* **Wash your hands**: regularly washing your hands can help prevent the spread of allergens\n* **Get enough vitamin C**: vitamin C may help boost your immune system and reduce your risk of developing an allergy\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you're looking for more information on allergies, here are some resources to get you started:\n\n* **MedlinePlus Health Topic: Allergy**\n* **National Library of Medicine: Allergies - español (Spanish) Bilingual PDF**\n\nRemember, if you suspect you have an allergy, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
