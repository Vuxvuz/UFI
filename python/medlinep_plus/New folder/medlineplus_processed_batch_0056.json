In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of the digestive system, exploring the various diseases that affect it and the latest research in the field.\n\n**The Function of Chloride Channels in Digestive System Disease**\n\nChloride channels play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of fluids within the body. Research has shown that abnormalities in chloride channel function can lead to various digestive disorders, including cystic fibrosis and certain types of gastrointestinal cancer. Understanding the function of these channels is essential for developing effective treatments for these conditions.\n\n**An Application of Deep Learning Model InceptionTime to Predict Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea**\n\nThe use of deep learning models has revolutionized the field of medicine, enabling healthcare professionals to make more accurate diagnoses and predictions. In this study, researchers employed the InceptionTime model to predict nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. The results showed a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.\n\n**Socioeconomic and Demographic Disparities in the Impact of Digestive Diseases**\n\nDigestive diseases affect individuals from all walks of life, but research has shown that certain socioeconomic and demographic factors can exacerbate their impact. For example, studies have found that individuals with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience delayed diagnosis and treatment for digestive disorders. Understanding these disparities is essential for developing targeted interventions and improving health outcomes.\n\n**Definitions of Digestive Terms**\n\n*   **Abdominal sounds**: The sounds produced by the movement of food, gas, and fluids within the digestive tract.\n*   **Barium enema**: A medical imaging procedure that uses a contrast agent to visualize the colon and rectum.\n*   **Black or tarry stools**: Stools that are dark in color due to the presence of digested blood.\n*   **Digestive diseases**: Conditions that affect the digestive system, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n*   **EGD discharge**: The fluid discharged during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n*   **Fecal fat**: The amount of fat present in stool, which can be used as a diagnostic indicator for certain digestive disorders.\n*   **Gastrointestinal fistula**: An abnormal connection between the digestive tract and another organ or the skin.\n*   **Gastrointestinal perforation**: A hole in the wall of the digestive tract that allows food, fluids, and gas to escape into the abdominal cavity.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   **Celiac disease**: A chronic autoimmune disorder caused by a reaction to gluten in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition.\n*   **Colonic diseases**: Conditions that affect the colon, such as diverticulitis and colorectal cancer.\n*   **Constipation**: A condition characterized by infrequent or difficult bowel movements.\n*   **Diverticulosis and diverticulitis**: Conditions where small pouches form in the wall of the colon, which can become inflamed and cause symptoms.\n*   **Gas**: The presence of gas within the digestive tract, which can be caused by swallowing air or the fermentation of food.\n*   **Gastroenteritis**: An inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, often caused by infection with a virus, bacteria, or parasite.\n*   **GERD**: A condition characterized by chronic acid reflux and symptoms such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing.\n*   **Indigestion**: A condition characterized by discomfort in the upper abdomen after eating, often due to poor digestion of food.\n*   **Intestinal obstruction**: A blockage of the small or large intestine that prevents normal flow of food, fluids, and gas.\n*   **Liver diseases**: Conditions that affect the liver, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.\n*   **Peptic ulcer**: An open sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum, often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*   **Small intestine disorders**: Conditions that affect the small intestine, such as celiac disease and Crohn's disease.\n*   **Stomach disorders**: Conditions that affect the stomach, such as gastritis and gastric cancer.\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on digestive diseases is the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",

    "content": "**Digestive Diseases**\n\nDigestive diseases are disorders of the digestive tract, which is sometimes called the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\n**The Digestive Process**\n\nIn digestion, food and drink are broken down into small parts (called nutrients) that the body can absorb and use as energy and building blocks for cells.\n\n**The Digestive Tract**\n\nThe digestive tract is made up of the esophagus (food tube), stomach, large and small intestines, liver, pancreas, and the gallbladder.\n\n**Symptoms of Digestive Problems**\n\nThe first sign of problems in the digestive tract often includes one or more of the following symptoms:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Bloating\n* Constipation\n* Diarrhea\n* Heartburn\n* Incontinence\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in the belly\n* Swallowing problems\n* Weight gain or loss\n\n**Common Digestive Diseases**\n\nA digestive disease is any health problem that occurs in the digestive tract. Conditions may range from mild to serious. Some common problems include:\n\n* Heartburn\n* Cancer\n* Irritable bowel syndrome\n* Lactose intolerance\n* Gallstones, cholecystitis, and cholangitis\n* Rectal problems, such as anal fissure, hemorrhoids, proctitis, and rectal prolapse\n* Esophagus problems, such as stricture (narrowing), achalasia, and esophagitis\n* Stomach problems, including gastritis, gastric ulcers (usually caused by Helicobacter pylori infection) and cancer\n* Liver problems, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, cirrhosis, liver failure, and autoimmune and alcoholic hepatitis\n* Pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst\n* Intestinal problems, such as polyps and cancer, infections, celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, and intestinal ischemia\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and hiatal hernia\n\n**Tests for Digestive Problems**\n\nTests for digestive problems can include:\n\n* Colonoscopy\n* Upper GI endoscopy\n* Capsule endoscopy\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n* Endoscopic ultrasound\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nMany surgical procedures are performed on the digestive tract. These include procedures done using endoscopy, laparoscopy, and open surgery. Organ transplants can be performed on the liver, pancreas, and small intestine.\n\nMany health care providers can help diagnose and treat digestive problems. A gastroenterologist is a physician specialist who has received extra training in the diagnosis and treatment of the digestive disorders. Other providers involved in the treatment of digestive diseases include:\n\n* Nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants (PAs)\n* Nutritionists or dietitians\n* Primary care doctors\n* Radiologists\n* Surgeons\n\n---\n\n**Digestive Diseases**\n\nThe digestive tract is made up of the esophagus (food tube), stomach, large and small intestines, liver, pancreas, and the gallbladder.\n\n**Symptoms of Digestive Problems**\n\n* Bleeding\n* Bloating\n* Constipation\n* Diarrhea\n* Heartburn\n* Incontinence\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in the belly\n* Swallowing problems\n* Weight gain or loss\n\n**Digestive Diseases**\n\nA digestive disease is any health problem that occurs in the digestive tract. Conditions may range from mild to serious.\n\nSome common problems include:\n\n* Heartburn\n* Cancer\n* Irritable bowel syndrome\n* Lactose intolerance\n\nOther digestive diseases include:\n\n* Gallstones, cholecystitis, and cholangitis\n* Rectal problems, such as anal fissure, hemorrhoids, proctitis, and rectal prolapse\n* Esophagus problems, such as stricture (narrowing), achalasia, and esophagitis\n* Stomach problems, including gastritis, gastric ulcers (usually caused by Helicobacter pylori infection) and cancer\n\nLiver problems, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, cirrhosis, liver failure, and autoimmune and alcoholic hepatitis\n\nPancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst\n\nIntestinal problems, such as polyps and cancer, infections, celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, and intestinal ischemia\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and hiatal hernia\n\n**Tests for Digestive Problems**\n\n* Colonoscopy\n* Upper GI endoscopy\n* Capsule endoscopy\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n* Endoscopic ultrasound\n\n**Surgical Procedures for Digestive Diseases**\n\nMany surgical procedures are performed on the digestive tract. These include procedures done using endoscopy, laparoscopy, and open surgery. Organ transplants can be performed on the liver, pancreas, and small intestine.\n\n**Health Care Providers Involved in Treatment of Digestive Diseases**\n\n* Gastroenterologist\n* Nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants (PAs)\n* Nutritionists or dietitians\n* Primary care doctors\n* Radiologists\n* Surgeons\n\n---\n\n**Digestive Diseases**\n\n**What are digestive diseases?**\n\nDigestive diseases, also known as gastrointestinal disorders, refer to a group of conditions that affect the digestive system. The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and utilized by the body.\n\n**Types of Digestive Diseases**\n\nThere are many different types of digestive diseases, including:\n\n*   **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: This includes conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n*   **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: This is a condition in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.\n*   **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: This is a condition characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.\n*   **Celiac disease**: This is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to react to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n*   **Pancreatitis**: This is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be acute or chronic.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of many digestive diseases is unknown, but there are several risk factors that may increase a person's likelihood of developing these conditions. These include:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Some people may be born with a predisposition to certain digestive diseases.\n*   **Environmental factors**: Exposure to certain toxins or infections may trigger the development of digestive disease.\n*   **Diet**: A diet high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats may contribute to the development of digestive disease.\n*   **Family history**: People with a family history of digestive disease may be more likely to develop these conditions.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of digestive diseases can vary depending on the specific condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: This is often described as cramping or discomfort in the abdomen.\n*   **Bloating**: This is a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen.\n*   **Changes in bowel movements**: This may include diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool consistency.\n*   **Nausea and vomiting**: These symptoms can occur in response to inflammation or infection in the digestive tract.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of digestive disease typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The specific diagnostic approach will depend on the suspected condition and may include:\n\n*   **Endoscopy**: This is a procedure in which a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted through the mouth to visualize the inside of the digestive tract.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This is a procedure in which a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted through the rectum to visualize the inside of the colon.\n*   **Imaging studies**: These may include X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the structure and function of the digestive tract.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of digestive disease depends on the specific condition and may involve a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and surgical interventions. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Dietary changes**: This may involve avoiding trigger foods or following a specialized diet such as a gluten-free diet.\n*   **Medications**: These may include antibiotics to treat infection, anti-inflammatory medications to reduce inflammation, or medications to manage symptoms such as pain or diarrhea.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue or repair a hole in the digestive tract.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent all digestive diseases, there are several steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing these conditions. These include:\n\n*   **Maintaining a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of certain digestive diseases.\n*   **Exercising regularly**: Regular physical activity can help to improve digestion and reduce symptoms of digestive disease.\n*   **Eating a balanced diet**: A diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources can help to support digestive health.\n*   **Managing stress**: Stress can exacerbate symptoms of digestive disease; engaging in stress-reducing activities such as meditation or yoga may help to manage stress.",

    "content": "**Dihydroergotamine Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDihydroergotamine is used to treat migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light) and cluster headaches (severe headaches usually on one side of the head or around one eye). Dihydroergotamine is in a class of medications called ergot alkaloids. It works by tightening blood vessels in the brain and by stopping the release of natural substances in the brain that cause swelling.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDihydroergotamine comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (under the skin), intramuscularly (in the muscle), or intravenouslyly (into a vein). Dihydroergotamine can be given subcutaneously at home to treat a migraine headache or given intramuscularly or intravenously at a doctor's office or hospital to treat a migraine or cluster headache. Additional dose(s) can be given every hour if headache continues but no more than 3 total doses should be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly or more than 2 total doses intravenously in a 24-hour period of time.\n\nTo use the solution for injection, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check your ampule to be sure it is safe to use.\n2. Wash your hands well with soap and water.\n3. Check to be sure all the liquid is at the bottom of ampule.\n4. Hold the bottom of the ampule in one hand and hold the top of the ampule between the thumb and pointer of your other hand.\n5. Push the top of the ampule backward with your thumb until it breaks off.\n6. Tilt the ampule at a 45-degree angle and insert the needle into the ampule.\n7. Pull back the plunger slowly and steadily until the top of the plunger is even with the dose your doctor told you to inject.\n8. Check if the syringe contains air bubbles.\n9. Choose a spot to inject the medication on either thigh, well above the knee.\n10. Wipe the area with an alcohol swab using a firm, circular motion, and allow it to dry.\n11. Hold the syringe with one hand and hold a fold of skin around the injection site with the other hand.\n12. Push the needle all the way into the skin at a 45- to 90-degree angle.\n13. Keep the needle inside the skin, and pull back slightly on the plunger.\n14. If blood appears in the syringe, pull the needle slightly out of the skin and repeat step 11.\n15. Push the plunger all the way down to inject the medication.\n16. Pull the needle quickly out of the skin at the same angle you inserted it.\n17. Press a new alcohol pad on the injection site and rub it.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDo not take dihydroergotamine if you are taking any of the following medications: antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox) and ketoconazole (Nizoral); HIV protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), and ritonavir (Norvir); or macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin), and troleandomycin (TAO).\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDihydroergotamine can damage the heart and other organs if it is used too often. Dihydroergotamine should be used only to treat a migraine that is in progress. Do not use dihydroergotamine to prevent a migraine from beginning or to treat a headache that feels different than your usual migraine.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nIf you are using the solution for injection, you should never reuse syringes. Dispose of syringes in a puncture resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Dihydroergotamine Injection**\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n* Dihydroergotamine can damage the heart and other organs if used too often.\n* Do not use dihydroergotamine to prevent a migraine from beginning or to treat a headache that feels different than your usual migraine.\n\n**Instructions for Use**\n\n1. Check your ampule to be sure it is safe to use. Do not use the ampule if it is broken, cracked, labeled with an expiration date that has passed, or contains a colored, cloudy, or particle-filled liquid.\n2. Wash your hands well with soap and water.\n3. Check to be sure all the liquid is at the bottom of ampule. If any liquid is at the top of the ampule, gently flick it with your finger until it falls to the bottom.\n4. Hold the bottom of the ampule in one hand. Hold the top of the ampule between the thumb and pointer of your other hand. Your thumb should be over the dot on the top of the ampule. Push the top of the ampule backward with your thumb until it breaks off.\n5. Tilt the ampule at a 45-degree angle and insert the needle into the ampule.\n6. Pull back the plunger slowly and steadily until the top of the plunger is even with the dose your doctor told you to inject.\n7. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upward and check if it contains air bubbles. If the syringe does contain air bubbles, tap it with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. Then slowly push the plunger up until you see a drop of medication at the tip of the needle.\n8. Check the syringe to be sure it contains the correct dose, especially if you had to remove air bubbles. If the syringe does not contain the correct dose, repeat steps 5 to 7.\n9. Choose a spot to inject the medication on either thigh, well above the knee. Wipe the area with an alcohol swab using a firm, circular motion, and allow it to dry.\n10.

    "content": "**Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Ataxia Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA) syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features affecting multiple body systems.\n\n**Heart Problems**\n\nBeginning in infancy to early childhood, most people with DCMA syndrome develop dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Some affected individuals also have long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. The irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death. Rarely, heart problems improve over time; however, in most cases of DCMA syndrome, affected individuals do not survive past childhood due to heart failure. A small percentage of people with DCMA syndrome have no heart problems at all.\n\n**Movement Difficulties**\n\nBy age 2, children with DCMA syndrome have problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). These movement problems can result in delay of motor skills such as standing and walking, but most older children with DCMA syndrome can walk without support.\n\n**Other Features**\n\nIn addition to heart problems and movement difficulties, most individuals with DCMA syndrome grow slowly before and after birth, which leads to short stature. Additionally, many affected individuals have mild intellectual disability. Many males with DCMA syndrome have genital abnormalities such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Other common features of DCMA syndrome include unusually small red blood cells (microcytic anemia), which can cause pale skin; an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver (hepatic steatosis), which can damage the liver; and the degeneration of nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerve atrophy), which can lead to vision loss.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDCMA syndrome is associated with increased levels of a substance called 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. The amount of acid does not appear to influence the signs and symptoms of the condition. DCMA syndrome is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). People with DCMA syndrome also have high urine levels of another acid called 3-methylglutaric acid.\n\n---\n\n**Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Ataxia (DCMA) Syndrome**\n\n**What is Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Ataxia Syndrome?**\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA) syndrome is a rare inherited condition characterized by heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features affecting multiple body systems.\n\n**Heart Problems**\n\nBeginning in infancy to early childhood, most people with DCMA syndrome develop dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently.

The DNAJC19 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. While the exact function of the DNAJC19 protein is unclear, it may regulate the transport of other proteins into and out of mitochondria.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDCMA syndrome is a very rare disorder. Approximately 30 cases have been identified in the Dariusleut Hutterite population of the Great Plains region of Canada. Only a few affected individuals have been identified outside this population.\n\n---\n\n**Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Ataxia Syndrome**\n\nThis rare genetic disorder is caused by mutations in the DNAJC19 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein found in structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of cells.\n\n**How the Disorder Affects the Body**\n\nThe loss of cellular energy damages tissues that have high energy demands, such as the heart and brain. This can lead to:\n\n* Heart problems\n* Movement difficulties\n* Other features of DCMA syndrome\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type V\n* DCMA\n* DCMA syndrome\n* DNAJC19 defect\n* MGA type V\n* MGCA5\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 5\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: 3-METHYLGLUTACONIC ACIDURIA, TYPE V; MGCA5\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Davey KM, Parboosingh JS, McLeod DR, Chan A, Casey R, Ferreira P, Snyder FF, Bridge PJ, Bernier FP.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form, but it may be the result of different underlying conditions. Some health care providers use the term to indicate a specific condition, called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. There is no known cause for this type of dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n\nThe most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy are:\n\n*   Heart disease caused by a narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries\n*   Poorly controlled high blood pressure\n\nThere are many other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including:\n\n*   Alcohol or cocaine (or other illegal drug) use (usually heavy use for a prolonged time)\n*   Diabetes, thyroid disease, or hepatitis\n*   Medicines that can be toxic to the heart, such as certain medicines used to treat cancer\n*   Abnormal heart rhythms in which the heart beats very fast for a long period of time\n*   Autoimmune illnesses\n*   Conditions that run in families\n*   Infections that involve the heart muscle\n*   Heart valves that are either too narrow or too leaky\n*   During the last month of pregnancy, or within 5 months after the baby is born\n*   Exposure to heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cobalt, or mercury\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n\nSymptoms of heart failure are most common.

Others may help prevent your heart failure from becoming worse, or may prevent other heart problems.\n\nProcedures and surgeries you may need include:\n\n*   A pacemaker to help treat slow heart rates or help your heartbeat stay in sync\n*   A defibrillator that recognizes life-threatening heart rhythms and sends an electrical pulse (shock) to stop them\n*   Heart bypass (CABG) surgery or angioplasty to improve blood flow to the damaged or weakened heart muscle\n*   Valve replacement or repair\n\nFor advanced cardiomyopathy:\n\n*   A heart transplant may be recommended if standard treatments have not worked and heart failure symptoms are very severe.\n*   Placement of a ventricular assist device or artificial heart may be considered.\n\n---\n\n**Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n\n**What is Dilated Cardiomyopathy?**\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and unable to pump blood effectively. It is one of the most common types of cardiomyopathy.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of dilated cardiomyopathy is often unknown, but it can be caused by various factors such as:\n\n*   **Infections**: Certain infections, such as endocarditis or myocarditis, can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n*   **Heart valve problems**: Abnormalities in the heart valves can cause strain on the heart and lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n*   **High blood pressure**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage the heart muscle and lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n*   **Alcohol abuse**: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy may include:\n\n*   **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing, especially when lying down or exerting oneself.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or weak, even after minimal physical activity.\n*   **Swelling**: Fluid buildup in the legs, ankles, and feet due to poor circulation.\n*   **Chest pain**: Pain or discomfort in the chest, which may worsen with deep breathing or exercise.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose dilated cardiomyopathy, your healthcare provider may perform:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A thorough check of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: A test that measures the electrical activity of your heart.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: An ultrasound test that evaluates the structure and function of your heart.\n*   **Cardiac catheterization**: A procedure that involves inserting a tube into your heart to measure pressure and blood flow.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy depends on the severity of the condition and may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: To manage symptoms, improve heart function, and prevent complications.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep to reduce stress on the heart.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged heart tissue.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for dilated cardiomyopathy varies depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. With proper treatment and lifestyle changes, many people with dilated cardiomyopathy can manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. However, some individuals may experience a worsening of the condition over time, leading to heart failure or other complications.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf you are experiencing any symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes and prevent further complications.",

It belongs to a class of medications called calcium-channel blockers. Diltiazem works by relaxing the blood vessels, allowing the heart to pump more efficiently and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDiltiazem is used to treat high blood pressure and control angina (chest pain). High blood pressure is a common condition that can cause damage to various organs in the body, including the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and eyes. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDiltiazem comes in three forms: a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an extended-release capsule. The regular tablet is usually taken three or four times a day, while the extended-release capsule and tablet are typically taken one or two times a day. It's essential to follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking diltiazem, inform your doctor about any allergies you may have, as well as any other medications you are currently taking.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking diltiazem. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had a myocardial infarction (MI); a narrowing or blockage of your digestive system or any other condition that causes food to move through your digestive system more slowly; low blood pressure; or heart, liver, or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking diltiazem, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking diltiazem.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nIf your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDiltiazem may cause side effects.

    "content": "**Diphenhydramine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDiphenhydramine is used to relieve red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by hay fever, allergies, or the common cold. Diphenhydramine is also used to relieve cough caused by minor throat or airway irritation. Diphenhydramine is also used to prevent and treat motion sickness, and to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Diphenhydramine is also used to control abnormal movements in people who have early stage parkinsonian syndrome (a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) or who are experiencing movement problems as a side effect of a medication.\n\nDiphenhydramine will relieve the symptoms of these conditions but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Diphenhydramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Diphenhydramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDiphenhydramine comes as a tablet, a rapidly disintegrating (dissolving) tablet, a capsule, a liquid-filled capsule, a dissolving strip, powder, and a liquid to take by mouth. When diphenhydramine is used for the relief of allergies, cold, and cough symptoms, it is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours. When diphenhydramine is used to treat motion sickness, it is usually taken 30 minutes before departure and, if needed, before meals and at bedtime. When diphenhydramine is used to treat insomnia it is taken at bedtime (30 minutes before planned sleep). When diphenhydramine is used to treat abnormal movements, it is usually taken three times a day at first and then taken 4 times a day.\n\nFollow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take diphenhydramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor or directed on the label.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nNonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain diphenhydramine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.\n\nIf you are giving diphenhydramine or a combination product that contains diphenhydramine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give diphenhydramine products that are made for adults to children.\n\nBefore you give a diphenhydramine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.\n\n---\n\n**Diphenhydramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n*   **Dosage and Administration**\n    *   Take diphenhydramine exactly as directed.\n    *   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor or directed on the label.\n\n**Forms of Diphenhydramine**\n\n*   Tablet\n*   Rapidly dissolving tablet\n*   Capsule\n*   Liquid-filled capsule\n*   Dissolving strip\n*   Powder\n*   Liquid\n\n**Administration Instructions**\n\n*   When taking the liquid, use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or a spoon made especially for measuring medication.\n*   For dissolving strips, place one strip on your tongue and swallow after it melts.\n*   For rapidly dissolving tablets, place a tablet on your tongue and close your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with or without water.\n*   For capsules, swallow them whole. Do not try to break the capsules.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Before taking diphenhydramine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to diphenhydramine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in diphenhydramine preparations.\n*   Inform your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking diphenhydramine.\n*   If you have certain medical conditions, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, glaucoma, ulcers, difficulty urinating, heart disease, high blood pressure, seizures, or an overactive thyroid gland, inform your doctor before taking diphenhydramine.\n*   If you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding, consult with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Diphenhydramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking diphenhydramine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to diphenhydramine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in diphenhydramine preparations.

If you become pregnant while taking diphenhydramine, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that generally diphenhydramine should not be used in older adults, except to manage serious allergic reactions, because it is not as safe or effective as other medication(s) to treat your condition. If you are 65 years of age or older, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this medication.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking diphenhydramine.\n\nYou should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nRemember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication. Avoid alcoholic beverages while you are taking this medication.\n\nIf you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that some brands of chewable tablets and rapidly disintegrating tablets that contain diphenhydramine may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nDiphenhydramine is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take diphenhydramine regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDiphenhydramine may cause side effects.

Getting treatment for diphtheria quickly is important, so if your doctor suspects that you have it, you'll start treatment before the lab tests come back. Treatment is with antibiotics.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine can prevent diphtheria, but its protection does not last forever. Children need another dose, or booster, at about age 12. Then, as adults, they should get a booster every 10 years. Diphtheria is very rare in the United States because of the vaccine.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nLearn more about diphtheria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\n* About Diphtheria (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Diphtheria Photos (Immunization Action Coalition)\n* Diphtheria Symptoms and Complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Vaccines: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\n* Also in Spanish",

    "content": "**Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine**\n\n**Why Get Vaccinated?**\n\nDTaP vaccine can prevent diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.\n\n* Diphtheria and pertussis spread from person to person.\n* Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds.\n* **DIPHTHERIA (D)** can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and death.\n* **TETANUS (T)** causes painful tightening of the muscles. Tetanus can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth, having trouble swallowing and breathing, or death.\n* **PERTUSSIS (aP)**, also known as \"whooping cough,\" can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat, or drink. Pertussis can be extremely serious especially in babies and young children, causing pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage, or death. In teens and adults, it can cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib fractures from severe coughing.\n\n**DTaP Vaccine**\n\n* DTaP is only for children younger than 7 years old.\n* Different vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap and Td) are available for older children, adolescents, and adults.\n* It is recommended that children receive 5 doses of DTaP, usually at the following ages:\n\t+ 2 months\n\t+ 4 months\n\t+ 6 months\n\t+ 15–18 months\n\t+ 4–6 years\n* DTaP may be given as a stand-alone vaccine, or as part of a combination vaccine (a type of vaccine that combines more than one vaccine together into one shot).\n* DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines.\n\n**Talk with Your Healthcare Provider**\n\nTell your health care provider if the person getting the vaccine:\n\n* Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of any vaccine that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies.\n* Has had a coma, decreased level of consciousness, or prolonged seizures within 7 days after a previous dose of any pertussis vaccine (DTP or DTaP)\n* Has seizures or another nervous system problem\n* Has had a condition called Guillain-Barré Syndrome (also called \"GBS\")\n* Has had severe pain or swelling after a previous dose of that protects against tetanus or diphtheria\n\nIn some cases, your child's healthcare provider may decide to postpone your child's DTaP vaccination until a future visit.\n\nChildren with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. Children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting DTaP vaccine.\n\nYour child's health care provider can give you more information.\n\n**Risks of a Vaccine Reaction**\n\nSoreness or swelling where the shot was given, fever, fussiness, feeling tired, loss of appetite, and vomiting sometimes happen after DTaP vaccination. More serious reactions, such as seizures, nonstop crying for 3 hours or more, or high fever (over 105°F) after DTaP vaccination happen much less often. Rarely, the vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg, especially in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth dose.\n\n---\n\n**Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine**\n\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\n\n**Risks of a Vaccine Reaction**\n\n* Soreness or swelling where the shot was given\n* Fever\n* Fussiness\n* Feeling tired\n* Loss of appetite\n* Vomiting sometimes happen after DTaP vaccination.\n* More serious reactions, such as seizures, nonstop crying for 3 hours or more, or high fever (over 105°F) after DTaP vaccination happen much less often. Rarely, the vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg, especially in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth dose.\n\n**What if There is a Serious Problem?**\n\n* An allergic reaction could occur after the child leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the child to the nearest hospital.\n* For other signs that concern you, call your child's healthcare provider.\n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\n* Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at https://www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS does not give medical advice.\n\n**The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program**\n\n* The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\n* Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP website at https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and about filing a claim.\n\n**How Can I Learn More?**\n\n* Ask your healthcare provider.\n* Call your local or state health department.\n* Visit the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for vaccine package inserts and additional information at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines.\n* Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or visit CDC's website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines.\n\n**Brand Names**\n\n* Daptacel\n* Infanrix\n\n**Brand Names of Combination Products**\n\n* Kinrix (containing Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellular Pertussis, Polio Vaccine)\n* Pediarix (containing Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellular Pertussis, Hepatitis B, Polio Vaccine)\n* Pentacel (containing Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellular Pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Polio Vaccine)\n* Quadracel (containing Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellular Pertussis, Polio Vaccine)\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* DTaP\n* DTaP-HepB-IPV\n* DTaP-IPV\n* DTaP-IPV/Hib",

The throat infection causes a gray to black, tough, fiber-like covering, which can block your airways. In some cases, diphtheria infects your skin first and causes skin lesions.\n\nOnce you are infected, the bacteria make dangerous substances called toxins. The toxins spread through your bloodstream to other organs, such as the heart and brain, and cause damage.\n\nBecause of widespread vaccination (immunization) of children, diphtheria is now rare in many parts of the world.\n\nRisk factors for diphtheria include crowded environments, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually occur 2 to 5 days after the bacteria enter your body:\n\n*   Fever and chills\n*   Sore throat, hoarseness\n*   Painful swallowing\n*   Croup-like (barking) cough\n*   Drooling (suggests airway blockage is about to occur)\n*   Bluish coloration of the skin\n*   Bloody, watery drainage from nose\n*   Breathing problems, including difficulty breathing, fast breathing, high-pitched breathing sound (stridor)\n*   Skin sores (usually seen in tropical areas)\n\nSometimes there are no symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and look inside your mouth.

It is also a reportable disease, and any cases are often publicized in the media. This helps you to know if diphtheria is present in your area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nRoutine childhood immunizations and adult boosters prevent the disease.\n\nAnyone who has come into contact with an infected person should get an immunization or booster shot against diphtheria, if they have not already received it. Protection from the vaccine lasts only 10 years. So it is important for adults to get a booster vaccine every 10 years. The booster is called tetanus-diphtheria (Td). (The shot also has vaccine medicine for an infection called tetanus.)\n\nIf you have been in close contact with a person who has diphtheria, contact your provider right away. Ask whether you need antibiotics to prevent getting diphtheria.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRespiratory diphtheria; Pharyngeal diphtheria; Diphtheric cardiomyopathy; Diphtheric polyneuropathy\n\n---\n\n**Diphtheria**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Diphtheria?**\n    Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It can affect anyone, but it's most common in children who haven't received the diphtheria vaccine.\n*   **Symptoms of Diphtheria**\n    The symptoms of diphtheria can vary from person to person, but they often include a sore throat, fever, headache, and a characteristic \"bull neck\" due to swelling of the neck muscles. In severe cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors**\n    Diphtheria is caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria, which are usually spread through close contact with an infected person. The risk of developing diphtheria increases in areas with poor sanitation, low vaccination rates, or during outbreaks.\n*   **Prevention**\n    The best way to prevent diphtheria is through vaccination. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is typically given to children as part of their routine immunization schedule. Boosters are also recommended for adults who may be at risk.\n*   **Treatment**\n    Treatment for diphtheria usually involves administering antitoxins to neutralize the bacterial toxins in the body. In severe cases, hospitalization and supportive care may be necessary to manage respiratory or cardiac complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Diphtheria\n*   Antibodies",

Then the doctor puts a needle into the femoral artery, the artery that runs down the leg. The doctor inserts a guide wire through the needle and then removes the needle. He replaces it with an introducer, a tubular instrument with two ports used to insert flexible devices such as a catheter into a blood vessel.\n\nOnce the introducer is in place, the original guidewire is replaced by a finer wire. This new wire is used to insert a diagnostic catheter, a long flexible tube, into the artery and guide it to the heart. The doctor then removes the second wire.\n\nWith the catheter at the opening of one of the coronary arteries, the doctor injects dye and takes an X-ray.

A stent may also be placed. This is a latticed metal scaffold put inside the coronary artery to keep the vessel open.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter the procedure, the doctor injects dye and takes an X-ray to check for change in the arteries.

Even though they all have disabilities, they can have a wide range of needs.\n\n**Causes of Disabilities**\n\nDisabilities can have different causes. Some disabilities are present at birth, while others may happen later in life.\n\nCauses of disabilities that are present at birth can include:\n\n* Disorders in single genes, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n* Disorders of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome\n* Exposures (before birth) to infections or substances, such as drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes\n\nCauses of disabilities that happen later in life can include:\n\n* Injuries, such as spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), and back injuries\n* Chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, COPD, and arthritis\n* Cancer\n* Mental health problems\n* Stroke\n* Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia\n\n**How Disabilities Can Affect Your Health**\n\nHaving a disability does not mean a person cannot be healthy. In fact, many people with disabilities report that their health is good or better. But they may have or be at risk of health problems related to their disability, called \"secondary conditions.\" These conditions may include:\n\n* Bowel or bladder problems\n* Chronic pain\n* Diabetes\n* Fatigue\n* Heart disease\n* Injuries\n* Mental health problems, including depression and substance use disorders\n* Overweight and obesity\n* Pressure sores or ulcers\n\nMany of these conditions can be prevented, and there are treatments for them. It's also important for people with disabilities to get health care that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability.\n\n**Getting and Staying Healthy**\n\nJust like for people who don't have a disability, having a healthy lifestyle is important for people who do have a disability. A healthy lifestyle includes:\n\n* Getting regular physical activity\n* Eating healthy foods in healthy portions\n* Limiting sun exposure and using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer\n* Not smoking, and if needed, getting help to quit smoking\n* Using medicines wisely\n* Not drinking alcohol or drinking in moderation\n* Getting help for any substance use or mental health problems\n* Staying in touch with family and friends\n\n**Resources for People with Disabilities**\n\nManaging a disability can sometimes be challenging. There are resources that can help:\n\n* Assistive devices and mobility aids can make daily tasks easier.\n* Schools can develop plans around the specific needs of a child with a disability. The goal of the plans is to give the child an opportunity to perform at the same level as other children their age.\n* Support networks, such as disability organizations, can help you learn more about resources for you and your family. Support groups can help you connect with other people who have the same disability. They can provide emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.\n* Government programs may provide benefits, job training, employment resources, and protection against discrimination.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Disabled Persons  (National Institutes of Health)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Persons with Disabilities  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\nArticle: The barriers perceived by Chilean athletes with disability at different social... \nArticle: Evaluation of specialized medical examinations in disability assessment: A cross-sectional study. \nArticle: Hands-Free Human-Machine Interfaces Using Piezoelectric Sensors and Accelerometers for Simulated Wheelchair...\n\n---\n\n**Disabilities**\n\nA disability is any condition of your body or mind that makes it more difficult for you to do one or more major life activities and interact with the world around you.\n\n**Types of Disabilities**\n\nThere are many types of disabilities, such as those that can affect your:\n\n* **Physical abilities**: e.g. paralysis, amputation\n* **Sensory abilities**: e.g. blindness, deafness\n* **Cognitive abilities**: e.g. intellectual disability, learning disability\n* **Emotional well-being**: e.g. mental health conditions like depression or anxiety\n\n**Causes of Disabilities**\n\nDisabilities can have different causes.

There are resources that can help:\n\n* **Assistive devices and mobility aids**: e.g. wheelchairs, walkers\n* **Support networks**: e.g. disability organizations, support groups\n* **Government programs**: e.g. benefits, job training, employment resources, protection against discrimination\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Disabled Persons  (National Institutes of Health)\nClinicalTrials.gov: Persons with Disabilities  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\n* **Article:** The barriers perceived by Chilean athletes with disability at different social...\n* **Article:** Evaluation of specialized medical examinations in disability assessment: A cross-sectional study.\n* **Article:** Hands-Free Human-Machine Interfaces Using Piezoelectric Sensors and Accelerometers for Simulated Wheelchair...\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nAAAs (Area Agencies on Aging) & Title VI Aging Programs (USAging)\nOffice of Disability Employment Policy\n\n**Children with Disabilities**\n\nBenefits for Children with Disabilities (Social Security Administration)\nCaring for Siblings of Kids with Disabilities (Nemours Foundation)\nIndividualized Education Plans (IEPs) (Nemours Foundation)\nSafety Plan Considerations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nAssistive Devices\nDevelopmental Disabilities\nLearning Disabilities\nLimb Loss\nMobility Aids\n\n---\n\n**Disabilities**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **elopmental Disabilities**\n* **Learning Disabilities**\n* **Limb Loss**\n* **Mobility Aids**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Assistive Devices**\n* **Developmental Disabilities**\n* **Learning Disabilities**\n* **Limb Loss**\n* **Mobility Aids**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

    "content": "**Discipline in Children**\n\nAll children misbehave sometimes. As a parent, you have to decide how you will respond. Your child needs rules to understand how to behave.\n\n**What is Discipline?**\n\nDiscipline involves both punishment and rewards. When you discipline your children, you are teaching them what is good behavior and what is not good behavior. Discipline is important to:\n\n* Protect children from harm\n* Teach self-discipline\n* Develop good social skills\n\n**Every Parent Has Their Own Parenting Style**\n\nYou may be strict or you may be laid back. The key is to:\n\n* Set clear expectations\n* Be consistent\n* Be loving\n\n**TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE**\n\nTry these parenting pointers:\n\n1. **Reward Good Behavior**\nAs much as you can, try to focus on the positive.

By respecting your child, you build trust.\n9. **Follow Through on Your Discipline**\nIf you tell your child that they will lose their TV time today if they hit, be prepared to turn off the TV for the day.\n\n**What You Need to Know About Spanking**\n\nExperts have found that spanking:\n\n* Can make children more aggressive\n* Can get out of control and the child can get hurt\n* Teaches children that it is OK to hurt someone they love\n* Teaches children to be afraid of their parent\n* Teaches children to avoid being caught, rather than learning better behavior\n\n**When to Seek Help**\n\nIf you have tried many parenting techniques, but things are not going well with your child, it is a good idea to talk with your child's health care provider. You should also talk to your child's provider if you find that your child:\n\n* Disrespects all adults\n* Is always fighting everyone\n* Seems depressed or blue\n* Does not seem to have friends or activities that they enjoy\n\n---\n\n**Discipline in Children**\n\nAs a parent, it's essential to establish rules for your child to understand how to behave.

Instead of saying \"Your room is messy,\" tell the child what needs to be picked up or cleaned.\n*   **Be calm, friendly, and firm**: A child may become angry, tearful, or sad, or may start a tantrum. The calmer your behavior is, the more likely your children will pattern their behavior after yours.\n*   **Follow through on your discipline**: If you tell your child that they will lose their TV time today if they hit, be prepared to turn off the TV for the day.\n*   **Don't make huge threats of punishment**: When you threaten a punishment but do not follow through, your child learns that you do not mean what you say.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tips for Effective Discipline**\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you discipline effectively:\n\n*   **Reward good behavior**: As much as you can, try to focus on the positive. Let your children know that you are pleased when they are behaving the way you wish.\n*   **Let natural consequences teach your child**: While it is not easy, you should not always prevent bad things from happening. If your child is frustrated with a toy and breaks it, let them learn that they no longer have that toy to play with.\n*   **Consider your child's age when setting limits or punishing**: Don't expect more from your child than your child can do.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Seek Help**\n\nIf you have tried many parenting techniques, but things are not going well with your child, it is a good idea to talk with your child's health care provider. You should also talk to your child's provider if you find that your child:\n\n*   **Disrespects all adults**\n*   **Is always fighting everyone**\n*   **Seems depressed or blue**\n*   **Does not seem to have friends or activities that they enjoy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What You Need to Know About Spanking**\n\nExperts have found that spanking can make children more aggressive, get out of control and the child can get hurt, teach children that it is OK to hurt someone they love, teach children to be afraid of their parent, teach children to avoid being caught rather than learning better behavior, and may reinforce bad behavior in children acting out just to get attention.\n\n---\n\n**Discipline in Children**\n\nWhen your child misbehaves, it's essential to set limits and teach them what is expected of them. Here are some tips on how to discipline your child effectively:\n\n*   **Apologize when you're out of control**: If you lose your temper, apologize to your child and promise to respond differently next time.\n*   **Help your child with tantrums**: Allow your children to express their feelings, but also help them cope with anger and frustration without violent or aggressive behavior. Here are some tips on dealing with temper tantrums:\n    *   Stay calm\n    *   Validate their emotions\n    *   Offer alternatives to aggressive behavior\n\n**What You Need to Know About Spanking**\n\nExperts have found that spanking is not an effective way to discipline children. In fact, it can lead to long-term negative effects on a child's emotional and psychological well-being.\n\n**When to Seek Help**\n\nIf you've tried many parenting techniques, but things aren't going well with your child, it's a good idea to talk with your child's healthcare provider. You should also talk to their provider if you find that your child:\n\n*   Is consistently aggressive or violent\n*   Has difficulty controlling their emotions\n*   Is experiencing behavioral problems at school\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry website.

    "content": "**Disk Replacement - Lumbar Spine**\n\nLumbar spine disk replacement is surgery of the lower back (lumbar) area. It is done to treat spinal stenosis or disk problems and allow normal movement of the backbone.\n\n**What is Spinal Stenosis?**\n\nSpinal stenosis is present when:\n\n* The space for the spinal column is narrowed.\n* The openings for the nerve roots leaving the spinal column become narrow, placing pressure on the nerve.\n\n**Description of Surgery**\n\nDuring total disk replacement (TDR), the inner portion of a damaged spinal disk is replaced with an artificial disk to restore normal movement of the backbone. Most often, surgery is done for only one disk, but at times, two levels next to each other may be replaced.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nCushion-like disks help the spine stay mobile. Nerves in the lower spine area get compressed due to:\n\n* Narrowing of the disk due to old injuries\n* Bulging of the disk (protrusion)\n* Arthritis that occurs in your spine that pushes on the nerves\n\n**Symptoms and Risks**\n\nSurgery for spinal stenosis may be considered if you have severe symptoms that interfere with your daily life and do not improve with other therapy. Symptoms most often include:\n\n* Pain that may be felt in your thigh, calf or lower back. The pain is often deep and steady.\n* Pain in your buttock area.\n* Pain when doing certain activities or moving your body a certain way.\n* Numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness.\n* Difficulty with balance and walking.\n* Loss of bladder or bowel control.\n\nRisks include:\n\n* Increase in back pain\n* Difficulty with movement\n* Injury to the gut\n* Blood clots in legs\n* Abnormal bone formation in the muscles and tendons surrounding the spinal cord\n* Sexual dysfunction (more common in men)\n* Damage to the ureter and bladder\n* Infection at the surgical site\n* Breakage of the artificial disk\n* Artificial disk may move out of place\n* Loosening of the implant\n* Paralysis\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will order an imaging test such as an MRI, CT scan, or x-ray to check if you need surgery. Your provider will want to know if you:\n\n* Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant\n* Are taking any medicines, supplements, or herbs\n* Have diabetes, heart disease, or have any other medical condition\n* Are a smoker\n\n**During the Days Before Surgery**\n\nPrepare your home for when you leave the hospital. If you are a smoker, you need to stop. People who have TDR and continue to smoke may not heal as well. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions on not drinking or eating anything before the procedure. This may be 6 to 12 hours before surgery. Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will stay in the hospital 1 to 2 days after surgery. Your surgeon will encourage you to stand and start walking as soon as the anesthesia wears off. You may have to wear a corset brace for support and faster healing. In the beginning, you'll be given clear liquids. You'll later progress to a liquid and semi-solid diet.\n\nYour surgeon will ask you not to:\n\n* Do any activity that stretches your spine too much\n* Take part in activities that involve jarring, bending, and twisting such as driving and lifting heavy objects for at least 3 months after surgery\n\nFollow instructions on how to take care of your back at home. You can likely return to normal activities 3 months after the surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe risk of complications are low after lumbar disk replacement. The surgery usually improves movement of the backbone better than other (spine surgeries). It is a safe procedure and pain relief occurs soon after surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Disk Replacement - Lumbar Spine**\n\nLumbar spine disk replacement is surgery of the lower back (lumbar) area.

You will be asleep and not feel any pain.\n\n**During Surgery**\n\n* You will lie on your back on the operating table.\n* Your arms are padded at the elbow area and folded in front of your chest.\n* Your surgeon makes an incision (cut) on your abdomen. Doing the operation through the abdomen allows the surgeon to access the spine without disturbing the spinal nerves.\n* The gut organs and blood vessels are moved to the side to get access to the backbone.\n* Your surgeon removes the damaged portion of the disk and puts the new artificial disk in its place.\n* All the organs are put back into place.\n* The incision is closed with stitches.\n\nThe surgery takes about 2 hours to complete.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nCushion-like disks help the spine stay mobile.

People who have TDR and continue to smoke may not heal as well. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n\nOne week before surgery, your surgeon may ask you to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).\n\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats these conditions to determine if surgery is safe for you.\n\nTalk with your provider and surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n\nLet your surgeon know right away if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you have before surgery.\n\nYou may want to visit a physical therapist to learn exercises to do before surgery.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions on not drinking or eating anything before the procedure. This may be 6 to 12 hours before surgery.\n\nTake the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n\nYour surgeon will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.

Most people with lower back pain do not need surgery. Most people are first treated with medicines, physical therapy, and exercise which give relief of back pain.\n\n**Risks**\n\nYou may be a candidate for disk replacement surgery if the following are true:\n\n* You are not very overweight.\n* Only one or two levels of your spine have this problem and other areas did not.\n* You do not have a lot of arthritis in the joints of your spine.\n* You have not had spine surgery in the past.\n* You do not have severe pressure on the nerves of your spine.\n\n---\n\n**Disk Replacement - Lumbar Spine**\n\n**Benefits**\n\nAfter disk replacement surgery, the area below the site of surgery still has preserved movement. This movement may help prevent further disk problems.\n\n**Who is a Candidate for Disk Replacement Surgery?**\n\nYou may be a candidate for disk replacement surgery if the following are true:\n\n* You have a damaged or degenerated lumbar spine disk that causes back pain and other symptoms.\n* You have tried other treatments such as physical therapy, medication, and injections without relief.\n* You are in good overall health and do not have any medical conditions that would make surgery risky.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks of disk replacement surgery include:\n\n* Allergic reaction to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, and infection\n* Increase in back pain\n* Difficulty with movement\n* Injury to the gut\n* Blood clots in legs\n* Abnormal bone formation in the muscles and tendons surrounding the spinal cord\n* Sexual dysfunction (more common in men)\n* Damage to the ureter and bladder\n* Infection at the surgical site\n* Breakage of the artificial disk\n* Artificial disk may move out of place\n* Loosening of the implant\n* Paralysis\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will order an imaging test such as an MRI, CT scan, or x-ray to check if you need surgery.\n\nYour provider will want to know if you:\n\n* Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant\n* Are taking any medicines, supplements, or herbs\n* Have diabetes, heart disease, or have any other medical condition\n* Are a smoker\n\nTell your provider what medicines you are taking.

These cushions are called disks, and they separate your spinal bones (vertebrae).\n\n**Description**\n\nA surgeon may perform disk removal (diskectomy) in these different ways.\n\n* **Microdiskectomy**: When you have a microdiskectomy, the surgeon does not need to do much surgery on the bones, joints, ligaments, or muscles of your spine.\n* **Diskectomy in the lower part of your back (lumbar spine)**: may be part of a larger surgery that also includes a laminectomy, foraminotomy, or spinal fusion.\n* **Diskectomy in your neck (cervical spine)**: is most often done along with foraminotomy, or fusion.\n\n**Microdiskectomy**\n\nMicrodiskectomy is done in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. You will be given general anesthesia. You will be asleep and pain-free.\n\nThe surgeon makes a small (1 to 1.5-inch, or 2.5 to 3.8-centimeter) incision (cut) on your back and moves the back muscles away from your spine. The surgeon uses a special microscope to see the problem disk or disks and nerves during surgery.\n\n* The nerve root is located and gently moved away.\n* The surgeon removes the injured disk tissue and pieces of the disk.\n* The back muscles are returned to their normal place.\n* The incision is closed with stitches or staples.\n* The surgery takes about 1 to 2 hours.\n\n**Diskectomy and Laminotomy**\n\nDiskectomy and laminotomy are usually done in the hospital, using general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free).\n\nThe surgeon makes a larger cut on your back over the spine. Muscles and tissue are gently moved to expose your spine. A small part of the lamina bone (part of the vertebrae that surrounds the spinal column and nerves) is cut away. The opening may be as large as the ligament that runs along your spine.\n\n* A small hole is cut in the disk that is causing your symptoms.\n* Material from inside the disk is removed. Other fragments of the disk may also be removed.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nWhen one of your disks moves out of place (herniates), the soft gel inside pushes through the wall of the disk. The disk may then place pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that are coming out of your spinal column.\n\nMany of the symptoms caused by a herniated disk get better or go away over time without surgery. Most people with low back or neck pain, numbness, or even mild weakness are often first treated with anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and exercise.\n\nOnly a few people with a herniated disk need surgery.\n\nYour health care provider may recommend a diskectomy if you have a herniated disk and:\n\n* Leg or arm pain or numbness that is very bad or is not going away, making it hard to do daily tasks\n* Severe weakness in muscles of your arm, lower leg or buttocks\n* Pain that spreads into your buttocks or legs\n\nIf you are having problems with your bowels or bladder, or the pain is so bad that strong pain medicines do not help, you will need to have surgery right away.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of this surgery are:\n\n* Damage to the nerves that come out of the spine, causing weakness or pain that does not go away.\n* Your back pain does not get better, or pain comes back later.\n* Pain after surgery, if all the disk fragments are not removed.\n* Spinal fluid may leak and cause headaches.\n* The disk may bulge out again.\n* Your spine may become more unstable and require more surgery.\n* Infection that may require antibiotics, a longer hospital stay, or more surgery.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days before the surgery:\n\n* Prepare your home for when you come back from the hospital.\n* If you are a smoker, you need to stop, ideally 4 weeks before your surgery. Your recovery will be slower and possibly not as good if you continue to smoke. Ask your provider for help.\n* Two weeks before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other medicines like these.\n* If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will ask you to see the providers who treat you for those conditions before your surgery.\n* Talk with your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n* Always let your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses you may have.\n* You may want to visit the physical therapist to learn some exercises to do before surgery and to practice using crutches.\n\n**On the Day of the Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Bring your cane, walker, or wheelchair if you have one already. Also bring shoes with flat, nonskid soles. Follow instructions about when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon will ask you to get up and walk around as soon as your anesthesia wears off. Most people go home the day of surgery. Do not drive yourself home.\n\nFollow instructions about how to care for yourself at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people have pain relief and can move better after surgery. Numbness and tingling should get better or disappear. Your pain, numbness, or weakness may not get better or go away if you had nerve damage before surgery, or if you have symptoms caused by other spinal conditions.\n\nFurther changes may occur in your spine over time and new symptoms may occur.\n\nTalk with your provider about how to prevent future back problems.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSpinal microdiskectomy; Microdecompression; Laminotomy; Disk removal; Spine surgery - diskectomy; Discectomy\n\n---\n\n**Diskectomy**\n\nDiskectomy is surgery to remove all or part of the cushion that helps support part of your spinal column.

Ask your provider for help.\nTwo weeks before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other medicines like these.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will ask you to see the providers who treat you for those conditions before your surgery.\nTalk with your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\nAlways let your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses you may have.\nYou may want to visit the physical therapist to learn some exercises to do before surgery and to practice using crutches.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nBring your cane, walker, or wheelchair if you have one already. Also bring shoes with flat, nonskid soles.\nFollow instructions about when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon will ask you to get up and walk around as soon as your anesthesia wears off. Most people go home the day of surgery. Do not drive yourself home.\n\nFollow instructions about how to care for yourself at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people have pain relief and can move better after surgery. Numbness and tingling should get better or disappear. Your pain, numbness, or weakness may not get better or go away if you had nerve damage before surgery, or if you have symptoms caused by other spinal conditions.\n\nFurther changes may occur in your spine over time and new symptoms may occur.\n\nTalk with your provider about how to prevent future back problems.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSpinal microdiskectomy; Microdecompression; Laminotomy; Disk removal; Spine surgery - diskectomy; Discectomy\n\n---\n\n**Diskectomy**\n\n**What is Diskectomy?**\n\nDiskectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a damaged or herniated disk from the spine. The goal of the surgery is to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and nerves, which can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the arms or legs.\n\n**Types of Diskectomy**\n\nThere are two main types of diskectomy:\n\n*   **Microdiskectomy**: A minimally invasive procedure that uses a small incision and a microscope to remove the damaged disk.\n*   **Diskectomy with laminotomy**: A more invasive procedure that involves removing a portion of the lamina bone to access the damaged disk.\n\n**Why is Diskectomy Performed?**\n\nDiskectomy may be performed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and nerves caused by a herniated disk. The symptoms of a herniated disk can include:\n\n*   Leg or arm pain or numbness that is severe or does not go away\n*   Severe weakness in muscles of the arm, lower leg, or buttocks\n*   Pain that spreads into the buttocks or legs\n\n**Risks of Diskectomy**\n\nThe risks of diskectomy include:\n\n*   Damage to the nerves that come out of the spine, causing weakness or pain that does not go away\n*   Your back pain does not get better, or pain comes back later\n*   Pain after surgery, if all the disk fragments are not removed\n*   Spinal fluid may leak and cause headaches\n*   The disk may bulge out again\n*   Your spine may become more unstable and require more surgery\n*   Infection that may require antibiotics, a longer hospital stay, or more surgery\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore undergoing diskectomy, it is essential to inform your surgeon about any medications you are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, supplements, or herbs.\n\n---\n\n**Diskectomy: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n*   Tell your surgeon what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n*   During the days before the surgery:\n    *   Prepare your home for when you come back from the hospital.\n    *   If you are a smoker, you need to stop, ideally 4 weeks before your surgery.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000524.htm",
    "content": "**Dislocated Shoulder - Aftercare**\n\nThe shoulder is a ball and socket joint, meaning the round top of your arm bone (the ball) fits into the groove in your shoulder blade (the socket). When you have a dislocated shoulder, it means the entire ball is out of the socket. A partly dislocated shoulder, also known as a shoulder subluxation, means only part of the ball is out of the socket.\n\n**About Your Injury**\n\nYou most likely dislocated your shoulder from a sports injury or accident, such as a fall. You have likely injured (stretched or torn) some of the muscles, tendons, or ligaments of the shoulder joint. These tissues help keep your arm in place. Having a dislocated shoulder is very painful and it's hard to move your arm. You may also experience:\n\n* Some swelling and bruising to your shoulder\n* Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arm, hand, or fingers\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nSurgery may or may not be needed after your dislocation, depending on your age and how often your shoulder has been dislocated. You may also need surgery if you have a job that requires heavy use of your shoulder or if you need to use it for safety reasons.\n\nIn the emergency room, your arm was placed back into your shoulder socket. You likely received medicine to relax your muscles and block your pain. Afterward, your arm was placed in a shoulder immobilizer for it to heal.\n\nYou will have a greater chance of dislocating your shoulder again with each injury, which can cause more damage to the bone and tissue around the shoulder. If your shoulder continues to partly or fully dislocate in the future, you may need surgery to repair or tighten the ligaments that hold the bones in your shoulder joint together.\n\n**To Relieve Your Symptoms**\n\nTo reduce swelling:\n\n* Put an ice pack on the area right after you injure it\n* Do not move your shoulder\n* Keep your arm close to your body\n* You can move your wrist and elbow while in the sling\n* Do not place rings on your fingers on the side of your dislocation until your health care provider tells you it is safe to do so\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYour provider will:\n\n* Tell you when and for how long to remove the shoulder immobilizer for short periods\n* Show you gentle exercises to help keep your shoulder from tightening or freezing up\n\nAfter your shoulder has healed for 2 to 4 weeks, you will be referred for physical therapy. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to stretch your shoulder, making sure you have good shoulder movement. As you continue to heal, you will learn exercises to increase the strength of your shoulder muscles and ligaments.\n\nDo not return to activities that place too much stress on your shoulder joint without asking your provider first. These activities include most sports activities using your arms, gardening, heavy lifting, or even reaching above shoulder level.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nSee an orthopedic specialist (orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine provider) in a week or less after your shoulder joint is put back into place. They will check the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments in your shoulder.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have swelling or pain in your shoulder, arm, or hand that becomes worse\n* Your arm or hand turns purple\n* You have a fever\n\n---\n\n**Dislocated Shoulder - Aftercare**\n\nYou've likely dislocated your shoulder from a sports injury or accident, such as a fall.

Some common types include:\n\n*   **Dislocated Shoulder**: A condition where the humerus bone is out of its normal position in the shoulder joint.\n*   **Kneecap Dislocation**: A condition where the patella bone is out of its normal position in the knee joint.\n*   **Nursemaid's Elbow**: A condition where the radius bone is out of its normal position in the elbow joint.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nDislocations can occur due to various reasons such as:\n\n*   **Injury or Trauma**: A sudden blow or impact can cause a dislocation.\n*   **Overuse or Repetitive Motion**: Repeatedly performing the same motion can put excessive stress on the joint, leading to dislocation.\n*   **Underlying Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions such as osteoporosis or arthritis can increase the risk of dislocation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of dislocation may vary depending on the location and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Pain and Swelling**: The affected area may be painful and swollen.\n*   **Limited Mobility**: The joint may be stiff or difficult to move.\n*   **Instability**: The bone may feel unstable or loose.\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a physical examination and imaging tests such as X-rays or MRI scans.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nTreatment for dislocation depends on the severity of the condition. Some common treatment options include:\n\n*   **Immobilization**: The affected area may be immobilized using a cast, splint, or sling.\n*   **Physical Therapy**: Gentle exercises and stretches can help improve range of motion and strength.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the damaged joint.\n\nPrevention is key in avoiding dislocations. Some tips include:\n\n*   **Strengthening Exercises**: Regular exercise can help strengthen the muscles around the joints.\n*   **Proper Technique**: Using proper technique when performing physical activities can reduce the risk of injury.\n*   **Seeking Medical Attention**: If you experience any symptoms of dislocation, seek medical attention promptly.",

    "content": "**Dislocation**\n\nA dislocation is a disruption of the normal position of the ends of two or more bones where they meet at a joint. A joint is the place where two bones connect, which allows movement.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt may be hard to tell a dislocated joint from a broken bone. Both are emergencies that need first aid treatment.\n\nMost dislocations can be treated in your health care provider's office or an emergency room. You may be given medicine to make you sleepy and to numb the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia that puts you into a deep sleep is needed.\n\nWhen treated early, most dislocations do not cause permanent injury.\n\nYou should expect that:\n\n* Injuries to the surrounding tissues generally take 6 to 12 weeks to heal. Sometimes, surgery to repair a ligament that tears when the joint is dislocated is needed.\n* Injuries to nerves and blood vessels may result in more long-term or permanent problems.\n\nOnce a joint has been dislocated, it is more likely to happen again. After being treated in the emergency room, you should follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon (a bone and joint specialist).\n\n**Causes**\n\nDislocations are usually caused by a sudden impact to the joint. This usually occurs following a blow, fall, or other trauma.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA dislocated joint may be:\n\n* Accompanied by numbness or tingling at the joint or beyond it\n* Very painful, especially if you try to use the joint or put weight on it\n* Limited in movement\n* Swollen or bruised\n* Visibly out of place, discolored, or misshapen\n\nNursemaid's elbow, or pulled elbow, is a partial dislocation that is common in toddlers. The main symptom is pain so that the child doesn't want to use the arm. This dislocation can be easily treated in your provider's office.\n\n**First Aid**\n\n* Call 911 or the local emergency number before you begin treating someone who may have a dislocation, especially if the accident that caused the injury may be life threatening.\n* If the person has a serious injury, check their airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin CPR, or bleeding control.\n* Do not move the person if you think that their head, back, or leg has been injured. Keep the person calm and still.\n* If the skin is broken, take steps to prevent infection. Do not blow on the wound. Rinse the area gently with clean water to remove any dirt you can see, but do not scrub or probe. Cover the area with sterile dressings before immobilizing the injured joint. Do not attempt to put the bone back in place unless you are a bone specialist.\n* Apply a splint or sling to the injured joint in the position in which you found it. Do not move the joint. Also immobilize the area above and below the injured area.\n* Check blood circulation around the injury by pressing firmly on the skin in the affected area. It should turn white, then regain color within a couple of seconds after you stop pressing on it. To reduce the risk for developing infection, do not do this step if the skin is broken.\n* Apply ice packs to ease pain and swelling, but do not put ice directly on the skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth.\n* Take steps to prevent shock. Unless there is a head, leg, or back injury, lay the victim flat, elevate their feet about 12 inches (in) or 30 centimeters (cm), and cover the person with a coat or blanket.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\n* Do not move the person unless the injury has been completely immobilized.\n* Do not move a person with an injured hip, pelvis, or upper leg unless it is absolutely necessary. If you are the only rescuer and the person must be moved, drag them by their clothing.\n* Do not attempt to straighten a misshapen bone or joint or try to change its position.\n* Do not test a misshapen bone or joint for loss of function.\n* Do not give the person anything by mouth.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if the person has any of the following:\n\n* A bone projecting through the skin\n* A known or suspected dislocation or broken bone\n* An area below the injured joint that is pale, cold, clammy, or blue\n* Severe bleeding\n* Signs of infection, such as warmth or redness at the injured site, pus, or a fever\n\n---\n\n**Dislocation**\n\nA dislocation is a disruption of the normal position of the ends of two or more bones where they meet at a joint.\n\n**What is a Dislocated Joint?**\n\nA dislocated joint is a joint where the bones are no longer in their normal positions.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt may be hard to tell a dislocated joint from a broken bone.
