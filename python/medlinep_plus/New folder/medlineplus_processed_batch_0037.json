For example, you may need:\n\n* Antibiotics or other medicines for weeks to months\n* Extra nutrition because your bowels are not working correctly\n* Kidney dialysis several times a week\n* Cancer medicines often\n\nYour health care provider will talk with you about other methods for receiving medicine and fluids into a vein and will help you decide which one is best for you.\n\n**Placing the Port**\n\nA port is placed under your skin in a minor surgery. Most ports are placed in the chest. But they may also be placed in the arm.\n\nYou may be placed into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery.\nYou may stay awake and receive medicines to help you relax and numb the area so you do not feel pain.\n\nYou can go home after your port is placed.\n\nYou will be able to feel and see a quarter-sized bump under your skin where your port is.\nYou may be a little sore for a few days after surgery.\nOnce you have healed, your port should not hurt.\n\n**Taking Care of and Using Your Port**\n\nYour port has 3 parts:\n\n* Portal or reservoir. A pouch made of hard metal or plastic.\n* Silicone top. Where a needle is inserted into the portal.\n* Tube or catheter. Carries medicine or blood from the portal to a large vein and into the heart.\n\nTo get medicine or nutrition through your port, a trained provider will stick a special needle through your skin and the silicone top and into the portal. A numbing cream can be used on your skin to decrease the pain of the needle stick.\n\nYour port may be used in your home, in a clinic, or in the hospital.\nA sterile dressing (bandage) will be placed around your port when it is used to help prevent infection.\n\nWhen your port is not being used, you can bathe or swim, as long as your provider says you are ready for activity. Check with your provider if you plan to do any contact sports, such as soccer and football.\n\nNothing will stick out of your skin when your port is not being used. This decreases your chance of infection in or around your port.\n\nAbout once a month, you will need to have your port flushed to help prevent clots. To do this, your provider will use a special solution.\n\nPorts can be used for a long time. When you no longer need your port, your provider will remove it.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nTell your provider right away if you notice any signs of infection, such as:\n\n* Your port seems to have moved.\n* Your port site is red, or there are red streaks around the site.\n* Your port site is swollen or warm.\n* Yellow or green drainage is coming from your port site.\n* You have pain or discomfort at the site.\n* You have a fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C).\n* Your port cannot be accessed with the special needle.\n\n---\n\n**Central Venous Catheters - Ports**\n\nA central venous catheter is a thin tube that goes into a vein in your arm or chest and ends at the right side of your heart (right atrium).

    "content": "**Central Venous Line - Infants**\n\nA central venous line is a long, soft, flexible tube that is put into a large vein in the chest.\n\n**Information**\n\n* **Why Is A Central Venous Line Used?**\n\t+ A central venous line is most often put in when a baby cannot get a percutaneous inserted central catheter (PICC) or midline central catheter (MCC).\n\t+ A central venous line can be used to give nutrients or medicines to a baby.\n\t+ It is only put in when babies need IV nutrients or medicines for a long time.\n* **How Is A Central Venous Line Placed?**\n\t+ The central venous line is put in at the hospital.\n\t+ The health care provider will:\n\t\t- Give the baby pain medicine.\n\t\t- Clean the skin on the chest with a germ-killing solution (antiseptic).\n\t\t- Make a small surgical cut in the chest or groin.\n\t\t- Place a hollow needle into a small vein in the arm or leg.\n\t\t- Put the catheter through the hollow needle into a vein.\n\t\t- Push the catheter in until the tip is close to the heart often using ultrasound guidance.\n\t\t- Take an x-ray to make sure the central venous line is in the right place.\n* **What Are The Risks Of A Central Venous Line?**\n\t+ Risks include:\n\t\t- There is a small risk for infection. The longer the central venous line is in, the greater the risk.\n\t\t- Blood clots can form in the veins leading to the heart.\n\t\t- The catheters can wear away the blood vessel wall.\n\t\t- IV fluids or medicine can leak into other parts of the body. This is rare, but this can cause serious bleeding, breathing problems, and problems with the heart.\n\nIf the baby has any of these problems, the central venous line may be taken out. Talk to your baby's provider about the risks of a central venous line.\n\n---\n\n**Central Venous Line in Infants**\n\nA central venous line is a medical device used to deliver nutrients or medicines directly into the bloodstream of an infant. It is typically placed in infants who require long-term intravenous (IV) therapy.\n\n**How is a Central Venous Line Placed?**\n\nThe placement of a central venous line involves the following steps:\n\n*   The healthcare provider will give the baby pain medicine to minimize discomfort.\n*   The skin on the chest or groin area will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution.\n*   A small surgical cut will be made in the chosen location.\n*   A hollow needle is inserted into a vein in the arm or leg, and then a catheter is threaded through the needle into the vein.\n*   The catheter is gently pushed towards the heart, often using ultrasound guidance to ensure accurate placement.\n*   An x-ray is taken to confirm that the central venous line is correctly positioned.\n\n**What are the Risks of a Central Venous Line?**\n\nWhile generally safe, there are some risks associated with the use of a central venous line in infants. These include:\n\n*   Infection: There is a small risk of infection with the placement and use of a central venous line.\n*   Blood clots: The formation of blood clots in the veins leading to the heart is another potential complication.\n*   Catheter-related complications: The catheters can wear away the blood vessel wall, which may lead to bleeding or other problems.\n\n**Why is a Central Venous Line Used?**\n\nA central venous line is typically used when an infant requires long-term IV therapy and cannot be managed with other types of vascular access devices. It allows for the delivery of essential nutrients and medicines directly into the bloodstream, ensuring that the baby receives the necessary treatment to recover from their condition.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   CVL - infants\n*   Central catheter - infants - surgically placed",

    "content": "**Cephalexin**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCephalexin is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections; and infections of the bone, skin, ears, genital, and urinary tract. Cephalexin is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\n\nAntibiotics such as cephalexin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCephalexin comes as a capsule, tablet, and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 6 or 12 hours for 7 to 14 days, depending on the condition being treated. Take cephalexin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cephalexin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cephalexin. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\n\nContinue to take cephalexin until you finish the prescription even if you feel better. If you stop taking cephalexin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCephalexin is also sometimes used for certain penicillin allergic patients who have a heart condition and are having a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure, in order to prevent them from developing a heart valve infection.\n\n---\n\n**Cephalexin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Precautions for Patients with Heart Conditions**\n\nFor patients who have a heart condition and are having a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure, in order to prevent them from developing a heart valve infection.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nCephalexin is also sometimes used for certain penicillin allergic patients who have a heart condition and are having a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure, in order to prevent them from developing a heart valve infection.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking cephalexin,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cephalexin; other cephalosporin antibiotic such as cefaclor, cefadroxil cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol), cefdinir, cefditoren (Spectracef), cefepime (Maxipime), cefixime (Suprax), cefotaxime (Claforan), cefotetan, cefoxitin (Mefoxin), cefpodoxime, cefprozil, ceftaroline (Teflaro), ceftazidime (Fortaz, Tazicef, in Avycaz), ceftibuten (Cedax), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), and cefuroxime (Zinacef); penicillin antibiotics; or any other medications.

    "title": "Cerebral Palsy | CP | MedlinePlus",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/cerebralpalsy.html",
    "content": "**Cerebral Palsy**\n\nAlso called: CP\n\n**What is Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurologic disorders that cause problems with movement, balance, and posture. The first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles.\n\n**Types of Cerebral Palsy (CP)**\n\nThere are different types of CP:\n\n* Spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements.\n* Dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs.\n* Ataxic cerebral palsy, which causes problems with balance and coordination.\n* Mixed cerebral palsy, which means that you have symptoms of more than one type.\n\n**Causes of Cerebral Palsy (CP)**\n\nCP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. When this development or damage happens before birth, it is called congenital CP. Most CP is congenital, and its causes may include:\n\n* Gene changes (variants)\n* Brain malformations\n* Infections or fevers in the pregnant parent\n* An injury to the developing baby\n\nCP can also happen during or after birth. CP that happens more than 28 days after birth is called acquired CP. Its causes can include:\n\n* Brain damage in the first few months or years of life\n* Infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis\n* Problems with blood flow to the brain, for example from a stroke or abnormal blood vessels\n* Head injuries, for example from a car accident, a fall, or child abuse\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nCertain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery may increase a baby's risk of congenital cerebral palsy. These may include:\n\n* Being born too small\n* Being born too early\n* Being born a twin or other multiple birth\n* Being conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART)\n* Infections\n* Health problems in the pregnant parent, such as thyroid problems and seizures\n* Severe newborn jaundice\n* Having complications during birth\n* Rh incompatibility\n* Exposure to toxic chemicals during pregnancy\n\n**Signs of Cerebral Palsy (CP)**\n\nThere are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child. These signs usually appear in the early months of life. They may include:\n\n* Developmental delays. Your child may be slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk.\n* Abnormal muscle tone. Your child may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid.\n* An unusual posture or favoring one side of the body when reaching, crawling, or moving.\n* Stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity).\n* Shaking (tremor) of arms, legs, hands, or feet.\n* Sudden, uncontrolled movements.\n\n**Diagnosing Cerebral Palsy (CP)**\n\nDiagnosing CP involves several steps:\n\n* Developmental monitoring (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, they should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible.\n* Developmental screening involves giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays. If the screenings are not normal, the provider will recommend more evaluations.\n* Developmental and medical evaluations are done to diagnose which disorder your child has.\n\n**Treatments for Cerebral Palsy (CP)**\n\nThere is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.\n\nA team of health professionals will work with you and your child to develop a treatment plan. Common treatments include:\n\n* Medicines\n* Surgery\n* Assistive devices such as braces and walkers\n* Physical, occupational, recreational, and speech therapy\n\n**Can Cerebral Palsy (CP) be Prevented?**\n\nYou cannot prevent the genetic problems that can cause CP. But it may be possible to manage or avoid some of the risk factors for CP. For example:\n\n* If you are pregnant, make sure that you are vaccinated against infections that could cause CP in your developing baby.\n* Get regular prenatal care, which can reduce the risk of preterm birth or having a low birthweight baby. It can also help you manage any health conditions that could raise the risk of CP.\n* Use car seats for your baby to prevent head injuries that could cause CP.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nDressing with Ease, Style, and Comfort (ALS Association)\n\n**Specifics**\n\nAtaxic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in Spanish\nDyskinetic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in Spanish\nSpastic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in Spanish\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Palsy | CP**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurologic disorders that cause problems with movement, balance, and posture.

It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements.\n*   **Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy**: This causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs.\n*   **Ataxic Cerebral Palsy**: This causes problems with balance and coordination.\n*   **Mixed Cerebral Palsy**: This means that you have symptoms of more than one type.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nCP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. When this development or damage happens before birth, it is called congenital CP. Most CP is congenital, and its causes may include:\n\n*   Gene changes (variants)\n*   Brain malformations\n*   Infections or fevers in the pregnant parent\n*   An injury to the developing baby\n\nCP can also happen during or after birth. CP that happens more than 28 days after birth is called acquired CP. Its causes can include:\n\n*   Brain damage in the first few months or years of life\n*   Infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis\n*   Problems with blood flow to the brain, for example from a stroke or abnormal blood vessels\n*   Head injuries, for example from a car accident, a fall, or child abuse\n\nIn some cases, the cause of congenital or acquired CP is unknown.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nCertain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery may increase a baby's risk of congenital cerebral palsy. These may include:\n\n*   Being born too small\n*   Being born too early\n*   Being born a twin or other multiple birth\n*   Being conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART)\n*   Infections\n*   Health problems in the pregnant parent, such as thyroid problems and seizures\n*   Severe newborn jaundice\n*   Having complications during birth\n*   Rh incompatibility\n*   Exposure to toxic chemicals during pregnancy\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Signs of Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nThere are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child. These signs usually appear in the early months of life. They may include:\n\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Abnormal muscle tone\n*   An unusual posture or favoring one side of the body when reaching, crawling, or moving\n*   Stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity)\n*   Shaking (tremor) of arms, legs, hands, or feet\n*   Sudden, uncontrolled movements\n\nIt's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is Cerebral Palsy (CP) Diagnosed?**\n\nDiagnosing CP involves several steps:\n\n*   Developmental monitoring (or surveillance)\n*   Developmental screening\n*   Developmental and medical evaluations\n\nTo make the diagnosis, your provider will check your child's motor skills, muscle tone, reflexes, and posture. They will also ask about their medical history and may order lab tests, genetic tests, and/or imaging tests.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Treatments for Cerebral Palsy (CP)?**\n\nThere is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.\n\nA team of health professionals will work with you and your child to develop a treatment plan. Common treatments include:\n\n*   Medicines\n*   Surgery\n*   Assistive devices such as braces and walkers\n*   Physical, occupational, recreational, and speech therapy\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Can Cerebral Palsy (CP) be Prevented?**\n\nYou cannot prevent the genetic problems that can cause CP. But it may be possible to manage or avoid some of the risk factors for CP. For example:\n\n*   If you are pregnant, make sure that you are vaccinated against infections that could cause CP in your developing baby.\n*   Get regular prenatal care, which can reduce the risk of preterm birth or having a low birthweight baby. It can also help you manage any health conditions that could raise the risk of CP.\n*   Use car seats for your baby to prevent head injuries that could cause CP.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Palsy**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation) - In English and Spanish\n* Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\t+ Muscle weakness or spasticity\n\t+ Poor coordination and balance\n\t+ Delayed development of motor skills\n\t+ Seizures\n\t+ Intellectual disability\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* Botulinum Toxin Injections: A Treatment for Muscle Spasms (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Treatments for cerebral palsy may include:\n\t+ Physical therapy to improve muscle strength and mobility\n\t+ Occupational therapy to develop fine motor skills and daily living activities\n\t+ Speech therapy to improve communication skills\n\t+ Medications to manage symptoms such as spasticity, seizures, or intellectual disability\n\t+ Surgery to correct physical deformities or improve mobility\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Dressing with Ease, Style, and Comfort (ALS Association)\n* Individuals with cerebral palsy may experience related issues such as:\n\t+ Difficulty with daily living activities due to muscle weakness or spasticity\n\t+ Challenges with communication and social interaction\n\t+ Emotional and psychological struggles due to stigma or lack of understanding\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Ataxic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\n* Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\n* Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Nemours Foundation)\n* There are four main types of cerebral palsy:\n\t+ Spastic cerebral palsy: characterized by muscle stiffness and spasms\n\t+ Dyskinetic cerebral palsy: characterized by involuntary movements\n\t+ Ataxic cerebral palsy: characterized by poor coordination and balance\n\t+ Hypotonic cerebral palsy: characterized by low muscle tone\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Cerebral Palsy (National Institutes of Health)\n* Researchers are continually working to develop new treatments and improve existing ones for cerebral palsy.

Bleeding often occurs in the outer parts of the brain, called the cortex, and not the deep areas. Symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Some people have gradual memory problems. When a CT scan is done, there are often signs that they have had bleeding in the brain that they may not have realized.\n\nIf there is a lot of bleeding, immediate symptoms occur and resemble a stroke. These symptoms include:\n\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Headache (usually in a certain part of the head)\n*   Nervous system changes that may start suddenly, including confusion, delirium, double vision, decreased vision, sensation changes, speech problems, weakness, or paralysis\n*   Seizures\n*   Stupor or coma (rarely)\n*   Vomiting\n\nIf bleeding is not severe or widespread, symptoms can include:\n\n*   Episodes of confusion\n*   Headaches that come and go\n*   Loss of mental function (dementia)\n*   Weakness or unusual sensations that come and go, and involve smaller areas\n*   Seizures\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nCAA is hard to diagnose with certainty without a sample of brain tissue.

You should tell your provider if you:\n\n*   Have a history of bleeding problems or take medicines that are blood thinners\n*   Have had an allergic reaction to x-ray contrast dye or any iodine substance\n*   May be pregnant\n*   Have kidney function problems\n\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 8 hours before the test.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe x-ray table may feel hard and cold. You may ask for a blanket or pillow.\n\nSome people feel a sting when the numbing medicine (anesthetic) is given. You will feel a brief, sharp pain and pressure as the catheter is moved into the body. Once the initial placement is complete, you will not feel the catheter any longer.\n\nThe contrast may cause a warm or burning feeling of the skin of the face or head. This is normal and usually goes away within a few seconds.\n\nYou may have slight tenderness and bruising at the site of the injection after the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCerebral angiography is most often used to identify or confirm problems with the blood vessels in or around the brain.\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have symptoms or signs of:\n\n*   Abnormal blood vessels in the brain (vascular malformation)\n*   Bulging blood vessel in the brain (aneurysm)\n*   Narrowing of the arteries in the brain\n*   Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain (vasculitis)\n\nIt is sometimes used to:\n\n*   Look at blood flow to a tumor.\n*   Evaluate the arteries of the head and neck before surgery.\n*   Find a clot that may have caused a stroke. \n\nIn some cases, this procedure may be used to get more detailed information after something abnormal has been detected by an MRI or CT scan of the head.\n\nThis test may also be done in preparation for medical treatment (interventional radiology procedures) by way of certain blood vessels. For instance, this test can be part of a treatment for a stroke or to treat a brain aneurysm.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nContrast dye flowing out of the blood vessel may be a sign of bleeding.\n\nNarrowed or blocked arteries may suggest:\n\n*   Cholesterol deposits\n*   A spasm of a brain artery\n*   Inherited disorders\n*   Blood clots causing a stroke\n\nOut of place blood vessels may be due to:\n\n*   Brain tumors\n*   Bleeding within the skull\n*   Aneurysm\n*   Abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain (arteriovenous malformation)\n\nAbnormal results may also be due to cancer that started in another part of the body and has spread to the brain (metastatic brain tumor).\n\n**Risks**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n*   Blood clot or bleeding where the catheter is inserted, which could partly block blood flow to the leg or hand (rare)\n*   Damage to an artery or artery wall from the catheter, which can block blood flow and cause a stroke (rare)\n*   Damage to the kidneys from the IV contrast\n\n**Considerations**\n\nTell your provider right away if you have:\n\n*   Weakness in your face muscles\n*   Numbness in your leg during or after the procedure\n*   Slurred speech during or after the procedure\n*   Vision problems during or after the procedure\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Angiography**\n\nCerebral angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye (contrast material) and x-rays to see how blood flows through the brain.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nCerebral angiography is done in the hospital or radiology center.\n\n* You lie on an x-ray table.\n* Your head is held still using a strap, tape, or sandbags, so you do not move it during the procedure.\n* Before the test starts, you are given a mild sedative to help you relax.\n* An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors your heart activity during the test. Sticky patches, called leads, will be placed on your arms and legs. Wires connect the leads to the ECG machine.\n\nAn area of your body, usually the groin or wrist, is cleaned and numbed with a numbing medicine (local anesthetic). A thin, hollow tube called a catheter is placed through an artery. The catheter is carefully moved up through the main blood vessels into an artery in the neck. X-rays help your health care provider (usually a specially trained radiologist) guide the catheter to the correct position.\n\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is sent through the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the artery and blood vessels of the brain. The dye helps highlight any blockages in blood flow.\n\nSometimes, a computer removes the bones and tissues on the images being viewed, so that only the blood vessels filled with the dye are seen. This is called digital subtraction angiography (DSA).\n\nAfter the x-rays are taken, the catheter is withdrawn. Pressure is applied on the leg or wrist at the site of insertion for 10 to 15 minutes to stop the bleeding or a device is used to close the tiny hole. A tight bandage is then applied. Your leg should be kept straight for 2 to 6 hours after the procedure. Watch the area for bleeding for at least the next 12 hours.\n\nAngiography with a catheter is used less often now. This is because magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography give clearer images and do not require placing a catheter.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Angiography**\n\nCerebral angiography is a medical test used to identify or confirm problems with the blood vessels in or around the brain.

    "content": "**Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation**\n\nA cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of cerebral AVM is unknown, however growing evidence suggests a genetic cause. An AVM occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal small blood vessels (capillaries) between them.\n\nAVMs vary in size and location in the brain.\n\nAn AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to the blood vessel. This allows blood to leak (hemorrhage) into the brain or surrounding tissues and reduces blood flow to the brain.\n\nCerebral AVMs are rare. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life. Some people with an AVM also have brain aneurysms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn about one half of people with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.\n\n* Symptoms of an AVM that is bleeding:\n\t+ Confusion or disturbed sleep\n\t+ Ear noise/buzzing (also called pulsatile tinnitus)\n\t+ Headache in one or more parts of the head, may seem like a migraine\n\t+ Problems walking\n\t+ Seizures\n* Symptoms due to pressure on one area of the brain:\n\t+ Vision problems\n\t+ Dizziness\n\t+ Muscle weakness in an area of the body or face\n\t+ Numbness in an area of the body\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination. You'll be asked about your symptoms, with a focus on your nervous system problems. Tests that may be used to diagnose an AVM include:\n\n* Brain and neck angiogram\n* Computed tomography (CT) angiogram\n* Head MRI\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* Head CT scan\n* Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDetermining the best treatment for an AVM that is found on an imaging test, but is not causing any symptoms, can be difficult. Your provider will discuss with you:\n\n* The risk that your AVM will break open (rupture). If this happens, there may be permanent brain damage.\n* The risk for any brain damage if you have one of the surgeries listed below.\n\nYour provider may discuss different factors that may increase your risk for bleeding, including:\n\n* Current or planned pregnancies\n* What the AVM looks like on imaging tests\n* Size of the AVM\n* Your age\n* Your symptoms\n\nA bleeding AVM is a medical emergency.

Some treatments are used together.\n\n* Open brain surgery removes the abnormal connection. The surgery is done through an opening made in the skull.\n* Embolization (endovascular treatment):\n\t+ A catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin or arm. It enters an artery and then goes into the small blood vessels in your brain where the AVM is located.\n\t+ A glue-like substance is injected into the abnormal vessels. This stops the blood flow in the AVM and reduces the risk of bleeding.\n* Stereotactic radiosurgery:\n\t+ Radiation is aimed directly on the area of the AVM.

Others may have permanent seizures and brain and nervous system problems. AVMs that do not cause symptoms by the time people reach their late 40s or early 50s are more likely to remain stable, and in rare cases, cause symptoms. Only in rare cases will they cause symptoms.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Brain damage\n* Intracerebral hemorrhage\n* Language difficulties\n* Numbness of any part of the face or body\n* Persistent headache\n* Seizures\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* Vision changes\n* Water on the brain (hydrocephalus)\n* Weakness in part of the body\n\nPossible complications of open brain surgery include:\n\n* Brain swelling\n* Hemorrhage\n* Seizure\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of cerebral AVM is unknown, however growing evidence suggests a genetic cause. An AVM occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal small blood vessels (capillaries) between them.\n\nAVMs vary in size and location in the brain.\n\nAn AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to the blood vessel. This allows blood to leak (hemorrhage) into the brain or surrounding tissues and reduces blood flow to the brain.\n\nCerebral AVMs are rare. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life. Some people with an AVM also have brain aneurysms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn about one half of people with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.\n\nSymptoms of an AVM that is bleeding are:\n\n* Confusion or disturbed sleep\n* Ear noise/buzzing (also called pulsatile tinnitus)\n* Headache in one or more parts of the head, may seem like a migraine\n* Problems walking\n* Seizures\n\nSymptoms due to pressure on one area of the brain include:\n\n* Vision problems\n* Dizziness\n* Muscle weakness in an area of the body or face\n* Numbness in an area of the body\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination. You'll be asked about your symptoms, with a focus on your nervous system problems. Tests that may be used to diagnose an AVM include:\n\n* Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)\n* Treatment\n\nDetermining the best treatment for an AVM that is found on an imaging test, but is not causing any symptoms, can be difficult.

This stops the blood flow in the AVM and reduces the risk of bleeding. This may be the first choice for some kinds of AVMs, or if surgery can't be done.\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery:\n\n* Radiation is aimed directly on the area of the AVM. This causes scarring and shrinkage of the AVM and reduces the risk of bleeding.\n* It is particularly useful for small AVMs deep in the brain that are difficult to remove by surgery.\n\nMedicines to stop seizures are prescribed if needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSome people, whose first symptom is excessive brain bleeding, will die. Others may have permanent seizures and brain and nervous system problems.

The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function.\n\nIn cerebral hypoxia, sometimes only the oxygen supply is interrupted. This can be caused by:\n\n* Breathing in smoke (smoke inhalation), such as during a fire\n* Carbon monoxide poisoning\n* Choking\n* Diseases that prevent movement (paralysis) of the breathing muscles, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\n* High altitude exposure\n* Pressure on (compression) the windpipe (trachea)\n* Strangulation\n\nIn other cases, both oxygen and nutrient supply are stopped, caused by:\n\n* Cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping)\n* Cardiac arrhythmia (heart rhythm problems)\n* Complications of general anesthesia\n* Drowning\n* Illegal drug or medicine overdose\n* Injuries to a newborn that occurred before, during, or soon after birth, such as cerebral palsy\n* Prolonged seizure (status epilepticus)\n* Stroke\n* Very low blood pressure\n\n_Brain Cells and Oxygen Supply_\n\nBrain cells are very sensitive to a lack of oxygen. Some brain cells start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears. As a result, brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or death.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include:\n\n* Change in attention (inattentiveness)\n* Poor judgment\n* Speech disorder\n* Uncoordinated movement\n\nSymptoms of severe cerebral hypoxia include:\n\n* Complete unawareness and unresponsiveness (coma)\n* No breathing\n* No response of the pupils of the eye to light\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Hypoxia**\n\n_Causes_\n\nIn cerebral hypoxia, sometimes only the oxygen supply is interrupted.

Basic life support is most important.\n*   Treatment involves:\n    *   Breathing assistance (mechanical ventilation) and oxygen\n    *   Regulating the heart rate and rhythm\n    *   Fluids, blood products, or medicines to raise blood pressure if it is low\n    *   Medicines or general anesthetics to calm seizures\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   The outlook depends on the extent of the brain injury.\n*   This is determined by how long the brain lacked oxygen, and whether nutrition to the brain was also affected.\n*   If the brain lacked oxygen for only a brief period, a coma may be reversible and the person may have a full or partial return of function.\n*   Some people recover many functions, but have abnormal movements, such as twitching or jerking, called myoclonus. Seizures may sometimes occur, and may be continuous (status epilepticus).\n*   Most people who make a full recovery were only briefly unconscious. The longer a person is unconscious, the higher the risk for death or brain death, and the lower the chances of recovery.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   Complications of cerebral hypoxia include a prolonged vegetative state.\n*   This means the person may have basic life functions, such as breathing, blood pressure, sleep-wake cycle, and eye opening, but the person is not alert and does not respond to their surroundings. Such people usually die within a year, although some may survive longer.\n*   Major complications may include:\n    *   Bed sores\n    *   Clots in the veins (deep vein thrombosis)\n    *   Lung infections (pneumonia)\n    *   Malnutrition\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Hypoxia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Complications and Survival**\n\nSuch people usually die within a year, although some may survive longer.\n\nThe length of survival depends partly on how much care is taken to prevent other problems. Major complications may include:\n\n*   Bed sores\n*   Clots in the veins (deep vein thrombosis)\n*   Lung infections (pneumonia)\n*   Malnutrition\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCerebral hypoxia is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately if someone is losing consciousness or has other symptoms of cerebral hypoxia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention depends on the specific cause of hypoxia. Unfortunately, hypoxia is usually unexpected. This makes the condition somewhat difficult to prevent.\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be lifesaving, especially when it is started right away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHypoxic encephalopathy; Anoxic encephalopathy",

    "content": "**Cerebral Palsy**\n\n_Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that involve the brain, affecting nervous system functions such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking._\n\n**Types of CP**\n\n*   Spastic\n*   Dyskinetic\n*   Ataxic\n*   Hypotonic\n*   Mixed\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Cerebral palsy is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life while the baby's brain is still developing._\n\nSome causes include:\n\n*   Low level of oxygen (hypoxia) in certain areas of the brain\n*   Premature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP\n*   Certain conditions such as bleeding in the brain, brain infections, head injury, infections in the mother during pregnancy, untreated jaundice, injuries to the brain during childbirth process, and exposure to toxins while developing (mercury)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_Symptoms of cerebral palsy can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:_\n\n*   Be very mild or very severe\n*   Only involve one side of the body or both sides\n*   Be more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs\n\nSymptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months.\n\n**Types of Cerebral Palsy**\n\n_Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. Symptoms include:_\n\n*   Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch\n*   Abnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make \"scissors\" movements, walk on the toes\n*   Joints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture)\n*   Muscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis)\n\nThe following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:\n\n*   Abnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stress\n*   Tremors\n*   Unsteady gait\n*   Loss of coordination\n*   Floppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much\n\n**Other Brain and Nervous System Symptoms**\n\n_Learning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normal. Speech problems (dysarthria) may occur, as well as hearing or vision problems. Seizures may also occur._\n\n**Eating and Digestion Symptoms**\n\n_Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adults. Vomiting or constipation may also occur._\n\n**Other Symptoms**\n\n_Increased drooling, slower than normal growth, irregular breathing, urinary incontinence, and scoliosis may all be symptoms of cerebral palsy._\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n_A full neurologic exam will be performed by your health care provider. In older people, testing cognitive function is also important._\n\nOther tests may be performed as needed, most often to rule out other disorders:\n\n*   Blood tests\n*   CT scan of the head\n*   Cranial ultrasound (especially in pre-term infants)\n*   Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n*   Hearing screen\n*   MRI of the head\n*   Vision testing\n\n**Treatment**\n\n_There is no cure for cerebral palsy. The goal of treatment is to help the person be as independent as possible._\n\nTreatment requires a team approach, including:\n\n*   Primary care provider\n*   Dentist (dental check-ups are recommended around every 6 months)\n*   Social worker\n*   Nurses\n*   Occupational, physical, and speech therapists\n*   Other specialists, including a neurologist, rehabilitation physician (physiatrist), pulmonologist, and gastroenterologist\n\nTreatment is based on the person's symptoms and the need to prevent complications.\n\nSelf and home care include:\n\n*   Getting enough food and nutrition\n*   Keeping the home safe\n*   Performing exercises recommended by the providers\n*   Practicing proper bowel care (stool softeners, fluids, fiber, laxatives, regular bowel habits)\n*   Protecting the joints from injury\n\nPutting the child in regular schools is recommended unless physical disabilities or mental development makes this impossible. Special education or schooling may help.\n\nThe following may help with communication and learning:\n\n*   Glasses\n*   Hearing aids\n*   Muscle and bone braces\n*   Walking aids\n*   Wheelchairs\n\nPhysical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopedic help, or other treatments may also be needed to help with daily activities and care.\n\nMedicines may include:\n\n*   Anticonvulsants to prevent or reduce the frequency of seizures\n*   Botulinum toxin to help with spasticity and drooling\n*   Muscle relaxants to reduce tremors and spasticity\n\nSurgery may be needed in some cases to:\n\n*   Control gastroesophageal reflux\n*   Cut certain nerves from the spinal cord to help with pain and spasticity\n*   Place a pump for medicine administration into spinal canal\n*   Place a feeding tube\n*   Release joint contractures\n\nShockwave therapy to reduce spasticity is being investigated.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\n_Stress and burnout among parents and other caregivers of people with cerebral palsy is common. Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in CP._\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n_CP is a life-long disorder. Long-term care may be required. The disorder does not affect expected length of life. The amount of disability varies. Babies with mild CP may outgrow their symptoms._\n\nMany adults are able to live in the community, either independently or with different levels of help.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n_CP may lead to the following health problems:_\n\n*   Bone thinning (osteoporosis)\n*   Bowel obstruction\n*   Hip dislocation and arthritis in the hip joint\n*   Injuries from falls\n*   Pressure sores\n*   Joint contractures\n*   Pneumonia caused by choking\n*   Poor nutrition\n*   Reduced communication skills (sometimes)\n*   Reduced intellect (sometimes)\n*   Scoliosis\n*   Seizures (in about half of the people who are affected by cerebral palsy)\n*   Social stigma\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Palsy**\n\n_Cerebral palsy_ is a group of disorders that involve the brain. This affects nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking.\n\n**Types of Cerebral Palsy**\n\nThere are several different types of CP, including:\n\n* Spastic\n* Dyskinetic\n* Ataxic\n* Hypotonic\n* Mixed\n\n**Causes**\n\nCP is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.\n\nIn some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen (hypoxia) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs.\n\nPremature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as:\n\n* Bleeding in the brain\n* Brain infections (encephalitis, meningitis, herpes simplex infections)\n* Head injury\n* Infections in the mother during pregnancy (rubella)\n* Untreated jaundice\n* Injuries to the brain during the childbirth process\n* Exposure to toxins while developing (mercury)\n\nIn some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:\n\n* Be very mild or very severe\n* Only involve one side of the body or both sides\n* Be more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs\n\nSymptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.\n\nThere are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms.\n\n**Spastic Cerebral Palsy**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch. They may tighten even more over time.\n* Abnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make \"scissors\" movements, walk on the toes.\n* Joints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture).\n* Muscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis).\n* Symptoms may affect one arm or leg, one side of the body, both legs, or both arms and legs.\n\nThe following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:\n\n* Abnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stress\n* Tremors\n* Unsteady gait\n* Loss of coordination\n* Floppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much\n\nOther brain and nervous system symptoms may include:\n\n* Learning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normal\n* Speech problems (dysarthria)\n* Hearing or vision problems\n* Seizures\n* Pain, especially in adults, which can be difficult to manage\n\nEating and digestion symptoms:\n\n* Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adults\n* Vomiting or constipation\n\nOther symptoms:\n\n* Increased drooling\n* Slower than normal growth\n* Irregular breathing\n* Urinary incontinence\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a full neurologic exam. In older people, testing cognitive function is also important.\n\nOther tests may be performed as needed, most often to rule out other disorders:\n\n* Blood tests\n* CT scan of the head\n* Cranial ultrasound (especially in pre-term infants)\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* Hearing screen\n* MRI of the head\n* Vision testing\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for CP. The goal of treatment is to help the person be as independent as possible.\n\nTreatment requires a team approach, including:\n\n* Primary care provider\n* Dentist (dental check-ups are recommended around every 6 months)\n* Social worker\n* Nurses\n* Occupational, physical, and speech therapists\n* Other specialists, including a neurologist, rehabilitation physician (physiatrist), pulmonologist, and gastroenterologist\n\nTreatment is based on the person's symptoms and the need to prevent complications.\n\nSelf and home care include:\n\n* Getting enough food and nutrition\n* Keeping the home safe\n* Performing exercises recommended by the providers\n* Practicing proper bowel care (stool softeners, fluids, fiber, laxatives, regular bowel habits)\n* Protecting the joints from injury\n\nPutting the child in regular schools is recommended unless physical disabilities or mental development makes this impossible. Special education or schooling may help.\n\nThe following may help with communication and learning:\n\n* Glasses\n* Hearing aids\n* Muscle and bone braces\n* Walking aids\n* Wheelchairs\n\nPhysical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopedic help, or other treatments may also be needed to help with daily activities and care.\n\nMedicines may include:\n\n* Anticonvulsants to prevent or reduce the frequency of seizures\n* Botulinum toxin to help with spasticity and drooling\n* Muscle relaxants to reduce tremors and spasticity\n\nSurgery may be needed in some cases to:\n\n* Control gastroesophageal reflux\n* Cut certain nerves from the spinal cord to help with pain and spasticity\n* Place a pump for medicine administration into spinal canal\n* Place a feeding tube\n* Release joint contractures\n\nShockwave therapy to reduce spasticity is being investigated.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nStress and burnout among parents and other caregivers of people with cerebral palsy is common. Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in CP.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCP is a life-long disorder. Long-term care may be required. The disorder does not affect expected length of life. The amount of disability varies. Babies with mild CP may outgrow their symptoms.\n\nMany adults are able to live in the community, either independently or with different levels of help.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCP may lead to the following health problems:\n\n* Bone thinning (osteoporosis)\n* Bowel obstruction\n* Hip dislocation and arthritis in the hip joint\n* Injuries from falls\n* Pressure sores\n* Joint contractures\n* Pneumonia caused by choking\n* Poor nutrition\n* Reduced communication skills (sometimes)\n* Reduced intellect (sometimes)\n* Scoliosis\n* Seizures (in about half of the people who are affected by cerebral palsy)\n* Social stigma\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if symptoms of CP develop, especially if you know that an injury occurred during birth or early infancy.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGetting the proper prenatal care may reduce the risk for some rare causes of CP. In most cases though, the injury causing the disorder is not preventable.\n\nPregnant mothers with certain medical conditions may need to be followed in a high-risk prenatal clinic.\n\nAdults with CP should continue to follow-up with a neurologist to reduce the risk of late complications.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Palsy**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCP is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.\n\nIn some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen (hypoxia) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs.\n\nPremature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as:\n\n* Bleeding in the brain\n* Brain infections (encephalitis, meningitis, herpes simplex infections)\n* Head injury\n* Infections in the mother during pregnancy (rubella)\n* Untreated jaundice\n* Injuries to the brain during the childbirth process\n* Exposure to toxins while developing (mercury)\n\nIn some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:\n\n* Be very mild or very severe\n* Only involve one side of the body or both sides\n* Be more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs\n\nSymptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.\n\nThere are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms.\n\nSpastic CP is the most common type. Symptoms include:\n\n* Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch. They may tighten even more over time.\n* Abnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make \"scissors\" movements, walk on the toes.\n* Joints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture).\n* Muscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis).\n\nSymptoms may affect one arm or leg, one side of the body, both legs, or both arms and legs.\n\nThe following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:\n\n* Abnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stress\n* Tremors\n* Unsteady gait\n* Loss of coordination\n* Floppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much\n\nOther brain and nervous system symptoms may include:\n\n* Learning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normal\n* Speech problems (dysarthria)\n* Hearing or vision problems\n* Seizures\n* Pain, especially in adults, which can be difficult to manage\n\nEating and digestion symptoms:\n\n* Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adults\n* Vomiting or constipation\n\nOther symptoms:\n\n* Increased drooling\n* Slower than normal growth\n* Irregular breathing\n* Urinary incontinence\n\n---\n\n**Cerebral Palsy: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\ncan be difficult to manage\n\n* Eating and digestion symptoms:\n\t+ Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adults\n\t+ Vomiting or constipation\n* Other symptoms:\n\t+ Increased drooling\n\t+ Slower than normal growth\n\t+ Irregular breathing\n\t+ Urinary incontinence\n\nSymptoms may occur before a child is 2 years old.

    "content": "**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**\n\nA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis tests a sample of your CSF for diseases that affect the brain and spinal cord, which make up your central nervous system. Your central nervous system controls and coordinates everything you do, including your ability to move, breathe, see, think, and more.\n\n**What is CSF?**\n\nCSF is a clear, colorless, watery fluid that flows in and around your brain and spinal cord. It acts like a cushion that helps protect them from sudden impact or injury. It also removes waste products from the brain and helps your central nervous system work properly.\n\nThe CSF normally has substances like water, vitamins, and nutrients in it and is free of cells, proteins, and toxins (a type of poison). Certain diseases of the brain and spinal cord and other conditions that affect the central nervous system can cause a change in the amount of CSF you have or what substances are in your CSF. A CSF analysis is a group of tests that use a sample of your CSF to help diagnose these types of diseases.\n\n**Other names:**\n\nSpinal Fluid Analysis, CSF Analysis\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CSF analysis is used to measure different substances in your CSF. It may include tests to diagnose:\n\n* Infectious diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).\n* Autoimmune disorders, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a rare disorder where the immune system attacks the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the body) and multiple sclerosis (MS; a nervous system disease of the brain and spinal cord).\n* Bleeding in the brain.\n* Brain tumors, including from cancers in other parts of the body that may spread to the central nervous system.\n* Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, which includes memory loss, confusion, and changes in behavior.\n\n**Why do I need a CSF analysis?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a CSF analysis if you have:\n\nSymptoms of an infection or bleeding in the brain or spinal cord\nSymptoms of an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)\nHad a brain injury or an injury to your spinal cord\nHave cancer that may have spread to your central nervous system\nSymptoms that may be from another central nervous system condition, such as headaches\n\n**What happens during a CSF analysis?**\n\nTo get a sample of CSF, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure:\n\nYou will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.\nA provider will clean your back to disinfect it and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.\nWhen the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.\nYour provider will withdraw a small amount of CSF for testing. This will take about five minutes.\nYou'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.\nYour provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CSF analysis, but you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted.\n\nYou may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more, but your provider may suggest treatment to help relieve the pain.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**\n\n**What is a CSF analysis?**\n\nA CSF analysis is a medical test used to diagnose various conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord. It involves measuring different substances in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds your brain and spinal cord.\n\n**When is a CSF analysis ordered?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a CSF analysis if you have:\n\n* Symptoms of an infection or bleeding in the brain or spinal cord\n* Symptoms of an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)\n* Had a brain injury or an injury to your spinal cord\n* Have cancer that may have spread to your central nervous system\n* Symptoms that may be from another central nervous system condition, such as headaches\n\n**What are the symptoms of a brain or spinal cord infection?**\n\nThe symptoms of a brain or spinal cord infection include:\n\n* Fever\n* Severe headache\n* Seizures\n* Stiff neck\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Sensitivity to light\n* Double vision\n* Changes in behavior\n* Confusion\n\n**What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)?**\n\nThe symptoms of MS often vary and come and go, or they may steadily get worse. They may include:\n\n* Blurred or double vision\n* Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, body, or face\n* Painful muscle spasms\n* Weak muscles, often in the hands and legs\n* Dizziness, balance problems, or clumsy movement when walking\n* Bladder control problems\n* Fatigue\n* Problems thinking or learning new things\n\n**What happens during a CSF analysis?**\n\nTo get a sample of CSF, your health care provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. During the procedure:\n\n* You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table\n* A provider will clean your back to disinfect it and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure\n* When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine\n* Your provider will withdraw a small amount of CSF for testing\n* This will take about five minutes\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CSF analysis, but you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted. You may also have some bleeding at the site or get a headache.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA CSF analysis may include a variety of different tests on your sample. So, the measurements on your test results will depend on which tests were done. Your provider can explain what your results mean.\n\nIn general, your CSF analysis results may show that you have an infection, an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), or another disease or injury of the brain or spinal cord. Your provider will likely order more tests to confirm your diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**\n\nAre life-threatening emergencies. If your provider suspects you have bacterial meningitis or another serious infection, you may need to start medicine before you have a final diagnosis.\n\n**References**\n\n* Allina Health.

    "content": "**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection**\n\n_Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is a test to look at the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord._\n\n**What is CSF?**\n\nCSF acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and spine from injury. The fluid is normally clear. It has the same consistency as water.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThere are different ways to get a sample of CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common method.\n\n1. **Lying Position**: You will lie on your side with your knees pulled up toward the chest, and chin tucked downward.\n2. **Local Anesthetic**: After the back is cleaned, the health care provider will inject a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the lower spine.\n3. **Spinal Needle**: A spinal needle will be inserted.\n4. **Pressure Measurement**: An opening pressure is sometimes taken. An abnormal pressure can indicate an infection or other problem.\n5. **CSF Collection**: Once the needle is in position, and after the CSF pressure is measured, a sample of 1 to 10 milliliters (mL) of CSF is collected in 4 vials.\n\n**Rare Methods of CSF Collection**\n\n*   Cisternal puncture: uses a needle placed below the occipital bone (back of the skull). It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem.\n*   Ventricular puncture: may be recommended in people with possible brain herniation. It is most often done in the operating room.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will need to give the health care team your consent before the test. Tell your provider if you are on any aspirin or any other blood-thinning medicines.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou should plan to rest for several hours, even if you feel fine. This is to prevent fluid from leaking around the site of the puncture. You will not need to lie flat on your back the entire time. If you develop a headache, it may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing.\n\nCSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as meningitis) and brain or spinal cord damage.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values typically range as follows:\n\n*   Pressure: 70 to 180 mm H2O\n*   Appearance: clear, colorless\n*   CSF total protein: 15 to 60 mg/100 mL (0.15 to 0.6 g/L)\n*   Gamma globulin: 3% to 12% of the total protein\n*   CSF glucose: 50 to 80 mg/100 mL or 2.77 to 4.44 mmol/L (or greater than two thirds of blood sugar level)\n*   CSF cell count: 0 to 5 white blood cells (all mononuclear), and no red blood cells\n*   Chloride: 110 to 125 mEq/L\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf the CSF looks cloudy, it could mean there is an infection or a buildup of white blood cells or protein.\n\nIf the CSF looks bloody or red, it may be a sign of bleeding or spinal cord obstruction. If it is brown, orange, or yellow, it may be a sign of increased CSF protein or previous bleeding (more than 3 days ago). There may be blood in the sample that came from the spinal tap itself. This makes it harder to interpret the test results.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of lumbar puncture include:\n\n*   Bleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (subdural hematomas).\n*   Discomfort during the test.\n*   Headache after the test that can last a few hours or days. It may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda to help relieve the headache. If headaches last more than a few days (especially when you sit, stand or walk) you might have a CSF-leak. You should talk to your physician if this occurs.\n*   Hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic.\n*   Infection introduced by the needle going through the skin.\n\nBrain herniation may occur if this test is done on a person with a mass in the brain (such as a tumor or abscess). This can result in brain damage or death. This test is not done if an exam or test reveals signs of a brain mass.\n\nDamage to the nerves in the spinal cord may occur, particularly if the person moves during the test.\n\nCisternal puncture or ventricular puncture carries additional risks of brain or spinal cord damage and bleeding within the brain.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThis test is more dangerous for people with:\n\n*   A tumor in the back of the brain that is pressing down on the brainstem\n*   Blood clotting problems\n*   Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)\n*   Individuals taking blood thinners, aspirin, clopidogrel, or other similar drugs to decrease the formation of blood clots.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection**\n\n**What is CSF?**\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and spine from injury. It has the same consistency as water and is normally clear.\n\n**How is CSF collected?**\n\nThere are different ways to get a sample of CSF:\n\n*   **Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)**: The most common method.\n*   **Cisternal puncture**: Uses a needle placed below the occipital bone (back of the skull). It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem. It is always done with fluoroscopy or other imaging guidance.\n*   **Ventricular puncture**: May be recommended in people with possible brain herniation. It is most often done in the operating room. A hole is drilled in the skull, and a needle is inserted directly into one of the brain's ventricles.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will need to give the health care team your consent before the test. Tell your provider if you are on any aspirin or any other blood-thinning medicines.\n\n**What Happens During the Test?**\n\nTo have the test:\n\n1.  You will lie on your side with your knees pulled up toward the chest, and chin tucked downward.\n2.  The health care provider will inject a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the lower spine.\n3.  A spinal needle will be inserted.\n4.  An opening pressure is sometimes taken. An abnormal pressure can indicate an infection or other problem.\n5.  Once the needle is in position, and after the CSF pressure is measured, a sample of 1 to 10 milliliters (mL) of CSF is collected in 4 vials.\n\n**How Will I Feel During the Test?**\n\nIt may be uncomfortable to stay in position for the test. Staying still is important because movement may lead to injury of the spinal cord.\n\nYou may be told to straighten your position slightly after the needle is in place. This is to help measure the CSF pressure.\n\nThe anesthetic will sting or burn when first injected. There will be a hard pressure sensation when the needle is inserted. Often, there is some brief discomfort when the needle goes through the tissue surrounding the spinal cord. This pain should stop in a few seconds.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing.\n\nCSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as meningitis) and brain or spinal cord damage. A spinal tap may also be done to establish the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus or bleeding into the spinal fluid from an aneurysm.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values typically range as follows:\n\n*   Pressure: 70 to 180 mm H2O\n*   Appearance: clear, colorless\n*   CSF total protein: 15 to 60 mg/100 mL (0.15 to 0.6 g/L)\n*   Gamma globulin: 3% to 12% of the total protein\n*   CSF glucose: 50 to 80 mg/100 mL or 2.77 to 4.44 mmol/L (or greater than two thirds of blood sugar level)\n*   CSF cell count: 0 to 5 white blood cells (all mononuclear), and no red blood cells\n*   Chloride: 110 to 125 mEq/L\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf the CSF looks cloudy, it could mean there is an infection or a buildup of white blood cells or protein.\n\nIf the CSF looks bloody or red, it may be a sign of bleeding or spinal cord obstruction. If it is brown, orange, or yellow, it may be a sign of increased CSF protein or previous bleeding (more than 3 days ago). There may be blood in the sample that came from the spinal tap itself. This makes it harder to interpret the test results.\n\nCSF PRESSURE\n\nIncreased CSF pressure may be due to increased intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull).\nDecreased CSF pressure may be due to spinal block, dehydration, or CSF leakage.\n\nCSF PROTEIN\n\nIncreased CSF protein may be due to blood in the CSF, diabetes, polyneuritis, tumor, injury, or any inflammatory or infectious condition.\nDecreased protein is a sign of rapid CSF production or systemic loss of protein.\n\nCSF GLUCOSE\n\nIncreased CSF glucose is a sign of high blood sugar.\nDecreased CSF glucose may be due to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), bacterial or fungal infection (such as meningitis), tuberculosis, or certain other types of meningitis.\n\nBLOOD CELLS IN CSF\n\nIncreased white blood cells in the CSF may be a sign of meningitis, acute infection, beginning of a long-term (chronic) illness, tumor, abscess, or demyelinating disease (such as multiple sclerosis).\nRed blood cells in the CSF sample may be a sign of bleeding into the spinal fluid or the result of a traumatic lumbar puncture.\n\nOTHER CSF RESULTS\n\nIncreased CSF gamma globulin levels may be due to diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection**\n\n**What is Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection?**\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is a test to look at the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.\n\n**How Does CSF Act as a Cushion?**\n\nCSF acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and spine from injury. The fluid is normally clear. It has the same consistency as water.

Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common method.\n\nTo have the test:\n\n*   You will lie on your side with your knees pulled up toward the chest, and chin tucked downward. Sometimes the test is done sitting up, but bent forward.\n*   After the back is cleaned, the health care provider will inject a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the lower spine.\n*   A spinal needle will be inserted.\n*   An opening pressure is sometimes taken. An abnormal pressure can indicate an infection or other problem.\n*   Once the needle is in position, and after the CSF pressure is measured, a sample of 1 to 10 milliliters (mL) of CSF is collected in 4 vials.\n*   The needle is removed, the area is cleaned, and a bandage is placed over the needle site. You may be asked to remain lying down for a short time after the test.\n\nIn some cases, special x-rays are used to help guide the needle into position. This is called fluoroscopy.\n\nLumbar puncture with fluid collection may also be part of other procedures such as an x-ray or CT scan after dye has been inserted into the CSF.\n\nRarely, other methods of CSF collection may be used.\n\nCisternal puncture uses a needle placed below the occipital bone (back of the skull). It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem. It is always done with fluoroscopy or other imaging guidance.\n\nVentricular puncture may be recommended in people with possible brain herniation. It is most often done in the operating room. A hole is drilled in the skull, and a needle is inserted directly into one of the brain's ventricles.\n\nCSF may also be collected from a tube that is already placed in the fluid, such as a shunt or a ventricular drain.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will need to give the health care team your consent before the test. Tell your provider if you are on any aspirin or any other blood-thinning medicines.\n\n---\n\n**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will need to give the health care team your consent before the test.

When certolizumab injection is used to treat Crohn's disease, it is usually given every two weeks for the first three doses and then every four weeks for as long as treatment continues. If you are injecting certolizumab injection yourself, follow the directions on your prescription label carefully. Do not inject more or less certolizumab than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you will be injecting certolizumab injection by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the written instructions for use that come with the medication.\n\nIf you are using a prefilled syringe that has been refrigerated, place it on a flat surface and allow it warm to room temperature for about 30 minutes before you are ready to inject the medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method.\n\n---\n\n**How to Use Certolizumab Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Important:** Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method.\n\nBefore you open the package containing your medication, check to be sure that the package is not torn, that the tamper-evident seals on the top and bottom of the package are not missing or broken and that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed.

Do not inject the medication into skin that is tender, bruised, red, or hard, or that has scars or stretch marks.\n\n\\n\\n\n**How to Inject Certolizumab Injection**\n\nDo not inject the medication in the same spot more than once. Choose a new spot at least 1 inch away from a spot that you have used before each time you inject the medication. If your doctor has told you to inject two syringes of certolizumab for each dose, choose a different spot for each injection.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Disposal of Used Syringes**\n\nDo not reuse certolizumab prefilled syringes and do not recap the syringes after use. Discard used syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your pharmacist how to discard the container.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Remember:** Certolizumab injection may help to control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition.

    "content": "**Ceruloplasmin Test**\n\nA ceruloplasmin test measures the amount of ceruloplasmin in a sample of your blood. Your liver makes ceruloplasmin by attaching copper to a protein. Your liver releases the ceruloplasmin into your bloodstream so it can carry copper to the parts of your body that need it.\n\n**What is Ceruloplasmin?**\n\nCeruloplasmin is a protein made by your liver that carries copper in your blood. Copper is a mineral that your body uses for many important processes, including making energy, blood vessels, and melanin (the substance that gives your skin and eyes their color). Copper helps your body use iron, and it supports brain development. It helps keep your nervous and immune systems healthy, too.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Ceruloplasmin Test?**\n\nYou may need a ceruloplasmin test if you have symptoms of Wilson disease or other conditions that affect copper levels in your blood. These symptoms can include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in your upper abdomen (belly)\n* Urine that's a darker color than usual and/or stool (poop) that's a lighter color\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* A type of anemia, called hemolytic anemia, that destroys red blood cells faster than your body can make them\n* Swelling from fluid buildup in your belly, lower legs, or feet\n* Itchy skin\n* Trouble with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination\n* Tremors\n* Stiff muscles and/or sudden jerky movements you can't control\n* Mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, or psychosis\n* Green, gold, or brown rings around your irises (the colored part of your eyes)\n\nIf you have a family history of Wilson disease, you may need a test even if you don't have symptoms.\n\n**What Happens During the Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of a ceruloplasmin test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. The meaning of your test results will depend on the results of other tests, including tests that measure the amount of copper in your blood and/or urine.\n\nTo make a diagnosis, your provider will consider all your test results along with your symptoms, medical history, and family history. Ask your provider to explain what your ceruloplasmin levels say about your health.\n\nIn general, lower than normal ceruloplasmin levels may mean your body is not able to use copper properly. Low ceruloplasmin may be a sign of:\n\n* Wilson disease\n* Menkes syndrome\n* Severe liver disease\n* Kidney disease\n* A lack of copper caused by malnutrition and/or malabsorption\n\nHigher than normal ceruloplasmin levels may be linked to:\n\n* Heart disease\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Leukemia\n* Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Infection, inflammation, or injury\n\n---\n\n**Ceruloplasmin Test**\n\n\\n\\nTo stay healthy, most people get enough copper from the foods they eat. Good sources of copper include shellfish, nuts and seeds, beef liver and other organ meats, wheat-bran cereals, and chocolate.\n\n\\n\\nNormally, most of the copper in your blood is part of ceruloplasmin. So, ceruloplasmin testing can help diagnose conditions that involve having too much or too little copper in your body.\n\n**What is Ceruloplasmin?**\n\nA ceruloplasmin test measures the amount of ceruloplasmin in a sample of your blood. Your liver makes ceruloplasmin by attaching copper to a protein. Your liver releases the ceruloplasmin into your bloodstream so it can carry copper to the parts of your body that need it.\n\n**What is Ceruloplasmin Used For?**\n\nA ceruloplasmin test is most often used with other tests to help diagnose Wilson disease. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from removing extra copper.\n\n\\n\\nWilson disease can lead to a harmful buildup of copper in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. The high levels of copper can severely damage organs and become life-threatening\n\n**Why Do I Need a Ceruloplasmin Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a ceruloplasmin test if you have symptoms of Wilson disease. Even though people are born with the disease, the symptoms don't appear until copper builds up in your liver, brain, or other organs. This usually happens between ages 4 and 40, but symptoms can appear earlier or later in life.\n\n\\n\\nWilson disease can cause many types of symptoms depending on which parts of your body are affected. For example:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in your upper abdomen (belly)\n* Urine that's a darker color than usual and/or stool (poop) that's a lighter color\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* A type of anemia, called hemolytic anemia, that destroys red blood cells faster than your body can make them\n* Swelling from fluid buildup in your belly, lower legs, or feet\n* Itchy skin\n* Trouble with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination\n* Tremors\n* Stiff muscles and/or sudden jerky movements you can't control\n* Mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, or psychosis\n* Green, gold, or brown rings around your irises (the colored part of your eyes)\n\n\\n\\nIf you have a family history of Wilson disease, you may need a test even if you don't have symptoms.\n\nYou may also need this test if you have symptoms that could be a sign of too little copper, such as:\n\n* Abnormally low levels of white blood cells called neutrophils\n* Osteoporosis, a condition that causes bones to become weak and break easily\n* Fatigue\n* Tingling in your hands and feet\n* Pale skin\n\n\\n\\nYour baby may need a ceruloplasmin test if they have symptoms of Menkes syndrome. Symptoms usually show up when babies are about two or three months old. They may include:\n\n* Hair that is colorless, thin, breaks easily, and becomes unusually tangled\n* Floppy muscles\n* Seizures\n* Slow weight gain and growth\n\n\\n\\nWithout treatment, most children with Menkes syndrome die within the first few years of life. If treatment is given in the first month after birth, some children may live longer. But even with treatment, the disease still tends to get worse over time.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with abnormal copper levels, you may need regular ceruloplasmin testing to check your condition and to see how well your treatment is working.\n\n---\n\n**Ceruloplasmin Test**\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with abnormal copper levels, your healthcare provider may recommend regular ceruloplasmin testing to monitor your condition and assess the effectiveness of your treatment.\n\n**What Happens During a Ceruloplasmin Test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The procedure typically takes less than five minutes, and you may feel a slight sting when the needle is inserted or removed.\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nThere's no special preparation required for a ceruloplasmin test. Simply arrive at your scheduled appointment time and follow any instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Test**\n\nThe risks associated with a blood test are minimal. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the site where the needle was inserted, but these symptoms usually resolve quickly.\n\n**Interpreting Your Results**\n\nYour ceruloplasmin test results will be evaluated in conjunction with other tests, such as those measuring copper levels in your blood and/or urine. Your healthcare provider will consider all relevant factors, including your symptoms, medical history, and family history, to determine the meaning of your test results.\n\n**Abnormal Ceruloplasmin Levels**\n\nLower-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may indicate that your body is not properly utilizing copper. This can be a sign of:\n\n* Wilson disease (although normal levels have been reported in some cases)\n* Menkes syndrome\n* Severe liver disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Copper deficiency due to malnutrition or malabsorption\n\nHigher-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may be associated with:\n\n* Heart disease\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Leukemia\n* Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Infection, inflammation, or injury\n\nHowever, high ceruloplasmin levels do not always indicate a condition requiring medical treatment. Pregnancy, birth control pills, and certain medications (such as estrogen therapy for menopause) can cause elevated blood ceruloplasmin levels. Excessive copper intake from your diet is rarely the cause of high ceruloplasmin.\n\nIf you have questions about your test results, discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nFor additional information on laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding your results, visit our resources section.\n\n**References**\n\n* Biology Dictionary: Ceruloplasmin\n* Cleveland Clinic: Ceruloplasmin Test\n* Cleveland Clinic: Menkes Disease\n* Cleveland Clinic: Wilson Disease\n* Hinkle J, Cheever K.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of cervical cancer screening, including the importance of regular check-ups and the various methods used to detect the disease.\n\n**Why is Cervical Cancer Screening Important?**\n\nCervical cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women worldwide. However, with regular screening, the risk of developing this disease can be significantly reduced. Early detection through screening allows for timely treatment, improving survival rates and reducing mortality.\n\n**Methods of Cervical Cancer Screening**\n\nThere are several methods used to screen for cervical cancer:\n\n*   **Pap Smear**: A simple test that involves collecting a sample of cells from the cervix using a spatula or brush. The cells are then examined for abnormal changes.\n*   **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing**: This method detects the presence of high-risk HPV types, which can cause cervical cancer.\n\n**Language Options**\n\nThis article is available in multiple languages to cater to diverse audiences:\n\n*   Arabic\n*   Chinese (Simplified)\n*   French\n*   Haitian Creole\n*   Hindi\n*   Japanese\n*   Korean\n*   Nepali\n*   Polish\n*   Portuguese\n*   Russian\n*   Somali\n*   Spanish\n*   Tagalog\n*   Vietnamese\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor further information and resources on cervical cancer screening, please visit the following links:\n\n*   American Cancer Society: [www.cancer.org](http://www.cancer.org)\n*   National Library of Medicine: [www.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.nlm.nih.gov)\n\nBy staying informed and up-to-date on cervical cancer screening methods and language options, you can take proactive steps towards maintaining your health and well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer Screening**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **American Cancer Society**\n    *   Female Exam and Pap Smear - हिन्दी (Hindi) Bilingual PDF\n    *   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - English PDF\n    *   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - हिन्दी (Hindi) PDF\n*   **Health Information Translations**\n    *   Japanese (日本語)\n        +   Female Exam and Pap Smear - 日本語 (Japanese) Bilingual PDF\n    *   Korean (한국어)\n        +   Female Exam and Pap Smear - 한국어 (Korean) Bilingual PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - English PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - 한국어 (Korean) PDF\n    *   Nepali (नेपाली)\n        +   Female Exam and Pap Smear - नेपाली (Nepali) Bilingual PDF\n    *   Polish (polski)\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - English PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - polski (Polish) PDF\n    *   Portuguese (português)\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - English PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - português (Portuguese) PDF\n    *   Russian (Русский)\n        +   Female Exam and Pap Smear - Русский (Russian) Bilingual PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - English PDF\n        +   You Can Prevent Cervical Cancer - Русский (Russian) PDF\n*   **National Library of Medicine**\n    *   Spanish (español)\n        +   Cervical Cancer Screening: MedlinePlus Health Topic - English \n        +   Pruebas y exámenes para el cáncer de cuello uterino: Tema de salud de MedlinePlus - español (Spanish)",

    "content": "**Cervical Cancer Screening**\n\n**What is Cervical Cancer?**\n\nCervical cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix, which is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal).\n\n**Why is Cervical Cancer Screening Important?**\n\nCervical cancer screening tests look for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. Before cervical cells become cancer, they start to look abnormal. These cells are called \"precancers\". If they aren't destroyed or removed, they may become cancer cells that grow out of control and spread to other parts of your body.\n\n**What Tests Screen for Cervical Cancer?**\n\nCervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup during a pelvic exam. These tests use a sample of cervical cells that your health care provider collects with a swab:\n\n*   A Pap test (also called a Pap smear or cervical cytology) checks for abnormal cells so they can be treated before they become cancer.\n*   An HPV (human papillomavirus) test checks for certain HPV infections that can cause cancer. HPV is a group of viruses that spread through sexual contact. The types that cause cancer are called \"high-risk HPV.\"\n*   The HPV/Pap cotest uses an HPV and Pap test together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes.\n\n**How Often Should I Be Screened for Cervical Cancer?**\n\nThe frequency of screening depends on your age and health history. If you have a cervix, it's recommended that you have your first Pap smear at age 21 and begin screening with an HPV test at age 25. You may need screening more often if you:\n\n*   Had an abnormal HPV test, Pap smear, or cervical biopsy in the recent past.\n*   Have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer.\n*   Have a weakened immune system.\n*   Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born.\n\n**What Are the Possible Benefits and Harms of Cervical Cancer Screening?**\n\nCervical cancer screening saves lives. Screening can detect cervical changes early, lowering your chance of dying from cervical cancer. But, cervical cancer screening has potential harms:\n\n*   The results can sometimes be wrong.\n*   Getting a false-positive result means that your test results appear abnormal, but there are no precancerous or cancerous cells. A false-positive may lead to:\n    *   Worry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer.\n    *   Follow-up tests or treatment that you may not have needed.\n*   Getting a false-negative result means that your test results appear normal, but there are precancer or cancerous cells. A false-negative may lead to:\n    *   You may delay seeking treatment even if you have symptoms.\n\n**Should I Be Screened for Cervical Cancer?**\n\nTalk with your provider about how often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get. This will depend on your age and health history.\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer Screening**\n\nCervical cancer screening is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. It involves testing for abnormal cells so they can be treated before they become cancer.\n\n**What tests screen for cervical cancer?**\n\n*   A Pap test (also called a Pap smear or cervical cytology) checks for abnormal cells.\n*   An HPV (human papillomavirus) test checks for certain HPV infections that can cause cancer.\n*   The HPV/Pap cotest uses an HPV and Pap test together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes.\n\n**What are the possible benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening?**\n\nCervical cancer screening saves lives.

But, cervical cancer screening has potential harms:\n\n*   The results can sometimes be wrong.\n*   Getting a false-positive result may lead to unnecessary tests or treatment.\n*   Getting a false-negative result may delay seeking treatment.\n\n**Should I be screened for cervical cancer?**\n\nTalk with your provider about how often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get. This will depend on your age and health history. If you have a cervix, it's recommended that you have your first Pap smear at age 21 and begin screening with an HPV test at age 25.\n\nYou may need screening more often if you:\n\n*   Had an abnormal HPV test, Pap smear, or cervical biopsy in the recent past.\n*   Have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer.\n*   Have a weakened immune system.\n*   Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born.\n\nIf you are over age 65 and have had regular Pap smear screenings with normal results, your provider may tell you that you no longer need them. If you have HIV, you may need to continue screenings after age 65.\n\nYou don't need cervical cancer screening if you had a total hysterectomy (surgery to remove your uterus and cervix) because of a condition that was not cancer. But if your hysterectomy was related to cervical cancer or precancer, ask your provider whether you need screening.\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer Screening**\n\n**Pap Smear: Do I Need One If I'm a Virgin?**\n\nIf you're a virgin, you may be wondering if you need to get a Pap smear. The answer is yes, but only if you plan on having sex in the future. A Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer that's usually done annually for women between 21 and 69 years old.\n\n**I Had a Hysterectomy. Do I Still Need to See My Ob-Gyn? Do I Still Need Pap Tests?**\n\nIf you've had a hysterectomy, you may be wondering if you still need to see your ob-gyn or get Pap tests. The answer is yes, but only for the first 20 years after your surgery. After that, you can stop seeing your ob-gyn and getting Pap tests.\n\n**Cervical Cancer Screening: Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions about cervical cancer screening:\n\n* What is a Pap smear?\n* How often should I get a Pap smear?\n* What happens during a Pap smear?\n* How do I prepare for a Pap smear?\n\n**Colposcopy**\n\nA colposcopy is a procedure that uses a special microscope to examine the cervix for abnormal cell growth. It's usually done after an abnormal Pap smear result.\n\n**Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test**\n\nAn HPV test is a screening test that detects the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells. It's usually done annually for women between 30 and 69 years old.\n\n**Understanding Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Results**\n\nIf your cervical cancer screening results are abnormal, don't panic! Your ob-gyn will explain what the results mean and what you need to do next.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nHere are some statistics and research findings about cervical cancer screening:\n\n* How many women get cervical cancer each year?\n* What is the effectiveness of Pap smears in preventing cervical cancer?\n* Are there any new technologies being developed for cervical cancer screening?\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nAre you interested in participating in a clinical trial for cervical cancer screening?

If you have a high-risk HPV infection in your cervix, you're more likely to develop cervical cancer if you:\n\n* Have a weakened immune system because of a disease that harms your immune system, such as HIV.\n* Take medicine to control your immune system, such as certain medicines to treat cancer or autoimmune diseases.\n* Smoke tobacco or breathe secondhand smoke.\n* Use birth control pills or have given birth to many children.\n* Have obesity.\n* Were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Cervical Cancer**\n\nCervical cancer usually doesn't cause symptoms when it first starts to grow. But when it does cause symptoms, they may include:\n\n* Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding after sex or between menstrual periods.\n* Vaginal discharge (fluid) that's watery and has a strong odor or contains blood.\n* Pelvic pain or pain during sex.\n\nIf cervical cancer spreads to other parts of your body, symptoms may include:\n\n* Unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge.\n* Pelvic pain or pain during sex.\n* Difficult or painful bowel movements (poops) or bleeding from the rectum when having a bowel movement.\n* Difficult or painful urination (peeing) or blood in your urine (pee).\n* Dull backache.\n* Swollen legs.\n* Abdominal (belly) pain.\n* Fatigue.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Cervical Cancer**\n\nIf you have symptoms or had an abnormal result on a screening test for cervical cancer, your health care provider will do more tests to find out if you have cervical cancer.

The best treatment for you depends on your health, how much cancer you have, whether it has spread, and which treatment you prefer. You may have more than one treatment, including:\n\n* Surgery to remove the cancer.\n* Radiation therapy, which uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\n* Chemotherapy (chemo), which uses special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer.\n* Targeted therapy, which uses special medicines to block the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n* Immunotherapy, which helps your immune system fight cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Cervical Cancer**\n\nAlmost all cervical cancer can be prevented by:\n\n* HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before you're exposed to HPV. So, it's best to get vaccinated before you become sexually active.\n* Routine cervical cancer screening.

The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n1.  **Dress Code**: Wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Remove your watch, jewelry, and wallet.\n2.  **Table Slide**: Lie on a narrow table that slides into a tunnel-shaped scanner.\n3.  **Contrast Dye**: Some exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein in your arm or hand before the test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   **Fasting**: You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n*   **Claustrophobia**: Tell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia).\n\n---\n\n**Cervical MRI Scan**\n\nA cervical MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses energy from strong magnets to create pictures of the part of the spine that runs through the neck area (cervical spine).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt).

The dye can also be given through an injection. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\n\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\n\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\n\n* Brain aneurysm clips\n* Certain types of artificial heart valves\n* Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n* Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\n* Recently placed artificial joints or surgery with implanted metal screws and plates\n* Certain types of vascular stents\n* Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\n\n* Pens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\n* Items such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged.\n* Pins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images.\n* Removable dental work should be taken out just before the scan.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\n\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\n\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass.\n\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe most common reasons for this test are:\n\n* Severe neck, shoulder, or arm pain that does not get better after treatment\n* Neck pain along with leg weakness, numbness, or other symptoms\n\nA cervical MRI scan may also be done for:\n\n* Birth defects of the spine\n* Infection that involves your spine\n* Injury or trauma to the spine\n* Multiple sclerosis\n* Severe scoliosis\n* Tumor or cancer in the spine\n* Arthritis in the spine\n\nMRI works better than CT scan in diagnosing these problems most of the time.\n\nA cervical MRI may also be done before spinal surgery.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means the part of the spine that runs through your neck and nearby nerves appears normal.\n\n---\n\n**Cervical MRI Scan**\n\n**What is a Cervical MRI Scan?**\n\nA cervical MRI scan is a medical test that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to take pictures of the cervical spine, which includes the neck and upper back. The test can help diagnose problems with the bones, discs, and spinal cord in this area.\n\n**Why is a Cervical MRI Scan Performed?**\n\nA cervical MRI scan may be performed to:\n\n* Diagnose conditions such as herniated or \"slipped\" disk (cervical radiculopathy), narrowing of the cervical spine (spinal stenosis), and abnormal wear of the bones and cartilage in the neck (cervical spondylosis)\n* Identify other problems, such as degenerative changes due to age, bone infection (osteomyelitis), disk inflammation (diskitis), infection of the spine, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or compression, spinal fracture, spinal tumor, or abnormality from growth\n\n**Risks**\n\nMRI uses no radiation. There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\n\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\n\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis.

The scan can help diagnose problems such as abnormal cell growth or cancer.\n\n**How is a cervical MRI scan performed?**\n\nThe scan is usually done on an outpatient basis and takes about 30 minutes to complete. You will be asked to lie on your back on a table that slides into the scanner. You may be given a contrast material to swallow before the test, which helps highlight certain areas of the cervix.\n\n**What are the benefits of a cervical MRI scan?**\n\nThe main benefit of a cervical MRI scan is that it can help diagnose problems such as abnormal cell growth or cancer in the cervix. It can also help identify other conditions such as fibroids or polyps.\n\n**How much does a cervical MRI scan cost?**\n\nThe cost of a cervical MRI scan varies depending on your location and insurance coverage. On average, the cost of an MRI scan is around $1,000 to $2,000.\n\n**What are the risks associated with a cervical MRI scan?**\n\nAs with any medical imaging test, there are some risks associated with a cervical MRI scan. These include:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to the contrast material\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\nHowever, these risks are rare and most people can undergo a cervical MRI scan without any complications.\n\n**What is the difference between a cervical MRI scan and an ultrasound?**\n\nA cervical MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the cervix, while an ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create images. While both tests can help diagnose problems in the cervix, an MRI scan provides more detailed images and is often used to diagnose conditions such as cancer or fibroids.\n\n**How do I prepare for a cervical MRI scan?**\n\nTo prepare for a cervical MRI scan, you should:\n\n*   Avoid eating or drinking anything for at least 4 hours before the test\n*   Remove any jewelry or metal objects that may interfere with the scanner\n*   Inform your doctor if you have any allergies or sensitivities to contrast materials\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure a safe and successful cervical MRI scan.",

The exact cause of cervical cancer is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that can infect both men and women.\n\n**Screening**\n\nScreening for cervical cancer involves checking for abnormal cell changes in the cervix. The most common screening test is the Pap smear, which involves collecting cells from the cervix using a special brush or spatula. The cells are then examined under a microscope for any signs of abnormal growth.\n\n**Diagnosis and Management**\n\nIf an abnormality is detected during screening, further testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. This may involve taking a sample of tissue from the cervix, which is then examined under a microscope. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, treatment options will depend on the stage and severity of the disease.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPreventing cervical cancer involves avoiding infection with HPV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all girls and women receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine as part of their routine vaccinations. Additionally, practicing safe sex and getting regular Pap smears can help prevent cervical cancer.\n\n**References**\n\n* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Adolescent Health Care, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Immunization, Infectious Disease, and Public Health Preparedness Expert Work Group.

    "content": "**Cervical Cancer**\n\nCervical cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the widespread use of Pap tests to screen women for cervical cancer or its precursors.\n\nCervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar (gland cells). Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.\n\nCervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap tests or the HPV vaccine, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap test results.\n\nAlmost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and also by sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical as well as other cancers. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nA woman's sexual behavior can increase her risk for developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:\n\n* Having sex at an early age\n* Having multiple sexual partners\n* Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities\n\nOther risk factors for cervical cancer include:\n\n* Not getting the HPV vaccine\n* Being economically disadvantaged\n* Having a mother who took the medicine diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage\n* Having a weakened immune system\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include:\n\n* Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause\n* Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling\n* Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual\n\nCervical cancer may spread to the vagina, lymph nodes, bladder, intestines, lungs, bones, and liver. Often, there are no problems or symptoms until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include:\n\n* Abdominal pain\n* Back pain\n* Bone pain or fractures\n* Fatigue\n* Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina\n* Leg pain\n* Loss of appetite\n* Pelvic pain\n* Single swollen leg\n* Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPrecancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions:\n\n* A Pap test screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis.\n* Depending on your age, the HPV DNA test may be done along with a Pap test to screen for cervical cancer. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. Talk to your health care provider about which test or tests are right for you.\n* If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue might be removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination.\n* A procedure called a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may also be done. This uses an electrified metal loop to remove some tissue from the cervix. If this is not feasible, a larger procedure called a cone biopsy may be done. This is a procedure that removes a cone-shaped wedge from the front of the cervix.\n\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed, the provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called cancer staging. Tests may include:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis\n* Cystoscopy\n* Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)\n* MRI of the abdomen and pelvis\n* PET scan\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment of cervical cancer depends on:\n\n* The stage of the cancer\n* The size and shape of the tumor\n* The woman's age and general health\n* Her desire to have children in the future\n\nEarly cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage.\n\nTypes of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include:\n\n* LEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue.\n* Cold knife cone -- uses a scalpel to remove abnormal tissue.\n* Cryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells.\n* Laser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue.\n* Hysterectomy may be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing.\n\nTreatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include:\n\n* Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. This is more often performed on younger, healthier women with small tumors.\n* Radiation therapy, along with low dose chemotherapy, is more often used for women with tumors too large for radical hysterectomy or women who are not good candidates for surgery.\n* Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed.\n\nRadiation therapy may also be used to treat cancer that has returned.\n\nChemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the person does depends on many things, including:\n\n* The type of cervical cancer\n* The stage of cancer (how far it has spread)\n* Age and general health\n* If the cancer comes back after treatment\n\nPrecancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications can include:\n\n* Risk of the cancer coming back especially in women who have treatment to save the uterus\n* Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n* Have not had regular Pap tests\n* Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge\n\n**Prevention**\n\nCervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following:\n\n* Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you.\n* Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n* Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors.\n* Get Pap tests as often as your provider recommends. Pap tests can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer.\n* Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older, or for some screening protocols, starting at age 25.\n* If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCancer - cervix; Cervical cancer - HPV; Cervical cancer - dysplasia\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer**\n\nCervical cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus.

Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include:\n\nAbdominal pain\nBack pain\nBone pain or fractures\nFatigue\nLeaking of urine or feces from the vagina\nLeg pain\nLoss of appetite\nPelvic pain\nSingle swollen leg\nWeight loss\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPrecancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions:\n\nA Pap test screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis.\nDepending on your age, the HPV DNA test may be done along with a Pap test to screen for cervical cancer. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. Talk to your health care provider about which test or tests are right for you.\nIf abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue might be removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination.\nA procedure called a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may also be done. This uses an electrified metal loop to remove some tissue from the cervix. If this is not feasible, a larger procedure called a cone biopsy may be done. This is a procedure that removes a cone-shaped wedge from the front of the cervix.\n\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed, the provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called cancer staging. Tests may include:\n\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis\nCystoscopy\nIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)\nMRI of the abdomen and pelvis\nPET scan\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment of cervical cancer depends on:\n\nThe stage of the cancer\nThe size and shape of the tumor\nThe woman's age and general health\nHer desire to have children in the future\n\nEarly cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage. There are surgical ways to cure cervical cancer without removing the uterus or seriously damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future.\n\nTypes of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include:\n\nLEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue.\nCold knife cone -- uses a scalpel to remove abnormal tissue.\nCryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells.\nLaser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue.\nHysterectomy may be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing.\n\nTreatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include:\n\nNote: I've kept the original structure and formatting of the text as much as possible, while making it cleaner and easier to read.\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention**\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nCervical cancer treatment depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the size and shape of the tumor, the woman's age and general health, and her desire to have children in the future.\n\nFor early cervical cancer, surgical removal or destruction of precancerous or cancerous tissue can be effective. This is why regular Pap tests are crucial in preventing cervical cancer or detecting it at an early stage.\n\nTypes of surgery for cervical precancer include:\n\n*   LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure) - uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue\n*   Cold knife cone - uses a scalpel to remove abnormal tissue\n*   Cryotherapy - freezes abnormal cells\n*   Laser therapy - uses light to burn abnormal tissue\n\nHysterectomy may be performed for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures or are not interested in further childbearing.\n\nFor more advanced cervical cancer, treatment options include:\n\n*   Radical hysterectomy - removes the uterus and surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina\n*   Radiation therapy, along with low-dose chemotherapy - used for women with tumors too large for radical hysterectomy or those who are not good candidates for surgery\n*   Pelvic exenteration - a type of surgery that removes all organs in the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum\n\nRadiation therapy may also be used to treat cancer that has returned.\n\nChemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells and can be given alone or with surgery or radiation.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nCervical cancer can be prevented by:\n\n*   Getting the HPV vaccine - which prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer\n*   Practicing safer sex - using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n*   Limiting the number of sexual partners - avoiding partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors\n*   Getting regular Pap tests - as often as recommended by your provider, to detect early changes that can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer\n*   Getting the HPV test if recommended by your provider - used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older, or starting at age 25\n*   Quitting smoking - as smoking increases the risk of getting cervical cancer\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Cancer Prevention**\n\nCervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following:\n\n*   **Get the HPV vaccine**: The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you.\n*   **Practice safer sex**: Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n*   **Limit the number of sexual partners you have**: Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors.\n*   **Get Pap tests as often as your provider recommends**: Pap tests can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer.\n*   **Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider**: It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older, or for some screening protocols, starting at age 25.\n*   **If you smoke, quit**: Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Cervical Dysplasia**\n\n_Cervical dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix._\n\nThe changes are not cancer, but they can lead to cancer of the cervix if not treated.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCervical dysplasia can develop at any age. However, treatment and follow-up will depend on your age. Cervical dysplasia is most commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV. Some types lead to cervical dysplasia or cancer. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts.\n\nThe following may increase your risk for cervical dysplasia:\n\n*   Having sex before age 18\n*   Having a baby at very young age\n*   Having had multiple sexual partners\n*   Having other illnesses, such as tuberculosis or HIV\n*   Using medicines that suppress your immune system\n*   Smoking\n*   Maternal history of exposure to DES (diethylstilbestrol)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a pelvic exam to check for cervical dysplasia. The initial test is usually a Pap test and a test for the presence of HPV.\n\nCervical dysplasia that is seen on a Pap test is called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap test report, any abnormal changes will be described as:\n\n*   Low-grade (LSIL)\n*   High-grade (HSIL)\n*   Possibly cancerous (malignant)\n*   Atypical glandular cells (AGC)\n*   Atypical squamous cells (ASC)\n\nYou will need more tests if a Pap test shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia. If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap tests may be all that is needed.\n\nThe provider may perform a biopsy to confirm the condition. This may be done with the use of colposcopy. Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp.\n\nDysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories:\n\n*   CIN I -- mild dysplasia\n*   CIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia\n*   CIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ\n\nSome strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done:\n\n*   As a screening test for women age 30 or more\n*   For women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment. Changes due to HPV infection may also go away without treatment or dysplasia.\n\nYou may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap tests every 6 to 12 months.\nIf the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed.\n\nTreatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include:\n\n*   Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells\n*   Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue\n*   LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue\n*   Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy)\n*   Hysterectomy (in rare cases)\n\nIf you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as suggested by your provider.\n\nMake sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. However, the condition may return.\n\nWithout treatment, severe cervical dysplasia may change into cervical cancer.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your age is 21 or older and you have never had a pelvic exam and Pap test.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAsk your provider about the HPV vaccine. Girls who receive this vaccine before they become sexually active reduce their chance of getting cervical cancer.\n\nYou can reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia by taking the following steps:\n\n*   Get vaccinated for HPV between ages 9 to 45.\n*   Do not smoke. Smoking increases your risk of developing more severe dysplasia and cancer.\n*   Do not have sex until you are 18 or older.\n*   Practice safe sex. Use a condom.\n*   Practice monogamy. This means you have only one sexual partner at a time.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia - dysplasia; CIN - dysplasia; Precancerous changes of the cervix - dysplasia; Cervical cancer - dysplasia; Squamous intraepithelial lesion - dysplasia; LSIL - dysplasia; HSIL - dysplasia; Low-grade dysplasia; High-grade dysplasia; Carcinoma in situ - dysplasia; CIS - dysplasia; ASCUS - dysplasia; Atypical glandular cells - dysplasia; AGUS - dysplasia; Atypical squamous cells - dysplasia; Pap smear - dysplasia; HPV - dysplasia; Human papilloma virus - dysplasia; Cervix - dysplasia; Colposcopy - dysplasia\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Dysplasia**\n\n_Cervical dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix.

This can be a precursor to cervical cancer.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of cervical dysplasia is not known, but it is thought to be related to infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Other risk factors include:\n\n*   **Age**: Cervical dysplasia can occur in people of any age, but it is most common in young adults.\n*   **Sexual activity**: Having multiple sexual partners or having sex at a young age may increase the risk of cervical dysplasia.\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer and dysplasia.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn many cases, cervical dysplasia does not cause any symptoms. However, some people may experience:\n\n*   **Abnormal vaginal bleeding**: This can include bleeding after sex or between periods.\n*   **Painful intercourse**: In some cases, cervical dysplasia can cause pain during sex.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCervical dysplasia is typically diagnosed through a Pap test, which involves collecting cells from the cervix. If the results are abnormal, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for cervical dysplasia depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of any underlying HPV infection. In some cases, no treatment is necessary, while in others, removal of the affected cells or more extensive surgery may be required.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent cervical dysplasia, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n*   **Get regular Pap tests**: Regular screening can help detect abnormal cell changes early on.\n*   **Practice safe sex**: Using condoms and limiting the number of sexual partners can help reduce the risk of HPV infection.\n*   **Don't smoke**: Quitting smoking can help reduce the risk of cervical cancer and dysplasia.",

When symptoms are present, they may include:\n\n*   Very heavy menstrual periods\n*   Vaginal bleeding after douching or intercourse\n*   Abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause or between periods\n*   White or yellow mucus (leukorrhea)\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Polyps**\n\n**What are cervical polyps?**\n\nCervical polyps are small, finger-like growths that appear on the cervix. They can be smooth, red, or purple in color.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPolyps do not always cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, they may include:\n\n* Very heavy menstrual periods\n* Vaginal bleeding after douching or intercourse\n* Abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause or between periods\n* White or yellow mucus (leukorrhea)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a pelvic exam. Some smooth, red or purple fingerlike growths will be seen on the cervix.\n\nMost often, the provider will remove the polyp with a gentle tug and send it for testing (biopsy). Most of the time, the biopsy will show cells that are consistent with a benign polyp. Rarely, there may be abnormal, precancerous, or cancer cells in a polyp.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe provider can remove polyps during a simple outpatient procedure.\n\nSmaller polyps may be removed with gentle twisting.\nElectrocautery may be needed to remove larger polyps.\n\nThe removed polyp tissue should be sent to a lab for further tests.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost polyps are not cancerous (benign) and are easy to remove. Polyps do not grow back most of the time. Women who have polyps are at risk of growing more polyps.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThere may be bleeding and slight cramping for a few days after removal of a polyp. Some cervical cancers may first appear as a polyp. Certain uterine polyps may be associated with uterine cancer.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Abnormal bleeding from the vagina, including bleeding after sex or between periods\n* Abnormal discharge from the vagina\n* Abnormally heavy periods\n* Bleeding or spotting after menopause\n\nContact your provider to schedule regular gynecological exams. Ask how often you should receive a Pap test.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSee your provider to treat infections as soon as possible.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nVaginal bleeding - polyps",

    "content": "**Cervical Spine CT Scan**\n\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine makes cross-sectional pictures of the neck. It uses x-rays to create the images.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping. A computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the cervical spine can be created by adding the slices together.\n\nYou must be still during the exam. Movement can cause blurred images. You may need to hold your breath for short periods of time. The scan takes 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nSome exams use a special dye, called contrast that is put into your body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays. Contrast can be given in different ways:\n\n*   It may be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.\n*   It may be given as an injection into the space around the spinal cord.\n\nIf contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test. Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to avoid this problem.\n\nBefore having the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra steps before the test if you take this drug. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms).\n\nYou will wear a hospital gown during the study. You will need to take off all jewelry as metal can affect the CT images.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table. Contrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning feeling, a metal taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These feelings are normal and go away in a few seconds.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCT makes detailed pictures of the body very quickly. The test may help look for:\n\n*   Birth defects of the cervical spine in children\n*   Spine problems, when a spine MRI cannot be used\n*   Injury to the upper spine\n*   Bone tumors or cancers\n*   Fracture of a spine bone\n*   Disk herniations and compression of the spinal cord\n*   Healing problems or scar tissue following surgery\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Spine CT Scan**\n\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine makes cross-sectional pictures of the neck.

    "content": "**Cervical Spondylosis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCervical spondylosis is caused by aging and chronic wear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).\n\nOver time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance.\n\nEveryday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.\n\nThe major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:\n\n* Being overweight and not exercising\n* Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting\n* Past neck injury (often several years before)\n* Past spine surgery\n* Ruptured or slipped disk\n* Severe arthritis\n* Previous surgery on the neck\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms often develop slowly over time. But they may start or get worse suddenly. The pain may be mild, or it can be deep and so severe that you are unable to move.\n\nYou may feel the pain over the shoulder blade. It may spread to the upper arm, forearm, or fingers (in rare cases).\n\nThe pain may get worse:\n\n* After standing or sitting\n* At night\n* When you sneeze, cough, or laugh\n* When you bend the neck backward or twist your neck or walk more than a few yards (meters)\n\nYou may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your health care provider examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your arm, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, clumsiness of your hand, or other problems.\n\nOther common symptoms are:\n\n* Neck stiffness that gets worse over time\n* Numbness or abnormal sensations in the shoulders or arms\n* Headaches, especially in the back of the head\n* Pain on the inside of the shoulder blade and shoulder pain\n\nLess common symptoms are:\n\n* Loss of balance\n* Pain or numbness in the legs\n* Loss of control over the bladder or bowels (if there is pressure on the spinal cord)\n* Exams and Tests_\n\nA physical exam may show that you have trouble moving your head toward your shoulder and rotating your head.\n\nYour provider may ask you to bend your head forward and to each side while putting slight downward pressure on the top of your head. Increased pain or numbness during this test is usually a sign that there is pressure on a nerve in your spine.\n\nWeakness of your shoulders and arms or loss of feeling can be signs of damage to certain nerve roots or to the spinal cord.\n\nA spine or neck x-ray may be done to look for arthritis or other changes in your spine.\n\nMRI or CT scans of the neck are done when you have:\n\n* Severe neck or arm pain that does not get better with treatment\n* Weakness or numbness in your arms or hands\n\nElectromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity tests may be done to examine nerve root function.\n\n_Treatment_\n\nYour providers can help you manage your pain so that you can stay active.\n\nYour provider may refer you for physical therapy. The physical therapist will help you reduce your pain using stretches. The therapist will teach you exercises that make your neck muscles stronger.\nThe therapist can also use neck traction to relieve some of the pressure in your neck.\nYou may also see a massage therapist, someone who performs acupuncture, or someone who does spinal manipulation (a chiropractor, osteopathic provider, or physical therapist). Sometimes, a few visits will help with neck pain.\nCold packs and heat therapy may help your pain during flare-ups.\n\nA type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful if the pain is having a serious impact on your life. This technique helps you better understand your pain and teaches you how to manage it.\n\nMedicines can help your neck pain. Your provider may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) for long-term pain control. Opioids may be prescribed if the pain is severe and does not respond to NSAIDs.\n\nIf the pain does not respond to these treatments, or you have a loss of movement or feeling, surgery is considered. Surgery is done to relieve the pressure on the nerves or spinal cord, and it can involve fusion of part of the neck.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nMost people with cervical spondylosis have some long-term symptoms. Most of these symptoms improve with non-surgical treatment and do not need surgery.\n\nMany people with this problem are able to maintain an active life. Some people will have to live with chronic (long-term) pain.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nThis condition may lead to the following:\n\n* Inability to hold in feces (fecal incontinence) or urine (urinary incontinence)\n* Loss of muscle function or feeling\n* Permanent disability (occasionally)\n* Poor balance\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* The condition becomes worse\n* There are signs of complications\n* You develop new symptoms (such as loss of movement or feeling in an area of the body)\n* You lose control of your bladder or bowels (call right away)\n\n---\n\n**Cervical Spondylosis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCervical spondylosis is caused by aging and chronic wear on the cervical spine.

    "content": "**Cervicitis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause cervicitis include:\n\n*   **Chlamydia**\n*   **Gonorrhea**\n*   **Herpes simplex virus (genital herpes)**\n*   **Human papilloma virus (genital warts)**\n*   **Trichomoniasis**\n\nOther things that can cause cervicitis include:\n\n*   A device inserted into the pelvic area such as a cervical cap, diaphragm, IUD, or pessary\n*   Allergy to spermicides used for birth control\n*   Allergy to latex in condoms\n*   Exposure to a chemical\n*   Reaction to douches or vaginal deodorants\n\n_Cervicitis is very common._ It affects more than one half of all women at some point during their adult life. Causes include:\n\n*   High-risk sexual behavior\n*   History of STIs\n*   Many sexual partners\n*   Sexual intercourse at an early age\n*   Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI\n\n_Too much growth of some bacteria that normally are present in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can also lead to cervical infection._\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nThere may be no symptoms. If symptoms are present, these may include:\n\n*   Abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs after intercourse, or between periods\n*   Unusual vaginal discharge that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in color\n*   Painful sexual intercourse\n*   Pain in the vagina\n*   Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis\n*   Painful urination\n*   Vaginal itching\n\n_Women who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms._\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nA pelvic exam is done to look for:\n\n*   Discharge from the cervix\n*   Redness of the cervix\n*   Swelling (inflammation) of the walls of the vagina\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Inspection of the discharge under a microscope (may show candidiasis, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis)\n*   Pap test\n*   Tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia\n\n_Rarely, colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix is necessary._\n\n_Treatment_\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat chlamydia or gonorrhea. Medicines called antivirals may be used to treat herpes simplex virus infections.\n\nHormonal therapy (with estrogen or progesterone) may be used in women who have reached menopause.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nMost of the time, simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause.\n\nOften, cervicitis does not cause any symptoms. It doesn't need treatment as long as tests for bacterial and viral causes are negative.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nCervicitis may last for months to years. Cervicitis may lead to pain with intercourse.\n\nUntreated cervicitis may lead to inflammation involving the female pelvic organs, causing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of cervicitis.\n\n_Prevention_\n\nThings you can do to reduce your risk of developing cervicitis include:\n\n*   Avoid irritants such as douches and deodorant tampons.\n*   Make sure that any foreign objects you insert into your vagina (such as tampons) are properly placed. Be sure to follow instructions on how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, or how often to clean it.\n*   Make sure your partner is free of any STI. You and your partner should not have sex with any other people.\n*   Use a condom every time you have sex to lower your risk of getting an STI. Condoms are available for both men and women, but are most commonly worn by the man. A condom must be used properly every time.\n\n---\n\n**Cervicitis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity.

Causes include:\n\n*   High-risk sexual behavior\n*   History of STIs\n*   Many sexual partners\n*   Sexual intercourse at an early age\n*   Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI\n\nToo much growth of some bacteria that normally are present in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can also lead to cervical infection.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nThere may be no symptoms. If symptoms are present, these may include:\n\n*   Abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs after intercourse, or between periods\n*   Unusual vaginal discharge that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in color\n*   Painful sexual intercourse\n*   Pain in the vagina\n*   Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis\n*   Painful urination\n*   Vaginal itching\n\nWomen who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms.\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nA pelvic exam is done to look for:\n\n*   Discharge from the cervix\n*   Redness of the cervix\n*   Swelling (inflammation) of the walls of the vagina\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Inspection of the discharge under a microscope (may show candidiasis, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis)\n*   Pap test\n*   Tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia\n\nRarely, colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix is necessary.\n\n_Treatment_\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat chlamydia or gonorrhea. Medicines called antivirals may be used to treat herpes simplex virus infections.\n\nHormonal therapy (with estrogen or progesterone) may be used in women who have reached menopause.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nMost of the time, simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause.\n\n---\n\n**Cervicitis**\n\n**What is Cervicitis?**\n\nCervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix, which can be caused by various factors such as bacterial or viral infections, hormonal changes, or physical irritants.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSome women may experience symptoms like abnormal vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, or painful intercourse. A healthcare provider will typically perform a pelvic exam to diagnose cervicitis.\n\n**Treatment and Outlook**\n\nSimple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause. Often, cervicitis does not cause any symptoms and doesn't need treatment as long as tests for bacterial and viral causes are negative.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCervicitis may last for months to years and can lead to pain with intercourse. Untreated cervicitis may lead to inflammation involving the female pelvic organs, causing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of cervicitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo reduce your risk of developing cervicitis:\n\n*   Avoid irritants such as douches and deodorant tampons.\n*   Make sure that any foreign objects you insert into your vagina (such as tampons) are properly placed. Be sure to follow instructions on how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, or how often to clean it.\n*   Make sure your partner is free of any STI. You and your partner should not have sex with any other people.\n*   Use a condom every time you have sex to lower your risk of getting an STI.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCervical inflammation; Inflammation - cervix\n\n---\n\n**Cervicitis**\n\n\\n\\nA, Bachmann LH, Chan PA, et al.

    "content": "**Cervix Disorders**\n\n**What is a Cervix Disorder?**\n\nA cervix disorder is a problem with your cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system, being the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave your body.\n\nYou may not have any symptoms of a cervix disorder, but routine pelvic exams and a Pap smear test can help determine if you may need treatment.\n\n**Types of Cervix Disorders**\n\nCervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix.\nCervicitis is swelling of the cervix. An infection usually causes it, but it can also be caused by skin irritation. Treatment can help you avoid potential complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nCervical incompetence (also called cervical insufficiency) can happen during pregnancy. The opening of your cervix widens too early. This may cause you to give birth too soon, or you could lose the fetus.\nCervical polyps and cysts are fleshy or fluid-filled growths on your cervix. These growths are usually benign (not cancer). They are more common during your reproductive years, especially after age 20.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Cervix Disorders?**\n\nYou are more likely to develop a cervix disorder if:\n\n* You've had a previous cervical procedure or surgery.\n* You've had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n* You used a latex condom or a feminine product such as a spermicide or douche that irritated the skin of your vagina.\n* You left something in your vagina too long, such as a diaphragm, tampon, or cervical cap, and it caused irritation.\n* You don't consistently use a condom when you have sex, or you have multiple sex partners.\n\n**Symptoms of Cervix Disorders**\n\nYou may not know that something is wrong since cervix disorders may not have any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may vary based on the cervix disorder.\n\nSymptoms can include:\n\n* Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding between menstrual periods\n* Pain during sex or a pelvic exam\n* Abnormal vaginal discharge\n\nIf you are pregnant, a few signs of an incompetent cervix could include light vaginal bleeding, a feeling of pelvic pressure, or mild cramps. But you may not have any signs.\n\n**Diagnosis of Cervix Disorders**\n\nEven if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may notice changes to the cells of your cervix during a pelvic exam. Your provider may look for:\n\n* Redness or inflammation (swelling) of your cervix or vaginal walls\n* Vaginal discharge or strong odor\n\nYour provider may perform a Pap test to look for changes in your cervix.\n\n**Treatment of Cervix Disorders**\n\nThe treatment for cervix disorders depends on the cause. It might include antibiotics or stopping using a product that causes skin irritation.\n\nIf you have had an incompetent cervix in the past, you might take medicine or have ultrasound imaging tests to check how your pregnancy is going.\n\n**Prevention of Cervix Disorders**\n\nYou can take steps to prevent some cervix disorders. This can include:\n\n* Using a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\n* Having regular pelvic exams.\n* Getting tested for STIs as needed.\n* Avoiding using personal care products that may cause skin irritation to your vagina.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nFor more information on cervix disorders, see the following resources:\n\n* **HPV and Pap Test Results: Next Steps after an Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Test** (National Cancer Institute)\n* **Colposcopy** (National Library of Medicine)\n* **Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP)** (Johns Hopkins Medicine)\n* **Cervical dysplasia - series** (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\nNote: The above text has been cleaned and formatted for display, with bold headings, *italicized lists*, and \\n\\n separating sections.\n\n---\n\n**Cervix Disorders**\n\nThe cervix is part of the female reproductive system, and a cervix disorder refers to any problem with this area.

In the United States, almost one in three babies are born this way.\n\n**When is a Cesarean Delivery Needed?**\n\nYou may need a cesarean delivery because:\n\n* You have health problems, including infection\n* You are carrying more than one baby\n* Your baby is too big\n* Your baby is in the wrong position\n* Your baby's health is in danger\n* Labor is not moving along as it should\n* There are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby)\n\n**How is a Cesarean Delivery Done?**\n\nBefore the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get:\n\n* An epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine.\n* A spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid.\n* General anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency cesarean deliveries.\n\nDuring the surgery, the surgeon will:\n\n* Make a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical.\n* Open the amniotic sac and take out your baby.\n* Cut the umbilical cord and the placenta.\n* Close the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve.\n\n**What are the Risks of a Cesarean Delivery?**\n\nA cesarean delivery is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include:\n\n* Infection\n* Blood loss\n* Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs\n* Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder\n* A reaction to the medicines or anesthesia used\n\nSome of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a cesarean delivery than from a vaginal birth. And having a cesarean delivery can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies.

Although cesarean (C-sections) are relatively safe surgical procedures, they should only be performed in appropriate medical circumstances.\n\n**Reasons for a Cesarean**\n\nSome of the most common reasons for a cesarean are:\n\n*   If the baby is in a feet first (breech) position.\n*   If the baby is in a shoulder first (transverse) position.\n*   If the baby’s head is too large to fit through the birth canal.\n*   If labor is prolonged and the mother’s cervix will not dilate to 10 centimeters.\n*   If the mother has placenta previa, where the placenta is blocking the birth canal.\n*   If there are signs of fetal distress which is when the fetus is in danger because of decreased oxygen flow to the fetus.\n\n**Causes of Fetal Distress**\n\nSome common causes of fetal distress are:\n\n*   Compression of the umbilical cord.\n*   Compression of major blood vessels in the mother’s abdomen because of her birthing position.\n*   Maternal illness due to hypertension, anemia, or heart disease.\n\n---\n\n**Cesarean Section**\n\nA cesarean section is a way to deliver a baby by cutting through the skin of the mother's abdomen.

Usually, the mother is given an epidural or a spinal block. Both of these will numb the lower body, but the mother will remain awake. If the baby has to be delivered quickly, as in an emergency, the mother may be given a general anesthetic, which will make her fall asleep.\n\nDuring the surgery, an incision is made in the lower abdomen followed by an incision made in the uterus. There is no pain associated with either of these incisions because of the anesthesia.\n\nThe doctor will open the uterus and the amniotic sac. Then the baby is carefully eased through the incision and out into the world. The procedure usually lasts about 20 minutes.\n\nAfterward, the physician delivers the placenta and stitches up the incisions in the uterus and abdominal wall. Usually, the mother is allowed to leave the hospital within a few days, barring complications like wound infections.\n\n**Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC)**\n\nOne concern that many women have is whether they’ll be able to have a normal delivery after having a cesarean. The answer depends on what the reasons were for having the c-section in the first place. If it was because of a one-time problem, like umbilical cord compression or breech position, then the mother may be able to have a normal birth.\n\nTherefore, as long as the mother has had one or two previous cesarean deliveries with a low-transverse uterine incision, and there are no other indications for a cesarean, she is a candidate for vaginal birth after cesarean, also called VBAC.\n\n---\n\n**Cesarean Section**\n\nA cesarean section is a way to deliver a baby by cutting through the skin of the mother's abdomen.

    "content": "**Chagas Disease**\n\nAlso called: American trypanosomiasis, South American trypanosomiasis\n\n**Summary**\nWhat is Chagas disease?\n\nChagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an illness that can cause serious heart and stomach problems. It is caused by a parasite. Chagas disease is common in Latin America, especially in poor, rural areas. It can also be found in the United States, most often in people who were infected before they moved to the U.S.\n\n**Causes**\nWhat causes Chagas disease?\n\nChagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. It is usually spread by infected blood-sucking bugs called triatomine bugs. They are also known as \"kissing bugs\" because they often bite people's faces. When one of these bugs bites you, it leaves behind infected waste. You can become infected if you rub the waste in your eyes or nose, the bite wound, or a cut.\n\nChagas disease can also spread through contaminated food, a blood transfusion, a donated organ, or from the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy.\n\n**Risk Factors**\nWho is more likely to develop Chagas disease?\n\nKissing bugs can be found throughout the Americas, but they are more common in certain areas. The people who are most at risk for Chagas disease:\n\n* Live in rural areas of Latin America\n* Have seen the bugs, especially in those areas\n* Have stayed in a house with a thatched roof or with walls that have cracks or crevices\n\n**Symptoms**\nWhat are the symptoms of Chagas disease?\n\nIn the beginning, there may be no symptoms. Some people do get mild symptoms, such as:\n\n* Fever\n* Fatigue\n* Body aches\n* Headache\n* Loss of appetite\n* Diarrhea\n* Vomiting\n* A rash\n* A swollen eyelid\n\nThese early symptoms usually go away. However, if you don't treat the infection, it stays in your body. Later, it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems such as:\n\n* An serious arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) that can cause sudden death\n* An enlarged heart that doesn't pump blood well\n* Problems with digestion and bowel movements\n* An increased chance of having a stroke\n\n**Diagnosis**\nHow is Chagas disease diagnosed?\n\nTo find out if you have Chagas disease, your health care provider:\n\n* Will do a physical exam\n* Will take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and where you have lived and traveled\n* Will run a blood test for Chagas disease\n* May run tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart\n\n**Treatment**\nWhat are the treatments for Chagas disease?\n\nMedicines can kill the parasite, especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example, a pacemaker can help with some heart complications.\n\n**Prevention**\nCan Chagas disease be prevented?\n\nThere are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you travel to areas where it occurs, you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or are staying in poor housing conditions. It is important to use insecticides to prevent bites and practice food safety.\n\n---\n\n**Chagas Disease**\n\n**What is Chagas disease?**\n\nChagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an illness that can cause serious heart and stomach problems.

The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, including:\n\n* Fever\n* General ill feeling\n* Swelling of an eye if the bite is near the eye\n* Swollen red area at the site of the insect bite\n\nAfter the acute phase, the disease goes into remission. There may be no other symptoms for many years. When symptoms finally develop, they may include:\n\n* Constipation\n* Digestive problems\n* Pain in the abdomen\n* Swallowing difficulties\n* Pounding or racing heart\n* Heart failure\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam can confirm the symptoms. Signs of Chagas disease may include:\n\n* Disease of the heart muscle\n* Enlarged liver and spleen\n* Enlarged lymph nodes\n* Irregular heartbeat\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nTests include:\n\n* Blood culture to look for signs of infection\n* Chest x-ray\n* Echocardiogram (uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart)\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG, tests electrical activity in the heart)\n* Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to look for signs of infection\n* Blood smear to look for signs of infection\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe acute phase of reactivated Chagas disease should be treated.

It may take more than 20 years from the time of the original infection to develop heart or digestive problems.\n\nAbnormal heart rhythms may cause sudden death. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nChagas disease can cause these complications:\n\n* Enlarged colon\n* Enlarged esophagus with swallowing difficulty\n* Heart disease\n* Heart failure\n* Malnutrition\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if you think you may have Chagas disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nInsect control with insecticides and houses that are less likely to have high insect populations will help control the spread of the disease.\n\nBlood banks in Central and South America screen donors for exposure to the parasite.

    "title": "Chalazion: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001006.htm",
    "content": "**Chalazion**\n\nA chalazion is a small bump in the eyelid caused by a blockage of a tiny oil gland.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA chalazion is caused by a blocked duct in one of the meibomian glands. These glands are located in the eyelid directly behind the eyelashes. They produce a thin, oily fluid that lubricates the eye.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA chalazion often develops following an internal hordeolum (also called a stye). The eyelid most often becomes tender, red, swollen and warm. Sometimes, the blocked gland causing the stye will not drain even though the redness and swelling go away. The gland will form a firm nodule in the eyelid that is not tender. This is called a chalazion.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn exam of the eyelid confirms the diagnosis.\n\nRarely, skin cancer of the eyelid may look like a chalazion. If this is suspected, you may need a biopsy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA chalazion will often go away without treatment in a month or so.\n\nThe first treatment is to place warm compresses over the eyelid for 10 to 15 minutes at least four times a day. Use lukewarm water (no hotter than you can leave your hand in comfortably). This may soften the hardened oils blocking the duct, and lead to drainage and healing.\nDO NOT push or squeeze the chalazion.\n\nIf the chalazion continues to get bigger, it may need to be removed with surgery. This is most often done from the inside of the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin.\n\nSteroid injection is another treatment option.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChalazia most often heal on their own. The outcome with treatment is excellent in most cases, but they may return after they have initially healed.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou may lose some eyelashes or you may end up with a small notch in the edge of the eyelid. Rarely, a healed chalazion will leave a small scar on the skin of the eyelid. These problems are more common if you've had surgery for the chalazion.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if lumps on the eyelid continue to get bigger despite treatment, or you have an area of eyelash loss.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nApplying warm compresses daily, then scrubbing the lid at the eyelash line may help prevent chalazia and styes. Use eye cleansing pads or diluted baby shampoo for this.\n\nIf your provider has prescribed antibiotic ointment, apply it to the lash line after using warm compresses and scrubs.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMeibomian gland lipogranuloma\n\n---\n\n**Chalazion**\n\nA chalazion is a small lump on the eyelid caused by a blocked duct in one of the meibomian glands.\n\n*   **Location:** Meibomian glands are located in the eyelid directly behind the eyelashes.\n*   **Function:** These glands produce a thin, oily fluid that lubricates the eye.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA chalazion often develops following an internal hordeolum (also called a stye). The eyelid most often becomes tender, red, swollen and warm. Sometimes, the blocked gland causing the stye will not drain even though the redness and swelling go away. The gland will form a firm nodule in the eyelid that is not tender.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn exam of the eyelid confirms the diagnosis. Rarely, skin cancer of the eyelid may look like a chalazion. If this is suspected, you may need a biopsy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA chalazion will often go away without treatment in a month or so. The first treatment is to place warm compresses over the eyelid for 10 to 15 minutes at least four times a day. Use lukewarm water (no hotter than you can leave your hand in comfortably). This may soften the hardened oils blocking the duct, and lead to drainage and healing.\n\n*   **Do not push or squeeze the chalazion.**\n*   If the chalazion continues to get bigger, it may need to be removed with surgery. This is most often done from the inside of the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin.\n*   Steroid injection is another treatment option.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChalazia most often heal on their own. The outcome with treatment is excellent in most cases, but they may return after they have initially healed.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou may lose some eyelashes or you may end up with a small notch in the edge of the eyelid. Rarely, a healed chalazion will leave a small scar on the skin of the eyelid.

If your provider has prescribed antibiotic ointment, apply it to the lash line after using warm compresses and scrubs.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMeibomian gland lipogranuloma\n\n---\n\n**Chalazion**\n\nA chalazion is a small bump on the eyelid that occurs when a oil gland becomes blocked. It's usually harmless and can be treated with warm compresses or minor surgery.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A blockage in an oil gland, causing it to become inflamed\n*   A bacterial infection\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   A small, painful bump on the eyelid\n*   Redness and swelling around the bump\n*   Difficulty closing the eye due to pain or swelling\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Warm compresses to help loosen the blockage\n*   Minor surgery to remove the blocked gland\n*   Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   Keeping the eyelids clean and free of debris\n*   Avoiding picking or squeezing the eyelid, which can push bacteria and other germs into the oil glands.\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

    "content": "**Chancroid**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nChancroid is caused by a bacterium called Haemophilus ducreyi.\n\nThe infection is found in many parts of the world, such as Africa and southwest Asia. The infection is uncommon in the United States. Most people in the United States who are diagnosed with chancroid get it outside the country in areas where the infection is more common.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWithin 1 day to 2 weeks after becoming infected, a person will get a small bump on the genitals. The bump becomes an ulcer within a day after it first appears. The ulcer:\n\n* Ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 2 inches (3 millimeters to 5 centimeters) in diameter\n* Is painful\n* Is soft\n* Has sharply defined borders\n* Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material\n* Has a base that bleeds easily if it is bumped or scraped\n\nAbout one half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women often have 4 or more ulcers. The ulcers appear in specific locations.\n\nCommon locations in men are:\n\n* Foreskin\n* Groove behind the head of the penis\n* Shaft of the penis\n* Head of the penis\n* Opening of the penis\n* Scrotum\n\nIn women, the most common location for ulcers is the outer lips of the vagina (labia majora). \"Kissing ulcers\" may develop. Kissing ulcers are those that occur on opposite surfaces of the labia.\n\nUlcers also may form on the:\n\n* Inner vagina lips (labia minora)\n* Area between the genitals and the anus (perineal area)\n* Inner thighs\n\nThe most common symptoms in women are pain with urination and intercourse.\n\nThe ulcer may look like the sore of primary syphilis (chancre).\n\nAbout one half of the people who are infected with a chancroid develop enlarged lymph nodes in the groin.\n\nIn one half of people who have swelling of the groin lymph nodes, the nodes break through the skin and cause draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are also called buboes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider diagnoses chancroid by:\n\n* Looking at the ulcer(s)\n* Checking for swollen lymph nodes\n* Testing (ruling out) for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\nThere is no blood test for chancroid.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe infection is treated with antibiotics including ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Large lymph node swellings may need to be drained, either with a needle or local surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChancroid can get better on its own. Some people have months of painful ulcers and draining. Antibiotic treatment often clears up the lesions quickly with very little scarring.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include urethral fistulas and scars on the foreskin of the penis in uncircumcised males. People with chancroid should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections, including but not limited to syphilis, HIV, and genital herpes.\n\nIn people with HIV, chancroid may take much longer to heal.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\n\n* You have symptoms of chancroid.\n* You have had sexual contact with a person who you know has an STI.\n* You have engaged in high-risk sexual practices.\n\n---\n\n**Chancroid**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Chancroid?**\n\nChancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Chancroid**\n\nChancroid is caused by a bacterium called Haemophilus ducreyi.

Avoiding all forms of sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent an STI.\n\nHowever, safer sex behaviors may reduce your risk. The proper use of condoms, either the male or female type, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STI. You need to wear the condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity.\n\n\\n\\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Soft chancre\n* Ulcus molle\n* Sexually transmitted disease - chancroid\n* STD - chancroid\n* Sexually transmitted infection - chancroid\n* STI - chancroid",
