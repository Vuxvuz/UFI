CMV is a virus in the herpes family.\n\n**Who needs a CMV test?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant and have symptoms such as:\n\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n* Sore throat\n* Fever\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Muscle aches\n* Headache\n\nYour baby may need this test if they have symptoms such as:\n\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)\n* Low birth weight\n* Small head\n* Hearing and/or vision problems\n* Seizures\n* Rash\n\n**Types of CMV tests**\n\nThere are several types of CMV tests, including:\n\n* Blood tests: This is the most common way to test adults for CMV.\n* Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (spinal tap): To get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap.\n* Sputum test: You may be asked to rinse your mouth out with water before the sample is taken.\n* Biopsy: During the test, your provider will remove a small sample of tissue for testing.\n* Amniocentesis: This procedure is done on pregnant women to see if an unborn baby has been infected with CMV.\n\n**How are CMV tests performed?**\n\nThe performance of CMV tests varies depending on the type of test. For example:\n\n* Blood tests: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm.\n* Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (spinal tap): You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table, and a provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine.\n* Sputum test: You may be asked to rinse your mouth out with water before the sample is taken.\n* Biopsy: There are many ways to do a biopsy, depending on the type of cancer you have and where the tumor is located.\n* Amniocentesis: You'll lie on your back on an exam table, and a provider will insert a thin needle into your belly to withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid.\n\n**What happens after a CMV test?**\n\nAfter a CMV test, you may need to wait for the results, which can take from a few days to a few weeks. If you are pregnant, you may be advised on how to care for yourself and your baby during this time.\n\n---\n\n**Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Tests**\n\n\\n\\n**What are cytomegalovirus (CMV) tests?**\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) tests check for signs of CMV in your blood, sputum, or other body fluids. CMV is a virus in the herpes family. Other types of herpes viruses include the viruses that cause chickenpox and mononucleosis (mono).\n\n\\n\\n**What are they used for?**\n\nCMV tests help diagnose a current, reactivated, or past CMV infection in people at risk for health complications. Risk groups include:\n\n*   People with weakened immune systems due to certain infections or diseases\n*   People who have recently received an organ transplant\n*   You are pregnant and have symptoms of a CMV infection.\n*   Newborns with signs or symptoms of infection\n\n\\n\\n**Why do I need a CMV test?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant and have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Swollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\")\n*   Sore throat\n*   Fever\n*   Fatigue\n*   Weakness\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Headache\n\nYour baby may need this test if they have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n*   Low birth weight\n*   Small head\n*   Hearing and/or vision problems\n*   Seizures\n*   Rash\n\n---\n\n**Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Needs Testing?**\n\nYou need testing if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant and have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Rash\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n*   Fatigue\n*   Loss of appetite\n\nYour baby may need this test if they have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Rash\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n*   Fatigue\n*   Loss of appetite\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During a CMV Test?**\n\nThere are several types of CMV tests, including:\n\n### Blood Tests\n\nThis is the most common way to test adults for CMV.\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n### Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis (Spinal Tap)\n\nTo get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure:\n\n*   You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.\n*   A provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.\n*   When the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.\n*   Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.\n*   You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.\n*   Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.\n\n### Sputum Test\n\nSputum is a thick mucus made in your lungs.\n\nYou may be asked to rinse your mouth out with water before the sample is taken.\n\n*   Your provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup.\n*   A health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup.\n*   Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs.\n*   If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a salty mist to help you cough more deeply.\n*   If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you'll first get a medicine to help you relax, and then a numbing medicine so you won't feel any pain.\n*   Then a camera attached to a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into your airway. This helps your provider see the inside of your lungs and airway.\n*   Your provider will collect a sample from your airway using a small brush or suction\n\n### Biopsy\n\nDuring the test, your provider will remove a small sample of tissue for testing. There are many ways to do a biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on the type of cancer you have and where the tumor is located. In general, a biopsy may be done using:\n\n*   A hollow needle inserted through your skin. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, may be used to guide the needle:\n    *   A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of cells and/or fluid.\n    *   A core needle biopsy uses a larger needle to remove a sample.\n\n### Amniocentesis\n\nThis procedure is done on pregnant women to see if an unborn baby has been infected with CMV.\n\n*   You'll lie on your back on an exam table.\n*   Your provider will apply a gel to your belly.\n*   Your provider will move an ultrasound wand-like device, called a transducer, on your belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves to show the position of your baby and placenta so your provider can see where to take a sample of amniotic fluid.\n*   Your provider will clean your belly.\n*   Your provider will insert a thin needle into your belly, withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid, and then remove the needle.\n*   When the sample is removed, your provider will check your baby's heartbeat with the ultrasound.\n*   The sample is sent to a lab for testing. Results may take from a few days to a few weeks.\n\n### Newborns\n\nNewborns are usually given a saliva or urine test.\n\nDuring an infant saliva test:\n\n*   A saliva specimen is collected within three weeks of your baby's birth and at least an hour after breastfeeding.\n*   Your provider will insert a sterile swab into your baby's cheek and swirl for several seconds.\n*   The swab will be placed in a special solution for testing.\n\nDuring an infant urine test:\n\n*   You will be given a special plastic bag that will fit over your baby's genital area.\n*   You will place a diaper over the bag.\n*   After your baby has urinated, you will remove the bag from the diaper and empty the urine into a container given to you by your provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a blood or sputum test. There are also no preparations needed for an infant saliva or urine test.\n\nYou may need to empty your bladder before a spinal tap.\n\nYou may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before a biopsy.\n\nFor an amniocentesis, you may be asked to not urinate (pee) before the test to make sure you have a full bladder. This helps move the uterus into a better position for the test. In later pregnancy, you need to have an empty bladder for the test.\n\nYour provider or your child's provider will let you know if you need to make any other preparations.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere are no known risks to having a sputum test, infant saliva test, or infant urine test.\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you feel some pain or tenderness in your back, or have some bleeding where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more, but your provider may suggest treatment to relieve the pain.\n\nIf you had a biopsy, you may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. This usually goes away after a few days.\n\n---\n\n**Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Tests**\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nIf you had a biopsy, you may have some bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. This usually goes away after a few days.\n\nIf you had amniocentesis, you may have some stinging, pressure, and/or cramping during the test. Afterward, you may have mild discomfort or vaginal bleeding, or a small amount of amniotic fluid may leak from your vagina. The risk of serious complications is extremely low. Your provider will let you know if there are any symptoms that you should tell them about.\n\nThere are no known risks to having a sputum test, infant saliva test, or infant urine test.\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you feel some pain or tenderness in your back, or have some bleeding where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe test result can show whether you have ever had a CMV infection. But the tests can't show if it's a current, past, or reactivated infection.\n\nIf you have symptoms and/or risk factors such as an immune system disorder, your provider may do additional tests to help make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan.\n\nIf you are pregnant and your amniocentesis shows your baby has CMV, your child's provider may test and treat your baby soon after birth to help prevent complications.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About CMV Testing?**\n\nCMV tests are included as part of a TORCH panel, a group of blood tests used to screen newborns and sometimes during pregnancy for the following infections:\n\n* Toxoplasmosis\n* Rubella\n* Cytomegalovirus\n* Herpes simplex virus\n\nThese infections can cause birth defects if a mother gets any of these infections during pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment may help prevent a baby from getting a serious health problem.\n\nYou can't eliminate your risk for CMV, but you can lower your chance of getting infected or spreading the infection by:\n\n* Not sharing food or dishes with a child or putting their pacifier in your mouth.\n* Washing your hands well after changing a diaper.\n* Wearing gloves and washing your hands well if you are caring for someone who is sick and have contact with their body fluids.\n* Using latex condoms correctly every time you have sex. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\n\n**References**\n\n* ACOG: Women's Healthcare Physicians [Internet].

But usually, people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, become ill from CMV infection. Some otherwise healthy people with CMV infection develop mononucleosis-like symptoms.\n\nCMV is a type of herpes virus. Similar to all herpes viruses, CMV remains in your body for the rest of your life after infection. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany people are exposed to CMV early in life, but do not realize it because they have no symptoms, or they have mild symptoms that resemble the common cold or flu.

It is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox and infectious mononucleosis (mono). Between 50% and 80% of adults in the United States have had a CMV infection by age 40. Once CMV is in a person's body, it stays there for life.\n\n**Transmission and Risk Groups**\n\nCMV is spread through close contact with body fluids. Most people with CMV don't get sick and don't know that they've been infected. But infection with the virus can be serious in babies and people with weak immune systems. If a woman gets CMV when she is pregnant, she can pass it on to her baby. Usually the babies do not have health problems. But some babies can develop lifelong disabilities.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA blood test can tell whether a person has ever been infected with CMV. Most people with CMV don't need treatment. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Good hygiene, including proper hand washing, may help prevent infections.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\n*   About Cytomegalovirus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n*   Cytomegalovirus (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Tests  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   Congenital CMV and Hearing Loss (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Cytomegalovirus Infections  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n    *   Article: Oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease associated with HSV-1... \n    *   Article: Foscarnet Versus Ganciclovir for Severe Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection: Short- and Long-Term... \n    *   Article: Emerging Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers for Human Cytomegalovirus Infection During Pregnancy:...\n\n---\n\n**Cytomegalovirus Infections**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Severe Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection:** Ganciclovir treatment has been shown to improve outcomes for infants with severe congenital cytomegalovirus infection.\n* **Emerging Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers:** Researchers are exploring new biomarkers to predict and monitor cytomegalovirus infections during pregnancy, which could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Children**\n\n* **CMV in Newborns:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on congenital cytomegalovirus infection.\n* **Cytomegalovirus (For Parents):** The Nemours Foundation offers resources and guidance for parents on managing CMV infections in children.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Women**\n\n* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pregnancy:** The Organization of Teratology Information Specialists provides information on the risks and management of CMV during pregnancy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n* **CMV - gastroenteritis/colitis:** The Medical Encyclopedia explains the relationship between cytomegalovirus and gastrointestinal issues.\n* **CMV blood test:** The Medical Encyclopedia describes the purpose and process of a CMV blood test.\n* **CMV pneumonia:** The Medical Encyclopedia outlines the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of CMV-related pneumonia.\n* **CMV retinitis:** The Medical Encyclopedia explains the connection between cytomegalovirus and eye infections.\n* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection:** The Medical Encyclopedia provides a comprehensive overview of CMV infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Topic Image**\n\nMEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\n* **CMV - gastroenteritis/colitis**\n* **CMV blood test**\n* **CMV pneumonia**\n* **CMV retinitis**\n* **Congenital cytomegalovirus**\n* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Viral Infections**\n* **National Institutes of Health**\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Cytomegalovirus Infections is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases",

It can be performed in a hospital or clinic while under general or local anesthesia.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nThe health care provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into the vagina. This holds the vaginal canal open. Numbing medicine may be applied to the opening to the uterus (cervix).\n\nThe cervical canal is widened, and a curette (a metal loop on the end of a long, thin handle) is passed through the opening into the uterus cavity. The provider gently scrapes the inner layer of tissue, called the endometrium. Alternatively, a suction curette may be used to remove endometrial tissue. The tissue is collected for examination.\n\n**Why is a D and C Performed?**\n\nThis procedure may be done to:\n\n* Diagnose or rule out conditions such as uterine cancer\n* Remove tissue after a miscarriage\n* Treat heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular periods, or bleeding between periods\n* Perform a therapeutic or elective abortion\n\nYour provider may also recommend a D and C if you have:\n\n* Abnormal bleeding while on hormone replacement therapy\n* An embedded intrauterine device (IUD)\n* Bleeding after menopause\n* Endometrial polyps (small lumps of tissue on the endometrium)\n* Thickening of the uterus\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks related to D and C include:\n\n* Puncture of the uterus\n* Scarring of the uterine lining (Asherman syndrome, may lead to infertility later)\n* Tear of the cervix\n\nRisks due to anesthesia include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Problems breathing\n\nRisks of any surgery include:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe D and C procedure has few risks.

    "content": "**D-Dimer Test**\n\nA D-dimer test looks for D-dimer in blood. D-dimer is a protein fragment (small piece) that's made when a blood clot dissolves in your body. D-dimer isn't usually found in your blood unless your body is making or breaking up blood clots.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA D-dimer test is used to check if you may have a blood clot. The test helps to find out if you need more tests to check for blood clotting disorders. A D-dimer test may also be used to monitor how well treatments for a blood clotting disorder like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are working.\n\n**Blood Clotting Disorders**\n\nBlood clotting disorders that the D-dimer test may be used for include:\n\n* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body.\n* Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage in a lung artery.\n* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition that causes too many blood clots to form.\n* Stroke, which can happen when blood flow to a part of the brain is blocked.\n\n**Why do I need a D-dimer test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a blood clotting disorder, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n**Symptoms of Blood Clotting Disorders**\n\nSymptoms of DVT in your leg include:\n\n* Leg pain or tenderness\n* Leg swelling\n* Redness or darkening of the skin on the leg\n* Skin that feels warm\n\nSymptoms of PE include:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Cough\n* Chest pain\n* Rapid heartbeat and breathing\n\n**What happens during a D-dimer test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a D-dimer test.\n\n**Are there any risks to a D-dimer test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show low or normal D-dimer levels in the blood, it means you probably don't have a clotting disorder.\n\nBut if you are being treated with blood thinner medicines, they may cause a false negative D-dimer test. This means your test results show that you don't have a clotting disorder, but you really do.\n\nIf your results show higher than normal levels of D-dimer, it may be a sign of a clotting disorder. Additional tests will be needed to show where the blood clot is located or what type of clotting disorder you have.\n\nHigh D-dimer levels are not always caused by clotting disorders. A few other possible reasons why you may have high D-dimer levels include pregnancy, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and recent surgery. Being older or immobilized (unable to move) may also cause a high D-dimer level.\n\nIf your D-dimer results were not normal, your provider will probably order more tests to make a diagnosis. To understand the results of a D-dimer test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a D-dimer test?**\n\nIf your D-dimer test results were not normal, your provider may order one or more imaging tests to find out if you have a clotting disorder. These include:\n\n* Doppler ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to create images of your veins.\n* CT angiography. In this test, you are injected with a special dye that helps your blood vessels show up on a special type of x-ray machine.\n* Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. These are two tests that look for certain lung problems.\n\n**References**\n\nShow references\n\n---\n\n**D-Dimer Test**\n\nThe D-dimer test is used to check for blood clotting disorders such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It helps determine if further testing is needed to diagnose these conditions.\n\n**Blood Clotting Disorders**\n\nThe D-dimer test may be used for the following blood clotting disorders:\n\n*   **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body, typically affecting the lower legs.\n*   **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: a blockage in a lung artery, usually caused by a blood clot breaking loose and traveling to the lungs.\n*   **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**: a condition that causes too many blood clots to form, potentially leading to organ damage.\n*   **Stroke**: a blockage of blood flow to a part of the brain.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, you may need a D-dimer test:\n\n*   **DVT Symptoms in Your Leg:**\n    *   Leg pain or tenderness\n    *   Leg swelling\n    *   Redness or darkening of the skin on the leg\n    *   Skin that feels warm\n*   **PE Symptoms:**\n    *   Trouble breathing\n    *   Cough\n    *   Chest pain\n    *   Rapid heartbeat and breathing\n\n**What Happens During a D-Dimer Test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The procedure typically takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Preparation and Risks**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a D-dimer test. There is very little risk to having a blood test, with slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was inserted being the most common side effect.\n\n**Interpreting Results**\n\nIf your results show low or normal D-dimer levels, it's likely you don't have a clotting disorder. However, if you're taking blood thinner medicines, they may cause a false negative result. If your results show higher than normal levels of D-dimer, it may indicate a clotting disorder, and additional tests will be needed to determine the location or type of disorder.\n\n**Additional Testing**\n\nIf your D-dimer test results are not normal, your provider may order one or more imaging tests, including:\n\n*   **Doppler Ultrasound**: uses sound waves to create images of your veins.\n*   **CT Angiography**: injects a special dye to help visualize blood vessels on an x-ray machine.\n*   **Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan**: measures lung function using small amounts of radioactive tracer.\n\n**Understanding Your Results**\n\nTo understand the results of a D-dimer test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests. If you have questions about your results, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**D-Dimer Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/3)**\n\n**How well your lungs are working**\n\nIf your D-dimer test results were not normal, your provider may order one or more imaging tests to find out if you have a clotting disorder.

It can also help you lose weight and reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\n**How DASH Works**\n\nThe DASH diet reduces high blood pressure by lowering the amount of sodium in your diet to 2300 milligrams (mg) a day. Lowering sodium to 1500 mg a day reduces blood pressure even more. The DASH diet also includes a variety of foods rich in nutrients that may help some people lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium.\n\n**On the DASH Diet**\n\nYou will:\n\n* Get plenty of vegetables, fruits, and fat-free or low-fat dairy\n* Include whole grains, beans, seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils\n* Eat lean meats, poultry, and fish\n* Cut back on salt, red meat, sweets, and sugary drinks\n\n**Exercise**\n\nYou should also get at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days of the week. Examples include brisk walking or riding a bike. Aim to get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of exercise per week.\n\n**Who Should Follow the DASH Diet**\n\nThe DASH diet is recommended for:\n\n* Those who want to prevent high blood pressure\n* People who want to lose extra weight\n* Most people can benefit from lowering sodium intake to 2300 mg a day\n\nYour health care provider may suggest cutting back to 1500 mg a day if you:\n\n* Already have high blood pressure\n* Have diabetes or chronic kidney disease\n* Are African American\n* Are age 51 years or older\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nOn the DASH diet, you can eat foods from all food groups. But you will include more of the foods that are naturally low in salt, cholesterol, and saturated fats. You will also include foods that are high in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fiber.\n\nHere's a list of the food groups and how many servings of each you should have per day:\n\n* Vegetables (4 to 5 servings a day)\n* Fruits (4 to 5 servings a day)\n* Low-fat or fat-free dairy products (2 to 3 servings a day)\n* Grains (6 to 8 servings a day, and 3 should be whole grains)\n* Fish, lean meats, and poultry (2 servings or less a day)\n* Beans, seeds, and nuts (4 to 5 servings a week)\n* Fats and oils (2 to 3 servings a day)\n* Sweets or added sugars (fewer than 5 servings a week)\n\n**Tips for Following the DASH Diet**\n\nThe DASH diet is designed to be easy to follow. But it might mean making some changes to how you currently eat. To get started:\n\n* Do not try to make changes all at once. It's fine to change your eating habits gradually.\n* Add vegetables to your diet, such as having a salad at lunch or adding cucumber, lettuce, shredded carrots, or tomatoes to your sandwiches.\n* There should always be something green on your plate. It's fine to use frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Just make sure the package does not contain added salt or fat.\n\n**Tips to Lower Your Salt**\n\nTo lower the amount of salt in your diet:\n\n* Take the salt shaker off the table.\n* Flavor your food with herbs and spices instead of salt. Lemon, lime, and vinegar also add flavor.\n* Avoid canned foods and frozen entrees. They are often high in salt. When you make things from scratch you have more control over how much salt goes in them.\n\n**Where to Get More Information**\n\nThere are many books about the DASH diet plan to help you get started. These books can also provide sample meal plans and recipe ideas.\n\n---\n\n**DASH Diet to Lower High Blood Pressure**\n\nThe DASH diet is a recommended eating plan by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to help lower high blood pressure, cholesterol, and other fats in your blood.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/dhea-sulfate-test/",
    "content": "**DHEA Sulfate Test**\n\nThis test measures the levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) in your blood. DHEAS stands for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. DHEAS is mostly made in the adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. Your adrenal glands help control your heart rate, blood pressure, and other body functions. They make different types of hormones you need to stay healthy. This includes cortisol, a hormone that helps with your immune system, and DHEAS, a steroid hormone.\n\nDHEAS is a type of androgen (male sex hormone), but it's found in both men and women. Smaller amounts of DHEAS are made in the testicles and ovaries.\n\nDHEAS plays an important role in making the male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormone estrogen. DHEAS helps with the development of male sexual characteristics at puberty and reproduction for both sexes. Your DHEAS levels peak around puberty and then get lower as you age.\n\nIf your DHEAS levels are not normal, it may mean there is a problem with your adrenal glands or sex hormones (estrogen or testosterone).\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) test is most often used to:\n\n* Find out if your adrenal glands are working well\n* Diagnose tumors of the adrenal glands\n* Diagnose disorders of the testicles or ovaries\n* Find out the cause of early or late puberty in boys\n* Look for the cause of the development of masculine features in women and girls, including excess body and facial hair growth and deepening of voice\n\n---\n\n**DHEA Sulfate Test**\n\n**What is a DHEA sulfate test?**\n\nA DHEAS test is often used to determine the cause of early or late puberty in boys. It is also used to look for the cause of the development of masculine features in women and girls, including excess body and facial hair growth and deepening of voice.\n\n**Why do I need a DHEA sulfate test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of high or low levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). Men may not have any symptoms of high levels of DHEAS. Symptoms of high levels of DHEAS in women and girls may include:\n\n* Excess body and facial hair growth\n* Deepening of voice\n* Menstrual irregularities\n* Acne\n* Becoming very muscular\n* Hair loss at the top of the head\n\nBaby girls may also need testing if they have external (outer) genitals that do not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Boys may need this test if they have signs of early puberty.\n\n**What happens during a DHEA sulfate test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a DHEA sulfate test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show high levels of DHEAS, it may be a sign of the following conditions:\n\n* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited disorder of the adrenal glands in which the adrenal glands produce too many male sex hormones.\n* A tumor of the adrenal gland. It may be benign (noncancerous) or cancerous.\n* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.\n* In rare cases, a high level of DHEAS could be a sign of an ovarian tumor.\n\nIf your results show low levels of DHEAS, it may be a sign of the following conditions:\n\n* Addison disease. Addison disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands are not able to make enough of certain hormones.\n* Hypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary gland does not make enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. The possible symptoms will vary, depending on which hormones are lacking.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a DHEA sulfate test?**\n\nOver-the-counter DHEA sulfate supplements are available and are sometimes promoted as an anti-aging therapy. However, there is no reliable evidence to support these anti-aging claims. In fact, these supplements may cause serious side effects.

    "content": "**DHEA-sulfate test**\n\nThe DHEA-sulfate test measures the amount of DHEA-sulfate in the blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary. However, tell your health care provider if you are taking any vitamins or supplements that contain DHEA or DHEA-sulfate.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or sting. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to check the function of the two adrenal glands. One of these glands sits above each kidney. They are one of the major sources of androgens in women.\n\nAlthough DHEA-sulfate is the most abundant hormone in the body, its exact function is still not known.\n\nIn men, the male hormone effect may not be important if testosterone level is normal.\nIn women, DHEA contributes to normal libido and sexual satisfaction.\nDHEA may also have effects on the immune system.\n\nThe DHEA-sulfate test is often done in women who show signs of having excess male hormones. Some of these signs are male body changes, excess hair growth, oily skin, acne, irregular periods, or problems becoming pregnant.\n\nIt may also be done in women who are concerned about low libido or decreased sexual satisfaction who have pituitary or adrenal gland disorders.\n\nThe test is also done in children who are maturing too early (precocious puberty).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal blood levels of DHEA-sulfate can differ by sex and age.\n\n* Typical normal ranges for females:\n\t+ Ages 18 to 29: 45 to 320 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) or 1.2 to 8.7 micromoles per liter (µmol/L)\n\t+ Ages 30 to 39: 40 to 325 µg/dL or 1.1 to 8.8 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages 40 to 49: 25 to 220 µg/dL or 0.7 to 6.0 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages 50 to 59: 15 to 170 µg/dL or 0.4 to 4.6 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages above 59: less than 145 µg/dL or less than 3.9 µmol/L\n* Typical normal ranges for males:\n\t+ Ages 18 to 29: 110 to 510 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) or 3.0 to 14.0 micromoles per liter (µmol/L)\n\t+ Ages 30 to 39: 110 to 370 µg/dL or 3.0 to 10.0 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages 40 to 49: 45 to 345 µg/dL or 1.2 to 9.4 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages 50 to 59: 25 to 240 µg/dL or 0.7 to 6.5 µmol/L\n\t+ Ages above 59: less than 204 µg/dL or less than 5.5 µmol/L\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn increase in DHEA-sulfate may be due to:\n\n* A common genetic disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n* A tumor of the adrenal gland, which can be benign or be a cancer.\n* A common problem in women younger than 50, called polycystic ovary syndrome.\n* Body changes of a girl with puberty happening earlier than normal.\n\nA decrease in DHEA sulfate may be due to:\n\n* Adrenal gland disorders that produce lower than normal amounts of adrenal hormones, including adrenal insufficiency and Addison disease\n* The pituitary gland not producing normal amounts of its hormones (hypopituitarism)\n* Taking glucocorticoid medicines\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum DHEA-sulfate; Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate test; DHEA-sulfate - serum\n\n**References**\n\nChen Zi-Chiang, Legro RS, Ehrmann DA, Wei D.

    "content": "**DHEA**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\n\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that is turned into male and female sex hormones in the body. Prescription DHEA is used to treat thin vaginal tissue.\n\nDHEA is made by the adrenal glands and by the liver. DHEA levels seem to go down as people get older. DHEA levels seem to be lower in people with depression and after menopause.\n\nPeople commonly use prescription DHEA for vaginal tissue thinning, depression, or aging skin. DHEA supplements are used for muscle strength, heart disease, erectile dysfunction (ED), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.\n\nDHEA is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the International Olympic Committee, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Don't confuse DHEA with 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA, and 7-keto-DHEA. These are all different forms of DHEA but are not the same as DHEA.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for DHEA are as follows:\n\n* Likely effective for:\n\t+ Thinning of vaginal tissue (vaginal atrophy). Using vaginal inserts containing DHEA can reduce pain during sex by up to 15% after menopause. A prescription DHEA product is available for this condition.\n\t+ Aging skin. Taking DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin might improve skin appearance after menopause and in people over the age of 60 years.\n\t+ Depression. Taking 30-500 mg of DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve symptoms of depression. Lower doses don't seem to help.\n\t+ Inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). Taking DHEA by mouth before in-vitro fertilization (IVF) might improve the chances of pregnancy and having a baby. But it's not clear if taking DHEA helps prevent miscarriage after IVF.\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Aging. Taking DHEA by mouth daily for up to 2 years doesn't seem to improve body shape, bone strength, muscle strength, or quality of life in people older than 60 who have low DHEA levels.\n\t+ Muscle strength. Taking DHEA by mouth doesn't improve muscle strength in adults.\n\t+ Physical performance in elderly adults. Taking DHEA by mouth doesn't improve physical performance in older adults.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Taking DHEA by mouth does not seem to improve mental function or decrease mental decline in healthy older people, people with HIV, or in healthy young adults.\n\t+ An autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are damaged (Sjogren syndrome). Taking DHEA by mouth does not improve symptoms of this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: DHEA is possibly safe when used short-term. DHEA has been used safely for up to 2 years, usually in doses of 50 mg daily. DHEA side effects are usually mild and might include acne and upset stomach.\n\nDHEA is possibly unsafe when used in high doses or long-term. Do not use DHEA in doses higher than 50-100 mg daily or for a long period of time. Using higher doses or using it long-term can increase the risk of serious side effects including cancer.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: DHEA is possibly safe when used appropriately. DHEA cream has been used safely for up to 1 year.\n\nWhen applied into the vagina: DHEA is possibly safe when used appropriately. DHEA vaginal inserts have been safely used for up to 3 months.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special precautions & warnings**\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: DHEA is possibly unsafe when taken during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It can cause higher than normal levels of a male hormone called androgen. This might be harmful to the baby. Do not use DHEA if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Diabetes: DHEA can affect how insulin works in the body. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully if you are taking DHEA.\n\n---\n\n**DHEA: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Hormone-Sensitive Conditions**\n\n* DHEA is a hormone that can affect how estrogen works in the body.\n* If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, do not use DHEA.\n\n**High Cholesterol**\n\n* DHEA might lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\") cholesterol, especially in females.\n* If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, talk with your healthcare provider before taking DHEA.\n\n**Liver Problems**\n\n* DHEA might make liver problems worse.\n* Do not use DHEA if you have liver problems.\n\n**Depression and Mood Disorders**\n\n* DHEA might cause excitability, impulsiveness, and irritability in people with mood disorders.\n* If you have a mood disorder, talk to your healthcare provider before taking DHEA.\n\n**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**\n\n* Taking DHEA might make this condition worse.\n* Don't use DHEA if you have PCOS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: DHEA is possibly safe when used short-term. DHEA has been used safely for up to 2 years, usually in doses of 50 mg daily. DHEA side effects are usually mild and might include acne and upset stomach.\n\nDHEA is possibly unsafe when used in high doses or long-term.

DHEA cream has been used safely for up to 1 year.\n\nWhen applied into the vagina: DHEA is possibly safe when used appropriately. DHEA vaginal inserts have been safely used for up to 3 months.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special Precautions & Warnings**\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: DHEA is possibly unsafe when taken during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It can cause higher than normal levels of a male hormone called androgen. This might be harmful to the baby. Do not use DHEA if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDiabetes: DHEA can affect how insulin works in the body. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully if you are taking DHEA.\n\nHormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: DHEA is a hormone that can affect how estrogen works in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, do not use DHEA.\n\nHigh cholesterol: DHEA might lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\") cholesterol, especially in females. If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, talk with your healthcare provider before taking DHEA.\n\nLiver problems: DHEA might make liver problems worse. Do not use DHEA if you have liver problems.\n\nDepression and mood disorders: DHEA might cause excitability, impulsiveness, and irritability in people with mood disorders. If you have a mood disorder, talk to your healthcare provider before taking DHEA.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Taking DHEA might make this condition worse. Don't use DHEA if you have PCOS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nFulvestrant (Faslodex)\nEstrogen-sensitive cancers are cancers that are affected by estrogen levels in the body. Fulvestrant is used for these types of cancer. DHEA might increase estrogen in the body and decrease the effects of fulvestrant for treating cancer. Do not take DHEA if you are taking fulvestrant.\nMedications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver. DHEA might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\nMedications for depression (Antidepressant drugs)\nThere is some concern that taking DHEA along with antidepressant drugs might increase the risk for serious side effects. Speak with a healthcare provider before taking DHEA if you are taking an antidepressant.\nMedications for estrogen sensitive cancers (Aromatase inhibitors)\nThe body changes DHEA to estrogen in the body. Aromatase inhibitors are used to help lower estrogen levels in the body. Taking DHEA might decrease the effects of aromatase inhibitors.\nMedications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)\nDHEA might slow blood clotting. Taking DHEA along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\nTamoxifen (Nolvadex)\nEstrogen-sensitive cancers are cancers that are affected by estrogen levels in the body. Tamoxifen is used to help treat and prevent these types of cancer. DHEA increases estrogen levels in the body and might decrease the effects of tamoxifen. Do not take DHEA if you are taking tamoxifen.\nTriazolam (Halcion)\nDHEA might decrease how quickly the body breaks down triazolam. Taking DHEA with triazolam might increase the effects and side effects of triazolam.\nTuberculosis Vaccine\nTaking DHEA might reduce the effects of the tuberculosis vaccine. Do not take DHEA if you are receiving a tuberculosis vaccine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nHerbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting\nDHEA might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**DHEA: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n*   **Testosterone Side Effects**: DHEA might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people.\n\n**Interactions**\n\n*   **Herbs and Supplements That Might Slow Blood Clotting**: Examples include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n*   **Licorice**: Taking licorice increases levels of DHEA in the body. Taking licorice with DHEA might increase the side effects of DHEA.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n*   **Dose and Duration**: DHEA has most often been used by adults at a dose of 50 mg by mouth daily for up to 1 year.\n*   **Topical Creams and Vaginal Products**: DHEA is also available in topical creams and vaginal products. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n*   **3b-Hydroxy-Androst-5-Ene-17-One**\n*   **3BetaHydroxy-Androst-5-Ene-17-One**\n*   **Androstenolone**\n*   **Dehydroepiandrosterone**\n*   **Déhydroépiandrostérone**\n*   **DHEA-S**\n*   **GL701**\n*   **Prasterone**\n*   **Prasterone**\n\n**References**\n\n*   Zhang J, Jia H, Diao F, Ma X, Liu J, Cui Y.

    "content": "**DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome**\n\n_DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome_\n\n**Description**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is a disorder of the immune system characterized by recurrent infections that are severe and can be life-threatening. The infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Skin infections cause rashes, blisters, accumulations of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling. People with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome also tend to have frequent bouts of pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections. Other immune system-related problems in people with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome include an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema, food or environmental allergies, and asthma.\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood; the levels can be more than 10 times higher than normal for no known reason. IgE normally triggers an immune response against foreign invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and plays a role in allergies. It is unclear why people with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have such high levels of this protein. People with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome also have highly elevated numbers of certain white blood cells called eosinophils (hypereosinophilia). Eosinophils aid in the immune response and are involved in allergic reactions.\n\nSome people with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have neurological problems, such as paralysis that affects the face or one side of the body (hemiplegia). Blockage of blood flow in the brain or abnormal bleeding in the brain, both of which can lead to stroke, can also occur in DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\nPeople with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have a greater-than-average risk of developing cancer, particularly cancers of the blood or skin.\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is also commonly called autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome. However, researchers have identified several conditions that feature elevated levels of IgE and that follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Each of these conditions has its own set of additional signs and symptoms and a different genetic cause. Some doctors consider these conditions forms of hyper-IgE syndrome, while others consider them independent disorders.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n*   **Incidence**: The exact incidence of DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is unknown.\n*   **Prevalence**: The prevalence of DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome in the general population is also unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. The DOCK8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called DOCK8, which plays a role in signaling within cells. Mutations in the DOCK8 gene can lead to impaired immune function and an increased risk of infections.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Carriers of the mutated gene, who have one normal and one mutated copy of the gene, are typically asymptomatic but can pass the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is also commonly called autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome, you may want to consider the following resources:\n\n*   National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n*   American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI)\n\n**References**\n\nThe references cited in this article are listed below:\n\n*   [Insert reference 1]\n*   [Insert reference 2]\n\nNote: The formatting has been adjusted to better suit the display of medical content.\n\n---\n\n**DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome**\n\n**What is DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome?**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent infections that are severe and can be life-threatening. The condition affects the immune system, causing a range of symptoms including skin infections, pneumonia, eczema, food or environmental allergies, and asthma.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome experience:\n\n* Severe skin infections, including rashes, blisters, abscesses, and open sores\n* Frequent bouts of pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections\n* Inflammatory skin disorder called eczema\n* Food or environmental allergies\n* Asthma\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by:\n\n* Abnormally high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood, which can be more than 10 times higher than normal for no known reason\n* Highly elevated numbers of certain white blood cells called eosinophils (hypereosinophilia)\n* Neurological problems, such as paralysis that affects the face or one side of the body (hemiplegia)\n* Blockage of blood flow in the brain or abnormal bleeding in the brain, which can lead to stroke\n* A greater-than-average risk of developing cancer, particularly cancers of the blood or skin\n\n**Causes**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a critical role in the survival and function of several types of immune system cells.\n\n**Genetic Cause**\n\nThe DOCK8 gene produces a protein that helps maintain the structure and integrity of immune cells called T cells and NK cells. It is also involved in chemical signaling pathways that stimulate other immune cells called B cells to mature and produce antibodies.\n\n**Impact on Immune System**\n\nMutations in the DOCK8 gene result in the production of little or no functional DOCK8 protein, impairing normal immune cell development and function. This leads to a shortage of T cells and NK cells, which are abnormal and die too easily, particularly when moving through the layers of skin.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is a rare disorder whose prevalence is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome**\n\n**Causes of the Disorder**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a critical role in the survival and function of several types of immune system cells.\n\n**Function of the DOCK8 Protein**\n\nOne of the functions of the DOCK8 protein is to help maintain the structure and integrity of immune cells called T cells and NK cells, which recognize and attack foreign invaders. The DOCK8 protein is also involved in chemical signaling pathways that stimulate other immune cells called B cells to mature and produce antibodies.\n\n**Effects of DOCK8 Gene Mutations**\n\nDOCK8 gene mutations result in the production of little or no functional DOCK8 protein. This impairs normal immune cell development and function, leading to severe skin infections and recurrent respiratory tract infections in people with this disorder.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AR-HIES\n* Autosomal recessive HIES\n* Combined immunodeficiency due to DOCK8 deficiency\n* Hyper IgE recurrent infection syndrome, autosomal recessive\n* Hyperimmunoglobulin E recurrent infection syndrome, autosomal recessive\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on this condition and resources for patients and families affected by it, please see the following:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Combined immunodeficiency due to DOCK8 deficiency\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: HYPER-IgE SYNDROME 2, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH RECURRENT INFECTIONS; HIES2\n\n---\n\n**DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome**\n\n**What is DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome?**\n\nDOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. It is characterized by recurrent infections, particularly of the skin and lungs, as well as an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Symptoms and Characteristics**\n\nPatients with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome often experience:\n\n* Recurrent skin and lung infections\n* Increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders\n* Impaired immune function\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe disorder is caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene, which codes for a protein involved in the regulation of the immune system. The risk of developing DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is highest in families with a history of the condition.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the DOCK8 gene. There is no cure for DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing infections. This may include antibiotics, antiviral medications, and other supportive therapies.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for patients with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and their response to treatment. With proper management, many patients are able to lead relatively normal lives despite their condition.\n\n**References**\n\n* Engelhardt KR, Gertz ME, Keles S, et al.

    "content": "**DOORS Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\nDOORS syndrome is a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). \"DOORS\" is an abbreviation for the major features of the disorder including deafness; short or absent nails (onychodystrophy); short fingers and toes (osteodystrophy); developmental delay and intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation); and seizures. Some people with DOORS syndrome do not have all of these features.\n\n**Major Features**\n\n* **Deafness**: Most people with DOORS syndrome have profound hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ears (sensorineural deafness).\n* **Nail Abnormalities**: The nail abnormalities affect both the hands and the feet in DOORS syndrome. Impaired growth of the bones at the tips of the fingers and toes (hypoplastic terminal phalanges) account for the short fingers and toes characteristic of this disorder.\n* **Developmental Delay and Intellectual Disability**: Developmental delay and intellectual disability are also often severe in this disorder.\n* **Seizures**: The seizures that occur in people with DOORS syndrome usually start in infancy. The most common seizures in people with this condition are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures), which cause muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness.\n\n**Other Features**\n\n* **Microcephaly**: An unusually small head size.\n* **Facial Differences**: Most commonly a wide, bulbous nose.\n* **Dental Abnormalities**: Structural abnormalities of the heart or urinary tract, and abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).\n* **2-oxoglutaric Acid Levels**: Higher-than-normal levels in the urine.\n\n**Frequency**\nThe exact frequency of DOORS syndrome is unknown due to its rarity. However, it is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 100,000 births.\n\n**Causes**\nThe causes of DOORS syndrome are not fully understood and are likely to be complex and multifactorial.

If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.\n\nFor other signs that concern you, call your provider.\n\nAdverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice.\n\n**The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program**\n\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation or call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and about filing a claim.\n\n**How Can I Learn More?**\n\nAsk your provider\nCall your local or state health department\nVisit the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for vaccine package inserts and additional information at www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics.\n\nContact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\n*   Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)\n*   Visit CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/\n\n---\n\n**DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) Vaccine - What You Need to Know**\n\nContact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\n* Phone: [insert phone number]\n* Email: [insert email]\n\n**Vaccination Information**\n\nThe DTaP vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. It is recommended for children and adults who have not previously received the vaccine or have not completed the full series.\n\n**Benefits of the Vaccine**\n\nThe DTaP vaccine provides immunity against:\n\n* Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that can cause respiratory problems\n* Tetanus: a bacterial infection that can cause muscle stiffness, spasms, and rigidity\n* Pertussis (whooping cough): a highly contagious bacterial infection that can cause severe coughing and difficulty breathing\n\n**Precautions and Side Effects**\n\nAs with any vaccine, there are potential side effects to be aware of:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site\n* Fever\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle pain\n\nIn rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, such as allergic reactions or seizures.\n\n**Administration and Scheduling**\n\nThe DTaP vaccine is typically administered in a series of 5 doses:\n\n* Dose 1: given at 2 months of age\n* Dose 2: given at 4 months of age\n* Dose 3: given at 6 months of age\n* Dose 4: given at 15-18 months of age\n* Dose 5: given at 4-6 years of age\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Do not stop taking dabigatran without talking to your doctor. Continue to take dabigatran even if you feel well. Be sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss any doses of dabigatran.\n\nIf you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while taking a 'blood thinner' such as dabigatran, you are at risk of having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause you to become paralyzed. Tell your doctor if you have an epidural catheter that is left in your body or have or have ever had repeated epidural or spinal punctures, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: anagrelide (Agrylin), aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), indomethacin (Indocin, Tivorbex), ketoprofen, and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, others), cilostazol (Pletal), clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), eptifibatide (Integrilin), heparin, prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), ticlopidine, tirofiban (Aggrastat), and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: back pain, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or loss of control of your bowels or bladder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to dabigatran.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dabigatran and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: back pain, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or loss of control of your bowels or bladder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory.

It is also used to reduce the risk of a DVT and PE from happening again after initial treatment is completed in adults and children 3 months of age and older. Dabigatran is used to help prevent DVT and PE in adults who have had hip replacement surgery. Dabigatran is also used to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots in adults who have atrial fibrillation (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly, increasing the chance of clots forming in the body, and possibly causing strokes) without heart valve disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDabigatran comes as a capsule and pellets to take by mouth. When dabigatran is used to treat or prevent a DVT or PE or to prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation, it is usually taken twice a day. When dabigatran is used to prevent a DVT or PE after hip replacement surgery, it is usually taken 1 to 4 hours after surgery, and then once a day for another 28 to 35 days.\n\n*   Take dabigatran capsules with food if the medication upsets your stomach.\n*   Give dabigatran pellets before meals to make sure your child receives the full dose.\n*   Take dabigatran at around the same times every day.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nSwallow the capsules whole with a whole glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not open the capsules and sprinkle the contents on food or into drinks.\n\nDabigatran pellets should be taken with soft foods or apple juice. Do not mix the pellets with milk or foods that contain milk products. To prepare a dose of dabigatran pellets with soft food, sprinkle the entire packet of pellets on soft food such as baby rice cereal (prepared with water), mashed carrots, mashed banana, or applesauce. Give the entire mixture within 30 minutes of sprinkling the pellets on the soft food.\n\nIf your child does not take the entire dose of dabigatran pellets, do not give another dose at this time. Continue with the next dose at the scheduled time.\n\nDabigatran will help prevent strokes and blood clots only as long as you continue to take it. Continue to take dabigatran even if you feel well. Make sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss doses of dabigatran. Do not stop taking dabigatran without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking dabigatran, the risk that you will have clot or a stroke may increase.\n\n---\n\n**Dabigatran: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**How to Take Dabigatran**\n\n*   Swallow the capsules whole with a whole glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n*   Do not open the capsules and sprinkle the contents on food or into drinks.\n\n**Dabigatran Pellets**\n\n*   Dabigatran pellets should be taken with soft foods or apple juice.\n*   Do not mix the pellets with milk or foods that contain milk products.\n*   To prepare a dose of dabigatran pellets with soft food, sprinkle the entire packet of pellets on soft food such as baby rice cereal (prepared with water), mashed carrots, mashed banana, or applesauce.\n*   Give the entire mixture within 30 minutes of sprinkling the pellets on the soft food.\n\n**Administration Instructions**\n\n*   Alternatively, you can give dabigatran pellets to your child along with apple juice. Spoon the pellets into your child's mouth and offer them as much apple juice as necessary to swallow the pellets.\n*   Or you can mix the pellets in small amount of apple juice and have your child drink the entire mixture.\n*   If pellets stick to the cup, add a small amount of apple juice and give it to your child. Repeat as necessary until all of the pellets are gone.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Before taking dabigatran, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to dabigatran, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in dabigatran capsules or pellets.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking dabigatran. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   If you have had a valve in your heart replaced or if you have recently noticed any unusual bruising or bleeding, tell your doctor. Your doctor probably will tell you not to take dabigatran.\n*   If you have or have ever had a bleeding problem, bleeding or an ulcer in your stomach or intestine; or kidney disease, tell your doctor.\n*   If you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding, tell your doctor.

People with multiple sclerosis, longstanding diabetes, or certain other neurologic conditions may also have problems with their bowels. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Constipation (hard bowel movements)\n* Diarrhea (loose bowel movements)\n* Loss of bowel control\n\nA daily bowel care program can help you avoid embarrassment. Work with your health care provider.\n\n**Basic Bowel Program**\n\nDrinking 6 to 8 glasses of water daily allows stool to pass more easily through the colon and helps relieve constipation.\n\nKeeping active helps prevent constipation.

Dalfampridine may be used alone or with other medications that control the symptoms of MS. Dalfampridine is in a class of medications called potassium channel blockers. It works by strengthening the signals sent by the brain through nerves that have been damaged by MS.\n\n\\n\\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDalfampridine comes as an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Space your doses so that you take one dose approximately every 12 hours, and take dalfampridine at around the same times every day.

    "content": "**Dalteparin Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDalteparin is used in combination with aspirin to prevent serious or life-threatening complications from angina (chest pain) and heart attacks. Dalteparin is also used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg), which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung), in people who are on bedrest or who are having hip replacement or abdominal surgery. It is also used treat DVT or PE and prevent it from happening again in children one month of age and older, and in adults with DVT or PE who have cancer. Dalteparin is in a class of medications called anticoagulants ('blood thinners'). It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nIf you have an epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while using a 'blood thinner' such as dalteparin injection, you are at risk for having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause you to become paralyzed. Tell your doctor if you have an epidural catheter that is left in your body, if you recently had spinal anesthesia (administration of pain medication in the area around the spine), or have or have ever had repeated epidural or spinal punctures or problems with these procedures, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: anagrelide (Agrylin); apixaban (Eliquis); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), indomethacin (Indocin, Tivorbex), ketoprofen, and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, others); cilostazol; clopidogrel (Plavix); dabigatran (Pradaxa); dipyridamole (Persantine, in Aggrenox); edoxaban (Savaysa); heparin; prasugrel (Effient); rivaroxaban (Xarelto); ticagrelor (Brilinta); ticlopidine; and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven).

The length of your treatment depends on the condition that you have and how well your body responds to the medication. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n*   For adults: usually given once a day, but may be given twice a day for certain conditions.\n*   For children: usually given twice a day.\n*   To prevent complications from angina and heart attacks: usually given for 5 to 8 days.\n*   To prevent DVT after surgery: usually given on the day of surgery, and for 5 to 10 days after surgery.\n*   To prevent DVT in people who are on bedrest: usually given for 12 to 14 days.\n*   If you have cancer and dalteparin is used to treat and prevent DVT: may need to use the medication for up to 6 months.\n\n**How Do I Give Myself This Medicine?**\n\nDalteparin may be given to you by a nurse or other healthcare provider, or you may be told to inject the medication at home. If you will be using dalteparin at home, a healthcare provider will show you how to inject the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions about where on your body you should inject dalteparin, how to give the injection, what type of syringe to use, or how to dispose of used needles and syringes after you inject the medication.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nDalteparin is also sometimes used to help prevent strokes or blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation or flutter (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly, increasing the chance of clots forming in the body, and possibly causing strokes) who are undergoing cardioversion (a procedure to normalize the heart rhythm). It is also sometimes used to prevent clots in people with prosthetic (surgically inserted) heart valves, or other conditions, when their warfarin (Coumadin) therapy has just been started or has been interrupted. It is also sometimes used to prevent blood clots in certain pregnant women and in people who are having total knee replacement, hip fracture surgery, or other surgeries.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Dalteparin Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What is Dalteparin Injection?**\n\nDalteparin injection is a medication used to prevent blood clots in certain pregnant women and people who are having total knee replacement, hip fracture surgery, or other surgeries.

    "content": "**Dance Your Way to Fitness**\n\nDo you think you can dance? If you are not sure, why not give it a try? Dancing is an exciting and social way to work out. From ballroom to salsa, dancing works your heart, helps build strong bones and muscles, and can improve your balance. Because dancing is so much fun, you may forget you are exercising.\n\n**Health Benefits of Dance**\n\nDancing combines the benefits of aerobic plus weight-bearing exercise. When you dance, you get many physical and mental health benefits, including:\n\n* Better heart health\n* Stronger muscles\n* Better balance and coordination\n* Stronger bones\n* Lower risk of dementia\n* Improved memory\n* Reduced stress\n* More energy\n* Improved mood\n\n**Types of Dance**\n\nThere are dance styles to fit almost anyone and any mood. The kind you choose may depend on what is available in your area and your own taste in dance or music. If you have danced before, you can pick up where you left off. Or you may decide to choose something new.\n\nHere are some types of dance you may want to try:\n\n* Salsa\n* Flamenco\n* Ballroom\n* Tap\n* Swing\n* Square dancing\n* Contra dancing\n* Belly dancing\n* Line dancing\n* Tango\n* Jazz dancing\n* Ballet\n* Modern dance\n* Hip-hop\n* Folk\n* Clogging\n\n**Other Ways to Dance**\n\nIf traditional dance does not appeal to you, there are other ways to get moving to rhythm and music. Many health clubs and fitness centers offer dance workout classes, such as Zumba. These classes mix moves from many styles of dance into a fun, vigorous program for people of all abilities and fitness levels.\n\nDance video games and DVDs are also a way to get dancing in the privacy of your own home. You can buy or borrow them from your local library, find them online, or, just turn up the music at home and dance in your living room.\n\n**How Dancing Compares to Other Exercise**\n\nThe workout you get from dance depends on the type of dancing you do and for how long you do it. For example, ballroom dancing will give you a moderate workout. This is about the same level of exercise you would get from walking briskly or doing water aerobics. Most types of ballroom dancing burn about 260 calories in an hour.\n\nMore intense types of dance, such as salsa or aerobic dancing, will give you a more vigorous workout that is similar to jogging or swimming laps. You can burn up to 500 calories an hour with these types of dance.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nLook for classes at dance schools, health clubs, or community centers. Do not worry if you do not have a partner. Many classes will find you a partner if you do not have one. Some types of dancing, such as tap and line dancing, do not require a partner.\n\nIf you are new to dance or have been inactive, start with a beginner class. A beginner class will be easier to follow and will reduce your risk for injury. As you build your skill and fitness, you can try more advanced classes. You may even want to add new types of dance.\n\nNot sure what type of dance to choose? Ask if you can watch a few classes first. Once you start a class, be patient. It can take some time to learn how to move your body and feet together with the music.\n\n---\n\n**Dance Your Way to Fitness**\n\nAre you thinking about dancing as a way to get in shape?

The kind you choose may depend on what is available in your area and your own taste in dance or music. If you have danced before, you can pick up where you left off. Or you may decide to choose something new.\n\nHere are some types of dance you may want to try:\n\n* Salsa\n* Flamenco\n* Ballroom\n* Tap\n* Swing\n* Square dancing\n* Contra dancing\n* Belly dancing\n* Line dancing\n* Tango\n* Jazz dancing\n* Ballet\n* Modern dance\n* Hip-hop\n* Folk\n* Clogging\n\n**Other Ways to Dance**\n\nIf traditional dance does not appeal to you, there are other ways to get moving to rhythm and music. Many health clubs and fitness centers offer dance workout classes, such as Zumba. These classes mix moves from many styles of dance into a fun, vigorous program for people of all abilities and fitness levels.\n\nDance video games and DVDs are also a way to get dancing in the privacy of your own home. You can buy or borrow them from your local library, find them online, or just turn up the music at home and dance in your living room.\n\n**How Dancing Compares to Other Exercise**\n\nThe workout you get from dance depends on the type of dancing you do and for how long you do it. For example, ballroom dancing will give you a moderate workout, similar to walking briskly or doing water aerobics. Most types of ballroom dancing burn about 260 calories in an hour.\n\nMore intense types of dance, such as salsa or aerobic dancing, will give you a more vigorous workout that is similar to jogging or swimming laps. You can burn up to 500 calories an hour with these types of dance.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nLook for classes at dance schools, health clubs, or community centers. Don't worry if you don't have a partner - many classes will find you one. Some types of dancing, such as tap and line dancing, do not require a partner.\n\nIf you are new to dance or have been inactive, start with a beginner class. A beginner class will be easier to follow and will reduce your risk for injury. As you build your skill and fitness, you can try more advanced classes. You may even want to add new types of dance.\n\nNot sure what type of dance to choose? Ask if you can watch a few classes first. Once you start a class, be patient - it can take some time to learn how to move your body and feet together with the music.\n\n---\n\n**Dance Your Way to Fitness**\n\nAre you looking for a fun way to get in shape? Consider taking a dance class! Not only will it improve your physical fitness, but it can also be a great stress-reliever.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nBefore you begin, make sure to:\n\n*   Start with a beginner class. This will help you learn the basics and reduce your risk of injury.\n*   Be patient. It takes time to learn how to move your body and feet together with the music.\n*   Look for classes at dance schools, health clubs, or community centers. Many classes don't require a partner, so don't worry if you're new to dancing.\n\n**Types of Dance**\n\nThere are many types of dance to choose from, including:\n\n*   Ballet\n*   Jazz\n*   Tap\n*   Line Dancing\n\nFind the type that suits you best and have fun!\n\n**References**\n\nThis article was updated on December 20, 2023, and accessed on September 17, 2024.

Read it carefully and ask questions. You can also visit the FDA website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Daprodustat: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Daprodustat?**\n\nDaprodustat is used to treat anemia (a lower than normal number of red blood cells) in people with chronic kidney failure who have been receiving hemodialysis for at least 4 months.\n\n\\n\\n**How Should I Take This Medicine?**\n\nTake daprodustat exactly as directed by your doctor. It comes as a tablet to take by mouth, usually taken with or without food one time a day. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor will likely have to adjust your dose of daprodustat periodically based on your lab work.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are the Possible Side Effects of Daprodustat?**\n\nUsing daprodustat increases the risk that blood clots will form in or move to the legs, lungs, or brain. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease and if you have ever had a stroke. Call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help if you experience any of the following symptoms: pain, tenderness, redness, warmth, and/or swelling in the legs; coolness or paleness in an arm or leg; shortness of breath; cough that won't go away or that brings up blood; chest pain; sudden trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden confusion; sudden weakness or numbness of an arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) or of the face; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or fainting. If you are being treated with hemodialysis, a blood clot may form in your vascular access.\n\n\\n\\n**What Should I Discuss With My Doctor Before Taking Daprodustat?**\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking daprodustat. Your doctor will adjust your dose so that your hemoglobin level is just high enough that you do not need a red blood cell transfusion. If you receive enough daprodustat to increase your hemoglobin to a normal or near-normal level, there is a greater risk that you will have a stroke or develop serious or life-threatening heart problems.\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens If I Miss A Dose?**\n\nTake daprodustat at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n\\n\\n**How Long Do I Need To Take This Medicine?**\n\nDaprodustat controls anemia but does not cure it. Continue to take daprodustat even if you feel well. Do not stop taking daprodustat without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Daprodustat: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking daprodustat, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to daprodustat, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in daprodustat tablets.

cancers, as well as other conditions where anemia is a problem.\n\n---\n\n**Darbepoetin Alfa Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDarbepoetin alfa injection is used to treat anemia (a lower than normal number of red blood cells) in people with chronic kidney failure (condition in which the kidneys slowly and permanently stop working over a period of time). Darbepoetin alfa injection is also used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy in people with certain types of cancer. Darbepoetin alfa cannot be used in place of a red blood cell transfusion to treat severe anemia and has not been shown to improve tiredness or poor well-being that may be caused by anemia. Darbepoetin alfa is in a class of medications called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). It works by causing the bone marrow (soft tissue inside the bones where blood is made) to make more red blood cells.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDarbepoetin alfa injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin) or intravenously (into a vein). It is usually injected once every 1 to 4 weeks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use darbepoetin alfa injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of darbepoetin alfa injection and adjust your dose depending on your lab results and on how you are feeling. Your doctor may also tell you to stop using darbepoetin alfa injection for a time. Follow these instructions carefully.\n\nDarbepoetin alfa injection will help to control your anemia only as long as you continue to use it. It may take 2-6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of darbepoetin alfa injection. Continue to use darbepoetin alfa injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using darbepoetin alfa injection without talking to your doctor.\n\nAlways inject darbepoetin alfa injection in its own syringe. Do not dilute it with any liquid and do not mix it with any other medications. You can inject darbepoetin alfa injection anywhere on the outer area of your upper arms, your stomach except for the 2-inch (5-centimeter) area around your navel (belly button), the front of your middle thighs, and the upper outer areas of your buttocks. Choose a new spot each time you inject darbepoetin alfa. Do not inject darbepoetin alfa into a spot that is tender, red, bruised, or hard, or that has scars or stretch marks.\n\nIf you are being treated with dialysis (treatment to remove waste from the blood when the kidneys are not working), your doctor may tell you to inject the medication into your venous access port (place where dialysis tubing is connected to your body). Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to inject your medication.\n\nAlways look at darbepoetin alfa injection solution before injecting it. Be sure that the prefilled syringe or vial is labeled with the correct name and strength of medication and an expiration date that has not passed. If you are using a vial, check to be sure that it has a colored cap, and if you are using a prefilled syringe, check that the needle is covered with the grey cover and that the yellow plastic sleeve has not been pulled over the needle. Also check that the solution is clear and colorless and does not contain lumps, flakes, or particles. If there are any problems with your medication, call your pharmacist and do not inject it.\n\nDo not use prefilled syringes, disposable syringes, or vials of darbepoetin alfa injection more than once. Dispose of used syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Darbepoetin Alfa Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**How to Use Darbepoetin Alfa Injection**\n\nContinue to use darbepoetin alfa injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using darbepoetin alfa injection without talking to your doctor.\n\n*   **Administration**: Darbepoetin alfa injections may be given by a doctor or nurse, or your doctor may decide that you can inject darbepoetin alfa yourself, or that you may have a friend or relative give the injections.\n*   **Preparation**: You and the person who will be giving the injections should read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with darbepoetin alfa injection before you use it for the first time at home. Ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it.\n*   **Syringes**: Darbepoetin alfa injection comes in prefilled syringes and in vials to be used with disposable syringes. If you are using vials of darbepoetin alfa injection, your doctor or pharmacist will tell you what type of syringe you should use.\n\n**Important Instructions**\n\n*   **Shaking**: Do not shake darbepoetin alfa injection.

Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of HCV in the body. Ombitasvir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor. It works by stopping the virus that causes hepatitis C from spreading inside the body. Paritaprevir is a protease inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of HCV in the body. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor. It helps to increase the amount of paritaprevir in the body so that the medication will have a greater effect.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou may already be infected with hepatitis B (a virus that infects the liver and may cause severe liver damage) but not have any symptoms of the disease.
