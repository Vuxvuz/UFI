The presence of these proteins indicates inflammation of the central nervous system._\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\n_A sample of CSF is needed. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common way to collect this sample. Other methods for collecting CSF are rarely used, but may be recommended in some cases. They include:_\n\n* _Cisternal puncture_\n* _Ventricular puncture_\n* _Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain._\n\n_After the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for testing._\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\n_This test helps support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

    "content": "**CSF-VDRL Test**\n\nThe CSF-VDRL test is used to help diagnose neurosyphilis. It looks for substances (proteins) called antibodies, which are sometimes produced by the body in reaction to the syphilis-causing bacteria.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA sample of spinal fluid is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for this test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe CSF-VDRL test is done to diagnose syphilis in the brain or spinal cord. Brain and spinal cord involvement is often a sign of late-stage syphilis. Blood screening tests (VDRL and RPR) are better at detecting middle-stage (secondary or latent) syphilis.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA negative result is normal. False-negatives can occur, meaning you can have syphilis even if this test is normal. Therefore, a negative test does not always rule out the infection. Other signs and tests may be used to diagnose neurosyphilis.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive result is abnormal and is a sign of neurosyphilis.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for this test are those related to lumbar puncture, which may include:\n\n* Bleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (subdural hematomas)\n* Discomfort during the test\n* Headache after the test that can last a few hours or days. If headaches last more than a few days (especially when you sit, stand or walk) you might have a CSF-leak.\n* Hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic\n* Infection introduced by the needle going through the skin\n\nYour provider can tell you about any other risks.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nVenereal disease research laboratory slide test - CSF; Neurosyphilis - VDRL\n\n---\n\n**CSF-VDRL Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe CSF-VDRL test, also known as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test - CSF; Neurosyphilis - VDRL, is a diagnostic test used to detect neurosyphilis, a complication of syphilis that affects the central nervous system.\n\n**How is it done?**\n\nThe test involves collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. The CSF is then tested for the presence of antibodies against Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis.\n\n**What does it detect?**\n\nA positive result indicates the presence of neurosyphilis, while a negative result does not rule out the infection. It's essential to note that having syphilis does not necessarily mean you will test positive for neurosyphilis.\n\n**Risks and Side Effects**\n\nThe risks associated with this test are related to the lumbar puncture procedure itself:\n\n*   Bleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (subdural hematomas)\n*   Discomfort during the test\n*   Headache after the test that can last a few hours or days. If headaches persist, it may indicate a CSF-leak.\n*   Hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic\n*   Infection introduced by the needle going through the skin\n\nYour healthcare provider can discuss any other potential risks with you.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nThe test is also known as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test - CSF; Neurosyphilis - VDRL.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article cites several sources, including:\n\n*   Karcher DS, McPherson RA.

    "content": "**CT Angiography - Abdomen and Pelvis**\n\nCT angiography combines a CT scan with the injection of dye to create pictures of the blood vessels in your belly (abdomen) or pelvis area.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\n\nA computer creates separate images of the belly area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.\n\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. The scan should take less than 30 minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays. The contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you also may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\n\nYou may also have to drink a different contrast before the exam. When you drink the contrast will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some have flavors so that they taste a little better. The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.\n\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance. Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.\n\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in patients with poorly functioning kidneys. Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems. Too much weight can damage the scanner. If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), talk to your provider about the weight limit before the test.\n\nYou will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nLying on the hard table may be a little bit uncomfortable. If you have contrast through a vein, you may have a slight burning sensation, metallic taste in your mouth, or warm flushing of your body. These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA CT angiography scan quickly makes detailed pictures of the blood vessels inside your belly or pelvis. This test may be used to look for abnormal widening or ballooning of part of an artery (aneurysm), the source of bleeding that starts in the intestines or elsewhere in the belly or pelvis, masses and tumors in the abdomen or pelvis, including cancer, when needed to help plan treatment.\n\nThe test also may be used before surgery on blood vessels of the liver, kidney transplant, or to check for narrowing of blood vessels that supply the legs and feet that may cause pain in the legs.\n\n---\n\n**CT Angiography - Abdomen and Pelvis**\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.

If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), talk to your provider about the weight limit before the test.\n\nYou will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nLying on the hard table may be a little bit uncomfortable. If you have contrast through a vein, you may have a slight burning sensation, metallic taste in your mouth, or warm flushing of your body. These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA CT angiography scan quickly makes detailed pictures of the blood vessels inside your belly or pelvis. This test may be used to look for abnormal widening or ballooning of part of an artery (aneurysm), the source of bleeding that starts in the intestines or elsewhere in the belly or pelvis, masses and tumors in the abdomen or pelvis, including cancer, when needed to help plan treatment.\n\nThe test also may be used before surgery on blood vessels of the liver, kidney transplant, narrowing of blood vessels that supply the legs and feet that may cause pain in the legs, narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the kidneys that can cause high blood pressure (renovascular hypertension).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nResults are considered normal if no problems are seen.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe abnormal results may show the source of bleeding inside the belly or pelvis, narrowing of the artery that supplies the kidneys, narrowing of arteries that supply the intestines, narrowing of arteries that supply the legs, ballooning or swelling of an artery (aneurysm), including the aorta, a tear in the wall of the aorta.\n\n---\n\n**Computed Tomography Angiography - Abdomen and Pelvis**\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe abnormal results may show:\n\n* The source of bleeding inside the belly or pelvis\n* Narrowing of the artery that supplies the kidneys\n* Narrowing of arteries that supply the intestines\n* Narrowing of arteries that supply the legs\n* Ballooning or swelling of an artery (aneurysm), including the aorta\n* A tear in the wall of the aorta\n\n**Risks**\n\nCT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.\n\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\n\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if you get this type of contrast.\n\nIf you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\n\nYour kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\n\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nComputed tomography angiography - abdomen and pelvis; CTA - abdomen and pelvis; Renal artery - CTA; Aortic - CTA; Mesenteric CTA; PAD - CTA; PVD - CTA; Peripheral vascular disease - CTA; Peripheral artery disease; CTA; Claudication - CTA\n\n**Images**\n\nCT scan\n\n**References**\n\nCarucci LR.

Contrast helps certain areas show up better on x-rays.\n\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\n\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medications before the test in order to safely receive it.\n\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medication metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra precautions.\n\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in people with poorly functioning kidneys. Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\n\nToo much weight can damage the scanner. If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), talk to your provider about the weight limit before the test.\n\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe x-rays produced by the CT scan are painless. Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\n\nIf you have contrast through a vein, you may have:\n\n*   Slight burning feeling\n*   Metallic taste in your mouth\n*   Warm flushing of your body\n\nThis is normal and usually goes away within a few seconds.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA chest CT angiogram may be done:\n\n*   For symptoms that suggest blood clots in the lungs, such as chest pain, rapid breathing, or shortness of breath\n*   After a chest injury or trauma\n*   Before surgery in the lung or chest\n*   To look for a possible site to insert a catheter for hemodialysis\n*   For swelling of the face or upper arms that cannot be explained\n*   To look for a suspected birth defect of the aorta or other blood vessels in the chest\n*   To look for a widening of an artery (aneurysm)\n*   To look for a tear in an artery (dissection)\n*   To assess certain blood vessels around the heart\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nResults are considered normal if no problems are seen.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA chest CT may show many disorders of the heart, lungs, or chest area, including:\n\n*   Suspected blockage of the superior vena cava\n*   Blood clot(s) in the lungs\n*   Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the lungs or chest, such as aortic arch syndrome\n*   Aortic aneurysm (in the chest area), also called thoracic aortic aneurysm\n*   Narrowing of part of the major artery leading out of the heart (aorta)\n*   Tear in the wall of an artery (dissection)\n*   Inflammation of the blood vessel walls (vasculitis)\n*   Problems with pulmonary vessels, including narrowing of pulmonary veins or abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins (arteriovenous malformations)\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of CT scans include:\n\n*   Being exposed to radiation\n*   Allergic reaction to contrast dye\n*   Damage to kidneys from contrast dye\n\nCT scans use more radiation than regular x-rays.

Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\n\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if you get this type of contrast.\n\nIf you absolutely must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) and/or steroids before the test.\n\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to receive extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.\n\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis.

If contrast is used, you may experience a slight burning feeling, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body.\n\n**Why is a CT Scan Performed?**\n\nA CT scan creates detailed pictures of the body, including the brain, chest, spine, and abdomen. The test may be used to:\n\n* Diagnose an infection\n* Guide a doctor to the right area during a biopsy\n* Identify masses and tumors, including cancer\n* Study blood vessels\n\n**What are the Risks of Having a CT Scan?**\n\nRisks of having a CT scan include:\n\n* Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n* Damage to kidney function from the contrast dye\n* Exposure to radiation\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about a CT scan, be sure to talk to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**\n\n**What is a CT scan?**\n\nA CT scan, also known as a CAT scan or computed axial tomography scan, is a medical imaging procedure that uses computer-processed combinations of multiple X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional images of the body.\n\n**How does a CT scan work?**\n\nIn a CT scan, the patient lies on a table that slides into a large, doughnut-shaped machine. The machine rotates around the patient, taking X-ray images from many different angles. A computer then uses these images to create detailed, three-dimensional pictures of the inside of the body.\n\n**What are the risks of having a CT scan?**\n\nThe main risk of having a CT scan is exposure to radiation. While the risk from any one scan is small, having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. Additionally, some people have allergies to contrast dye, which can cause anaphylaxis in rare cases.\n\n**What are the benefits of having a CT scan?**\n\nCT scans provide detailed images of the inside of the body, allowing doctors to diagnose and treat a wide range of medical conditions, from injuries and tumors to infections and diseases. They are particularly useful for examining organs and tissues that are difficult to reach with other imaging techniques.\n\n**How can I prepare for a CT scan?**\n\nBefore having a CT scan, you should inform your doctor if you have any allergies or sensitivities, especially to contrast dye. You may also be asked to remove any jewelry or clothing that could interfere with the scan. Depending on the type of scan and the area of the body being imaged, you may be given instructions on how to prepare, such as fasting or avoiding certain medications.\n\n**What are some common uses for CT scans?**\n\nCT scans are used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, including:\n\n* Injuries and trauma\n* Tumors and cancer\n* Infections and diseases\n* Organ damage and dysfunction\n* Vascular disorders\n\nThey are particularly useful for examining organs and tissues that are difficult to reach with other imaging techniques.\n\n**References**\n\nBlankensteijn JD, Lely RJ.

    "content": "**Cabergoline**\n\n*pronounced as (ka ber' goe leen)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCabergoline is used to treat hyperprolactinemia (high levels of prolactin, a natural substance that helps breast-feeding women produce milk but can cause symptoms such as infertility, sexual problems, and bone loss in women who are not breast-feeding or men). Cabergoline is in a class of medications called dopamine receptor agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of prolactin in the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCabergoline comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a week. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cabergoline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of cabergoline and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 4 weeks.\n\nDo not stop taking cabergoline without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCabergoline is also sometimes used to treat Parkinson's disease (a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking cabergoline,\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cabergoline, ergot medications such as bromocriptine (Parlodel); dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergoloid mesylates (Hydergine), ergotamine (in Cafergot, in Ergomar), methylergonovine (Methergine), methysergide (Sansert), and pergolide (Permax); any other medications, or any of the ingredients in cabergoline tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cabergoline.

This is more common when you first start taking cabergoline. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n\nYou should know that some people treated with cabergoline have developed gambling problems or other intense urges or behaviors that were compulsive or unusual for them, such as increased sexual urges or behaviors. There is not enough information to tell whether the people developed these problems because they took the medication or for other reasons. Call your doctor if you have an urge to gamble that is difficult to control, you have intense urges, or you are unable to control your behavior. Tell your family members about this risk so that they can call the doctor even if you do not realize that your gambling or any other intense urges or unusual behaviors have become a problem.\n\n---\n\n**Cabergoline: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n*Tell Your Doctor*\n\n- Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cabergoline.

    "content": "**Caffeine in the Diet**\n\nCaffeine is a substance found in certain plants and can also be man-made and added to foods. It's a central nervous system stimulant and a diuretic.\n\n**Function**\n\nCaffeine is absorbed quickly into the brain, but it doesn't collect in the bloodstream or get stored in the body. It leaves the body through urine many hours after consumption.\n\nThere's no nutritional need for caffeine, and it can be avoided in the diet.\n\nCaffeine stimulates the brain and nervous system, but it won't reduce the effects of alcohol. It may be used for short-term relief of fatigue or drowsiness.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nCaffeine is widely consumed:\n\n* Found naturally in tea leaves, kola nuts, coffee, and cocoa beans\n* Added to processed foods:\n\t+ Coffee: 75-100 mg per 6 oz cup, 40 mg per 1 oz espresso\n\t+ Tea: 60-100 mg per 16 oz cup (black or green)\n\t+ Chocolate: 10 mg per oz (sweet, semisweet, or dark), 58 mg per oz (unsweetened baking chocolate)\n\t+ Most colas: 45 mg in a 12 oz drink\n\t+ Candies, energy drinks, snacks, gum: 40-100 mg per serving\n\nCaffeine is often added to over-the-counter medicines like pain relievers, diet pills, and cold medicines. It has no flavor and can be removed from foods through decaffeination.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nCaffeine can lead to:\n\n* Fast heart rate\n* Anxiety\n* Difficulty sleeping\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Restlessness\n* Tremors\n* Urinating more often\n\nStopping caffeine suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, including:\n\n* Drowsiness\n* Headaches\n* Irritability\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Health Effects**\n\nLarge amounts of caffeine may stop calcium absorption, leading to thinning bones (osteoporosis). Caffeine may also lead to painful, lumpy breasts (fibrocystic disease).\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe American Medical Association recommends moderate tea or coffee drinking is not likely to be harmful as long as you have good health habits.\n\n* Four 8 oz cups of brewed or drip coffee (~400 mg caffeine) or\n* Five servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea (~165-235 mg caffeine) per day is an average or moderate amount for most people.\n* Consuming very large amounts (>1200 mg) within a short time may lead to toxic effects like seizures.\n\nLimit your caffeine intake if:\n\n* You're prone to stress, anxiety, or sleep problems\n* You have painful, lumpy breasts\n* You have acid reflux or stomach ulcers\n* You have high blood pressure that doesn't respond to medicine\n* You have fast or irregular heart rhythms\n* You have chronic headaches\n\nWatch how much caffeine a child gets. There are no specific guidelines for caffeine consumption in children and teens. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages its use, especially energy drinks.\n\n**Pregnancy**\n\nSmall amounts of caffeine during pregnancy are safe. Avoid large amounts. Caffeine can travel through the bloodstream to the placenta and have a negative effect on a developing baby. Limit your intake to less than 200 mg per day.\n\n---\n\n**Health Effects of Caffeine**\n\nLarge amounts of caffeine may stop the absorption of calcium and lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis).\nCaffeine may lead to painful, lumpy breasts (fibrocystic disease).\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs states that moderate tea or coffee drinking is not likely to be harmful to your health as long as you have other good health habits.\n\nFour 8 ounce cups (1 liter) of brewed or drip coffee (about 400 mg of caffeine) or 5 servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea (about 165 to 235 mg of caffeine) per day is an average or moderate amount of caffeine for most people. Consuming very large amounts of caffeine (over 1200 mg) within a short time period may lead to toxic effects such as seizures.\n\nYou may want to limit your caffeine intake if:\n\n* You are prone to stress, anxiety, or sleep problems.\n* You are a woman with painful, lumpy breasts.\n* You have acid reflux or stomach ulcers.\n* You have high blood pressure that does get lower with medicine.\n* You have problems with fast or irregular heart rhythms.\n* You have chronic headaches.\n\n**Caffeine in Children and Pregnancy**\n\nWatch how much caffeine a child gets. There are currently no specific guidelines for caffeine consumption in children and teens, The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages its use, especially energy drinks.\n\nThese drinks often contain large amounts of caffeine as well as other stimulants, which can cause sleep problems, nervousness, and stomach upset.\n\nSmall amounts of caffeine during pregnancy are safe. Avoid large amounts. Caffeine, like alcohol, travels through your bloodstream to the placenta. Excessive caffeine intake can have a negative effect on a developing baby.\n\n---\n\n**Caffeine in the Diet**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nCaffeine can lead to:\n\n*   A fast heart rate\n*   Anxiety\n*   Difficulty sleeping\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Restlessness\n*   Tremors\n*   Urinating more often\n\nStopping caffeine suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. These may include:\n\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Headaches\n*   Irritability\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Health Effects**\n\nThere has been much research on the health effects of caffeine.\n\nLarge amounts of caffeine may stop the absorption of calcium and lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis).\n\nCaffeine may lead to painful, lumpy breasts (fibrocystic disease).\n\nCaffeine may harm a child's nutrition if drinks with caffeine replace healthy drinks such as milk. Caffeine cuts down on appetite so a child who consumes caffeine may eat less. The United States has not developed guidelines for caffeine intake by children.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs states that moderate tea or coffee drinking is not likely to be harmful to your health as long as you have other good health habits.\n\nFour 8 ounce cups (1 liter) of brewed or drip coffee (about 400 mg of caffeine) or 5 servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea (about 165 to 235 mg of caffeine) per day is an average or moderate amount of caffeine for most people. Consuming very large amounts of caffeine (over 1200 mg) within a short time period may lead to toxic effects such as seizures.\n\nYou may want to limit your caffeine intake if:\n\n*   You are prone to stress, anxiety, or sleep problems.\n*   You are a woman with painful, lumpy breasts.\n*   You have acid reflux or stomach ulcers.\n*   You have high blood pressure that does get lower with medicine.\n*   You have problems with fast or irregular heart rhythms.\n*   You have chronic headaches.\n\nWatch how much caffeine a child gets.\n\nThere are currently no specific guidelines for caffeine consumption in children and teens, The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages its use, especially energy drinks.\n\nThese drinks often contain large amounts of caffeine as well as other stimulants, which can cause sleep problems, as well as nervousness and stomach upset.\n\nSmall amounts of caffeine during pregnancy are safe. Avoid large amounts.\n\nCaffeine, like alcohol, travels through your bloodstream to the placenta. Excessive caffeine intake can have a negative effect on a developing baby. Caffeine is a stimulant, so it increases your heart rate and metabolism. Both of these can affect the baby.\n\nDuring pregnancy, it is fine to have 1 or 2 small cups (240 to 480 milliliters) of caffeinated coffee or tea a day. However, limit your intake to less than 200 mg per day. Many drugs will interact with caffeine. Talk to your health care provider about possible interactions with the medicines you take.\n\nIf you are trying to cut back on caffeine, reduce your intake slowly to prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Caffeine in the Diet**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Much Caffeine is Too Much?**\n\nThe US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has guidelines for safe caffeine consumption. According to their website, \"spilling the beans\" - or exceeding 400mg of caffeine per day - can lead to negative health effects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Caffeine and Health**\n\nResearch suggests that moderate caffeine intake may have benefits for certain health conditions, such as:\n\n*   **Headache**: Caffeine has been shown to help alleviate headache symptoms.\n*   **Hypertension**: Moderate caffeine consumption may lower blood pressure in some individuals.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that excessive caffeine intake can lead to negative effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Caffeine in the Diet**\n\nWhen considering caffeine intake, it's crucial to be aware of hidden sources of caffeine in foods and beverages. Some examples include:\n\n*   **Sports drinks**: Many sports drinks contain caffeine, which may not be immediately apparent.\n*   **Energy drinks**: Energy drinks often contain high levels of caffeine, making them a potential concern for excessive intake.\n\nBy being informed about caffeine content and consumption guidelines, individuals can make healthier choices regarding their diet.",

It:\n\n*   Stimulates your central nervous system, making you feel more awake and giving you a boost of energy\n*   Is a diuretic, helping your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more\n*   Increases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburn\n*   May interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body\n*   Increases your blood pressure\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Side Effects from Too Much Caffeine?**\n\nFor most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as:\n\n*   Restlessness and shakiness\n*   Insomnia\n*   Headaches\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fast heart rate\n*   Dehydration\n*   Anxiety\n*   Dependency\n\nSome people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Should Avoid or Limit Caffeine?**\n\nYou should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you:\n\n*   Are pregnant, since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby.\n*   Are breastfeeding, since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby.\n*   Have sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n*   Have migraines or other chronic headaches.\n*   Have anxiety.\n*   Have GERD or ulcers.\n*   Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat).\n*   Have high blood pressure.\n*   Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics, asthma medicines, and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take.\n*   Are a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Caffeine Withdrawal?**\n\nIf you have been consuming caffeine on a regular basis and then suddenly stop, you may have caffeine withdrawal.

The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.\n\nCompanies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.\n\nSometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions.\n\n**Who should avoid or limit caffeine?**\n\nYou should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you:\n\n* Are pregnant, since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby.\n* Are breastfeeding, since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby.\n* Have sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n* Have migraines or other chronic headaches.\n* Have anxiety.\n* Have GERD or ulcers.\n* Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat).\n* Have high blood pressure.\n* Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics, asthma medicines, and heart medicines.

You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.\n\n**What are energy drinks?**\n\nEnergy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.\n\nCompanies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.\n\nSometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions.\n\n**Who should avoid or limit caffeine?**\n\nYou should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you:\n\n* Are pregnant, since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby.\n* Are breastfeeding, since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby.\n* Have sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n* Have migraines or other chronic headaches.\n* Have anxiety.\n* Have GERD or ulcers.\n* Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat).\n* Have high blood pressure.\n* Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics, asthma medicines, and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take.\n* Are a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine.\n\n**What is caffeine withdrawal?**\n\nIf you have been consuming caffeine on a regular basis and then suddenly stop, you may have caffeine withdrawal. Symptoms can include:\n\n* Headaches\n* Drowsiness\n* Irritability\n* Nausea\n* Trouble concentrating\n\nThese symptoms usually go away after a couple of days.\n\n**How does caffeine affect the body?**\n\nCaffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism.

    "content": "**Calcification**\n\nCalcification is a process in which calcium builds up in body tissue, causing the tissue to harden. This can be a normal or abnormal process.\n\n**Information**\n\nNinety-nine percent of calcium entering the body is deposited in bones and teeth. The remaining calcium dissolves in the blood.\n\nWhen a disorder affects the balance between calcium and certain chemicals in the body, calcium can be deposited in other parts of the body, such as the arteries, kidneys, lungs, and brain. Calcium deposits can cause problems with how these blood vessels and organs work. Calcifications can usually be seen on x-rays.

    "content": "**Calcipotriene Topical**\n\npronounced as (kal si poe trye' een)\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCalcipotriene is used to treat psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form due to increased production of skin cells on some areas of the body). Calcipotriene is in a class of medications called synthetic vitamin D3 derivatives. It works by slowing the excessive production of skin cells.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCalcipotriene comes as a cream to apply to the skin and as a solution (liquid) to apply to the scalp. The cream and solution are usually applied two times a day. Use calcipotriene at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use calcipotriene exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nCalcipotriene controls psoriasis but does not cure it. You may see some improvement in your condition after 2 weeks, but it may take up to 8 weeks before you feel the full benefit of calcipotriene.\n\nDo not apply calcipotriene cream to the face.\n\nCalcipotriene solution may catch fire. Do not use this medication near heat or an open flame, such as a cigarette.\n\nTo use the cream, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands.\n*   Apply a thin layer of cream to the area to be treated.

Be careful not to get the solution on your forehead or other areas of your face, especially in or near your eyes, nose, or mouth.\n*   Rub the solution into the lesion gently.\n*   Wash your hands.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Calcipotriene Topical: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know before using this medication?**\n\n*   Calcipotriene may make your skin sensitive to sunlight. Be sure to protect yourself from the sun by staying out of it, wearing protective clothing (such as a hat), sunglasses, and sunscreen.\n*   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\n*   Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra cream or solution to make up for a missed dose.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Calcipotriene may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n    *   itching\n    *   redness\n    *   worsening of psoriasis\n    *   burning\n    *   stinging or tingling of skin\n    *   dry skin\n*   Some side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Calcitonin Test**\n\n**What is a Calcitonin Test?**\n\nA calcitonin test measures the level of calcitonin in a sample of your blood. Calcitonin is a hormone that helps control the level of calcium in your blood. It's made in your thyroid gland by cells called \"C cells.\" Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck.\n\n**What Does a High Calcitonin Level Mean?**\n\nA high calcitonin level may be a sign of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or C-cell hyperplasia. MTC is a rare cancer that happens when C cells in your thyroid grow out of control. C-cell hyperplasia is a rare condition that causes abnormal growth of C cells in your thyroid.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Calcitonin Test?**\n\nYou may need a calcitonin test if you have symptoms of medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia, such as:\n\n* A lump in the front of your neck\n* Swollen lymph nodes in your neck (also called \"swollen glands\")\n* Pain in your throat\n* Trouble swallowing or breathing\n* A change in your voice, such as hoarseness\n* A long-lasting cough when you don't have a cold\n* Diarrhea\n\nYou may also need a calcitonin test if you have symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), which can affect your thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid glands. Symptoms depend on which glands are affected.\n\n**What Happens During a Calcitonin Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe meaning of your calcitonin test results depends on the reason you were tested. If you had a calcitonin test:\n\n* To help diagnose or screen for medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia:\n\t+ A normal calcitonin level may mean that you don't have either condition, but it doesn't rule them out.\n\t+ A high calcitonin level means that the C cells in your thyroid are making too much calcitonin. The higher the level, the more likely it is that you have medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia.\n* To monitor treatment for medullary thyroid cancer or to check whether cancer has come back after treatment:\n\t+ Calcitonin levels that decrease and stay low over time usually mean that your treatment is helping.\n\t+ A calcitonin level that decreases but is still higher than normal may mean that you still have some cancer tissue left in your body.

    "content": "**Calcitonin Blood Test**\n\nThe calcitonin blood test measures the level of the hormone calcitonin in the blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is usually no special preparation needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCalcitonin is a hormone produced in C cells of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located inside the front of your lower neck above the collar bones. Calcitonin helps control the breakdown and rebuilding of bone.\n\nA common reason to have the test is if you have had surgery to remove a thyroid tumor called medullary thyroid cancer. The test allows your health care provider to evaluate if the tumor has spread (metastasized) or has come back (tumor recurrence).\n\nYour provider may also order a calcitonin test when you have symptoms of medullary cancer of the thyroid, or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, or a family history of these conditions. Calcitonin may also be higher in other tumors, such as:\n\n* Insulinoma (tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin)\n* Lung cancer\n* VIPoma (cancer that usually grows from islet cells in the pancreas)\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal value is less than 25 pg/mL (25 picograms per milliliter) for males and less than 20 pg/mL for females.\n\nWomen and men can have different normal values, with men having higher values.\n\nSometimes, calcitonin in the blood is checked several times after you are given a shot (injection) of a special medicine that stimulates calcitonin production.\n\nYou will need this extra test if your baseline calcitonin is normal, but your provider suspects you have medullary cancer of the thyroid.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher-than-normal level may indicate:\n\n* Insulinoma\n* Lung cancer\n* Medullary cancer of thyroid (most common)\n* VIPoma\n\nHigher-than-normal levels of calcitonin can also occur in people with kidney disease, smokers, and higher body weight. Also, it increases when taking certain medicines to stop stomach acid production.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum calcitonin\n\n**References**\n\nBringhurst FR, Demay MB, Kronenberg HM.

    "content": "**Calcitriol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCalcitriol is used to treat and prevent low levels of calcium and bone disease in patients whose kidneys or parathyroid glands are not working normally. It is also used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (a condition in which the body produces too much parathyroid hormone) and metabolic bone disease in people with kidney disease.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCalcitriol comes as a capsule and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day or once every other day in the morning with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nTake calcitriol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of calcitriol and may gradually increase your dose depending on your body's response to calcitriol.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCalcitriol is also sometimes used to treat rickets (softening and weakening of bones in children caused by lack of vitamin D), osteomalacia (softening and weakening of bones in adults caused by lack of vitamin D), and familial hypophosphatemia (rickets or osteomalacia caused by decreased ability to break down vitamin D in the body). Calcitriol is also sometimes used to increase the amount of calcium in the blood of premature babies. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Consult your doctor before taking calcitriol if you have kidney disease, liver disease, or high levels of calcium in your blood.\n*   Calcitriol may interact with other medications, including antacids and minerals. Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of calcitriol, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take extra doses to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCalcitriol may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, or constipation. If you experience any of these symptoms, inform your doctor. In rare cases, calcitriol may cause more serious side effects like high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) or kidney stones.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore calcitriol at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze calcitriol. Dispose of unused calcitriol capsules safely, following your doctor's instructions.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much calcitriol or experience an overdose, seek medical attention immediately. Symptoms of an overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, or constipation.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCalcitriol is a prescription medication that comes in capsule and solution forms. It is available by prescription only. Consult your doctor before taking calcitriol if you have any medical conditions or allergies.\n\n---\n\n**Calcitriol: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking calcitriol, tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking calcitriol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with calcitriol: other vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements, antacids containing magnesium, magnesium supplements or laxatives containing magnesium. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking calcitriol. Do not start any of these medications while taking calcitriol without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have high levels of calcium. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take calcitriol.\n\nTell your doctor if you have recently had surgery or are unable to move around for any reason and if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking calcitriol, call your doctor. You should not breastfeed while you are taking calcitriol.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nCalcitriol will work only if you get the right amount of calcium from the foods you eat. If you get too much calcium from foods, you may experience serious side effects of calcitriol, and if you do not get enough calcium from foods, calcitriol will not control your condition. Your doctor will tell you which foods are good sources of these nutrients and how many servings you need each day. If you find it difficult to eat enough of these foods, tell your doctor. In that case, your doctor can prescribe or recommend a supplement.\n\nIf you are being treated with dialysis (process of cleaning the blood by passing it through a machine), your doctor may also prescribe a low-phosphate diet. Follow these directions carefully.\n\nIf you do not have kidney disease, you should drink plenty of fluids while taking calcitriol. If you have kidney disease, talk to your doctor about how much fluid you should drink each day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nSome side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* feeling tired\n* difficulty thinking clearly\n* loss of appetite\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* constipation\n* increased thirst\n* increased urination\n* or weight loss\n* weakness\n* headache\n* upset stomach\n* dry mouth\n* muscle pain\n* bone pain\n* metallic taste in mouth\n* difficult or painful urination\n* changes in vision\n* lack of interest in the things around you\n* hallucination (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist)\n* fever or chills\n* stomach pain\n* pale, fatty stools\n* yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* runny nose\n* decreased sexual desire\n* irregular heartbeat\n* rash\n* hives\n* itching\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n\n---\n\n**Calcitriol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the possible side effects of this medication?**\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

This measurement is important because it reflects the amount of calcium that is available for physiological processes and is not just a reflection of total calcium levels.\n\n**Why is calcium ionized important?**\n\nMeasuring calcium ionized is important because it can help diagnose and monitor conditions such as hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels) and hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). It can also help identify underlying causes of these conditions, such as parathyroid gland disorders.\n\n**How is calcium ionized measured?**\n\nCalcium ionized is typically measured using a blood test.

    "content": "**Calcium Acetate**\n\n*pronounced as (kal' see um as' e tate)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCalcium acetate is used to control high blood levels of phosphorus in people with kidney disease who are on dialysis (medical treatment to clean the blood when the kidneys are not working properly). Calcium acetate is in a class of medications called phosphate binders. It binds phosphorus that you get from foods in your diet and prevents it from being absorbed into your blood stream.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCalcium acetate comes as a capsule, tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken along with each meal (e.g., 3 times a day if you eat 3 meals a day) as directed by your doctor. Take calcium acetate at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take calcium acetate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are using the solution, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the dosing cup that comes with the medication to measure your dose. Ask your pharmacist if you have any question about how much medication you should take or how to use the dosing cup.\n\nYour doctor will probably adjust your dose based on your phosphorus blood levels, not more often than once every 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking calcium acetate,\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to calcium acetate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in calcium acetate preparations.

    "content": "**Calcium Blood Test**\n\nA calcium blood test measures the amount of calcium in your blood. Too much or too little calcium in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of medical conditions, such as bone disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disorders, kidney disease, and other conditions.\n\n**What is Calcium?**\n\nCalcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. About 1% of the calcium in your body is in your blood. The rest is stored in your bones and teeth. Having the right amount of calcium in your blood is necessary for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work properly. It also helps blood vessels move blood throughout your body and helps release hormones that affect many body functions.\n\n**What is a Calcium Blood Test Used For?**\n\nA blood calcium test is used to check your general health. It's also used to help diagnose or monitor many medical conditions, including those that affect your bones, kidneys, digestive system, thyroid, and parathyroid glands.\n\n**Types of Calcium Blood Tests**\n\nThere are two types of calcium blood tests:\n\n*   Total calcium test measures all the calcium in your blood.\n*   Ionized calcium test measures only the \"free calcium\" in your blood that isn't attached to proteins.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Calcium Blood Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may have ordered a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes a calcium blood test, as part of your routine checkup. You may also have this test to diagnose or monitor conditions that can affect your blood calcium or if you have symptoms of abnormal calcium levels.\n\n**Symptoms of High and Low Calcium Levels**\n\nHigh calcium levels may cause:\n\n*   Digestive symptoms such as constipation, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, increased thirst, urinating more than usual, kidney stones, bone, joint, and muscle symptoms such as weakness, aches, and pains, fatigue, a change in mental health such as depression or confusion.\n\nLow calcium levels may cause:\n\n*   Dry skin, coarse hair, and nails that easily break (after a long period of low levels), muscle cramps, spasms, or stiffness, tingling in the lips, tongue, fingers, and feet, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), seizures, if calcium levels are extremely low.\n\n**What Happens During a Calcium Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for a calcium blood test or a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel. You may need to stop taking certain medicines or supplements, such as vitamin D, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults from a total calcium test that are higher than normal (hypercalcemia) may be a sign of many types of conditions, such as:\n\n*   Overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism), a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone\n*   Certain types of cancer, including cancer that spreads to the bone\n*   Bone disorders, including Paget's disease of bone\n*   Taking too much vitamin D over a long period of time\n\nResults from a total calcium test that are lower than normal (hypocalcemia) may be a sign of:\n\n*   Low blood protein levels, which may be caused by liver disease or malnutrition\n*   Underactive parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism), a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone\n*   Too little calcium in your diet\n*   Too little vitamin D or magnesium\n*   Pancreatitis\n*   Kidney disease\n\nIf your results from a total calcium blood test are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your diet and certain medicines can affect your calcium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests, Reference Ranges, and Understanding Results**\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about a calcium blood test?\n\nA calcium blood test does not tell you how much calcium is in your bones. Bone health can be measured with a type of x-ray called a bone density scan, or DEXA scan. A DEXA scan measures the mineral content, including calcium, and other aspects of your bones.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium Blood Test**\n\nA calcium blood test is used to check your general health. It's also used to help diagnose or monitor many medical conditions, including those that affect your bones, kidneys, digestive system, thyroid, and parathyroid glands.\n\n**Types of Calcium Blood Tests**\n\nThere are two types of calcium blood tests that measure different forms of blood calcium:\n\n*   Total calcium test measures all the calcium in your blood.\n*   Ionized calcium test measures only the \"free calcium\" in your blood that isn't attached to proteins.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Calcium Blood Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may have ordered a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes a calcium blood test, as part of your routine checkup.

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults from a total calcium test that are higher than normal (hypercalcemia) may be a sign of many types of conditions, such as overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism), certain types of cancer, bone disorders, and taking too much vitamin D over a long period of time.\n\nResults from a total calcium test that are lower than normal (hypocalcemia) may be a sign of low blood protein levels, underactive parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism), too little calcium in your diet, too little vitamin D or magnesium, pancreatitis, and kidney disease.\n\nIf your results from a total calcium blood test are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your diet and certain medicines can affect your calcium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium Blood Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/3)**\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a calcium blood test?**\n\nA calcium blood test does not tell you how much calcium is in your bones. Bone health can be measured with a type of x-ray called a bone density scan, or DEXA scan. A DEXA scan measures the mineral content, including calcium, and other aspects of your bones.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing [Internet].

    "content": "**Calcium and Bones**\n\nThe mineral calcium helps your muscles, nerves, and cells work normally.\n\nYour body also needs calcium (as well as phosphorus) to make healthy bones. Bones are the main storage site of calcium in the body.\n\nYour body cannot make calcium. The body only gets the calcium it needs through the food you eat, or from supplements. If you do not get enough calcium in your diet, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium, your bones can get weak or will not grow properly.\n\n**Bone Health**\n\nYour bones are a living organ. Bones are constantly being remodeled with old bone being resorbed and new bone being formed. It takes about 10 years for all the bone in your body to be renewed. That is why paying attention to bone health is important in adults and not just in growing children.\n\nBone density refers to how much calcium and other minerals are present in a section of your bone. Bone density is highest between ages 25 and 35. It goes down as you get older. This can result in brittle, fragile bones that can break easily, even without a fall or other injury.\n\n**Nutrition and Supplements**\n\nThe digestive system normally absorbs only 15% to 20% of the calcium taken in your diet. Vitamin D is the hormone that helps the gut absorb more calcium.\n\nMany older adults have common risks that make bone health worse. Calcium intake in the diet (mainly in milk, cheese, and yogurt) may be low. Vitamin D levels may also be low which can make gut calcium absorption low. In many adults, hormonal signals have to take some calcium out of the bones every day to keep blood calcium levels normal. This contributes to bone loss.\n\nBecause of this, as you age, your body still needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong. Most experts recommend at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 to 1,000 international units of vitamin D a day. Your health care provider may recommend a supplement to give you the calcium and vitamin D you need.\n\nSome recommendations call for much higher doses of vitamin D, but many experts feel that high doses of vitamin D are not safe for everyone. In addition, very high amounts of calcium in your diet can lead to health problems such as constipation, kidney stones, and kidney damage. If you are concerned about bone health, be sure to discuss with your provider whether supplements of calcium and Vitamin D are a good choice for you.\n\n**Dietary Recommendations**\n\nFollow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. These nutrients will not completely stop bone loss, but they will help ensure that your body has the materials it needs to build bones. Remaining fit and active can also protect bones and keep them stronger. Avoiding smoking also protects bones and keeps them stronger.\n\nHigh-calcium foods include:\n\n*   Milk\n*   Cheese\n*   Ice cream\n*   Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach and collard greens\n*   Salmon\n*   Sardines (with the bones)\n*   Tofu\n*   Yogurt\n\n---\n\n**Calcium and Bones**\n\nThe mineral calcium helps your muscles, nerves, and cells work normally.\n\nYour body also needs calcium (as well as phosphorus) to make healthy bones.

About one half of the calcium in the blood is attached to proteins, mainly albumin.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. These medicines may include:\n\n*   Calcium salts (may be found in nutritional supplements or antacids)\n*   Lithium\n*   Thiazide diuretics (water pills)\n*   Levothyroxine\n*   Vitamin D\n\nDrinking too much milk (2 or more quarts or 2 liters a day or a large amount of other dairy products) or taking too much vitamin D as a dietary supplement can also increase blood calcium levels.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAll cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function, and helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of:\n\n*   Certain bone diseases\n*   Certain cancers, such as multiple myeloma, or a cancer of the breast, lung, neck, and kidney\n*   Chronic kidney disease\n*   Chronic liver disease\n*   Disorders of the parathyroid glands (hormone made by these glands controls calcium and vitamin D levels in the blood)\n*   Disorders that affect how your intestines absorb nutrients (intestinal malabsorption)\n*   High vitamin D blood level\n*   Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or taking too much thyroid hormone medicine\n\nYour provider may also order this test if you have been on bed rest for a long time.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values range from 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL (0.47 to 0.57 millimol/L).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher than normal level may be due to a number of health conditions. Common causes include:\n\n*   Being on bed rest for a long time.\n*   Consuming too much calcium or vitamin D.\n*   Hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid glands make too much of their hormone; sometimes associated with a low vitamin D level).\n*   Infections that cause granulomas such as tuberculosis and certain fungal and mycobacterial infections.\n*   Multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma and certain other cancers.\n*   Metastatic bone tumor (bone cancer that has spread).\n*   Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or too much thyroid hormone replacement medicine.\n*   Paget disease. Abnormal bone destruction and regrowth, causing deformity of the affected bones.\n*   Sarcoidosis. Lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues become swollen or inflamed.\n*   Tumors producing a parathyroid hormone-like substance.\n*   Use of certain medicines such as lithium, tamoxifen, and thiazides.\n\nA lower than normal levels may be due to:\n\n*   Disorders that affect absorption of nutrients from the intestines (intestinal malabsorption)\n*   Hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid glands do not make enough of their hormone)\n*   Kidney insufficiency or failure\n*   Low blood level of albumin\n*   Liver disease\n*   Magnesium deficiency\n*   Pancreatitis\n*   Vitamin D deficiency\n\n---\n\n**Calcium Blood Test**\n\nThe calcium blood test measures the level of calcium in the blood.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher than normal level may be due to:\n\n* Being on bed rest for a long time\n* Consuming too much calcium or vitamin D\n* Hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid glands make too much of their hormone; sometimes associated with a low vitamin D level)\n* Infections that cause granulomas such as tuberculosis and certain fungal and mycobacterial infections\n* Multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma and certain other cancers\n* Metastatic bone tumor (bone cancer that has spread)\n* Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or too much thyroid hormone replacement medicine\n* Paget disease.

    "title": "Calcium in Urine Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/calcium-in-urine-test/",
    "content": "**Calcium in Urine Test**\n\nA calcium in urine test measures the amount of calcium in your urine (pee). If your urine calcium levels aren't normal, it may be a sign of kidney disease, a parathyroid disorder, bone disease, or another condition that affects how your body uses calcium.\n\n**What is Calcium?**\n\nCalcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. Most of your calcium is stored in your bones and teeth. About 1% of the calcium in your body is in your blood. If there's too much calcium in your blood, the extra calcium may be stored in your bones or passed in your urine and stool (poop).\n\n**How Does the Body Regulate Calcium Levels?**\n\nHaving just the right amount of calcium in your blood is necessary for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work properly. Your blood calcium levels are carefully controlled by your parathyroid glands, which are 4 pea-sized glands in your neck. If your blood calcium levels get too low, these glands make parathyroid hormones (PTH). The hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that work to increase your blood calcium levels until they are normal again.\n\n**What Does PTH Do?**\n\nPTH raises blood calcium levels by:\n\n* Causing your bones to release calcium into your blood\n* Helping your intestines absorb calcium from food\n* Helping your kidneys hold on to calcium and return it to your blood instead of flushing it out in urine\n\n**When is a Calcium in Urine Test Used?**\n\nA calcium in urine test may be used with other tests to help:\n\n* Diagnose kidney stones if you have symptoms. Kidney stones form when you have high levels of certain minerals in your urine. Most kidney stones are made of calcium.\n* Diagnose or monitor problems with how well your kidneys are working.\n* Learn more about how your parathyroid glands are working if you:\n\t+ Have symptoms of underactive parathyroid glands\n\t+ Have been diagnosed with overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism)\n* Learn more about the cause of a bone disease you have, such as osteoporosis.\n* Learn more about the cause of abnormal results on a calcium blood test.\n\n**What Happens During a Calcium in Urine Test?**\n\nYou'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. You may be asked to avoid certain foods and medicines for several days before the test. But don't stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a calcium in urine test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nHigher than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of many conditions, including:\n\n* A kidney stone\n* Overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism)\n* Certain types of cancer, including cancer that spreads to the bones\n* Bone disorders, including Paget's disease of bone and osteoporosis\n* Sarcoidosis\n\nLower than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of many conditions, including:\n\n* Kidney disease\n* Underactive parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism)\n* Too little vitamin D or magnesium\n* Malabsorption disorder\n* Malnutrition\n\n---\n\n**Calcium in Urine Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA calcium in urine test measures the amount of calcium in your urine (pee).

If there's too much calcium in your blood, the extra calcium may be stored in your bones or passed in your urine and stool (poop).\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA calcium in urine test may be used with other tests to help:\n\n* Diagnose kidney stones if you have symptoms\n* Diagnose or monitor problems with how well your kidneys are working\n* Learn more about how your parathyroid glands are working if you:\n\t+ Have symptoms of underactive parathyroid glands\n\t+ Have been diagnosed with overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism)\n* Learn more about the cause of a bone disease you have, such as osteoporosis.\n* Learn more about the cause of abnormal results on a calcium blood test.\n\n**Why do I need a calcium in urine test?**\n\nYou may need a calcium in urine test if you have symptoms of a kidney stone. These symptoms include:\n\n* Sharp pain in your lower abdomen (belly), back, side, or groin\n* Blood in your urine\n* Frequent need to urinate (pee)\n* Pain while urinating\n* Inability to urinate or urinating only small amounts\n* Cloudy or bad-smelling urine\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\nYou may also need a calcium in urine test if:\n\n* You have been diagnosed with overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism)\n* You have symptoms of underactive parthyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism)\n\n**What happens during a calcium in urine test?**\n\nYou'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. You will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. You may be asked to avoid certain foods and medicines for several days before the test. But don't stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a calcium in urine test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nHigher than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of many conditions, including:\n\n* A kidney stone\n* Overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism)\n* Certain types of cancer, including cancer that spreads to the bones\n* Bone disorders, including Paget's disease of bone and osteoporosis\n* Sarcoidosis\n\nLower than normal calcium levels in urine may be a sign of many conditions, including:\n\n* Kidney disease\n* Underactive parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism)\n* Too little vitamin D or magnesium\n* Malabsorption disorder\n* Malnutrition\n\nIf your calcium levels aren't normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Urine calcium levels can be affected by:\n\n* Your diet, for example, eating foods with a lot of sodium (salt)\n* Certain supplements, such as taking too much vitamin D for a long period of time\n* Certain medicines, including antacids and some diuretics (water pills)\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium in Urine Test**\n\nA calcium in urine test measures the amount of calcium in your urine to help diagnose and monitor conditions such as kidney stones, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis. The test can also help identify individuals with a high risk of developing these conditions.\n\n**Why is the Calcium in Urine Test Important?**\n\nThe calcium in urine test is important because it can help:\n\n* Diagnose and monitor conditions such as kidney stones, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis\n* Identify individuals with a high risk of developing these conditions\n* Monitor the effectiveness of treatment for these conditions\n\n**How is the Calcium in Urine Test Performed?**\n\nThe calcium in urine test is typically performed by collecting a 24-hour urine sample. The sample is then sent to a laboratory where it is analyzed for its calcium content.\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Hyperparathyroidism?**\n\nHyperparathyroidism can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Confusion\n* Depression\n* Anxiety\n* Headaches\n* Joint pain\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Hypoparathyroidism?**\n\nHypoparathyroidism can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Muscle cramps\n* Tingling or numbness in the hands and feet\n* Abnormal heart rhythms\n* Seizures\n* Coma\n\n**How is Hyperparathyroidism Diagnosed?**\n\nHyperparathyroidism is typically diagnosed using a combination of laboratory tests, including:\n\n* Calcium blood test\n* Phosphate blood test\n* Parathyroid hormone (PTH) test\n* Urine calcium test\n\n**How is Hypoparathyroidism Diagnosed?**\n\nHypoparathyroidism is typically diagnosed using a combination of laboratory tests, including:\n\n* Calcium blood test\n* Phosphate blood test\n* Parathyroid hormone (PTH) test\n* Urine calcium test\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Calcium\n* Kidney Stones\n* Paget's Disease of Bone\n* Parathyroid Disorders\n* Vitamin D Deficiency\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* Calcium Blood Test\n* Crystals in Urine\n* How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n* How to Understand Your Lab Results\n* Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP)\n* Kidney Stone Analysis\n* Magnesium Blood Test\n* Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Test\n* Phosphate in Blood\n* Phosphate in Urine\n* Uric Acid Test",

    "content": "**Calcium in Diet**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Calcium?**\n\nCalcium is the most plentiful mineral found in the human body. The teeth and bones contain the most calcium. Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium.\n\n**Function**\n\nCalcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. It helps form and maintain healthy teeth and bones. A proper level of calcium in the body over a lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis.\n\nCalcium helps your body with:\n\n*   Building strong bones and teeth\n*   Clotting blood\n*   Sending and receiving nerve signals\n*   Squeezing and relaxing muscles\n*   Releasing hormones and other chemicals\n*   Keeping a normal heartbeat\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nMany foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can easily absorb.\n\nWhole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Most adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products. Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.\n\nYogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions.\nMilk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium.\nVitamin D is needed to help your body use calcium. Milk is fortified with vitamin D for this reason.\n\n**Other Sources of Calcium**\n\nOther sources of calcium that can help meet your body's calcium needs include:\n\n*   Green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage\n*   Salmon and sardines canned with their soft bones\n*   Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans\n*   Blackstrap molasses\n\nCalcium is often added to food products. These include foods such as orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. These are a very good source of calcium for people who do not eat a lot of dairy products.\n\n**Ways to Make Sure You Get Enough Calcium in Your Diet**\n\nCook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. (This means steaming or sautéing to cook instead of boiling foods.)\nBe careful about the other foods you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed. This is why leafy greens are not considered an adequate source of calcium by themselves, because your body is unable to utilize much of the calcium they contain. People on a vegan diet need to be sure to also include soy products and fortified products in order to get enough calcium.\n\n**Dietary Supplements**\n\nCalcium is also found in many multivitamin-mineral supplements. The amount varies, depending on the supplement. Dietary supplements may contain only calcium, or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel of the package to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time.\n\nTwo commonly available forms of calcium dietary supplements include calcium citrate and calcium carbonate.\n\nCalcium citrate is the more expensive form of the supplement. It is taken up well by the body on a full or empty stomach.\nCalcium carbonate is less expensive. It is absorbed better by the body if taken with food. Calcium carbonate is found in over-the-counter antacid products such as Rolaids or Tums. Each chew or pill usually provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium. Check the label for the exact amount.\n\nOther types of calcium in supplements and foods include calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and calcium phosphate.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nIncreased calcium for a limited period of time does not normally cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period of time raises the risk for kidney stones in some people.\n\nThose who do not receive enough calcium over a long period of time can develop osteoporosis (thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density over time). Other disorders are also possible.\n\nPeople with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. For this reason, they are often at risk for calcium deficiency. However, over-the-counter products are available that make it easier to digest lactose. You can also buy lactose-free milk at most grocery stores. Most people who do not suffer from severe lactose-intolerance are still able to digest hard cheeses and yogurt.\n\nTell your health care provider about any dietary supplements and medicines you take. Your provider can tell you if those dietary supplements might interact or interfere with your prescription or over-the-counter medicines. In addition, some medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs calcium.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement. How much calcium you need depends on your age and sex. Other factors, such as pregnancy and illnesses, are also important.\n\nRecommendations for calcium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\n\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.\n\nDietary Reference Intakes for calcium:\n\nInfants (AI):\n\n*   0 to 6 months: 200 milligrams per day (mg/day)\n*   7 to 12 months: 260 mg/day\n\nChildren and adolescents (RDA):\n\n*   Age 1 to 3: 700 mg/day\n*   Age 4 to 8: 1,000 mg/day\n*   Age 9 to 18: 1,300 mg/day\n\nAdults (RDA):\n\n*   Age 19 to 50: 1,000 mg/day\n*   Age 51 to 70: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day\n*   Over age 70: 1,200 mg/day\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding (RDA):\n\n*   Age 14 to 18: 1,300 mg/day\n*   Age 19 to 50: 1,000 mg/day\n\nUp to 2,500 to 3,000 mg a day of calcium from dietary sources and supplements appears to be safe for children and adolescents, and 2,000 to 2,500 mg a day appears to be safe for adults.\n\nThe following list can help you determine roughly how much calcium you are getting from food:\n\n*   8-ounce (240 milliliter) glass of milk = 300 mg of calcium\n*   8-ounce (240 milliliter) glass of calcium-fortified soy milk = 300 mg calcium\n*   1.5 ounces (42 grams) of cheese = 300 mg of calcium\n*   6 ounces (168 grams) of yogurt = 300 mg of calcium\n*   3 ounces (84 grams) of sardines with bones = 300 mg of calcium\n*   ½ cup (82 grams) of cooked turnip greens = 100 mg of calcium\n*   ¼ cup (23 grams) of almonds = 100 mg of calcium\n*   1 cup (70 grams) of shredded bok choy = 74 mg of calcium\n\nVitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium. When choosing a calcium supplement, look for one that also contains vitamin D.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDiet - calcium\n\n**References**\n\nCosman F, de Beur SJ, LeBoff MS, et al.

    "content": "**Calcium Supplements**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Should Take Calcium Supplements?**\n\nCalcium is an essential mineral for the human body. It helps build and protect your teeth and bones. Getting enough calcium over your lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis, also known as \"thin bones.\"\n\nMost people get enough calcium in their normal diet. Dairy foods, leafy green vegetables, and calcium-fortified foods have high levels of calcium. For example, 1 cup (237 ml) of milk or yogurt has 300 mg of calcium. Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent them from getting osteoporosis.\n\nYour healthcare provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium. The decision to take extra calcium should be based on balancing the benefits and risks of doing so.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Calcium Supplements**\n\nForms of calcium include:\n\n*   **Calcium Carbonate**: Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 mg or more of calcium. This form of calcium should be taken with meals.\n*   **Calcium Citrate**: This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate.\n*   **Other Forms**: Such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, and calcium phosphate. Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms and do not offer any advantages.\n\nWhen choosing a calcium supplement:\n\nLook for the word \"purified\" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.\nAvoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Take Extra Calcium**\n\nFollow your provider's advice on how much extra calcium you need.\n\nIncrease the dose of your calcium supplement slowly. Your provider may suggest that you start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time.\n\nTry to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. Do not take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will:\n\nAllow more calcium to be absorbed\nCut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation\n\nThe total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements:\n\n19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day\n51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day\n71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day\n\nThe body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement. Some forms of calcium supplements also contain vitamin D.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Side Effects and Safety**\n\nDo not take more than the recommended amount of calcium without your provider's approval.\n\nTry the following if you have side effects from taking extra calcium:\n\nDrink more fluids.\nEat high-fiber foods.\nSwitch to another form of calcium if the diet changes do not help.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium Supplements**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Should Take Calcium Supplements?**\n\nCalcium is an essential mineral for the human body, helping build and protect teeth and bones.

However, older women and men may require extra calcium to prevent osteoporosis.\n\nYour healthcare provider will determine if you need to take additional calcium, weighing the benefits against potential risks.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Calcium Supplements**\n\nForms of calcium include:\n\n*   **Calcium carbonate**: Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products contain this form. It's absorbed well with meals and is a cost-effective option.\n*   **Calcium citrate**: A more expensive form, but better absorbed on an empty or full stomach. Suitable for people with low stomach acid levels.\n*   Other forms like calcium gluconate, lactate, phosphate: They have less calcium than carbonate and citrate forms and offer no advantages.\n\nWhen choosing a calcium supplement:\n\n*   Look for the word \"purified\" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.\n*   Avoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite without the USP symbol, as they may contain high levels of lead or other toxic metals.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Take Extra Calcium**\n\nFollow your provider's advice on the necessary extra calcium dose. Increase the supplement dose gradually:\n\n*   Start with 500 mg a day for a week.\n*   Add more over time, spreading the extra calcium intake throughout the day (up to 500 mg at a time).\n\nThis approach allows for better absorption and reduces side effects like gas, bloating, and constipation.\n\nThe total daily calcium needs for adults:\n\n*   19-50 years: 1,000 mg\n*   51-70 years: Men - 1,000 mg; Women - 1,200 mg\n*   71 years and over: 1,200 mg\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Side Effects and Safety**\n\nDo not take more than the recommended calcium amount without your provider's approval. If you experience side effects:\n\n*   Drink more fluids.\n*   Eat high-fiber foods.\n*   Switch to another form of calcium if diet changes do not help.\n\nAlways inform your provider and pharmacist about extra calcium intake, as it may interact with certain medications, such as antibiotics and iron pills.\n\nBe aware of the following risks:\n\n*   Long-term extra calcium use increases the risk of kidney stones in some individuals.\n*   Excessive calcium can hinder the body's absorption of iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus.\n*   Antacids contain additional ingredients like sodium, aluminum, and sugar; consult your provider about using antacids as a calcium supplement.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium Supplements**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis**\n\nAccording to Cosman et al., prevention and treatment of osteoporosis should involve a clinician's guide that includes calcium supplements as one of the essential components. Their study, published in Osteoporos Int in 2014, highlights the importance of calcium supplementation in preventing and treating osteoporosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Calcium and Vitamin D: Important at Every Age**\n\nThe NIH Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center website emphasizes the significance of calcium and vitamin D for bone health. Their article, last reviewed in May 2023, stresses that these nutrients are crucial for maintaining strong bones throughout one's life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a recommendation statement on the use of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for preventing fractures in community-dwelling adults. Their study, published in JAMA in 2018, provides evidence-based guidance for healthcare providers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention**\n\nWeber TJ's chapter on osteoporosis in Goldman-Cecil Medicine highlights the importance of calcium supplements as a treatment and prevention strategy for this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nCosman F, de Beur SJ, LeBoff MS, et al.

Also, tell your doctor if you take antidepressants; benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), oxazepam, temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Halcion); medications for mental illness, nausea, or seizures; muscle relaxants; or narcotic pain medications.\n\nYou doctor may need to change the doses of your medications and monitor you carefully. Do not drink alcoholic beverages while you are taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate.\n\n**Availability**\n\nCalcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is available only through a restricted distribution program called the Xywav and Xyrem REMS Program. Your medication will be mailed to you from a central pharmacy after you have read the information and talked to a pharmacist.\n\n**Medication Guide**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\nYou can also obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCalcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat attacks of cataplexy (episodes of muscle weakness that begin suddenly and last for a short time) and excessive daytime sleepiness in adults and children 7 years of age and older who have narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that may cause extreme sleepiness, sudden uncontrollable urge to sleep during daily activities, and cataplexy).\n\nCalcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is also used to treat adults who have idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; a sleep disorder that may cause excessive daytime sleepiness and uncontrollable urge to sleep during daily activities despite adequate or prolonged nighttime sleep).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCalcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate comes as a solution (liquid) to mix with water and take by mouth. When calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with cataplexy, it is usually taken twice each night because calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night.\n\nWhen calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, it is usually taken once or twice each night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and a second dose is taken 2 1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium Oxybate: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Take Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium Oxybate**\n\n*   The first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**Taking Your Bedtime Doses**\n\n*   Do not take your bedtime doses of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate until you or your child are in bed and are ready to go to sleep for the night.\n*   If your doctor has told you to take a second dose, place your second dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in a safe place near your bed (or in an safe place to give to your child) before sleep.\n*   Use an alarm clock to be sure that you will wake up in time to take the second dose.\n\n**Dosing Schedule**\n\n*   Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.\n\n---\n\n**Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium Oxybate**\n\n**What is it?**\nA solution (liquid) to mix with water and take by mouth.\n\n**How is it used?**\nTo treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with cataplexy, or idiopathic hypersomnia.

    "content": "**Calcium, Vitamin D, and Your Bones**\n\nGetting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet can help maintain bone strength and lessen your risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\n**Bone Strength and Calcium**\n\nYour body needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong. Low bone density can cause your bones to become brittle and fragile. These weak bones can break more easily, even without an obvious injury.\n\nVitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Eat foods that provide the right amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. This kind of diet will give your body the building blocks it needs to make and maintain strong bones.\n\nIn addition to getting enough calcium and vitamin D, you can reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis by exercising regularly and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol use.\n\n**How Much Calcium and Vitamin D Do I Need?**\n\nAmounts of calcium are given in milligrams (mg), and vitamin D is given in international units (IU).\n\n* All children ages 9 to 18 should have:\n\t+ 1300 mg of calcium daily\n\t+ 600 IU of vitamin D daily\n* All people age 19 to 50 should have:\n\t+ 1000 mg of calcium daily\n\t+ 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily\n* Adults age 51 and older should have:\n\t+ Women: 1200 mg of calcium daily\n\t+ Men: 1000 mg of calcium daily\n\t+ Men and women: 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily. People who are vitamin D deficient or have insufficient amounts of vitamin D will need higher amounts of vitamin D supplementation.\n\nToo much calcium or vitamin D can lead to problems such as an increased risk for kidney stones.\n\nTotal calcium should not exceed 2000 mg per day\nTotal vitamin D should not exceed 4000 IU per day\n\n**Calcium and Dairy Products**\n\nMilk and dairy products are the best sources of calcium. They contain a form of calcium that your body can absorb easily. Choose yogurts, cheeses, and buttermilk.\n\nAdults should choose fat-free (skim) milk or low-fat (2% or 1%) milk, and other lower fat dairy products. Removing some of the fat does not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.\n\nYogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk come in fat-free or low-fat versions.\nVitamin D helps your body use calcium, which is why vitamin D is often added to milk.\n\nIf you eat very few or no dairy products, you can find calcium in other foods. It is often added to orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. Check the labels on these foods for added calcium.\n\n**Other Sources of Calcium**\n\nGreen leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy (Chinese cabbage), are good sources of calcium.\n\nOther good food sources of calcium are:\n\n* Salmon and sardines that are canned with their bones (you can eat these soft bones)\n* Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini (sesame paste), and dried beans\n* Blackstrap molasses\n\n---\n\n**Calcium, Vitamin D, and Your Bones**\n\nGetting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet can help maintain bone strength and lessen your risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\n**Bone Strength and Calcium**\n\nYour body needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong.

They will retain more calcium this way.\nBe careful about what you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb), can prevent your body from absorbing calcium.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nYour health care provider may recommend a calcium or vitamin D supplement for the calcium and vitamin D you need. However, the balance between benefits and harms of these supplements is unclear.\n\n**References**\n\nLeBoff MS, Greenspan SL, Insogna KL, et al.
