    "content": "**Breast Reconstruction**\n\nIf you need a mastectomy, you have a choice about whether or not to have surgery to rebuild the shape of the breast. Instead of breast reconstruction, you could choose to wear a breast form that replaces the breast, wear padding inside your bra, or do nothing. All of these options have pros and cons. What is right for one woman may not be right for another.\n\n**When to Have Breast Reconstruction**\n\nBreast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy, or it may be done later on. If radiation therapy is part of the treatment plan, your doctor may suggest waiting until after radiation therapy.\n\n**Talking to a Plastic Surgeon**\n\nIf you're thinking about breast reconstruction, talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy, even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on.\n\n**Types of Breast Reconstruction**\n\nA surgeon can reconstruct the breast in many ways. Some women choose to have breast implants, which are filled with saline or silicone gel. Another method uses tissue taken from another part of your body. The plastic surgeon can take skin, muscle, and fat from your lower abdomen, back, or buttocks.\n\n**Choosing the Right Type of Reconstruction**\n\nThe type of reconstruction that is best for you depends on your age, body type, and the type of cancer surgery that you had. A plastic surgeon can help you decide.\n\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Breast Reconstruction (Susan G.

    "content": "**Breast Augmentation Surgery**\n\n**What is Breast Augmentation?**\n\nBreast augmentation is a procedure to enlarge or change the shape of the breasts.\n\n**Description**\n\nBreast augmentation is done by placing implants behind breast tissue or under the chest muscle. An implant is a sac filled with either sterile salt water (saline) or a material called silicone.\n\n**Types of Implants and Surgery**\n\nThere are different ways to place breast implants:\n\n*   In the most common technique, the surgeon makes a cut (incision) on the underside of your breast, in the natural skin fold. The surgeon places the implant through this opening.\n*   The implant may be placed through a cut under your arm. The surgeon may perform this surgery using an endoscope.\n*   The surgeon may make a cut around the edge of your areola. This is the darkened area around your nipple.\n*   A saline implant may be placed through a cut near your belly button.\n\n**Factors That Can Affect Your Outcome**\n\nThe type of implant, size of the implant, and implant surgery can affect:\n\n*   How much pain you have after the procedure\n*   The appearance of your breast\n*   The risk for the implant breaking or leaking in the future\n*   Your future mammograms -- additional views will be required to allow visualization\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines, breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks for breast surgery are:\n\n*   Difficulty breastfeeding\n*   Loss of feeling in the nipple area\n*   Small scars, often in an area where they do not show much\n*   Thickened, raised scars\n*   Uneven position of nipples\n*   Different sizes or shapes of the two breasts\n*   Breaking or leakage of the implant\n*   Visible rippling of the implant\n*   Need for more breast surgery\n\n**Emotional Risks**\n\nIt is normal for your body to create a \"capsule\" made up of scar tissue around your new breast implant. This helps keep the implant in place. Sometimes, this capsule becomes thickened and larger. This may cause a change in the shape of your breast, hardening of breast tissue, or some pain.\n\nEmotional risks for this surgery may include feeling that your breasts do not look perfect. Or, you may be disappointed with people's reactions to your \"new\" breasts.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your health care provider:\n\n*   If you are or could be pregnant\n*   What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the days before your surgery:\n\n*   You may need mammograms or breast x-rays before surgery. The plastic surgeon will do a breast exam.\n*   Several days before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will likely go home when the anesthesia wears off and you can walk, drink water, and get to the bathroom safely.\n\nAfter breast augmentation surgery, a bulky gauze dressing will be wrapped around your breasts and chest. Or, you might wear a surgical bra. Drainage tubes may be attached to your breasts. These will be removed within 3 days. Your surgeon will give you instructions about when you may bathe or shower.\n\nThe surgeon may also recommend massaging the breasts starting 5 days after surgery. Massaging helps reduce hardening of the capsule that surrounds the implant. Ask your provider first before massaging over your implants.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou are likely to have a very good outcome from breast surgery. You may feel better about your appearance and yourself. Also, any pain or skin symptoms due to the surgery will likely disappear. You may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months to reshape your breasts.\n\nScars are permanent and are often more visible in the year after surgery. They may fade after this. Your surgeon will try to place the incisions so that your scars are as hidden as possible.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Augmentation Surgery**\n\n**What is Breast Augmentation?**\n\nBreast augmentation is a surgical procedure to enlarge or change the shape of the breasts.\n\n**How is Breast Augmentation Done?**\n\nThe surgery involves placing implants behind breast tissue or under the chest muscle.

An implant is a sac filled with either sterile salt water (saline) or a material called silicone. The surgery is done at an outpatient surgery clinic or in a hospital.\n\n**Types of Implants and Surgery**\n\nThere are different ways to place breast implants:\n\n*   In the most common technique, the surgeon makes a cut (incision) on the underside of your breast, in the natural skin fold.\n*   The implant may be placed through a cut under your arm.

It may also be done to change the shape of your breasts or to correct a defect you are born with (congenital deformity).\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines, breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks for breast surgery are:\n\n*   Capsular contracture (when scar tissue causes the breast to become hard or misshapen)\n*   Loss of sensation around the nipple\n*   Problems with breastfeeding\n\n---\n\n**Breast Augmentation Surgery**\n\nIt's improvement, not perfection.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Reactions to medicines, breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection (risks for anesthesia and surgery in general)\n* Difficulty breastfeeding\n* Loss of feeling in the nipple area\n* Small scars, often in an area where they do not show much\n* Thickened, raised scars\n* Uneven position of nipples\n* Different sizes or shapes of the two breasts\n* Breaking or leakage of the implant\n* Visible rippling of the implant\n* Need for more breast surgery (risks for breast surgery)\n\nIt is normal for your body to create a \"capsule\" made up of scar tissue around your new breast implant. This helps keep the implant in place. Sometimes, this capsule becomes thickened and larger. This may cause a change in the shape of your breast, hardening of breast tissue, or some pain.\n\nEmotional risks for this surgery may include feeling that your breasts do not look perfect. Or, you may be disappointed with people's reactions to your \"new\" breasts.\n\nThere are some risks that may occur months or even years after an implant is in place.\n\nA rare type of lymphoma (cancer of the immune system) has been reported with some types of implants. It is called breast implant-associated lymphoma. Symptoms include a mass or swelling around the implant and breast pain. It can be treated with removal of the implant and the area around the implant. Ongoing research in this area may discover other uncommon links between breast implants with other types of cancer.\n\nSome patients have experienced systemic symptoms after receiving implants. This has been called \"breast implant illness\" although there is not enough evidence yet for it to be a recognized illness. Reported symptoms include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Memory and concentration problems (\"brain fog\")\n* Pain in joints and muscles\n* Anxiety\n* Hair loss\n* Depression\n* Rash\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Inflammation\n* Weight gain or loss\n\nSome women report that symptoms improve after the implant is removed. Despite these rare risks, breast implants are considered safe.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your health care provider:\n\n* If you are or could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the days before your surgery:\n\n* You may need mammograms or breast x-rays before surgery. The plastic surgeon will do a breast exam.\n* Several days before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.\n* Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n* You may need to fill prescriptions for pain medicine before surgery.\n* Arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and help you around the house for 1 or 2 days.\n* If you smoke, it is important to stop. Smoking can cause problems with healing. Your surgeon may postpone surgery if you continue to smoke. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n* You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before surgery.\n* Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Wear or bring loose clothing that buttons or zips in front. And bring a soft, loose-fitting bra with no underwire.\n* Arrive on time at the outpatient clinic or hospital.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Augmentation Surgery**\n\nIf you are a smoker, it is crucial to stop smoking before undergoing breast augmentation surgery. Smoking can hinder the healing process, and your surgeon may postpone the surgery if you continue to smoke.\n\n**Preparation for Surgery**\n\n*   You will typically be advised not to eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before surgery.\n*   Take any prescribed medications with a small amount of water as instructed by your healthcare provider.\n*   Wear loose-fitting clothing that buttons or zips in front, and bring a soft, comfortable bra without underwire.\n*   Arrive at the outpatient clinic or hospital on time.\n\n**During Surgery**\n\nYour healthcare provider will guide you through the surgical process. You may be given general anesthesia to ensure your comfort during the procedure.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will likely be discharged when the anesthesia wears off and you can safely walk, drink water, and use the bathroom. A bulky gauze dressing or a surgical bra will be applied around your breasts and chest. Drainage tubes may be attached to your breasts, which will be removed within 3 days. Your surgeon will provide instructions on bathing or showering.\n\n**Post-Surgical Care**\n\nYour surgeon may recommend massaging your breasts starting 5 days after surgery to reduce hardening of the capsule surrounding the implant. However, consult with your healthcare provider before performing any self-massage over your implants.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou can expect a very good outcome from breast augmentation surgery. You may feel more confident about your appearance and overall well-being. Any pain or skin symptoms resulting from the surgery should dissipate. You might need to wear a supportive bra for several months to help reshape your breasts.\n\nScars are permanent but may fade over time. Your surgeon will strive to place incisions in areas that minimize visibility.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Breast augmentation\n*   Breast implants\n*   Implants - breast\n*   Mammaplasty - augmentation\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nPlease follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider for post-operative care and wound management.\n\n---\n\n**Risks and Complications of Breast Implants**\n\nAccording to the FDA, risks and complications associated with breast implants include:\n\n*   **Rupture**: Silicone gel-filled implants can rupture, causing symptoms such as pain, swelling, and changes in breast size.\n*   **Capsular contracture**: A condition where the scar tissue around the implant becomes tight, causing the breast to feel hard or painful.\n*   **Adhesions**: Scar tissue that forms between the implant and surrounding tissue, which can cause discomfort or other complications.\n*   **Infection**: As with any surgical procedure, there is a risk of infection with breast augmentation surgery.\n*   **Scarring**: While not typically a serious complication, scarring can be a concern for some patients.\n\nIt's essential to discuss these risks and complications with your surgeon before undergoing breast augmentation surgery.",

    "content": "**Breast Biopsy - Stereotactic**\n\nA breast biopsy is the removal of breast tissue to examine it for signs of breast cancer or other disorders.\n\nThere are several types of breast biopsies, including stereotactic, ultrasound-guided, MRI-guided and excisional breast biopsy. This article focuses on stereotactic breast biopsy, which uses mammography to help pinpoint the spot in the breast that needs to be removed. This procedure is usually done by a radiologist or surgeon.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou are asked to undress from the waist up. During the biopsy, you are awake.\n\nYou will most likely be asked to lie facing down on the biopsy table. The breast that is being biopsied hangs through an opening in the table. The table is raised and the doctor performs the biopsy from underneath. In some cases, stereotactic breast biopsy is done while you sit in an upright position.\n\nThe biopsy is done in the following way:\n\n*   The doctor first cleans the area on your breast.\n*   Numbing medicine is injected.\n*   The breast is pressed down to hold it in position during the procedure.\n*   You need to hold still while the biopsy is being done.\n*   The doctor makes a very small cut on your breast over the area that needs to be biopsied.\n*   Using a special machine, a needle or sheath is guided to the exact location of the abnormal area.

You will be given instructions about what activities you can do, how to take care of your breast, and what medicines you can take for pain.\n\nYou may have some bruising, and there will be a very small scar where the needle was inserted.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAn ultrasound-guided breast biopsy may be done to evaluate abnormal findings on a mammogram, breast ultrasound, or MRI.\n\nTo determine whether someone has breast cancer, a biopsy must be done. Tissue from the abnormal area is removed and examined under a microscope.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means there is no sign of cancer or other breast problems.\n\nYour provider will let you know if and when you need a follow-up ultrasound, mammogram, or other tests.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA biopsy can identify a number of breast conditions that are not cancer or precancer, including:\n\n* Fibroadenoma (breast lump that usually isn't cancer)\n* Fat necrosis\n\nBiopsy results may show abnormal conditions such as:\n\n* Atypical ductal hyperplasia\n* Atypical lobular hyperplasia\n* Flat epithelial atypia\n* Intraductal papilloma\n* Lobular carcinoma-in-situ\n* Radial scar\n* Fibroepithelial lesion\n* Mucocele-like lesion\n\nIf the biopsy result is benign, you may not need any further treatment, though sometimes surgery to remove a benign condition is recommended. If the biopsy shows an abnormal condition, you may be referred to a surgeon to discuss a surgical biopsy to remove the entire area and test it more thoroughly.\n\nDepending on surgical biopsy results, you may need further surgery or treatment.\n\nYour provider will discuss the meaning of the biopsy results with you.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a slight chance of infection at the injection or incision site. Excessive bleeding is rare.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Biopsy - Ultrasound**\n\nA breast biopsy is the removal of breast tissue to examine it for signs of breast cancer or other disorders.\n\n**Types of Breast Biopsies**\n\nThere are several types of breast biopsies, including:\n\n* Stereotactic\n* Ultrasound-guided\n* MRI-guided\n* Excisional breast biopsy\n\nThis article focuses on needle-based, ultrasound-guided breast biopsies.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will be asked to undress from the waist up and wear a robe that opens in the front. During the biopsy, you will be awake.\n\nThe biopsy is done as follows:\n\n* The doctor cleans the area on your breast.\n* Numbing medicine is injected.\n* A very small cut is made on your breast over the area that needs to be biopsied.\n* An ultrasound machine is used to guide the needle to the abnormal area in your breast that needs to be biopsied.\n* Several small pieces of tissue are taken.\n* A small metal clip may be placed into the breast in the area of the biopsy to mark it, if needed.\n\nThe biopsy is done using one of the following:\n\n* Fine needle aspiration\n* Hollow needle (called a core needle)\n* Vacuum-powered device\n* Both a hollow needle and vacuum-powered device\n\nOnce the tissue sample has been taken, the needle is removed. Ice and pressure are applied to the site to stop any bleeding. A bandage is applied to absorb any fluid.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThe health care provider will ask about your medical history and may perform a manual breast exam.\n\nIf you take blood thinning medicines (including aspirin, supplements, or herbs), ask your doctor whether you need to stop taking these before the biopsy.\n\nTell your doctor if you may be pregnant.\n\nDo not use lotion, perfume, powder, or deodorant underneath your arms or on your breasts.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the numbing medicine is injected, it may sting a bit.\n\nDuring the procedure, you may feel slight discomfort or light pressure.\n\nAfter the test, the breast may be sore and tender to the touch for several days.

This means that anyone, including men and boys, can develop breast cancer.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of breast cancer in men is not clear. But there are risk factors that make breast cancer more likely in men:\n\n*   Exposure to radiation\n*   Higher estrogen levels due to factors such as heavy alcohol use, cirrhosis, and obesity\n*   Heredity, such as a family history of breast cancer, having a variant BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, and certain genetic disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome\n*   Excess breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n*   Older age -- men are often diagnosed with breast cancer between ages 60 and 70\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of breast cancer in men include:\n\n*   Lump or swelling in the breast tissue. One breast may be larger than the other.\n*   A small lump beneath the nipple.\n*   Unusual changes in the nipple or skin around the nipple such as redness, scaling, or puckering.\n*   Nipple discharge.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and family medical history. You will have a physical exam and a breast exam.\n\nYour provider may order other tests, including:\n\n*   A mammogram.\n*   Breast ultrasound.\n*   An MRI of the breast.\n*   If any of the tests suggest cancer, your provider will arrange a biopsy to check for cancer.\n\nIf cancer is found, your provider will order other tests to find out:\n\n*   How it has spread\n*   What treatments might be best\n*   What are the chances that the cancer might come back\n\nThe tests may include:\n\n*   Bone scan\n*   CT scan\n*   PET scan\n*   Sentinel lymph node biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer in Men**\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is cancer that starts in breast tissue. Both males and females have breast tissue, which means anyone, including men and boys, can develop breast cancer.\n\n**How Common is Breast Cancer in Men?**\n\nBreast cancer in men is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers.\n\n**Causes of Breast Cancer in Men**\n\nThe cause of breast cancer in men is not clear. However, there are risk factors that make breast cancer more likely in men:\n\n* Exposure to radiation\n* Higher estrogen levels due to factors such as heavy alcohol use, cirrhosis, and obesity\n* Heredity, such as a family history of breast cancer, having a variant BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, and certain genetic disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome\n* Excess breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n* Older age - men are often diagnosed with breast cancer between ages 60 and 70\n\n**Symptoms of Breast Cancer in Men**\n\nSymptoms of breast cancer in men include:\n\n* Lump or swelling in the breast tissue. One breast may be larger than the other.\n* A small lump beneath the nipple.\n* Unusual changes in the nipple or skin around the nipple such as redness, scaling, or puckering.\n* Nipple discharge.\n\n**Exams and Tests for Breast Cancer in Men**\n\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and family medical history. You will have a physical exam and a breast exam. Your provider may order other tests, including:\n\n* A mammogram.\n* Breast ultrasound.\n* An MRI of the breast.\n* If any of the tests suggest cancer, your provider will arrange a biopsy to check for cancer.\n\n**Treatment Options for Breast Cancer in Men**\n\nTreatment options for breast cancer in men include:\n\n* Surgery to remove the breast, lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over chest muscles, and chest muscles, if needed\n* Radiation therapy after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells and to target specific tumors\n* Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body or to lower the risk of the cancer returning after surgery\n* Hormone therapy to block hormones that may help certain types of breast cancer grow\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Breast Cancer in Men**\n\nThe long-term outlook for men with breast cancer is excellent when the cancer is found and treated early. About 91% of men treated before the cancer has spread to other areas of the body are cancer-free after 5 years.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer in Men**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment options for breast cancer in men include:\n\n*   Surgery to remove the breast, lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over chest muscles, and chest muscles, if needed\n*   Radiation therapy after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells and to target specific tumors\n*   Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body or to lower the risk of the cancer returning after surgery\n*   Hormone therapy to block hormones that may help certain types of breast cancer grow\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nCancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have had the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone. The group can also point you to helpful resources for managing your condition.\n\nAsk your provider to help you find a support group of men who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe long-term outlook for men with breast cancer is excellent when the cancer is found and treated early.\n\nAbout 91% of men treated before the cancer has spread to other areas of the body are cancer-free after 5 years.\n\nAlmost 3 out of 4 men treated for cancer that has spread to lymph nodes but not to other areas of the body are cancer-free at 5 years.\n\nMen who have cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body have a smaller chance of long-term survival.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include side effects from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if you notice something unusual about your breast, including any lumps, skin changes, or discharge.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no clear way to prevent breast cancer in men. The best way to protect yourself is to:\n\n*   Know that men can develop breast cancer\n*   Know your risk factors and talk with your provider about screening and early detection with tests if needed\n*   Know the possible signs of breast cancer\n*   Tell your provider if you notice any changes in your breast\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nInfiltrating ductal carcinoma - male; Ductal carcinoma in situ - male; Intraductal carcinoma - male; Inflammatory breast cancer - male; Paget disease of the nipple - male; Breast cancer - male\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer in Men**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Overview**\n\nMale breast cancer treatment is focused on removing or destroying the tumor and preventing its spread. The goal of treatment is to control the disease, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Standard Treatment Options**\n\nThe standard treatment options for male breast cancer include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Mastectomy (removal of the breast) or lumpectomy (removal of the tumor) may be performed.\n*   **Radiation therapy**: To kill any remaining cancer cells after surgery.\n*   **Hormone therapy**: To block the production of hormones that stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells.\n*   **Chemotherapy**: To kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment by Stage**\n\nThe treatment plan for male breast cancer depends on the stage and size of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment may include:\n\n*   **Stage I**: Surgery or hormone therapy.\n*   **Stage II**: Surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.\n*   **Stage III**: Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.\n*   **Stage IV**: Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and pain management.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Follow-Up Care**\n\nAfter treatment, patients with male breast cancer should follow up regularly with their healthcare provider to monitor for any signs of recurrence or new tumors.",

In many cases, finding breast cancer early makes it easier to treat or cure. But screenings also have risks, such as missing signs of cancer. When to start screenings may depend on your age and risk factors.\n\n**Mammograms**\n\nA mammogram is the most common type of screening. It is an x-ray of the breasts using a special machine. This test is done in a hospital or clinic and only takes a few minutes. Mammograms can find tumors that are too small to feel.\n\n*   Mammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\n*   Women with a family history of breast cancer should work with their health care provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\n*   Mammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older.\n\n**Breast Exams**\n\nThis is an exam to feel the breasts and underarms for lumps or unusual changes. Your provider may perform a clinical breast exam (CBE). You can also check your breasts on your own. This is called a breast self-exam (BSE). Doing self-exams may help you become more familiar with your breasts. This may make it easier to notice unusual breast changes.\n\n*   Keep in mind that breast exams do not reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer. They also do not work as well as mammograms to find cancer. For this reason, you should not rely only on breast exams to screen for cancer.\n\n**MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**\n\nAn MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to find signs of cancer. This screening is done only for women who have a high risk for breast cancer.\n\n*   Women at high risk for breast cancer (greater than 20% to 25% lifetime risk) should have an MRI along with a mammogram every year.\n*   You may have a high risk if you have:\n    *   A family history of breast cancer, most often when your mother or sister had breast cancer at an early age\n    *   Lifetime risk for breast cancer is 20% to 25% or higher\n    *   Certain BRCA gene variations, whether you carry this marker or a first degree relative does and you have not been tested\n    *   First degree relatives with certain genetic syndromes (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes)\n\n**Benefits and Risks of Screenings**\n\nWhen and how often to have a breast cancer screening test is a choice you must make.

This occurs when a test shows cancer when there is none. This can lead to having more tests that also have risks. It can also cause anxiety.\n*   False-negative results. These are tests that come back normal even though there is cancer. Women who have false-negative results do not know they have breast cancer and delay treatment.\n*   Exposure to radiation. Although the potential benefits of mammography outweigh the possible harm from the radiation exposure, repeated x-rays can cause cancer.\n*   Overtreatment.

Staging is a tool the team uses to find out how advanced the cancer is. The stage of the cancer depends on the size and location of a tumor, whether it has spread, and how far the cancer has spread.\n\n**Why Is Staging Important?**\n\nYour health care team uses staging to help:\n\n* Decide the best treatment\n* Know what kind of follow-up will be needed\n* Determine your chance of recovery (prognosis)\n* Find clinical trials you may be able to join\n\n**Two Types of Staging**\n\nThere are two types of staging for breast cancer.\n\n1. **Clinical Staging**: Based on tests done before surgery, including:\n\t* Physical exam\n\t* Mammogram\n\t* Breast MRI\n\t* Breast Ultrasound\n\t* Breast Biopsy (ultrasound or stereotactic)\n\t* Chest x-ray\n\t* CT scan\n\t* Bone scan\n\t* PET Scan\n2. **Pathological Staging**: Uses the results from lab tests done on breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery.\n\n**How Stages Are Determined**\n\nStages of breast cancer are defined by a system called TNM:\n\n* T: tumor (size and location)\n* N: lymph nodes (whether cancer has spread to the nodes, how many have cancer cells)\n* M: metastasis (whether cancer has spread to parts of the body away from the breast)\n\n**What the Stages Mean**\n\nDoctors use seven main stages to describe breast cancer.\n\n1. **Stage 0**: Carcinoma in situ - cancer confined to lobules or ducts, has not spread.\n2. **Stage I**: Small (or too small to see) invasive tumor, may or may not have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\n3. **Stage II**: No tumor found in breast, but cancer has spread to axillary lymph nodes or nodes near the breastbone.\n4. **Stage IIIA**: Cancer has spread to 4-9 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone (but not to other parts of the body).\n5. **Stage IIIB**: Tumor has spread to chest wall or skin of breast, causing ulcer or swelling (may also have spread to axillary nodes).\n6. **Stage IIIC**: Cancer of any size has spread to at least 10 axillary nodes (may also have spread to skin of breast or breast wall).\n7. **Stage IV**: Cancer is metastatic, having spread to other organs such as bones, lungs, brain, or liver.\n\n**How Staging Guides Treatment**\n\nThe type of cancer you have, along with the stage, will help determine your treatment. With stages I-III, the main goal is to cure the cancer by treating it and keeping it from coming back. With stage IV, the goal is to improve symptoms and prolong life. In almost all cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.\n\n**Recurrent Cancer**\n\nCancer can come back after treatment ends.

This type of staging will help determine additional treatment and help predict what to expect after treatment ends.\n\n**How Stages Are Determined**\n\nStages of breast cancer are defined by a system called TNM:\n\n* T stands for tumor. It describes the size and location of the main tumor.\n* N stands for lymph nodes. It describes whether cancer has spread to the nodes. It also tells how many nodes have cancer cells.\n* M stands for metastasis. It tells whether the cancer has spread to parts of the body away from the breast.\n\n**What the Stages Mean**\n\nDoctors use seven main stages to describe breast cancer.\n\n* **Stage 0**: Also called carcinoma in situ. This is cancer that is confined to the lobules or ducts in the breast. It has not spread to surrounding tissue.\n* **Stage I**: The tumor is small (or may be too small to see) and invasive. It may or may not have spread to the lymph nodes close to the breast.\n* **Stage II**: There may be no tumor found in the breast, but cancer can be found that has spread to axillary lymph nodes or nodes close to the breastbone.\n* **Stage IIIA**: Cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone but not to other parts of the body. Or, there could be a tumor larger than 5 centimeters and cancer that has spread to 3 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone.\n* **Stage IIIB**: The tumor has spread to the chest wall or to the skin of the breast causing an ulcer or swelling. It may also have spread to axillary nodes but not to other parts of the body.\n* **Stage IIIC**: Cancer of any size has spread to at least 10 axillary nodes. It may also have spread to the skin of the breast or breast wall, but not to distant parts of the body.\n* **Stage IV**: The cancer is metastatic, which means it has spread to other organs such as the bones, lungs, brain, or liver.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer Staging**\n\nDoctors use seven main stages to describe breast cancer.\n\n* **Stage 0, Carcinoma in Situ**: Cancer is confined to the lobules or ducts in the breast.

Axillary nodes are nodes found in a chain from under the arm to above the collarbone. There might also be a tumor between 2 and 5 centimeters in the breast with small cancers in some of the lymph nodes. Or, the tumor could be larger than 5 centimeters with no cancer in the nodes.\n* **Stage IIIA**: Cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone but not to other parts of the body.

    "content": "**Breast Cancer**\n\nBreast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nIn its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include:\n\n* A lump or thickening in or near the breast\n* A change in the size or shape of the breast\n* Nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward)\n* Skin irritation, dimpling, redness, or scaliness\n\nHowever, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\n\n**Types of Breast Cancer**\n\nIn some cases, cancerous cells can invade surrounding breast tissue. In these cases, the condition is known as invasive breast cancer. Sometimes, tumors spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.\n\n**Hereditary Breast Cancer**\n\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both breasts.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBreast cancer is a relatively rare disease, but it is the most common type of cancer affecting women in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, breast cancer accounts for about 30% of all cancers diagnosed in women.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nSome cases of breast cancer are associated with inherited gene mutations. These mutations can be passed down from parents to children and increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nBreast cancer is also known as ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, or invasive ductal carcinoma, depending on the type and location of the tumor.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on breast cancer, including symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and support resources, please visit the National Cancer Institute's website at [www.cancer.gov](http://www.cancer.gov).\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor.\n\n**Types of Breast Cancer**\n\nIn women, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.\n\n**Symptoms of Breast Cancer**\n\nIn its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, redness, or scaliness.\n\n**Causes of Breast Cancer**\n\nCancers occur when a buildup of mutations in critical genes—those that control cell growth and division or repair damaged DNA—allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In most cases of breast cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the breast.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSome breast cancers that cluster in families are associated with inherited mutations in particular genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. These genes are described as \"high penetrance\" because they are associated with a high risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer and a moderate risk of developing pancreatic cancer and a type of skin cancer called melanoma.\n\n**Frequency of Breast Cancer**\n\nBreast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. (Only skin cancer is more common.) About one in eight women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Researchers estimate that more than 276,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women in 2020.\n\n**Male Breast Cancer**\n\nMale breast cancer represents less than 1 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses. Scientists estimate that about 2,600 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in men in 2020.\n\n**Genetic Mutations and Ethnic Groups**\n\nParticular gene mutations associated with breast cancer are more common among certain geographic or ethnic groups, such as people of Ashkenazi (central or eastern European) Jewish heritage and people of Norwegian, Icelandic, or Dutch ancestry.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer: Understanding the Genetic Factors**\n\nIn this article, we'll delve into the genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer. We'll explore the role of inherited mutations in specific genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, and discuss how these changes increase a person's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n**High Penetrance Genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2**\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are considered \"high penetrance\" because they're associated with a high risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer, as well as a moderate risk of pancreatic cancer and melanoma. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\n**Germline Mutations: A Rare but Significant Risk Factor**\n\nLess commonly, gene mutations present in all cells increase the risk of developing breast cancer. These genetic changes, classified as germline mutations, are usually inherited from a parent. In people with germline mutations, changes in other genes, combined with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a person will develop breast cancer.\n\n**Rare Genetic Syndromes: An Increased Risk of Breast Cancer**\n\nSeveral rare genetic syndromes, including Cowden syndrome, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These syndromes typically result from mutations in specific genes, such as PTEN, CDH1, TP53, or STK11.\n\n**Low Penetrance Genes: A Complex Interplay of Genetic and Environmental Factors**\n\nMutations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for breast cancer. These genes are described as \"low penetrance\" or \"moderate penetrance\" because changes in each gene appear to make only a small or moderate contribution to overall breast cancer risk.\n\n**Personal and Environmental Risk Factors: A Complex Interplay**\n\nResearchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that contribute to a person's risk of developing breast cancer. These factors include sex, age, ethnic background, a history of previous breast cancer, certain changes in breast tissue, and hormonal and reproductive factors. A history of breast cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred in early adulthood.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBreast cancer is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer can help us better comprehend the disease and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/6)**\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSome breast cancers that cluster in families are associated with inherited mutations in particular genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. These genes are described as \"high penetrance\" because they are associated with a high risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer and a moderate risk of developing pancreatic cancer and a type of skin cancer called melanoma.\n\n**Rare Genetic Syndromes**\n\nA significantly increased risk of breast cancer is also a feature of several rare genetic syndromes, including:\n\n*   Cowden syndrome, which is most often caused by mutations in the PTEN gene\n*   Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, which results from mutations in the CDH1 gene\n*   Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is usually caused by mutations in the TP53 gene\n*   Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which typically results from mutations in the STK11 gene\n\n**Low Penetrance Genes**\n\nMutations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for breast cancer. These genes are described as \"low penetrance\" or \"moderate penetrance\" because changes in each of these genes appear to make only a small or moderate contribution to overall breast cancer risk.\n\n**Personal and Environmental Factors**\n\nResearchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that contribute to a person's risk of developing breast cancer, including:\n\n*   Sex\n*   Age\n*   Ethnic background\n*   A history of previous breast cancer\n*   Certain changes in breast tissue\n*   Hormonal and reproductive factors\n*   Exposure to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens)\n\n**Genes Associated with Breast Cancer**\n\nThe following genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer:\n\n*   ATM\n*   BRCA1\n*   BRCA2\n*   CDH1\n*   CYP19A1\n*   FGFR2\n*   H19\n*   MAP3K1\n*   NBN\n*   PTEN\n*   RAD51\n*   STK11\n*   TERT\n*   TP53\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\nThe following genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer:\n\n*   BARD1\n*   BRIP1\n*   CASP8\n*   CHEK2\n*   CTLA4\n*   LSP1\n*   MRE11\n*   PALB2\n*   RAD51C\n*   TOX3\n*   XRCC2\n*   XRCC3\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is a type of cancer that affects the breast tissue. It is one of the most common types of cancer among women.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nMost cases of breast cancer are not caused by inherited genetic factors. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations in breast cells that are acquired during a person's lifetime, and they do not cluster in families.\n\nIn hereditary breast cancer, the way that cancer risk is inherited depends on the gene involved. For example, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of breast cancer can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n* A new lump or thickening in the breast\n* Changes in the size, shape, or feel of the breast\n* Dimpling or puckering of the skin\n* Redness or scaliness of the skin\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nBreast cancer is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, mammography, and biopsy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of breast cancer depends on the stage and type of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify individuals who are at increased risk for breast cancer due to inherited genetic mutations. The most common genes associated with an increased risk of breast cancer are BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Breast cancer, familial\n* Breast carcinoma\n* Cancer of breast\n* Malignant neoplasm of breast\n* Malignant tumor of breast\n* Mammary cancer\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Breast cancer, familial male\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Breast cancer, susceptibility to\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Malignant tumor of breast\n* Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast\n* Phyllodes tumor of the breast\n* Hereditary breast cancer\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ BREAST CANCER\n\t+ BREAST-OVARIAN CANCER, FAMILIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; BROVCA1\n\t+ BREAST-OVARIAN CANCER, FAMILIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2; BROVCA2\n\n**References**\n\n* American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Statistics\n* Apostolou P, Fostira F.

While there is no single \"breast cancer gene,\" several genes have been identified as risk factors for the disease. The most well-known of these are BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are responsible for approximately 5-10% of all breast cancers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recent Research on Breast Cancer Genetics**\n\nTwo recent studies have shed new light on the genetics of breast cancer. In a study published in the Annals of Oncology, researchers found that mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The study also found that other genetic variants, such as those in the TP53 gene, may contribute to the development of breast cancer.\n\nIn another study published in Cancer, researchers used next-generation sequencing to identify genetic mutations in individuals with breast cancer. The study found that mutations in 25 different genes were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nIf you're concerned about your family history or want to learn more about the genetics of breast cancer, here are some key concepts to understand:\n\n*   **Prognosis**: The prognosis of a genetic condition refers to its potential impact on an individual's health and quality of life.\n*   **Gene variants**: Gene variants are changes in the DNA sequence that can affect an individual's risk of developing certain conditions or traits.\n*   **Inheritance patterns**: Genetic disorders can be inherited in different ways, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance.\n*   **Treatment and management**: While there is no cure for genetic disorders, many can be treated or managed with appropriate medical care and lifestyle changes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about breast cancer or genetics, here are some related health topics to explore:\n\n*   Breast Cancer\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Male Breast Cancer",

    "content": "**Breast Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast. There are two main types of breast cancer:\n\n*   **Ductal Carcinoma**: Starts in the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the breast to the nipple. Most breast cancers are of this type.\n*   **Lobular Carcinoma**: Starts in the parts of the breast, called lobules, which produce milk.\n\nIn rare cases, other kinds of breast cancer can start in other areas of the breast.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nBreast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer:\n\n*   Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as age and family history, you cannot control.\n*   The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history.\n*   Understanding your risk factors can help you take steps to lower your risk.\n\nSome women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents.\n\nGenes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly breast cancer often does not cause symptoms. This is why regular breast cancer screening is important, so cancers that don't have symptoms may be found earlier.\n\nAs the cancer grows, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Breast lump or lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt.\n*   Change in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange.\n*   Fluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus.\n\nIn men, breast cancer symptoms include breast lump, breast pain, and breast tenderness.\n\nSymptoms of advanced breast cancer may include:\n\n*   Bone pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit (next to the breast with cancer)\n*   Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will ask about your symptoms and risk factors. Then they will perform a physical exam. The exam includes both breasts, armpits, and the neck and chest area.\n\nWomen may choose to perform breast self-exams each month. However, the effectiveness of self-exams for detecting breast cancer is debatable.\n\nTests used to diagnose and monitor people with a breast lump or breast cancer may include:\n\n*   Mammography to screen for breast cancer or help identify a breast lump\n*   Breast ultrasound to show whether a lump is solid or fluid-filled\n*   Breast MRI to help better identify a breast lump or evaluate an abnormal change on a mammogram\n*   Breast biopsy, using methods such as needle aspiration or ultrasound-guided, stereotactic, or open biopsy\n*   Sentinel lymph node biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\n*   CT scan to check if the cancer has spread outside the breast\n*   PET scan to check if the cancer has spread outside the breast\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is based on many factors, including:\n\n*   The type of breast cancer\n*   The stage of the cancer (staging is a tool your providers use to find out how advanced the cancer is)\n*   Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones, mainly estrogen and progesterone\n*   Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu protein\n*   Tests on the tumor's genes to see if you would benefit from chemotherapy\n\nCancer treatments may include:\n\n*   Hormone therapy.\n*   Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.\n*   Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.\n*   Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump. A mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed during surgery.\n*   Targeted therapy which uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth. Other targeted therapy medicines are not related to hormones.\n\nCancer treatment can be local or systemic:\n\n*   Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.\n*   Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.\n\nMost women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou may experience side effects or complications from cancer treatment. These may include temporary pain or swelling of the breast and surrounding area. Ask your provider about the possible side effects from treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have a breast or armpit lump\n*   You have nipple discharge\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\nAfter being treated for breast cancer, contact your provider if you develop symptoms such as:\n\n* Nipple discharge\n* Rash on the breast\n* New lumps in the breast\n* Swelling in the area\n* Pain, especially chest pain, abdominal pain, or bone pain\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTalk to your provider about how often you should have a mammogram or other tests to screen for breast cancer. Early breast cancers found by a mammogram have a good chance of being cured.\n\nMammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.\n\n* Mammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\n* Women with a family history of breast cancer should work with their provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\n\nMammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older.\n\nTamoxifen is approved for breast cancer prevention in women age 35 and older who are at high risk. Raloxifene is approved for breast cancer prevention in women after the menopause. Discuss this with your provider.\n\nWomen at very high risk for breast cancer may consider preventive (prophylactic) mastectomy. This is surgery to remove the breasts before breast cancer is diagnosed. Possible candidates include:\n\n* Women who have already had one breast removed due to cancer\n* Women with a strong family history of breast cancer\n* Women with genes or genetic mutations that raise their risk for breast cancer (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2)\n\nMany risk factors, such as your genes and family history, cannot be controlled. But making healthy lifestyle changes may reduce your overall chance of getting cancer. This includes:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Maintaining a healthy weight\n* Limiting alcohol consumption to 1 drink per day\n\n**Causes**\n\nBreast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer:\n\nSome risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as age and family history, you cannot control.\nThe more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history.\n\nSome women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents.\n\nGenes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers.\nA screening tool with questions about your and your family's medical history can help your health care provider determine whether you are at risk for carrying these genes.\nIf you may be at high risk due to a known variant gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, a blood test can show if you carry the genes.\n\nBreast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not increase the risk for breast cancer. There is also no evidence of a direct link between breast cancer and pesticides.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly breast cancer often does not cause symptoms. This is why regular breast cancer screening is important, so cancers that don't have symptoms may be found earlier.\n\nAs the cancer grows, symptoms may include:\n\n* Breast lump or lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt.\n* Change in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange.\n* Fluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus.\n\nIn men, breast cancer symptoms include breast lump, breast pain, and breast tenderness.\n\nSymptoms of advanced breast cancer may include:\n\n* Bone pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit (next to the breast with cancer)\n* Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will ask about your symptoms and risk factors. Then they will perform a physical exam. The exam includes both breasts, armpits, and the neck and chest area.\n\nWomen may choose to perform breast self-exams each month. However, the effectiveness of self-exams for detecting breast cancer is debatable.\n\nTests used to diagnose and monitor people with a breast lump or breast cancer may include:\n\n* Mammography to screen for breast cancer or help identify a breast lump\n* Breast ultrasound to show whether a lump is solid or fluid-filled\n* Breast MRI to help better identify a breast lump or evaluate an abnormal change on a mammogram\n* Breast biopsy, using methods such as needle aspiration or ultrasound-guided, stereotactic, or open biopsy\n* Sentinel lymph node biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\n* CT scan to check if the cancer has spread outside the breast\n* PET scan to check if the cancer has spread outside the breast\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**Staging and Treatment**\n\nIf your provider learns that you do have breast cancer, more tests will be done. This is called staging, which checks if the cancer has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up. It also gives you an idea of what to expect in the future.\n\nBreast cancer stages range from 0 to IV. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is based on many factors, including:\n\n*   The type of breast cancer\n*   The stage of the cancer (staging is a tool your providers use to find out how advanced the cancer is)\n*   Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones, mainly estrogen and progesterone\n*   Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu protein\n*   Tests on the tumor's genes to see if you would benefit from chemotherapy\n\nCancer treatments may include:\n\n*   Hormone therapy.\n*   Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.\n*   Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.\n*   Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump. A mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed during surgery.\n*   Targeted therapy which uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth. Other targeted therapy medicines are not related to hormones.\n\nCancer treatment can be local or systemic:\n\n*   Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.\n*   Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.\n\nMost women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.\n\n**Stage 0**\n\nLumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.\n\n**Stage I and II**\n\nLumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.\n\n**Stage III**\n\nTreatment involves surgery, possibly preceded or followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.\n\n**Stage IV**\n\nTreatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**What is Breast Cancer?**\n\nBreast cancer is cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast.\n\n**Types of Breast Cancer**\n\nThere are two main types of breast cancer:\n\n*   Ductal carcinoma starts in the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the breast to the nipple. Most breast cancers are of this type.\n*   Lobular carcinoma starts in the parts of the breast, called lobules, which produce milk.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBreast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer:\n\n*   Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as age and family history, you cannot control.\n*   The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history.\n\n**Genetic Changes**\n\nSome women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents.\n\n*   Genes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers.\n*   A screening tool with questions about your and your family's medical history can help your health care provider determine whether you are at risk for carrying these genes.\n*   If you may be at high risk due to a known variant gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, a blood test can show if you carry the genes.\n\n**Other Risk Factors**\n\nBreast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not increase the risk for breast cancer.

All women continue to have mammograms to monitor for the return of cancer or development of another breast cancer.\n\nWomen who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer Treatment and Prevention**\n\n**Treatment Overview**\n\nAfter being diagnosed with breast cancer, treatment typically involves a combination of therapies aimed at eliminating the disease. The specific approach depends on various factors, including the stage and type of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.\n\n**Cancer Treatments May Include:**\n\n*   Surgery to remove the tumor or affected breast\n*   Radiation therapy to kill cancer cells\n*   Chemotherapy to target and destroy cancer cells throughout the body\n*   Hormone therapy to block estrogen production, which can fuel certain types of breast cancer\n\n**Treatment Goals and Outcomes**\n\nFor women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the primary objective is to treat the disease, prevent its recurrence, and improve survival rates. In contrast, the main goal for those with stage IV breast cancer is to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and enhance quality of life.\n\n**Support Groups and Outlook**\n\nJoining a cancer support group can help alleviate stress and feelings of isolation. Sharing experiences with others who have gone through similar challenges can foster a sense of community and understanding.\n\nThe prognosis for breast cancer patients has improved significantly due to advances in treatment and care. However, the disease's progression and recurrence rates remain concerns. Factors influencing outcomes include tumor location, hormone receptor status, gene expression, and tumor size and shape.\n\n**Possible Complications and When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nWomen treated for breast cancer may experience side effects or complications from therapy, such as temporary pain or swelling in the affected area. It is essential to discuss potential side effects with a healthcare provider.\n\nIf symptoms like nipple discharge, rash on the breast, new lumps, swelling, or pain (including chest, abdominal, or bone pain) arise after treatment, patients should contact their provider promptly.\n\n**Prevention and Screening**\n\nRegular mammograms are crucial for early breast cancer detection. The American Cancer Society recommends annual screening starting at age 45 for women with an average risk of breast cancer. Women with a family history or other risk factors may need to begin screenings earlier or more frequently.\n\nTamoxifen and raloxifene are approved for breast cancer prevention in high-risk individuals, while preventive mastectomy may be considered for those with a strong family history or genetic predisposition.\n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle through balanced diet, regular exercise, and moderate alcohol consumption can also help reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\n**Screening and Prevention**\n\nMammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.\n\n* Mammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\n* Women with a family history of breast cancer should work with their provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\n\n**Risk Factors and Prevention**\n\nMany risk factors, such as your genes and family history, cannot be controlled. But making healthy lifestyle changes may reduce your overall chance of getting cancer. This includes:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Maintaining a healthy weight\n* Limiting alcohol consumption to 1 drink per day\n\n**Preventive Measures**\n\nTamoxifen is approved for breast cancer prevention in women age 35 and older who are at high risk. Raloxifene is approved for breast cancer prevention in women after the menopause. Discuss this with your provider.\n\nWomen at very high risk for breast cancer may consider preventive (prophylactic) mastectomy. This is surgery to remove the breasts before breast cancer is diagnosed. Possible candidates include:\n\n* Women who have already had one breast removed due to cancer\n* Women with a strong family history of breast cancer\n* Women with genes or genetic mutations that raise their risk for breast cancer (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2)\n\n**References**\n\nHarnden K, Mauro L, Pennisi A.

    "content": "**Breast Enlargement in Males**\n\nWhen an abnormal amount of breast tissue develops in males, it is called gynecomastia. It is essential to determine if the excess growth in the area of the breast is breast tissue or not excess fat tissue (lipomastia).\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe condition may occur in one or both breasts. It begins as a small lump beneath the nipple, which may be tender. One breast may be larger than the other. Over time the lump may become less tender and feel harder.\n\nEnlarged breasts in males are usually harmless but may cause men to avoid wearing certain clothing or not want to be seen without a shirt. This can cause significant distress, particularly in young men.\n\nSome newborns may have breast development along with a milky discharge (galactorrhea). This condition usually lasts for a couple of weeks to months. In rare cases, it may last until the child is 1 year old.\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men. There are other causes as well.\n\n*   **Hormone Changes**: Breast enlargement is usually caused by an imbalance of estrogen (female hormone) and testosterone (male hormone). Males have both types of hormones in their body. Changes in the levels of these hormones, or in how the body uses or responds to these hormones, can cause enlarged breasts in males.\n*   **Health Conditions**: Certain health problems can cause breast growth in adult men, including:\n    *   Chronic liver disease\n    *   Kidney failure and dialysis\n    *   Low testosterone level\n    *   Obesity (also the most common cause of breast growth due to fat)\n    Rare causes include:\n    *   Genetic variants\n    *   Overactive thyroid or underactive thyroid\n    *   Tumors (including benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called prolactinoma)\n*   **Medicines and Medical Treatment**: Some medicines and treatments that can cause breast growth in men include:\n    *   Cancer chemotherapy\n    *   Hormone treatment for prostate cancer, such as bicalutamide\n    *   Treatment for an enlarged prostate, such as finasteride (Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart)\n    *   Treatment for hair loss with finasteride (Propecia)\n    *   Radiation treatment of the testicles\n    *   HIV/AIDS medicines\n    *   Corticosteroids and anabolic steroids\n    *   Estrogen (including those in soy products)\n    *   Heartburn and ulcer medicines, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or proton pump inhibitors\n    *   Anti-anxiety medicines, such as diazepam (Valium)\n    *   Heart medicines, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), digoxin (Lanoxin), amiodarone, and calcium channel blockers\n    *   Antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral)\n    *   Antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl)\n    *   Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil)\n    *   Herbal remedies such as lavender, tea tree oil, and dong quai\n    *   Opioids\n\n**Drug and Alcohol Use**\n\nUsing certain substances can cause breast enlargement:\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Amphetamines\n*   Heroin\n*   Marijuana\n*   Methadone\n\nGynecomastia has also been linked to exposure to endocrine disrupters. These are common chemicals often found in plastics.\n\nMen who have enlarged breasts may have an increased risk for breast cancer. Breast cancer in men is rare. Signs that may suggest breast cancer include:\n\n*   One-sided breast growth\n*   Firm or hard breast lump that feels like it is attached to the tissue\n*   Skin sore over the breast\n*   Bloody discharge from the nipple\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFor swollen breasts that are tender, applying cold compresses may help. Ask your health care provider if it's OK to take pain relievers.\n\nOther tips include:\n\n*   Stop taking all recreational drugs, such as marijuana\n*   Stop taking all nutritional supplements or any medicines you are taking for bodybuilding\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have recent swelling, pain, or enlargement in one or both breasts\n*   There is dark or bloody discharge from the nipples\n*   There is a skin sore or ulcer over the breast\n*   A breast lump feels hard or firm\n\nIf your son has breast growth but has not yet reached puberty, have him checked by a provider.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and perform a physical examination.\n\nYou may not need any tests, but the following tests may be done to check for certain diseases:\n\n*   Blood hormone level tests\n*   Breast ultrasound\n*   Liver and kidney function studies\n*   Mammogram\n\n**Treatment**\n\nOften no treatment is needed. Breast growth in newborns and young boys often goes away on its own.\n\nIf a medical condition is causing the problem, your provider will treat that condition.\n\nYour provider will talk with you about medicines or substances that may cause breast growth. Stopping their use or changing medicines may make the problem go away. Do not stop taking any medicines before talking to your provider.\n\nBreast growth that is large, uneven, or does not go away may cause a decrease in quality of life. Treatments that may be used in this situation are:\n\n*   Hormone treatment that blocks the effects of estrogens\n*   Breast reduction surgery to remove the breast tissue\n\nGynecomastia that has been present for a long time is less likely to resolve even if the right treatment is started.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGynecomastia; Breast enlargement in a male\n\n---\n\n**Breast Enlargement in Males**\n\nWhen an abnormal amount of breast tissue develops in males, it is called gynecomastia. It is important to find out if the excess growth in the area of the breast is breast tissue and not excess fat tissue (lipomastia).\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men. There are other causes as well.\n\n*   **Hormone Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during puberty, aging, or certain medical conditions can lead to gynecomastia.\n*   **Medical Conditions**: Chronic liver disease, kidney failure, low testosterone levels, obesity, genetic variants, overactive or underactive thyroid, and tumors (such as prolactinoma) can cause breast growth in adult men.\n*   **Medicines and Treatments**: Certain medications, including cancer chemotherapy, hormone treatment for prostate cancer, and treatments for hair loss, can contribute to gynecomastia.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe condition may occur in one or both breasts.

There are other causes as well.\n\n**Hormone Changes**\n\n*   Breast enlargement is usually caused by an imbalance of estrogen (female hormone) and testosterone (male hormone).\n*   In newborns, breast growth is caused by being exposed to estrogen from the mother.\n*   In preteens and teens, breast growth is caused by normal hormone changes that occur during puberty.\n*   In men, hormone changes due to aging can cause breast growth.\n\n**Health Conditions**\n\nCertain health problems can cause breast growth in adult men, including:\n\n*   Chronic liver disease\n*   Kidney failure and dialysis\n*   Low testosterone level\n*   Obesity (also the most common cause of breast growth due to fat)\n\nRare causes include:\n\n*   Genetic variants\n*   Overactive thyroid or underactive thyroid\n*   Tumors (including benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called prolactinoma)\n\n**Medicines and Medical Treatment**\n\nSome medicines and treatments that can cause breast growth in men include:\n\n*   Cancer chemotherapy\n*   Hormone treatment for prostate cancer, such as bicalutamide\n*   Treatment for an enlarged prostate, such as finasteride (Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart)\n\nTreatment for hair loss with finasteride (Propecia)\n\nRadiation treatment of the testicles\n\nHIV/AIDS medicines\n\nCorticosteroids and anabolic steroids\n\nEstrogen (including those in soy products)\n\nHeartburn and ulcer medicines, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or proton pump inhibitors\n\nAnti-anxiety medicines, such as diazepam (Valium)\n\nHeart medicines, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), digoxin (Lanoxin), amiodarone, and calcium channel blockers\n\nAntifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral)\n\nAntibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl)\n\nTricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil)\n\nHerbal remedies such as lavender, tea tree oil, and dong quai\n\nOpioids\n\n**Drug and Alcohol Use**\n\nUsing certain substances can cause breast enlargement:\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Amphetamines\n*   Heroin\n*   Marijuana\n*   Methadone\n\nGynecomastia has also been linked to exposure to endocrine disrupters. These are common chemicals often found in plastics.\n\n**Increased Risk for Breast Cancer**\n\nMen who have enlarged breasts may have an increased risk for breast cancer. Breast cancer in men is rare. Signs that may suggest breast cancer include:\n\n*   One-sided breast growth\n*   Firm or hard breast lump that feels like it is attached to the tissue\n*   Skin sore over the breast\n*   Bloody discharge from the nipple\n\n---\n\n**Breast Enlargement in Males**\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and perform a physical examination.\n\nYou may not need any tests, but the following tests may be done to check for certain diseases:\n\n*   Blood hormone level tests\n*   Breast ultrasound\n*   Liver and kidney function studies\n*   Mammogram\n\n**TREATMENT**\n\nOften no treatment is needed. Breast growth in newborns and young boys often goes away on its own.\n\nIf a medical condition is causing the problem, your provider will treat that condition.\n\nYour provider will talk with you about medicines or substances that may cause breast growth. Stopping their use or changing medicines may make the problem go away. Do not stop taking any medicines before talking to your provider.\n\nBreast growth that is large, uneven, or does not go away may cause a decrease in quality of life. Treatments that may be used in this situation are:\n\n*   Hormone treatment that blocks the effects of estrogens\n*   Breast reduction surgery to remove the breast tissue\n\nGynecomastia that has been present for a long time is less likely to resolve even if the right treatment is started.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have recent swelling, pain, or enlargement in one or both breasts\n*   There is dark or bloody discharge from the nipples\n*   There is a skin sore or ulcer over the breast\n*   A breast lump feels hard or firm\n\nIf your son has breast growth but has not yet reached puberty, have him checked by a provider.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGynecomastia; Breast enlargement in a male",

    "content": "**Breast Lift**\n\nA breast lift, or mastopexy, is cosmetic breast surgery to lift the breasts. The surgery may also involve changing the position of the areola and nipple.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nCosmetic breast surgery can be done at an outpatient surgery clinic or in a hospital.\n\nYou will likely receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free. Or, you may receive medicine to help you relax and local anesthesia to numb the area around the breasts to block pain. You will be awake but unable to feel pain.\n\nThe surgeon will make 1 to 3 surgical cuts (incision) in your breast. Extra skin, and sometimes some breast tissue, will be removed and your nipple and areola may be moved.\n\nSometimes, women have breast augmentation (enlargement with implants) when they have a breast lift.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nCosmetic breast surgery is surgery you choose to have. You do not need it for medical reasons.\n\nWomen usually have breast lifts to lift sagging, loose breasts. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and normal aging may cause a woman to have stretched skin and smaller breasts.\n\nYou should probably wait to have a breast lift if you are:\n\n* Planning to lose weight\n* Pregnant or still nursing a child\n* Planning to have more children\n\nTalk with a plastic surgeon if you are considering cosmetic breast surgery. Discuss how you expect to look and feel better. Keep in mind that the desired result is improvement, not perfection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of breast surgery are:\n\n* Inability to nurse a baby after surgery\n* Large scars that take a long time to heal\n* Loss of sensation around the nipples\n* One breast that is larger or shaped slightly differently than the other (asymmetry of the breasts)\n* Uneven position of the nipples\n\nThe emotional risks of surgery may include feeling that both breasts do not look perfectly balanced or they may not look like what you expected.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAsk your surgeon if you need a screening mammogram based on your age and risk of having breast cancer. This should be done long enough before surgery so if more imaging or a biopsy is needed, your planned surgery date won't be delayed.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse:\n\n* If you are or could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nThe week or two before surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to stop taking blood thinning medicines. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), and others.\n* Ask your surgeon which drugs you should still take on the day of surgery.\n* If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your health care provider for help quitting.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n* Take the drugs your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Wear or bring loose clothing that buttons or zips in front.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Lift: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Emotional Risks of Surgery**\n\nThe emotional risks of surgery may include feeling that both breasts do not look perfectly balanced or they may not look like what you expected.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAsk your surgeon if you need a screening mammogram based on your age and risk of having breast cancer.

Or, you will wear a surgical bra. Wear the surgical bra or a soft supportive bra for as long as your surgeon tells you to. This will likely be for several weeks.\n\nDrainage tubes may be attached to your breasts. These will be removed in the office within a few days.\n\nYour pain should decrease in a few weeks. Ask your surgeon if you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to help with pain instead of a narcotic medicine. If you do use a narcotic medicine, be sure to take it with food and plenty of water. Do not apply ice or heat to your breasts unless your doctor has told you that is OK.\n\nAsk your surgeon when it is OK to shower or bathe.\n\nFollow any other self-care instructions you are given.\n\nSchedule a follow-up visit with your surgeon. At that time, you will be checked for how you are healing. Sutures (stitches) will be removed if needed.\n\nYou may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou are likely to have a very good outcome from breast surgery. You may feel better about your appearance and yourself.\n\nScars are permanent and are often very visible for up to a year after surgery. After a year, they may fade but will not become invisible. Your surgeon will try to place the cuts so that scars are hidden from view. Surgical cuts are usually made on the underside of the breast and around the edge of the areola.

    "content": "**Breast Lump Removal**\n\n**Description**\n\nBreast lump removal is surgery to remove a lump that may be a breast cancer. Tissue around the lump is also removed. This surgery is called an excisional breast biopsy, or lumpectomy.\n\nWhen a noncancerous tumor such as a fibroadenoma of the breast is removed, this is also called an excisional breast biopsy, or a lumpectomy.\n\nSometimes, the health care provider cannot feel the lump when examining you. However, it can be seen on imaging results, such as a mammogram or ultrasound. In this case, a wire localization will be done before the surgery.\n\nA radiologist will use a mammogram or ultrasound to place a needlewire (or needlewires) in or near the abnormal breast area.\nThis will help the surgeon know where the lump is so that it can be removed.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nSurgery to remove a breast cancer is most often the first step in treatment.\n\nThe choice of which surgery is best for you can be difficult. It may be hard to know whether lumpectomy or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast) is best. You and the providers who are treating your breast cancer will decide together. In general:\n\nLumpectomy is often preferred for smaller breast lumps. This is because it is a smaller procedure and it has about the same chance of curing breast cancer as a mastectomy. It is a good option as you get to keep most of your breast tissue that has not been affected by cancer.\nMastectomy to remove all breast tissue may be done if the area of cancer is too large or there are multiple tumors which cannot be removed without deforming the breast.\n\nYou and your provider should consider:\n\n* The size of your tumor\n* Where it is in your breast\n* If there is more than one tumor\n* How much of the breast is affected\n* The size of your breasts in relation to the tumor\n* Your age\n* Your family history\n* Your general health, including whether you have reached menopause\n* If you are pregnant\n* If you are not a candidate for additional treatment such as radiation\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for surgery are:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n* Poor wound healing\n* Heart attack, stroke, death\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Risks associated with general anesthesia\n\nThe appearance of your breast may change after surgery. You may notice dimpling, a scar, or a difference in shape between your breasts. Also, areas of the breast may be numb, such as near the scar, or the nipple.\n\nYou may need another procedure to remove more breast tissue if tests show the cancer is too close to the edge of the tissue already removed.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your provider:\n\n* If you could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription\n* Any allergies you may have, including medicines, foods and latex or rubber\n* Reactions to anesthesia in the past\n\nDuring the days before your surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot. Be sure to ask your surgeon which medicines should be stopped, and for how long before your procedure.\nAsk your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop for at least 2 weeks prior to the surgery. Your provider can help.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe recovery period is very short for a simple lumpectomy. Many women have little pain, but if you do feel pain, you can take pain medicine, such as acetaminophen.\n\nYour skin should heal in about a month. You will need to take care of the surgical cut area. Change dressings as your provider tells you to. Watch for signs of infection when you get home (such as redness, swelling, or drainage from the incision). Wear a comfortable bra that provides good support, such as a sports bra. You may need to put some gauze over the incision so that the bra does not irritate it.\n\nYou may need to empty a fluid drain a few times a day for 1 to 2 weeks. You may be asked to measure and record the amount of fluid drained. Your provider will remove the drain later.\n\nMost women can go back to their usual activities in a week or so. Avoid heavy lifting, jogging, or activities that cause pain in the surgical area for 1 to 2 weeks. Check with your surgeon prior to driving, or going back to work.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of a lumpectomy for breast cancer depends mostly on the size of the cancer, as well as the make up of the tumor. It also depends on its spread to lymph nodes underneath your arm.\n\nA lumpectomy for breast cancer is most often followed by radiation therapy and other treatments such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both.\n\nIn most cases, you do not need a breast reconstruction after lumpectomy.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Lump Removal**\n\n**What is Breast Lump Removal?**\n\nBreast lump removal, also known as lumpectomy or excisional breast biopsy, is a surgical procedure to remove a lump that may be a breast cancer. Tissue around the lump is also removed.\n\n**When is Breast Lump Removal Performed?**\n\nSurgery to remove a breast cancer is most often the first step in treatment. The choice of which surgery is best for you can be difficult. It may be hard to know whether lumpectomy or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast) is best. You and your provider will decide together.\n\n**Types of Breast Lump Removal**\n\nThere are two main types of breast lump removal:\n\n*   **Lumpectomy**: This is often preferred for smaller breast lumps. It is a smaller procedure and has about the same chance of curing breast cancer as a mastectomy.\n*   **Mastectomy to Remove All Breast Tissue**: This may be done if the area of cancer is too large or there are multiple tumors which cannot be removed without deforming the breast.\n\n**Risks Associated with Breast Lump Removal**\n\nThe risks for surgery are:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Poor wound healing\n*   Heart attack, stroke, death\n*   Reactions to medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your provider:\n\n*   If you could be pregnant\n*   What medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription\n*   Any allergies you may have, including medicines, foods and latex or rubber\n*   Reactions to anesthesia in the past\n\n**During the Days Before Your Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot. Be sure to ask your surgeon which medicines should be stopped, and for how long before your procedure.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions about eating or drinking before surgery. Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe recovery period is very short for a simple lumpectomy. Many women have little pain, but if you do feel pain, you can take pain medicine, such as acetaminophen. Your skin should heal in about a month. You will need to take care of the surgical cut area.

You will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep, but pain free) or local anesthesia (you are lightly sedated and pain free). The procedure takes about 1 hour.\n\nThe surgeon makes a small cut on your breast. The lump and some of the normal breast tissue around it is removed. If a lump is known to be cancerous, a pathologist examines a sample of the removed tissue to make sure all the cancer has been taken out.\n\nWhen no cancer cells are found near the edges of the removed tissue, it is called a clear margin.\nYour surgeon may also remove some or all of the lymph nodes in your armpit to see if the cancer has spread to them. \n\nOften, small metal clips will be placed inside the breast to mark the area of tissue removal, especially if there is a concern for cancer. This makes the area easy to see on future mammograms. It also helps guide radiation therapy, when needed.\n\nThe surgeon will close your skin with stitches or staples. These may dissolve or need to be removed later. Rarely, a drain tube may be placed to remove extra fluid. Your surgeon will send the lump to the pathologist for more testing.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nSurgery to remove a breast cancer is most often the first step in treatment.\n\nThe choice of which surgery is best for you can be difficult.

The surgeon will make an incision in the breast, remove the lump and some surrounding tissue, and then close the incision with stitches.\n\n**Why It's Done (Purpose)**\n\nThe purpose of a lumpectomy is to remove a breast lump that may be cancerous. By removing the lump, the surgeon can help prevent the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\n**How It's Performed (Description)**\n\nA lumpectomy is typically performed under general anesthesia, which means you will be asleep during the procedure. The surgeon will make an incision in the breast, remove the lump and some surrounding tissue, and then close the incision with stitches.\n\n**Recovery (Aftercare)**\n\nAfter a lumpectomy, you may experience some pain, swelling, and bruising in the breast area. Your doctor may prescribe pain medication to help manage any discomfort. You should also follow your doctor's instructions for caring for your surgical wound.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of a lumpectomy depends on several factors, including the size of the cancer, the type of cancer, and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. In some cases, radiation therapy may be necessary after a lumpectomy to help kill any remaining cancer cells.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Lumpectomy\n* Wide local excision\n* Breast conservation surgery\n* Breast-sparing surgery\n* Partial mastectomy\n* Segmental resection\n* Tylectomy\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* Follow your doctor's instructions for caring for your surgical wound.\n* Take any prescribed medication as directed.\n* Attend follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your recovery.\n\n**Images**\n\n* Female breast\n* Open biopsy of the breast\n* Breast self-exam\n* Breast lumps\n* Lumpectomy\n* Causes of breast lumps\n* Breast lump removal - series\n* Core needle biopsy of the breast\n\n**References**\n\n* American Cancer Society website.

This tissue responds to hormone changes. Because of this, lumps can come and go.\n\n**Causes of Breast Lumps**\n\nLumps in a woman are most often either fibroadenomas or cysts, or just normal variations in breast tissue known as fibrocystic changes.\n\n*   Fibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. This is a benign condition that does not increase your risk for breast cancer.\n*   Fibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery.\n*   Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes.\n\n**Other Causes of Breast Lumps**\n\nBreast cancer.\nInjury. Blood may collect and feel like a lump called a hematoma if your breast gets badly bruised.\nLipoma. This is a collection of fatty tissue.\nMilk cysts (sacs filled with milk). These cysts can occur with breastfeeding.\nBreast abscess. These typically occur if you are breastfeeding or have recently given birth, but can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSee your provider if you have any new lumps or breast changes. Ask about your risk factors for breast cancer, and screening and prevention for breast cancer.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   The skin on your breast appears dimpled or wrinkled (like the peel of an orange).\n*   You find a new breast lump during self-exam.\n*   You have bruising on your breast but did not experience any injury.\n*   You have nipple discharge, especially if it is bloody, clear like water, or pinkish (blood-tinged).\n*   Your nipple is inverted (turned inward) but normally is not inverted.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will get a complete history from you. You will be asked about your factors that may increase your risk for breast cancer. Your provider will perform a thorough breast exam. If you don't know how to perform a breast self-exam, and want to do this, ask your provider to teach you the proper method.\n\nYou may be asked medical history questions such as:\n\n*   When and how did you first notice the lump?\n*   Do you have other symptoms such as pain, nipple discharge, or fever?\n*   Where is the lump located?\n*   Do you do breast self-exams, and is this lump a recent change?\n*   Have you had any type of injury to your breast?\n*   Are you taking any hormones, medicines, or supplements?\n\nSteps your provider may take next include:\n\n*   Ordering a mammogram to look for cancer, or a breast ultrasound to see if the lump is solid or a cyst.\n*   Using a needle to draw fluid out of a cyst. The fluid is usually discarded and does not need to be examined under a microscope.\n*   Ordering a needle biopsy, which is often done by a radiologist.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nHow a breast lump is treated depends on the cause.\n\n*   Solid breast lumps are usually biopsied with a needle by the radiologist. Depending upon the situation, they might be removed with surgery. They can also be monitored over time by your provider.\n*   Cysts can be drained in your provider's office. If the lump disappears after it is drained, you do not need further treatment. If the lump does not disappear or comes back, you might need to be rechecked with exam and imaging.\n*   Breast infections are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes a breast abscess needs to be drained with a needle or surgically drained.\n*   If you are diagnosed with breast cancer, you will discuss your options carefully and thoroughly with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Lump**\n\nA breast lump is swelling, growth, or mass in the breast.\n\n**Breast Lumps in Men and Women**\n\nBreast lumps in both men and women raise concern for breast cancer, even though most lumps are not cancer.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nBoth males and females of all ages have normal breast tissue. This tissue responds to hormone changes. Because of this, lumps can come and go.\n\n* **Infants**: Both male and female infants may have breast lumps from their mother's estrogen when they are born. The lump will most often go away on its own as the estrogen clears from the baby's body.\n* **Young Girls**: Young girls often develop \"breast buds,\" which appear just before the beginning of puberty. These bumps may be tender. They are common around age 9, but may happen as early as age 6.\n* **Teenage Boys**: Teenage boys may develop breast enlargement and lumps because of hormone changes in mid-puberty. Although this may be upsetting to boys, the lumps or growth almost always go away on their own over a period of months.\n\n**Causes**\n\nLumps in a woman are most often either fibroadenomas or cysts, or just normal variations in breast tissue known as fibrocystic changes.\n\n* **Fibrocystic Changes**: Fibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. This is a benign condition that does not increase your risk for breast cancer. Symptoms are most often worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts.\n* **Fibroadenomas**: Fibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery. They move easily inside the breast tissue and are usually not tender. They occur most often during the reproductive years.\n* **Cysts**: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, often just before your menstrual period.\n\n**Other Causes of Breast Lumps**\n\nBreast cancer.\nInjury.

Although this may be upsetting to boys, the lumps or growth almost always go away on their own over a period of months.\n\n**Causes**\n\nLumps in a woman are most often either fibroadenomas or cysts, or just normal variations in breast tissue known as fibrocystic changes.\n\nFibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. This is a benign condition that does not increase your risk for breast cancer. Symptoms are most often worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts.\n\nFibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery. They move easily inside the breast tissue and are usually not tender. They occur most often during the reproductive years. These lumps do not have cancer or become cancerous except in rare cases.\n\nCysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, often just before your menstrual period. Ultrasound can determine if a lump is a cyst. It can also reveal whether it is a simple, complicated, or complex cyst.\n\nSimple cysts are just sacs filled with fluid. They do not need to be removed and may go away on their own. If a simple cyst is growing or causing pain, it can be aspirated.\n\nA complicated cyst has a little bit of debris in the fluid and can either be watched with ultrasound or the fluid can be drained.\n\nA complex cyst looks more worrisome on ultrasound. Your provider may recommend either a follow up ultrasound or a needle biopsy. Depending on the results, the cyst may be monitored with ultrasound exams or removed surgically.\n\nOther causes of breast lumps include:\n\n* Breast cancer.\n* Injury. Blood may collect and feel like a lump called a hematoma if your breast gets badly bruised. These lumps tend to get better on their own in a few days or weeks. If they do not improve, your provider may have to drain the blood.\n* Lipoma. This is a collection of fatty tissue.\n* Milk cysts (sacs filled with milk). These cysts can occur with breastfeeding.\n* Breast abscess. These typically occur if you are breastfeeding or have recently given birth, but can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSee your provider if you have any new lumps or breast changes. Ask about your risk factors for breast cancer, and screening and prevention for breast cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Lump**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* The skin on your breast appears dimpled or wrinkled (like the peel of an orange).\n* You find a new breast lump during self-exam.\n* You have bruising on your breast but did not experience any injury.\n* You have nipple discharge, especially if it is bloody, clear like water, or pinkish (blood-tinged).\n* Your nipple is inverted (turned inward) but normally is not inverted.\n\nAlso make contact if:\n\n* You are a woman, age 20 or older, and want guidance on how to perform a breast self-exam.\n* You are a woman age 40 or older and have not had a mammogram in the past year for advice about screening for breast cancer.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will get a complete history from you. You will be asked about your factors that may increase your risk for breast cancer. Your provider will perform a thorough breast exam. If you don't know how to perform a breast self-exam, and want to do this, ask your provider to teach you the proper method.\n\nYou may be asked medical history questions such as:\n\n* When and how did you first notice the lump?\n* Do you have other symptoms such as pain, nipple discharge, or fever?\n* Where is the lump located?\n* Do you do breast self-exams, and is this lump a recent change?\n* Have you had any type of injury to your breast?\n* Are you taking any hormones, medicines, or supplements?\n\nSteps your provider may take next include:\n\n* Ordering a mammogram to look for cancer, or a breast ultrasound to see if the lump is solid or a cyst.\n* Using a needle to draw fluid out of a cyst. The fluid is usually discarded and does not need to be examined under a microscope.\n* Ordering a needle biopsy, which is often done by a radiologist.\n\nHow a breast lump is treated depends on the cause.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBreast mass; Breast nodule; Breast tumor\n\n**Images**\n\nFemale breast\n    Breast lumps\n    Fibrocystic breast change\n    Fibroadenoma\n    Breast lump removal  - series\n    Causes of breast lumps\n    Core needle biopsy of the breast\n\n---\n\n**Breast Lump**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a breast lump?**\n\nA breast lump, also known as a breast mass or tumor, is an abnormal growth in the breast tissue. It can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Breast Lumps**\n\nBreast lumps can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   **Fibrocystic breast change**: A condition characterized by lumpy or rope-like breast tissue.\n*   **Fibroadenoma**: A benign tumor made up of glandular and fibrous tissues.\n*   **Cysts**: Fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breast.\n*   **Infection**: Bacterial or fungal infections can cause breast lumps.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Breast Lumps**\n\nTo diagnose a breast lump, your doctor may perform:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A thorough check of the breast to feel for any abnormalities.\n*   **Mammogram**: An X-ray image of the breast tissue to detect any changes or tumors.\n*   **Ultrasound**: A non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the breast tissue.\n*   **Biopsy**: A procedure where a sample of breast tissue is removed and examined for cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment for a breast lump depends on its cause and severity. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Removing the lump or affected breast tissue.\n*   **Medications**: Antibiotics to treat infections, hormone therapies to manage cysts, or chemotherapy to treat cancer.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and getting regular mammograms can help reduce the risk of developing breast lumps.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile some breast lumps cannot be prevented, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being aware of any changes in your breast tissue can help detect problems early on. If you notice any unusual changes or symptoms, consult with your doctor promptly.",

    "content": "**Breast Milk - Pumping and Storing**\n\nBreast milk is the best nutrition for your baby. Learn to pump, collect, and store breast milk. You can continue to give your baby breast milk when you return to work. Talk to a lactation consultant, also called a breastfeeding expert, for help if you need it.\n\n**Be Prepared**\n\nTake time for you and your baby to learn and get good at breastfeeding. Before you go back to work, establish your milk supply. Take care of yourself so you make plenty of breast milk. Try to:\n\n* Breastfeed or pump on a regular schedule\n* Drink plenty of fluids\n* Eat healthy\n* Get plenty of rest\n\n**Giving Your Baby a Bottle**\n\nWait until your baby is 3 to 4 weeks old to try a bottle. This gives you and your baby time to get good at breastfeeding first.\n\nYour baby has to learn to suck from a bottle. Here are ways to help your baby learn to take a bottle:\n\n* Give your baby a bottle while your baby is still calm, before hunger starts.\n* Have someone else give your baby the bottle. This way, your baby is not confused as to why you are not breastfeeding.\n* Leave the room when someone is giving your baby a bottle. Your baby can smell you and will wonder why you are not breastfeeding.\n\nStart bottle feeding about 2 weeks before you go back to work so your baby has time to get used to it.\n\n**Plan How You Will Pump Milk at Work**\n\nBuy or rent a breast pump. If you start to pump before you go back to work, you can build up a supply of frozen milk.\n\nThere are many breast pumps on the market. Pumps may be hand-operated (manual), battery-operated, or electric. You can rent hospital-quality pumps at a medical supply store.\n\nMost mothers find electric pumps the best. They create and release suction on their own, and you can easily learn to use one.\n\nEither a lactation consultant or the nurses at the hospital can help you buy or rent a pump. They can also teach you how to use it.\n\nFigure out where you can pump at work. Ideally, there is a quiet, private room you can use.\n\nFind out if your workplace has pump rooms for working moms. They often have a comfortable chair, sink, and electric pump.\n\nIf pumping at work is going to be hard, build up a store of breast milk before you go back. You can freeze breast milk to give to your baby later.\n\n**Pump, Collect, and Store Breast Milk**\n\nPump 2 to 3 times a day when you are at work. As your baby gets older, you probably will not have to pump as often to keep up your milk supply.\n\nCollect breast milk when pumping. You can use:\n\n* 2- to 3-ounce (60 to 90 milliliters) bottles or hard plastic cups with screw-on caps\n* Heavy duty bags that fit into a bottle\n\nDo not use everyday plastic bags or formula bottle bags. They leak.\n\nStore your breast milk.\n\nDate the milk before storing it.\nFresh breast milk can be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours, and refrigerated for 4 days.\n\nYou can keep frozen milk:\n\n* In a freezer compartment inside the refrigerator for 2 weeks\n* In a separate door refrigerator/freezer for up to 3 to 4 months\n* In a deep freezer at constant 0 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 months\n\nDo not add fresh breast milk to frozen milk.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Milk - Pumping and Storing**\n\nBreast milk is the best nutrition for your baby. Learning to pump, collect, and store breast milk will help you continue to give your baby breast milk even after you return to work.\n\n**Be Prepared**\n\nTake time for you and your baby to learn and get good at breastfeeding before you go back to work.

Thawed milk can be refrigerated and used for up to 24 hours, but do not refreeze.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Milk - Pumping and Storing**\n\nWhen you're at work, pumping breast milk is a crucial step in maintaining your milk supply. As your baby gets older, you may not need to pump as frequently, but it's still essential to collect and store your milk properly.\n\n**Collecting Breast Milk**\n\nTo collect breast milk, you'll need:\n\n* 2- to 3-ounce (60 to 90 milliliters) bottles or hard plastic cups with screw-on caps\n* Heavy-duty bags that fit into a bottle\n\nMake sure these containers are washed in hot, soapy water and rinsed well. Avoid using everyday plastic bags or formula bottle bags, as they tend to leak.\n\n**Storing Breast Milk**\n\nDate the milk before storing it. Fresh breast milk can be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours and refrigerated for 4 days. You can store frozen milk in:\n\n* A freezer compartment inside the refrigerator for 2 weeks\n* A separate door refrigerator/freezer for up to 3 to 4 months\n* A deep freezer at constant 0 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 months\n\nRemember not to add fresh breast milk to frozen milk.\n\n**Thawing and Using Breast Milk**\n\nTo thaw frozen milk:\n\n1. Put it in the refrigerator\n2. Soak it in a bowl of warm water\n\nThawed milk can be refrigerated and used for up to 24 hours. Do not refreeze. When leaving breast milk with a child care provider, label the container with your child's name and the date.\n\n**Do Not Microwave Breast Milk**\n\nAvoid microwaving breast milk, as overheating destroys nutrients and can cause \"hot spots\" that may burn your baby. Bottles may also explode when microwaved for too long.\n\n**Nursing and Bottle Feeding**\n\nIf you're nursing as well as bottle feeding:\n\n1. Nurse your baby before leaving for work in the morning and right when you get home.\n2. Expect your baby to nurse more often in the evenings and weekends when you are home. Feed on-demand when you are with your baby.\n3. Have your child care provider give your baby bottles of breast milk when you are at work.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, meaning no other food, drinks, or formula. If you use formula, still breastfeed and give as much breast milk as you can. The more breast milk your baby gets, the better. Supplementing with too much formula will decrease your milk supply.\n\nYou can ask your health care provider about medicines and remedies to help increase your milk supply.\n\n**References**\n\n* Louis-Jacques A, Lawrence RM, Lawrence RA.

    "content": "**Breast Reconstruction - Implants**\n\nAfter a mastectomy, some women choose to have surgery to remake their breast. This type of surgery is called breast reconstruction. It can be performed at the same time as mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or later (delayed reconstruction).\n\n**The Breast Reconstruction Process**\n\nThe breast is usually reshaped in two stages, or surgeries. During the first stage, a tissue expander is used. An implant is placed during the second stage. Sometimes, the implant is inserted in the first stage.\n\n**Description of the Procedure**\n\nIf you are having reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy, your surgeon may do either of the following:\n\n*   **Skin-sparing mastectomy**: This means a small area of skin is removed along with the nipple and areola (the pigmented area around the nipple).\n*   **Nipple-sparing mastectomy**: This means all of the skin, the nipple, and areola are kept.\n\nIn either case, skin is left to make reconstruction easier.\n\n**The Two-Stage Breast Reconstruction Process**\n\nBreast reconstruction with implants is usually done in two stages, or surgeries. During the surgeries, you will receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\n\nIn the first stage:\n\n*   The surgeon creates a pouch under your chest muscle.\n*   A small tissue expander is placed in the pouch. The expander is balloon-like and made of silicone.\n*   A valve is placed below the skin of the breast. The valve is connected by a tube to the expander. (The tube stays below the skin in your breast area.)\n*   Your chest still looks flat right after this surgery.\n\nStarting about 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, you see your surgeon every 1 or 2 weeks. During these visits, your surgeon injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through the valve into the expander.\n\nOver time, the expander slowly enlarges the pouch in your chest to the right size for the surgeon to place an implant.\n\nWhen it reaches the right size, you will wait 1 to 3 months before the permanent breast implant is placed during the second stage.\n\n**The Second Stage of Breast Reconstruction**\n\nIn the second stage:\n\n*   The surgeon removes the tissue expander from your chest and replaces it with a breast implant. This surgery takes 1 to 2 hours.\n*   Before this surgery, you will have talked with your surgeon about the different kinds of breast implants. Implants may be filled with either saline or a silicone gel.\n\nYou may have another minor procedure later that remakes the nipple and areola area.\n\n**Why Breast Reconstruction is Performed**\n\nYou and your surgeon will decide together about whether to have breast reconstruction, and when to have it.\n\nHaving breast reconstruction does not make it harder to find a tumor if your breast cancer comes back.\n\nGetting breast implants does not take as long as breast reconstruction that uses your own tissue. You will also have fewer scars. But, the size, fullness, and shape of the new breasts are more natural with reconstruction that uses your own tissue.\n\n**Risks of Breast Reconstruction**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of breast reconstruction with implants are:\n\n*   The implant may break or leak. If this happens, you will need more surgery.\n*   A scar may form around the implant in your breast. If the scar becomes tight, your breast may feel hard and cause pain or discomfort. This is called capsular contracture. You will need more surgery if this happens.\n*   Infection soon after surgery. You will need to have the expander or the implant removed.\n*   Breast implants can shift. This will cause a change in the shape of your breast.\n*   One breast may be larger than the other (asymmetry of the breasts).\n*   You may have a loss of sensation around the nipple and areola.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon if you are taking any medicines including supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to stop taking blood thinning medicines. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), and others.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk for problems. Ask your health care provider for help quitting.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may be able to go home the same day as the surgery. Or, you will need to stay in the hospital overnight.\n\nYou may still have drains in your chest when you go home. Your surgeon will remove them later during an office visit. You may have pain around your cuts after surgery. Follow instructions about taking pain medicine.\n\nFluid may collect under the incision. This is called a seroma. It is fairly common. A seroma may go away on its own. If it does not go away, it may need to be drained by the surgeon during an office visit.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nResults of this surgery are usually very good. It is nearly impossible to make a reconstructed breast look exactly the same as the remaining natural breast. You may need more \"touch up\" procedures to get the result you want.\n\nReconstruction will not restore normal sensation to the breast or the new nipple.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBreast implants surgery; Mastectomy - breast reconstruction with implants; Breast cancer - breast reconstruction with implants\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reconstruction with Implants**\n\nIf you are having breast reconstruction later, your surgeon will remove enough skin over your breast during the mastectomy to be able to close the skin flaps and make the chest look as smooth and flat as possible.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nBreast reconstruction with implants is usually done in two stages, or surgeries. During the surgeries, you will receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\n\nIn the first stage:\n\n*   The surgeon creates a pouch under your chest muscle.\n*   A small tissue expander is placed in the pouch. The expander is balloon-like and made of silicone.\n*   A valve is placed below the skin of the breast. The valve is connected by a tube to the expander. (The tube stays below the skin in your breast area.)\n*   Your chest still looks flat right after this surgery.\n\nStarting about 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, you see your surgeon every 1 or 2 weeks. During these visits, your surgeon injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through the valve into the expander. Over time, the expander slowly enlarges the pouch in your chest to the right size for the surgeon to place an implant.\n\nWhen it reaches the right size, you will wait 1 to 3 months before the permanent breast implant is placed during the second stage.\n\nIn the second stage:\n\n*   The surgeon removes the tissue expander from your chest and replaces it with a breast implant. This surgery takes 1 to 2 hours.\n*   Before this surgery, you will have talked with your surgeon about the different kinds of breast implants. Implants may be filled with either saline or a silicone gel.\n\nYou may have another minor procedure later that remakes the nipple and areola area.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nYou and your surgeon will decide together about whether to have breast reconstruction, and when to have it.\n\nHaving breast reconstruction does not make it harder to find a tumor if your breast cancer comes back.\n\nGetting breast implants does not take as long as breast reconstruction that uses your own tissue. You will also have fewer scars. But, the size, fullness, and shape of the new breasts are more natural with reconstruction that uses your own tissue.\n\nMany women choose not to have breast reconstruction or implants. They may use a prosthesis (an artificial breast) in their bra that gives them a natural shape, or they may choose to use nothing at all.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of breast reconstruction with implants are:\n\n*   The implant may break or leak. If this happens, you will need more surgery.\n*   A scar may form around the implant in your breast. If the scar becomes tight, your breast may feel hard and cause pain or discomfort. This is called capsular contracture. You will need more surgery if this happens.\n*   Infection soon after surgery. You will need to have the expander or the implant removed.\n*   Breast implants can shift. This will cause a change in the shape of your breast.\n*   One breast may be larger than the other (asymmetry of the breasts).\n*   You may have a loss of sensation around the nipple and areola.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon if you are taking any medicines including supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to stop taking blood thinning medicines. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), and others.\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk for problems. Ask your health care provider for help quitting.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n*   Follow instructions about not eating or drinking and about showering before you go to the hospital.\n*   Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may be able to go home the same day as the surgery. Or, you will need to stay in the hospital overnight.\n\nYou may still have drains in your chest when you go home. Your surgeon will remove them later during an office visit. You may have pain around your cuts after surgery. Follow instructions about taking pain medicine.\n\nFluid may collect under the incision. This is called a seroma. It is fairly common. A seroma may go away on its own. If it does not go away, it may need to be drained by the surgeon during an office visit.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nResults of this surgery are usually very good. It is nearly impossible to make a reconstructed breast look exactly the same as the remaining natural breast. You may need more \"touch up\" procedures to get the result you want.\n\nReconstruction will not restore normal sensation to the breast or the new nipple.\n\nHaving breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer can improve your sense of well-being and your quality of life.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reconstruction with Implants**\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nBreast reconstruction with implants is usually done in two stages, or surgeries. During the surgeries, you will receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\n\n**First Stage**\n\nThe surgeon creates a pouch under your chest muscle.\nA small tissue expander is placed in the pouch.

    "content": "**Breast Reconstruction - Natural Tissue**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Breast Reconstruction?**\n\nBreast reconstruction is a type of surgery that remakes your breast after a mastectomy. It can be performed at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or later (delayed reconstruction).\n\n**Types of Breast Reconstruction**\n\nDuring breast reconstruction with natural tissue, the breast is reshaped using muscle, skin, or fat from another part of your body.\n\n* **Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator Flap (DIEP or DIEAP)**: This procedure involves taking skin and fat from your lower belly to create a new breast.\n* **Latissimus Muscle Flap**: This procedure involves taking muscle, skin, and fat from your upper back to create a new breast.\n* **Gluteal Flap**: This procedure involves taking skin, fat, and possibly muscle from your buttocks to create a new breast.\n* **Transverse Upper Gracilis Flap (TUG)**: This procedure involves taking skin, fat, and muscle from your thigh to create a new breast.\n* **Transverse Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous Flap (TRAM)**: This procedure involves taking skin, fat, and muscle from your lower belly to create a new breast.\n\n**Preparation for Surgery**\n\nBefore the procedure:\n\n* Tell your surgeon if you are taking any medicines, including supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n* Stop taking blood thinning medicines one week before surgery.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking may slow healing and increase the risk for problems.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of breast reconstruction with natural tissue are:\n\n* Loss of sensation around the nipple and areola\n* Noticeable scar\n* One breast is larger than the other (asymmetry of the breasts)\n* Loss of the flap because of problems with blood supply, requiring more surgery to save the flap or to remove it\n* Bleeding into the area where the breast used to be, sometimes requiring a second surgery to control the bleeding\n\n**Recovery**\n\nYou will stay in the hospital for 2 to 5 days. Your recovery time at home will be much longer compared to other reconstruction procedures.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reconstruction with Natural Tissue**\n\nAfter a mastectomy, some women choose to have surgery to remake their breast. This type of surgery is called breast reconstruction. It can be performed at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or later (delayed reconstruction).\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring breast reconstruction that uses natural tissue, the breast is reshaped using muscle, skin, or fat from another part of your body.\n\nIf you are having breast reconstruction at the same time as mastectomy, the surgeon may do either of the following:\n\n* Skin-sparing mastectomy. This means that the nipple and areola and a small area of skin around it is removed.\n* Nipple-sparing mastectomy. This means all of the skin, nipple, and areola (the pigmented skin around the nipple) are kept.\n\nIn either case, skin is left to make reconstruction easier.\n\nIf you will have breast reconstruction later, the surgeon can still do skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy. If you are not sure about having reconstruction, the surgeon will remove the nipple and enough skin to make the chest wall as smooth and flat as possible.\n\n**Types of Breast Reconstruction**\n\nThe following types of breast reconstruction include:\n\n* Deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (DIEP or DIEAP)\n* Latissimus muscle flap\n* Gluteal flap\n* Transverse upper gracilis flap (TUG)\n* Transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap (TRAM)\n\n**Procedure Details**\n\nFor any of these procedures, you will have general anesthesia. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\n\nFor TRAM surgery:\n\n* The surgeon makes a cut (incision) across your lower belly, from one hip to the other.\n* Your scar will be hidden later by most clothing and bathing suits.\n* The surgeon loosens skin, fat, and muscle in this area. This tissue is then tunneled under the skin of your abdomen up to the breast area to create your new breast.\n\nFor latissimus muscle flap with a breast implant:\n\n* The surgeon makes a cut in your upper back, on the side of your breast that was removed.\n* The surgeon loosens skin, fat, and muscle from this area. This tissue is then tunneled under your skin to the breast area to create your new breast.\n\nFor a DIEP or DIEAP flap:\n\n* The surgeon makes a cut across your lower belly. Skin and fat from this area is loosened.\n* This tissue is then placed in your breast area to create your new breast.\n\nFor a gluteal flap:\n\n* The surgeon makes a cut in your buttocks. Skin, fat, and possibly muscle from this area are loosened.\n* This tissue is placed in your breast area to create your new breast.\n\nFor a TUG flap:\n\n* The surgeon makes a cut in your thigh. Skin, fat, and muscle from this area are loosened.\n* This tissue is placed in your breast area to create your new breast.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nResults of this surgery are usually very good.

Or, the nipple and areola can be created with a tattoo.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reconstruction - Natural Tissue**\n\n**When Breast Reconstruction is Done**\n\n*   If you are having breast reconstruction at the same time as mastectomy, the entire surgery may last 8 to 10 hours. When it is done as a second surgery, it may take up to 12 hours.\n\n**Types of Breast Reconstruction**\n\n*   For any of these procedures, you will have general anesthesia.\n*   For TRAM surgery:\n    *   The surgeon takes tissue from your lower abdomen and moves it to your chest to create the new breast.\n*   For latissimus muscle flap with a breast implant:\n    *   The surgeon takes tissue from your back and uses it to cover a breast implant in your chest.\n*   For a DIEP or DIEAP flap:\n    *   The surgeon takes tissue from your lower abdomen, including fat, skin, and blood vessels, and moves it to your chest to create the new breast.\n*   For a gluteal flap:\n    *   The surgeon takes tissue from your buttocks and uses it to create the new breast.\n*   For a TUG flap:\n    *   The surgeon takes tissue from your lower abdomen and uses it to create the new breast.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nYou and your surgeon will decide together about whether to have breast reconstruction and when. The decision depends on many different factors.\n\nHaving breast reconstruction does not make it harder to find a tumor if your breast cancer comes back.\n\nThe advantage of breast reconstruction with natural tissue is that the remade breast is softer and more natural than breast implants. The size, fullness, and shape of the new breast can be closely matched to your other breast.\n\nBut muscle flap procedures are more complicated than placing breast implants. You may need blood transfusions during the procedure. You will usually spend 2 or 3 more days in the hospital after this surgery compared to other reconstruction procedures. Also, your recovery time at home will be much longer.\n\nSome women choose not to have breast reconstruction or implants. They may use a prosthesis (an artificial breast) in their bra that gives a natural shape. Or, they may choose to use nothing at all.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of breast reconstruction with natural tissue are:\n\n*   Loss of sensation around the nipple and areola\n*   Noticeable scar\n*   One breast is larger than the other (asymmetry of the breasts)\n*   Loss of the flap because of problems with blood supply, requiring more surgery to save the flap or to remove it\n*   Bleeding into the area where the breast used to be, sometimes requiring a second surgery to control the bleeding\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon if you are taking any medicines, including supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking blood thinning medicines.

Often the areola is made smaller.\n*   The surgeon closes the cuts with stitches to reshape the breast.\n*   Sometimes liposuction is combined with breast reduction to improve the shape of the breast and armpit areas.\n\nThe procedure can last 2 to 5 hours.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nBreast reduction may be recommended if you have very large breasts (macromastia) and:\n\n*   Chronic pain that affects your quality of life. You may be having headaches, neck pain, or shoulder pain.\n*   Chronic nerve problems caused by poor posture, which result in numbness or tingling in your arms or hands.\n*   Cosmetic problems, such as persistent bra-strap groove, scar-like lines in the skin (striae), difficulty finding clothes that fit, and low self-confidence.\n*   Chronic rashes under your breasts.\n*   Unwelcome attention that is making you feel awkward.\n*   Inability to participate in sports.\n\nSome women may benefit from non-surgical treatments, such as:\n\n*   Exercising to strengthen their back and shoulder muscles\n*   Losing excess weight\n*   Wearing supportive bras\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reduction**\n\nAre you tired of feeling self-conscious about your large breasts? Do you struggle with chronic rashes, low self-confidence, or difficulty finding clothes that fit? You may benefit from breast reduction surgery.\n\n**When to Consider Surgery**\n\nSome women may benefit from non-surgical treatments, such as:\n\n* Exercising to strengthen their back and shoulder muscles\n* Losing excess weight\n* Wearing supportive bras\n\nBreast reduction may be recommended if you have very large breasts (macromastia) and experience symptoms like:\n\n* Chronic rashes under your breasts\n* Unwelcome attention that makes you feel awkward\n* Inability to participate in sports\n\n**Risks**\n\nAs with any surgery, there are risks associated with breast reduction. These include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n* Difficulty breastfeeding or being unable to breastfeed\n* Large scars that take a long time to heal\n* Loss of feeling in the nipple area\n* Uneven position of the nipples or differences in the size of the breasts\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore surgery, be sure to:\n\n* Ask your surgeon if you need a screening mammogram based on your age and risk of having breast cancer.\n* Tell your surgeon or nurse if you are or could be pregnant and what medicines you are taking.\n\nThe week or two before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking blood thinning medicines. If you smoke, try to quit, as smoking slows healing and increases the risk for problems.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Wear loose clothing that buttons or zips in front. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may go home the same day or stay overnight in the hospital. A gauze dressing (bandage) will be wrapped around your breasts and chest, or you will wear a surgical bra. Wear the surgical bra or a soft supportive bra for as long as your surgeon tells you to. Drainage tubes may be attached to your breasts and removed within a few days.\n\nYour pain should decrease in a few weeks. Ask your surgeon if you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to help with pain instead of a narcotic medicine. Follow any other self-care instructions you are given, including when it is OK to shower or bathe.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou are likely to have a very good outcome from breast reduction surgery. You may feel better about your appearance and be more comfortable with various activities. Pain or skin symptoms, such as striation, may disappear. You may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months for comfort and to help with healing.\n\n---\n\n**Breast Reduction**\n\nYou are likely to have a very good outcome from breast reduction surgery. You may feel better about your appearance and be more comfortable with various activities.\n\nPain or skin symptoms, such as striation, may disappear. You may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months for comfort and to help with healing.\n\n**Scars**\n\nScars are permanent. They will be more visible for the first year, but will then fade. The surgeon will make every effort to place the surgical cuts so that scars are hidden. Cuts are usually made on the underside of the breast and around the areola. Most of the time, the scars should not be noticeable, even in low-cut clothing.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou are likely to have a very good outcome from breast reduction surgery.

    "content": "**Breast Self-Exam**\n\nA breast self-exam is something a woman does at home to look for changes or problems in her breast tissue. Many women feel that doing this is important to their health.\n\nHowever, experts do not agree about the benefits of breast self-exams in finding breast cancer or saving lives. Talk to your health care provider about whether breast self-exams are right for you.\n\n**Information**\n\nThe best time to do a monthly breast self-exam is about 3 to 5 days after your period starts. Do it at the same time every month. Your breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time in your monthly cycle.\n\nIf you have gone through menopause, do your exam on the same day every month.\n\nBegin by lying on your back. It is easier to examine all breast tissue if you are lying down.\n\nPlace your right hand behind your head. With the middle fingers of your left hand, gently yet firmly press down using small motions to examine the entire right breast.\n\nNext, sit or stand. Feel your armpit, because breast tissue goes into that area.\n\nGently squeeze the nipple, checking for discharge. Repeat the process on the left breast.\n\nUse one of the patterns shown in the diagram to make sure that you are covering all of the breast tissue.\n\nNext, stand in front of a mirror with your arms by your side.\n\nLook at your breasts directly and in the mirror. Look for changes in skin texture, such as dimpling, puckering, indentations, or skin that looks like an orange peel.\n\nAlso note the shape and outline of each breast.\n\nCheck to see if the nipple turns inward.\n\nDo the same with your arms raised above your head.\n\nYour goal is to get used to the feel of your breasts. This will help you to find anything new or different.

Some foods may flavor your breast milk, but babies are often not bothered by this.\n\nIf your baby is fussy after you eat a certain food or spice, avoid that food for a while. Try it again later to see if it is a problem.\n\n**Caffeine, Alcohol, Smoking, and Breastfeeding**\n\nSmall amounts of caffeine will not hurt your baby.\n\nLimit your caffeine intake. Keep your coffee or tea at 1 cup (240 milliliters) per day.\n\nIf you drink larger amounts of caffeine, your baby may get agitated and have trouble sleeping.\n\nLearn how your baby reacts to caffeine. Some babies may react to even 1 cup (240 milliliters) of coffee or tea a day. If that happens, stop drinking beverages with caffeine.\n\nAvoid alcohol.\n\nAlcohol affects your milk.\n\nIf you choose to drink, limit yourself to 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of alcohol a day.\n\nTalk to your health care provider about drinking alcohol and breastfeeding.\n\nTry not to smoke.

Most of the time, this is safe and OK for your baby.\n\nTalk with your provider about any medicines you take. Do not stop taking your medicine without first speaking to your provider.\n\nAsk about medicines that are OK to take while you are breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Drugs keeps a list of these medicines. Your provider can look at the list and talk to you about medicines you take when breastfeeding.\n\n**Breastfeeding and Contraception**\n\nYou can get pregnant when breastfeeding. Do not use breastfeeding for birth control.\n\nYou are less likely to get pregnant while breastfeeding if:\n\n* Your baby is younger than 6 months old.\n* You are breastfeeding only, and your baby does not take any formula.\n* You have not yet had a menstrual period after having your baby.\n\nTalk to your provider about birth control. Be aware that some birth control pills with estrogen may decrease your milk supply. You have lots of other choices. Condoms, diaphragm, progesterone-only pills or shots, and IUDs are safe and effective.\n\nBreastfeeding delays the return of normal menstrual periods. Your ovaries will make an egg before you have your period so you can get pregnant before your periods begin again.\n\n---\n\n**Breastfeeding - Self-Care**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Eating for Breastfeeding**\n\nTo produce milk, you need to eat a balanced diet that includes:\n\n*   **Milk foods**: Eat at least 4 servings each day. Examples include:\n    *   1/2 cup (60 grams) cooked pasta\n    *   1/2 cup (80 grams) cooked rice\n    *   1 cup (60 grams) cereal\n    *   1 slice bread\n*   **Protein-rich foods**: Eat at least 3 servings each day. Examples include:\n    *   1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) oil\n    *   1 tablespoon (15 grams) low-fat mayo\n    *   2 tablespoons (30 grams) light salad dressing\n*   **Fruits**: Eat 2 to 4 servings each day. Examples include:\n    *   1 medium apple\n    *   1 banana\n    *   1 cup mixed berries\n*   **Vegetables**: Eat at least 3 to 5 servings each day. Examples include:\n    *   1 cup cooked carrots\n    *   1 cup cooked broccoli\n    *   1 cup salad with low-fat dressing\n*   **Grains**: Eat about 6 servings each day. Examples include:\n    *   1 slice whole-grain bread\n    *   1/2 cup cooked oatmeal\n    *   1 cup cooked brown rice\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Caffeine, Alcohol, Smoking, and Breastfeeding**\n\n*   **Caffeine**: Small amounts are safe for your baby. Limit your intake to 1 cup (240 milliliters) per day.\n*   **Alcohol**: Avoid it altogether. If you choose to drink, limit yourself to 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of alcohol a day.\n*   **Smoking**: Quit smoking as soon as possible. Smoking increases your risks for preterm birth, stillbirth, and having a smaller-than-normal baby.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Medicines and Breastfeeding**\n\nMany medicines pass into mother's milk. Most of the time, this is safe and OK for your baby. Talk with your provider about any medicines you take. Do not stop taking your medicine without first speaking to your provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breastfeeding and Contraception**\n\nYou can get pregnant when breastfeeding. Do not use breastfeeding for birth control. You are less likely to get pregnant while breastfeeding if:\n\n*   Your baby is younger than 6 months old.\n*   You are breastfeeding only, and your baby does not take any formula.\n*   You have not yet had a menstrual period after having your baby.\n\nTalk to your provider about birth control. Be aware that some birth control pills with estrogen may decrease your milk supply. You have lots of other choices. Condoms, diaphragm, progesterone-only pills or shots, and IUDs are safe and effective.\n\n---\n\n**Breastfeeding - Self-Care**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Lactation**\n\nLactation is a complex process that involves the production and secretion of milk by the mammary glands. The physiology of lactation is influenced by hormonal changes, particularly the increase in estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy. As the baby grows, the breasts undergo changes to prepare for milk production.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breastfeeding Benefits**\n\nBreastfeeding provides numerous benefits for both mother and baby. For mothers, breastfeeding can help with uterine contraction after delivery, reduce bleeding, and promote bonding with the baby. For babies, breastfeeding offers essential nutrients, antibodies, and a reduced risk of infections and diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Self-Care Tips for Breastfeeding Mothers**\n\nTo ensure a successful breastfeeding experience, mothers should prioritize self-care. This includes:\n\n*   Getting enough rest and taking breaks when needed\n*   Eating a balanced diet rich in protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients\n*   Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water\n*   Managing stress through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation\n*   Seeking support from healthcare providers, lactation consultants, or online communities\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Resources for Breastfeeding Support**\n\nFor mothers seeking additional guidance on breastfeeding, the following resources are available:\n\n*   Office on Women's Health website: [www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding](http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding)\n*   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) breastfeeding guidelines\n*   Local lactation consultants or breastfeeding support groups\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review and Update**\n\nThis article was reviewed by LaQuita Martinez, MD, and updated on November 8, 2024.",

This is normal if your nipples have always been indented inward and can easily point out when you touch them. If your nipples are pointing in, and this is new, contact your provider right away.\n* Skin puckering or dimpling. This can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection. Often, there is no known reason. You should see your provider but most of the time this does not need treatment.\n* Warm to the touch, red, or painful breast. This is caused by an infection in your breast. See your provider for treatment.\n* Scaly, flaking, itchy skin. This is most often eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection.

Keep your nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.\n* If you have cracked nipples, apply 100% pure lanolin after feedings.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you notice unusual changes in your skin and nipples. Your provider will talk to you about your medical history and the recent changes you have noticed in your breasts and nipples.

These changes are usually harmless and resolve on their own within a few weeks.\n\n**Causes of Skin and Nipple Changes**\n\n*   **Stretch marks**: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause your skin to stretch, leading to the formation of stretch marks.\n*   **Mastitis**: This is an inflammation of the breast tissue that can cause pain, swelling, and redness. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection.\n*   **Engorgement**: When your milk comes in, your breasts may become swollen and tender. This is a normal response to breastfeeding.\n\n**Self-Care Tips**\n\n*   **Keep an eye out for signs of infection**: If you notice any redness, swelling, or pus around your nipple or breast, seek medical attention immediately.\n*   **Practice good hygiene**: Wash your hands before touching your breasts or nipples to prevent the spread of infection.\n*   **Take care of your overall health**: Eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and get enough rest to help your body recover from childbirth.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\n*   If you experience severe pain, swelling, or redness around your nipple or breast\n*   If you notice any signs of infection, such as pus or discharge\n*   If you have a fever over 101.5°F (38.6°C)\n\nRemember, most skin and nipple changes are harmless and resolve on their own within a few weeks. However, if you're concerned about your symptoms or experience any severe discomfort, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider.",

    "content": "**Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding**\n\nAs a new parent, you have many important decisions to make. One is to choose whether to breastfeed your baby or bottle feed using infant formula.\n\n**Benefits of Breastfeeding**\n\n*   Breast milk naturally has all the nutrients babies need to grow and develop.\n*   Breast milk has antibodies that can help prevent your baby from getting sick.\n*   Breastfeeding can help prevent health problems in your baby, such as allergies, eczema, ear infections, and stomach problems.\n*   Breastfed babies are less likely to be hospitalized with breathing infections.\n*   Breastfed babies are less likely to become obese or have diabetes.\n*   Breastfeeding may help prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n*   Mothers who breastfeed find it easier to lose weight after pregnancy.\n*   Breastfeeding may help lower the risk for breast and ovarian cancers, diabetes, and certain other diseases in mothers.\n\n**Preparing to Breastfeed**\n\nIt is true that breastfeeding is not always easy and natural for moms and babies. It can take a little time for you both to get the hang of it. It is important to know this up front, so that you can make sure you have all the support and commitment you need if a problem does come up.\n\n**Breastfeeding and Work**\n\nIt is easier than ever before to work and continue to breastfeed. Allowing women to breastfeed often leads to less missed time due to illness, and decreased employee turnover.\n\n**Overcoming Breastfeeding Problems**\n\nCertain problems can get in the way of breastfeeding for some moms:\n\n*   Breast tenderness and nipple soreness. This is normal in the first week.\n*   Breast engorgement or fullness.\n*   Plugged milk ducts.\n*   Not enough milk for the baby's needs.\n\nIt is well worth doing all you can to overcome breastfeeding challenges. Most mothers find that the early struggles pass quickly, and they settle into a workable and enjoyable feeding routine with their little one.\n\n**Health and Safety Issues**\n\nIf you are a smoker, it is still a good idea to breastfeed. Breast milk can help to cancel out some of the risks to your baby from exposure to smoking. If you smoke cigarettes, smoke after breastfeeding, so your baby gets the least amount of nicotine.\n\nIt is safe to breastfeed your baby if you have hepatitis B or hepatitis C. If your nipples are cracked or bleeding, you should stop nursing. Express your milk and throw it away until your breasts heal.\n\nMothers who should not breastfeed include those who:\n\n*   Have HIV or AIDS, as they can pass the virus to their baby by breastfeeding.\n*   Are taking certain medicines needed to treat ongoing health problem. If you take medicines for a health problem, ask your provider if it is still safe to breastfeed.\n*   Have an alcohol or drug addiction.\n\n**Bottle Feeding Your Baby**\n\nThere is no question that it is best to feed your baby breast milk for as long as you possibly can, even if it is just for the first few months or so. A small number of mothers are not able to breastfeed. This can be hard to accept, but it does not make you a bad mom. Infant formula is still a healthy choice, and your baby will get all the necessary nutrients.\n\nIf you choose to feed your baby formula, there are some benefits:\n\n*   Anyone can feed your baby. Grandparents or babysitters can feed your baby while you work or get some well-deserved time with your partner.\n*   You can get round-the-clock help. Your partner can help out with nighttime feedings so you can get more sleep. This can be a bonus for your partner, giving them the chance to bond early on with their little one.\n\nRemember that everything you do as a mother, your love, attention, and care, will help give your baby the best start in life.\n\n---\n\n**Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding**\n\nAs a new parent, you have many important decisions to make. One is to choose whether to breastfeed your baby or bottle feed using infant formula.\n\n**Health Experts Agree**\n\nHealth experts agree that breastfeeding is the healthiest option for both mom and baby. They recommend that babies feed only on breast milk for the first 6 months, and then continue to have breast milk as a main part of their diet until they are at least 1 and better 2 years old.\n\n**Benefits of Breastfeeding**\n\nBreastfeeding is a wonderful way to bond with your little one. Here are some of the many other benefits of breastfeeding:\n\n*   **Nutrients**: Breast milk naturally has all the nutrients babies need to grow and develop.\n*   **Antibodies**: Breast milk has antibodies that can help prevent your baby from getting sick.\n*   **Health problems**: Breastfeeding can help prevent health problems in your baby, such as allergies, eczema, ear infections, and stomach problems.\n*   **Hospitalization**: Breastfed babies are less likely to be hospitalized with breathing infections.\n*   **Obesity and diabetes**: Breastfed babies are less likely to become obese or have diabetes.\n*   **SIDS**: Breastfeeding may help prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n*   **Weight loss**: Mothers who breastfeed find it easier to lose weight after pregnancy.\n*   **Cancer risk**: Breastfeeding may help lower the risk for breast and ovarian cancers, diabetes, and certain other diseases in mothers.\n\n**Preparing to Breastfeed**\n\nIt is true that breastfeeding is not always easy and natural for moms and babies.

Allowing women to breastfeed often leads to less missed time due to illness, and decreased employee turnover.\n\n*   **Laws**: Hourly workers eligible for overtime pay who work for companies with more than 50 employees are required by law to be given the time and a place to pump.\n*   **Employer support**: Some employers provide a comfortable place for mothers to pump milk.\n\n**Overcoming Breastfeeding Problems**\n\nCertain problems can get in the way of breastfeeding for some moms:\n\n*   **Breast tenderness and nipple soreness**: This is normal in the first week. It can also take a couple of weeks for mother and baby to learn how to breastfeed.\n*   **Breast engorgement or fullness**: This can be uncomfortable, but it's a sign that your milk is coming in.\n*   **Plugged milk ducts**: These can cause pain and discomfort, but they're usually easy to treat.\n*   **Not enough milk**: Though many women worry about this, it is rare that a mother will produce too little milk.\n\n**Health and Safety Issues**\n\nIf you are a smoker, it is still a good idea to breastfeed.

It can take a little time for you both to get the hang of it. Skin to skin contact at birth will help you and your baby get a good start with breastfeeding. Ask your health care provider to put your baby on your chest, if everyone is healthy and stable after birth.\n\nBeing a new parent takes time, and feeding is no exception to this rule. Breastfed babies will sometimes eat every hour for a while, before they take a long nap. Try to nap when your baby does. If you need a longer break, you can also express milk (by hand or pump) and have someone else feed the breast milk to your baby.\n\nYou do not need to follow a special diet when you breastfeed.

This does not include salaried employees, though most employers will follow these practices. Some states have even broader breastfeeding laws.\n\nBut not all mothers are able to pump their breasts on the job so they can continue to breastfeed. Certain jobs, such as driving a bus or waiting tables, may make it hard to stick to a regular pumping schedule. If you have more than one job or if you travel for work, finding a place and time to pump and store milk may be hard. And, while some employers provide a comfortable place for mothers to pump milk, not all do.\n\n**Overcoming Breastfeeding Problems**\n\nCertain problems can get in the way of breastfeeding for some moms:\n\n*   Breast tenderness and nipple soreness.

    "content": "**Breath Alcohol Test**\n\nA breath alcohol test determines how much alcohol is in your blood by measuring the amount of alcohol in the air you breathe out (exhale).\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are many brands of breath alcohol tests, each using a different method to test the level of alcohol in the breath. The machine may be electronic or manual.\n\nOne common tester is the balloon type: blow up the balloon with one breath until it's full, then release the air into a glass tube filled with bands of yellow crystals. The bands change colors (from yellow to green) depending on the alcohol content. Carefully read the instructions before using the test to ensure an accurate result.\n\nIf an electronic alcohol meter is used, follow the instructions that come with the meter.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nWait 15 minutes after drinking an alcoholic beverage and 1 minute after smoking before starting the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is no discomfort.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nWhen you drink alcohol, the amount of alcohol in your blood goes up. This is called your blood-alcohol level. The breath alcohol test helps you know how much alcohol it takes to raise the blood-alcohol level to a dangerous level.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal is when the blood alcohol level is zero.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nWith the balloon method:\n\n* 1 green band means that the blood-alcohol level is 0.05% or lower\n* 2 green bands mean a level between 0.05% and 0.10%\n* 3 green bands mean a level between 0.10% and 0.15%\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with a breath alcohol test.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe test does not measure the driving abilities of a person. Driving abilities vary among people with the same blood-alcohol level. Some people with a level below 0.05% may not be able to safely drive. For people who only drink sometimes, judgment problems occur at a level of just 0.02%.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAlcohol test - breath\n\n---\n\n**Breath Alcohol Test**\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nWhen you drink alcohol, the amount of alcohol in your blood goes up. This is called your blood-alcohol level.\n\n*   When the amount of alcohol in the blood reaches 0.02% to 0.03%, you may feel a relaxing \"high.\"\n*   When that percentage reaches 0.05% to 0.10%, you have:\n    *   Reduced muscle coordination\n    *   A longer reaction time\n    *   Impaired judgment and responses\n\nDriving and operating machinery when you're \"high\" or drunk (intoxicated) is dangerous. A person with an alcohol level of 0.08% and above is considered legally drunk in most states.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal is when the blood alcohol level is zero.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nWith the balloon method:\n\n*   1 green band means that the blood-alcohol level is 0.05% or lower\n*   2 green bands mean a level between 0.05% and 0.10%\n*   3 green bands mean a level between 0.10% and 0.15%\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with a breath alcohol test.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe test does not measure the driving abilities of a person.

    "content": "**Breath Odor**\n\nUnpleasant breath odor is commonly called bad breath.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nBad breath is usually related to poor dental hygiene. Not brushing and flossing regularly causes sulfur compounds to be released by bacteria in the mouth.\n\nSome disorders will produce distinct breath odors. Some examples are:\n\n* A fruity odor to the breath is a sign of ketoacidosis, which may occur in diabetes. It is a potentially life-threatening condition.\n* Breath that smells like feces can occur with prolonged vomiting, especially when there is a bowel obstruction. It may also occur temporarily if a person has a tube placed through the nose or mouth to drain their stomach.\n* The breath may have an ammonia-like odor (also described as urine-like or \"fishy\") in people with chronic kidney failure.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBad breath may be caused by:\n\n* Abscessed tooth\n* Gum surgery\n* Alcoholism\n* Cavities\n* Dentures\n* Eating certain foods, such as cabbage, garlic, or raw onions\n* Coffee and poorly pH-balanced diet\n* Object stuck in the nose (usually happens in kids); often a white, yellow, or bloody discharge from one nostril\n* Gum disease (gingivitis, gingivostomatitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG))\n* Impacted tooth\n* Poor dental hygiene\n* Tonsils with deep crypts and sulfur granules\n* Sinus infection\n* Throat infection\n* Tobacco smoking\n* Vitamin supplements (especially in large doses)\n* Some medicines, including insulin shots, triamterene, and paraldehyde\n\nSome diseases that may cause unpleasant breath odor are:\n\n* Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG)\n* Acute necrotizing ulcerative mucositis\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n* Acute renal failure\n* Bowel obstruction\n* Bronchiectasis\n* Chronic kidney failure\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Gastric carcinoma\n* Gastrojejunocolic fistula\n* Hepatic encephalopathy\n* Diabetic ketoacidosis\n* Lung infection or abscess\n* Ozena, or atrophic rhinitis\n* Periodontal disease\n* Pharyngitis\n* Zenker diverticulum\n\n**Home Care**\n\nUse proper dental hygiene, especially flossing. Remember that mouthwashes are not effective in treating the underlying problem.\n\nFresh parsley or a strong mint is often an effective way to fight temporary bad breath. Avoid smoking.\n\nOtherwise, follow your health care provider's instructions to treat any underlying cause of bad breath.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Breath odor does not go away and there is not an obvious cause (such as smoking or eating foods that cause the odor).\n* You have breath odor and signs of a respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or face pain with discharge from your nose.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and perform a physical exam.\n\nYou may be asked the following medical history questions:\n\n* Is there a specific odor (such as fish, ammonia, fruit, feces, or alcohol)?\n* Have you recently eaten a spicy meal, garlic, cabbage, or other \"odorous\" food?\n* Do you take vitamin supplements?\n* Do you smoke?\n* What home care and oral hygiene measures have you tried? How effective are they?\n* Have you had a recent sore throat, sinus infection, tooth abscess, or other illness?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nThe physical exam will include a thorough inspection of your mouth and nose. A throat culture may be taken if you have a sore throat or mouth sores.\n\nIn rare cases, tests that may be performed include:\n\n* Blood tests to check for diabetes or kidney failure\n* Endoscopy (EGD)\n* X-ray of the abdomen\n* X-ray of the chest\n\nAntibiotics may be prescribed for some conditions. For an object in the nose, your provider will use an instrument to remove it.\n\n---\n\n**Breath Odor**\n\nBad breath is usually related to poor dental hygiene. Not brushing and flossing regularly causes sulfur compounds to be released by bacteria in the mouth.\n\nSome disorders will produce distinct breath odors.

    "content": "**Breath Sounds**\n\n_Breathing Problems, Lung Diseases_\n\nBreath sounds are the noises produced by the structures of the lungs during breathing.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe lung sounds are best heard with a stethoscope. This is called auscultation.\n\nNormal lung sounds occur in all parts of the chest area, including above the collarbones and at the bottom of the rib cage.\n\nUsing a stethoscope, the health care provider may hear normal breathing sounds, decreased or absent breath sounds, and abnormal breath sounds.\n\nAbsent or decreased sounds can mean:\n\n* Air or fluid in or around the lungs (such as pneumonia, heart failure, and pleural effusion)\n* Increased thickness of the chest wall\n* Over-inflation of a part of the lungs (emphysema can cause this)\n* Reduced airflow to part of the lungs\n\nThere are several types of abnormal breath sounds. The four most common are:\n\n* **Rales**: Small clicking, bubbling, or rattling sounds in the lungs. They are heard when a person breathes in (inhales). They are believed to occur when air opens closed air spaces. Rales can be further described as moist, dry, fine, and coarse.\n* **Rhonchi**: Sounds that resemble snoring. They occur when air is blocked or air flow becomes rough through the large airways.\n* **Stridor**: Wheeze-like sound heard when a person breathes. Usually it is due to a blockage of airflow in the windpipe (trachea) or in the back of the throat.\n* **Wheezing**: High-pitched sounds produced by narrowed airways. They are most often heard when a person breathes out (exhales). Wheezing and other abnormal sounds can sometimes be heard without a stethoscope.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCauses of abnormal breath sounds may include:\n\n* Acute bronchitis\n* Asthma\n* Bronchiectasis\n* Chronic bronchitis\n* Congestive heart failure\n* Emphysema\n* Interstitial lung disease\n* Foreign body obstruction of the airway\n* Pneumonia\n* Pulmonary edema\n* Tracheobronchitis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek medical care right away if you have:\n\n* Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin)\n* Nasal flaring\n* Severe trouble breathing or shortness of breath\n\nContact your provider if you have wheezing or other abnormal breathing sounds.\n\nYour provider will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your medical history and your breathing. Questions may include:\n\n* When did the breath sound start?\n* How long did it last?\n* How would you describe your breathing?\n* What makes it better or worse?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nThe provider usually discovers abnormal breath sounds. You may not even notice them.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Analysis of a sputum sample (sputum culture, sputum Gram stain)\n* Blood tests (including an arterial blood gas)\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the chest\n* Pulmonary function tests\n* Pulse oximetry\n\n---\n\n**Breath Sounds**\n\nAbnormal breath sounds can be caused by several factors, including:\n\n*   **Acute bronchitis**\n*   **Asthma**\n*   **Bronchiectasis**\n*   **Chronic bronchitis**\n*   **Congestive heart failure**\n*   **Emphysema**\n*   **Interstitial lung disease**\n*   **Foreign body obstruction of the airway**\n*   **Pneumonia**\n*   **Pulmonary edema**\n*   **Tracheobronchitis**\n\nThese conditions can lead to abnormal breath sounds, such as rales, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing.

Your provider will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your medical history and your breathing.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Provider**\n\nWhen did the breath sound start?\n\nHow long did it last?\n\nHow would you describe your breathing?\n\nWhat makes it better or worse?\n\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\n\n---\n\n**Breath Sounds**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What are breath sounds?**\n    Breath sounds, also known as lung sounds or respiratory sounds, are the noises produced by the lungs during breathing. They can be heard through a stethoscope and are an important indicator of lung health.\n*   **Types of breath sounds:**\n    There are two main types of breath sounds:\n    *   **Normal breath sounds:** These are the typical sounds heard in healthy lungs, including the sound of air moving in and out of the lungs.\n    *   **Abnormal breath sounds:** These can indicate underlying lung disease or other respiratory problems. Examples include wheezing, crackles, and rhonchi.\n*   **Importance of breath sounds:**\n    Breath sounds are a crucial indicator of lung health and can help diagnose various respiratory conditions.

    "content": "**Breath-holding Spell**\n\nSome children have breath-holding spells. This is an involuntary stop in breathing that is not in the child's control.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBabies as young as 2 months old and up to 2 years old can start having breath-holding spells. Some children have severe spells.\n\nChildren can have breath-holding spells when they are responding to:\n\n* Fear\n* Pain\n* Traumatic event\n* Being startled or confronted\n\nBreath-holding spells are more common in children with:\n\n* Genetic conditions, such as Riley-Day syndrome or Rett syndrome\n* Iron deficiency anemia\n* A family history of breath-holding spells (parents may have had similar spells when they were children)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBreath-holding spells most often occur when a child becomes suddenly upset or surprised. The child makes a short gasp, exhales, and stops breathing. The child's nervous system slows the heart rate or breathing for a short amount of time. Breath-holding spells are not thought to be a willful act of defiance, even though they often occur with temper tantrums. Symptoms can include:\n\n* Blue (cyanosis) or pale skin\n* Crying, then no breathing\n* Fainting or loss of alertness (unconsciousness)\n* Jerky movements (short, seizure-like movements)\n\nNormal breathing starts again after a brief period of unconsciousness. The child's color improves with the first breath. This may occur several times per day, or only on rare occasions.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your child's medical history and symptoms.\n\nBlood tests may be done to check for an iron deficiency.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the heart\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to check for seizures\n\n**Treatment**\n\nNo treatment is usually needed. But iron drops or pills may be given if your child has an iron deficiency.\n\nBreath-holding can be a frightening experience for parents. If your child has been diagnosed with breath-holding spells, take the following steps:\n\n* During a spell, make sure your child is in a safe place where they will not fall or be hurt.\n* Place a cold cloth on your child's forehead during a spell to help shorten the episode.\n* After the spell, try to be calm. Avoid giving too much attention to the child, as this can reinforce the behaviors that led to the spell.\n* Avoid situations that cause your child's temper tantrums. This can help reduce the number of spells.\n* Ignore breath-holding spells that do not cause your child to faint. Ignore the spell in the same way you ignore temper tantrums.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children outgrow breath-holding spells by the time they are 4 to 8 years old.\n\nChildren who have a seizure during a breath-holding spell are not at higher risk for having seizures otherwise.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if:\n\n* You think your child is having breath-holding spells\n* Your child's breath-holding spells are getting worse or happening more often\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n* Your child stops breathing or has trouble breathing\n* Your child has seizures for more than 1 minute\n\n---\n\n**Breath-Holding Spells**\n\n**What Are Breath-Holding Spells?**\n\nSome children have breath-holding spells.

This condition causes a person to wake up suddenly during the night feeling short of breath.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThis is a common complaint in people with some types of heart or lung problems. Sometimes the problem is subtle. People may only notice it when they realize that sleep is more comfortable with lots of pillows under their head, or their head in a propped-up position.\n\nCauses may include:\n\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Cor pulmonale\n* Heart failure\n* Obesity (does not directly cause difficulty breathing while lying down but often worsens other conditions that lead to it)\n* Panic disorder\n* Sleep apnea\n* Snoring\n\n**Home Care**\n\nYour health care provider may recommend self-care measures. For example, weight loss may be suggested if you are obese.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have any unexplained difficulty in breathing while lying down, call your provider.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about the problem.\n\nQuestions may include:\n\n* Did this problem develop suddenly or slowly?\n* Is it getting worse (progressive)?\n* How bad is it?\n* How many pillows do you need to help you breathe comfortably?\n* Is there any ankle, foot, or leg swelling?\n* Do you have difficulty breathing at other times?\n* How tall are you? How much do you weigh? Has your weight changed recently?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nThe physical exam will include special attention to the heart and lungs (cardiovascular and respiratory systems).\n\nTests that may be performed include the following:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Echocardiogram\n* Pulmonary function tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the breathing problem.\n\nYou may need to use oxygen.\n\n---\n\n**Breathing Difficulty - Lying Down**\n\nThis is a common complaint in people with some types of heart or lung problems.

This can be a sign of underlying heart or lung problems.\n\n**Causes of breathing difficulty lying down**\n\nThere are several causes of breathing difficulty lying down, including:\n\n*   **Heart failure**: When the heart is unable to pump enough blood, it can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.\n*   **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: COPD is a progressive lung disease that can cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.\n*   **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause inflammation and fluid buildup, leading to shortness of breath.\n\n**Symptoms of breathing difficulty lying down**\n\nThe symptoms of breathing difficulty lying down may include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when lying down\n*   Coughing or wheezing\n*   Fatigue or feeling tired easily\n*   Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet\n\n**Diagnosing breathing difficulty lying down**\n\nTo diagnose breathing difficulty lying down, a healthcare provider may perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Physical exam**: A physical exam to check for signs of heart or lung problems.\n*   **Chest X-ray**: A chest X-ray to look for fluid buildup in the lungs.\n*   **Pulmonary function test**: A pulmonary function test to measure lung function.\n\n**Treatment of breathing difficulty lying down**\n\nThe treatment of breathing difficulty lying down depends on the underlying cause. Some possible treatments may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n*   **Oxygen therapy**: Oxygen therapy may be recommended to help increase oxygen levels in the blood.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and getting enough rest may also be recommended.\n\nIt's essential to seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms of breathing difficulty lying down. Early detection and treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",

Some people feel breathless with only mild exercise (for example, climbing stairs), even though they don't have a medical condition. Others may have advanced lung disease, but may never feel short of breath. Breathing difficulty is a subjective feeling; only the person feeling it can decide if it is present.\n\nWheezing is one form of breathing difficulty in which you make a high-pitched sound when you breathe out.\n\n**Causes**\n\nShortness of breath has many different causes. For example, heart disease can cause breathlessness if your heart is unable to pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. If your brain, muscles, or other body organs do not get enough oxygen, a sense of breathlessness may occur.\n\nBreathing difficulty may also be due to problems with the lungs, airways, or other health problems.\n\n**Problems with the Lungs**\n\n* Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n* Swelling and mucus buildup in the smallest air passages in the lungs (bronchiolitis)\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema\n* Pneumonia\n* High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)\n* Other lung disease\n\n**Problems with the Airways Leading to the Lungs**\n\n* Blockage of the air passages in your nose, mouth, or throat\n* Choking on something stuck in the airways\n* Swelling around the vocal cords (croup)\n* Inflammation of the tissue (epiglottis) that covers the windpipe (epiglottitis)\n\n**Problems with the Heart**\n\n* Chest pain due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart (angina)\n* Heart attack\n* Heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease)\n* Heart failure\n* Heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias)\n\n**Other Causes**\n\n* Allergies (such as to mold, dander, or pollen)\n* High altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air\n* Compression of the chest wall\n* Dust in the environment\n* Emotional distress, such as anxiety\n* Hiatal hernia (condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest)\n* Obesity\n* Panic attacks\n* Anemia (low hemoglobin)\n* Blood problems (when your blood cells cannot pick up oxygen normally; the disease methemoglobinemia is an example)\n* Neuromuscular problems leading to weakness of the breathing muscles\n\n---\n\n**Breathing Difficulty**\n\n**What is Breathing Difficulty?**\n\nBreathing difficulty, also known as dyspnea, is a subjective feeling of not getting enough air.

    "content": "**Breech Birth**\n\nThe best position for your baby inside your uterus at the time of delivery is head down. This position makes it easier and safer for your baby to pass through the birth canal.\n\nIn the last weeks of pregnancy, your health care provider will check to see what position your baby is in.\n\nIf your baby's position does not feel normal, you may need an ultrasound. If the ultrasound shows your baby is breech, your provider will talk with you about your options for a safe delivery.\n\n**What is Breech?**\n\nIn breech position, the baby's bottom is down. There are a few types of breech:\n\n* **Complete Breech**: means the baby is bottom-first, with knees bent.\n* **Frank Breech**: means the baby's legs are stretched up, with feet near the head.\n* **Footling Breech**: means one leg is lowered over the mother's cervix.\n\nYou are more likely to have a breech baby if you:\n\n* Go into early labor\n* Have an abnormally shaped uterus, fibroids, or too much amniotic fluid\n* Have more than one baby in your womb\n* Have placenta previa (when the placenta is on the lower part of the uterine wall, blocking the cervix)\n\n**Turning Your Baby (External Version)**\n\nIf your baby is not in a head-down position after your 36th week, your provider can explain your choices and their risks to help you decide what steps to take next.\n\nYour provider may offer to try to guide the baby into the right position. This is called external version. It involves pushing on your belly while watching the baby on an ultrasound. The pushing may cause some discomfort.\n\nIf your provider tries to change your baby's position, you may be given a medicine that relaxes the muscles of your uterus. You can also expect:\n\n* An ultrasound to show your provider where the placenta and baby are located.\n* Your provider to push on your abdomen to try and turn your baby's position.\n* Your baby's heartbeat to be monitored.\n\nSuccess is higher if your provider tries this procedure at about 36 to 37 weeks. At this time, your baby is a little smaller, and there is most often more fluid around the baby. Your baby is also old enough in case there is a problem during the procedure that makes it necessary to deliver the baby promptly. This is rare.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks are low for this procedure when a skilled provider does it. Rarely, it may lead to an emergency cesarean birth (C-section) if:\n\n* Part of the placenta tears away from the lining of your womb\n* Your baby's heartbeat drops too low, which can happen if the umbilical cord is tightly wrapped around your baby\n\n**If My Baby Doesn't Turn, Will I Have a C-section?**\n\nMost babies who remain breech after an attempt at turning them will be delivered by C-section. Your provider will explain the risk of delivering a breech baby vaginally.\n\nToday, the option to deliver a breech baby vaginally is not offered in most cases. The safest way for a breech baby to be born is by C-section.\n\nThe danger of breech birth is mostly due to the fact that the largest part of a baby is its head. When the breech baby's pelvis or hips deliver first, the woman's pelvis may not be large enough for the head to be delivered also. This can result in a baby getting stuck in the birth canal, which can cause injury or death.\n\nThe umbilical cord may also be damaged or blocked. This can reduce the baby's oxygen supply.\n\nIf a C-section is planned, it will most often be scheduled for no earlier than 39 weeks. You will have an ultrasound at the hospital to confirm the position of your baby just before the surgery.\n\nThere is also a chance that you will go into labor or your water will break before your planned C-section. If that happens, contact your provider right away and go to the hospital. It is important to go in right away if you have a breech baby and your bag of water breaks. This is because there is a higher chance that the cord will come out even before you are in labor. This can be very dangerous for your baby.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPregnancy - breech; Delivery - breech\n\n---\n\n**Breech Birth**\n\nThe safest way for a breech baby to be born is by C-section.\n\n**Understanding Breech Position**\n\nIn breech position, the baby's bottom is down.

This can be a challenging and potentially risky situation for both mother and baby.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of breech birth**\n\nThere are several reasons why a baby may be in a breech position:\n\n*   The baby has not moved into a head-down position by the time the mother goes into labor\n*   The mother has had a previous cesarean section or other uterine surgery, which can increase the risk of a breech birth\n*   The mother is carrying twins or other multiple babies, which can increase the risk of a breech birth\n\n\\n\\n**Risks associated with breech birth**\n\nBreech births can be risky for both mother and baby. Some of the risks include:\n\n*   Increased risk of complications during delivery\n*   Higher risk of injury to the baby's head or neck\n*   Increased risk of infection or other health problems for the mother\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment options for breech birth**\n\nIf a breech birth is suspected, the healthcare provider may recommend one of the following treatment options:\n\n*   External cephalic version (ECV): This involves using pressure on the abdomen to try to turn the baby head-down\n*   Version: This involves manually turning the baby from outside the uterus\n*   Cesarean section: In some cases, a cesarean section may be necessary to ensure the baby's safety\n\n\\n\\n**Preventing breech birth**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent a breech birth, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n*   Getting regular prenatal care to monitor the baby's position and movement\n*   Engaging in activities that help the baby move into a head-down position, such as swimming or yoga\n*   Avoiding certain positions or activities that may increase the risk of a breech birth\n\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\n\nBreech births can be challenging and potentially risky situations for both mother and baby. By understanding the causes, risks, and treatment options associated with breech birth, mothers can take steps to reduce their risk and ensure a healthy delivery.",

Some studies suggest that individuals with a family history of psychiatric disorders may be at higher risk for developing this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nTreatment for brief psychotic disorder typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms, prevent relapse, and improve overall quality of life. With proper treatment, most individuals with this condition can recover fully within a few months.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   **Psychotic Disorders**: A category of mental health conditions characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, or emotional responsiveness.\n*   **Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders**: A group of mental health conditions that share similar symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Psychiatric Association.

    "content": "**Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)**\n\nA brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) is when an infant younger than one year stops breathing, has a change in muscle tone, turns pale or blue in color, or is unresponsive. The event occurs suddenly, lasts less than 30 to 60 seconds, and is frightening to the person caring for the infant.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIt is unclear how often these events occur.\n\nBRUE is not the same as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is also not the same as older terms such as near-miss SIDS or aborted crib deaths, which are no longer used.\n\nEvents that involve a change in an infant's breathing, color, muscle tone, or behavior may be caused by an underlying medical problem. But these events would then not be considered a BRUE. Some of the causes for events that are not a BRUE include:\n\n* Reflux after eating\n* Severe infections (such as bronchiolitis, whooping cough)\n* Birth defects that involve the face, throat, or neck\n* Birth defects of the heart or lungs\n* Allergic reactions\n* A brain, nerve, or muscle disorder\n* Child abuse\n* Certain uncommon genetic disorders\n\nA specific cause of the event is found about half the time. In healthy children who only have one event, the cause is rarely identified.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThese events are more likely to occur during the first two months of life and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nA BRUE includes one or more of the following:\n\n* Breathing changes -- either no effort at breathing, breathing with great difficulty, or decreased breathing\n* Color change -- most often blue or pale (many infants turn red, when crying for example, so this does not indicate a BRUE)\n* Change in muscle tone -- most often they are limp, but they may become rigid\n* Change in level of responsiveness\n\nChoking or gagging means the event was likely not a BRUE. These symptoms are more likely caused by reflux.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask you to describe what occurred during the event. The provider will also ask about:\n\n* Other events like this one in the past\n* Other known medical problems\n* Medicines, herbs, or extra vitamins the infant may be taking\n* Other medicines at home the child could have taken\n* Complications during pregnancy and labor, or at birth, or being born early\n* Siblings or children in the household who also had this type of event\n* Illegal drugs or heavy alcohol use in the house\n* Prior reports of abuse\n\nWhen deciding if more testing is needed, the provider will consider:\n\n* The type of event that occurred\n* How severe the symptoms were\n* What was going on right before the event\n* Other health problems that are present or that are found on physical exam\n\nA thorough physical exam will be done, checking for:\n\n* Signs of infection, trauma, or abuse\n* Low oxygen level\n* Abnormal heart sounds\n* Signs of birth defects that involve the face, throat, or neck that may cause breathing problems\n* Signs of abnormal brain function\n\nIf there are no findings to suggest a high-risk BRUE, lab tests and imaging tests are often not needed. If choking or gasping occurred during feeding and the infant recovered quickly, more testing will often not be needed.\n\n**Factors That Suggest a Higher Risk for Recurrence or the Presence of a Serious Cause**\n\nInfants under 2 months of age\nBeing born at 32 weeks or earlier\nMore than 1 event\nEpisodes lasting longer than 1 minute\nCPR by a trained provider was needed\nSigns of child abuse\n\nIf risk factors are present, testing that may be done includes:\n\n* A complete blood count (CBC) to look for signs of infection or anemia.\n* A metabolic profile to look for problems with how the kidneys and liver are working. Abnormal levels of calcium, protein, blood sugar, magnesium, sodium, and potassium may also be found.\n* Urine or blood screen to look for drugs or toxins.\n* Chest x-ray.\n* Holter monitoring, echocardiogram, or other tests for heart problems.\n* CT or MRI of the brain.\n* Laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy.\n* Tests to evaluate the heart.\n* Test for pertussis.\n* Sleep study.\n* X-rays of the bones looking for prior trauma.\n* Screening for genetic disorders.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf the event was brief, included no signs of breathing or heart problems, and corrected on its own, your child will likely not need to stay in the hospital.\n\nReasons your child may be admitted overnight include:\n\n* The event included symptoms that indicate a more serious cause.\n* Suspected trauma or neglect.\n* Suspected poisoning.\n* The child appears unwell or is not thriving well.\n* Need to monitor or observe while feeding.\n* Concern over ability of parents to care for child.\n\nIf admitted, your child's heart rate and breathing will be monitored.\n\nYour provider may recommend that you and other caregivers:\n\n* Place your infant on their back when sleeping or napping. Their face should be free.\n* Avoid soft bedding materials. Babies should be placed on a firm, tight-fitting crib mattress without loose bedding. Use a light sheet to cover the baby. Do not use pillows, comforters, or quilts.\n* Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.\n* Consider saline nose drops or using a nasal bulb if the nose is congested.\n* Learn proper techniques to respond to any future events. This includes not shaking the infant. Your provider can instruct you.\n* Avoid overfeeding, perform frequent burping during feedings, and hold the infant upright after feeding.\n* Talk to your provider before thickening your child's feedings or using medicines that reduce acid and reflux.\n\nAlthough not common, home monitoring devices may be recommended.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost often, these events are harmless and not a sign of more serious health problems or death.\n\nBRUE is unlikely to be a risk factor for SIDS. Most victims of SIDS do not have any types of events beforehand.\n\nA child with risk factors for BRUE may have a higher risk for recurrence or the presence of a serious cause.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if child abuse is suspected. Possible signs of abuse include:\n\n* Poisoning or head injury that are not caused by an accident\n* Bruising or other signs of a prior injury\n* When events occur only in the presence of a single caretaker when no health problems are found as the cause for these events\n\n---\n\n**Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)**\n\nA brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) is when an infant younger than one year stops breathing, has a change in muscle tone, turns pale or blue in color, or is unresponsive.

Possible signs of abuse include:\n\n* Poisoning or head injury that are not caused by an accident\n* Bruising or other signs of a prior injury\n* When events occur only in the presence of a single caretaker when no health problems are found as the cause for these events\n\n---\n\n**Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)**\n\nA Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) is a sudden, brief event that occurs in an infant younger than one year, characterized by:\n\n* Stopping breathing\n* Change in muscle tone\n* Turning pale or blue in color\n* Being unresponsive\n\nThe event lasts less than 30 to 60 seconds and is frightening to the person caring for the infant.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIt is unclear how often these events occur. BRUE is not the same as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is also not the same as older terms such as near-miss SIDS or aborted crib deaths, which are no longer used.\n\nEvents that involve a change in an infant's breathing, color, muscle tone, or behavior may be caused by an underlying medical problem. But these events would then not be considered a BRUE. Some of the causes for events that are not a BRUE include:\n\n* Reflux after eating\n* Severe infections (such as bronchiolitis, whooping cough)\n* Birth defects that involve the face, throat, or neck\n* Birth defects of the heart or lungs\n* Allergic reactions\n* A brain, nerve, or muscle disorder\n* Child abuse\n* Certain uncommon genetic disorders\n\nA specific cause of the event is found about half the time. In healthy children who only have one event, the cause is rarely identified.\n\nThe main risk factors for BRUE are:\n\n* A prior episode when the child stopped breathing, turned pale, or had blue coloring\n* Feeding problems\n* Recent head cold or bronchitis\n* Age younger than 10 weeks\n\nLow birth weight, being born early, or secondhand smoke exposure also may be risk factors.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThese events are more likely to occur during the first two months of life and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nA BRUE includes one or more of the following:\n\n* Breathing changes -- either no effort at breathing, breathing with great difficulty, or decreased breathing\n* Color change -- most often blue or pale (many infants turn red, when crying for example, so this does not indicate a BRUE)\n* Change in muscle tone -- most often they are limp, but they may become rigid\n* Change in level of responsiveness\n\nChoking or gagging means the event was likely not a BRUE. These symptoms are more likely caused by reflux.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask you to describe what occurred during the event. The provider will also ask about:\n\n* Other events like this one in the past\n* Other known medical problems\n* Medicines, herbs, or extra vitamins the infant may be taking\n* Other medicines at home the child could have taken\n* Complications during pregnancy and labor, or at birth, or being born early\n* Siblings or children in the household who also had this type of event\n* Illegal drugs or heavy alcohol use in the house\n* Prior reports of abuse\n\nWhen deciding if more testing is needed, the provider will consider:\n\n* The type of event that occurred\n* How severe the symptoms were\n* What was going on right before the event\n* Other health problems that are present or that are found on physical exam\n\nA thorough physical exam will be done, checking for:\n\n* Signs of infection, trauma, or abuse\n* Low oxygen level\n* Abnormal heart sounds\n* Signs of birth defects that involve the face, throat, or neck that may cause breathing problems\n* Signs of abnormal brain function\n\nIf there are no findings to suggest a high-risk BRUE, lab tests and imaging tests are often not needed. If choking or gasping occurred during feeding and the infant recovered quickly, more testing will often not be needed.\n\nFactors that suggest a higher risk for recurrence or the presence of a serious cause include:\n\n* Infants under 2 months of age\n* Being born at 32 weeks or earlier\n* More than 1 event\n* Episodes lasting longer than 1 minute\n* CPR by a trained provider was needed\n* Signs of child abuse\n\nIf risk factors are present, testing that may be done includes:\n\n* A complete blood count (CBC) to look for signs of infection or anemia.\n* A metabolic profile to look for problems with how the kidneys and liver are working. Abnormal levels of calcium, protein, blood sugar, magnesium, sodium, and potassium may also be found.\n* Urine or blood screen to look for drugs or toxins.\n* Chest x-ray.\n* Holter monitoring, echocardiogram, or other tests for heart problems.\n* CT or MRI of the brain.\n* Laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy.\n* Tests to evaluate the heart.\n* Test for pertussis.\n* Sleep study.\n* X-rays of the bones looking for prior trauma.\n* Screening for genetic disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)**\n\n**Screening for Genetic Disorders**\n\nYour health care provider will ask you to describe what occurred during the event.

Their face should be free.\n* Avoid soft bedding materials. Babies should be placed on a firm, tight-fitting crib mattress without loose bedding. Use a light sheet to cover the baby. Do not use pillows, comforters, or quilts.\n* Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.\n* Consider saline nose drops or using a nasal bulb if the nose is congested.\n* Learn proper techniques to respond to any future events. This includes not shaking the infant. Your provider can instruct you.\n* Avoid overfeeding, perform frequent burping during feedings, and hold the infant upright after feeding.\n* Talk to your provider before thickening your child's feedings or using medicines that reduce acid and reflux.\n\nAlthough not common, home monitoring devices may be recommended.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost often, these events are harmless and not a sign of more serious health problems or death.\n\nBRUE is unlikely to be a risk factor for SIDS.
