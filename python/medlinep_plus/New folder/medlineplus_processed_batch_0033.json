    "content": "**Calendula**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\nCalendula (Calendula officinalis) is a plant known as pot marigold. It is not the same as ornamental marigolds of the Tagetes genus grown in vegetable gardens.\n\nCalendula is native to Asia and southern Europe and has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine. The chemicals in calendula might help new tissue grow in wounds and decrease swelling in the mouth and throat.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using calendula for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Preparations of calendula flower are likely safe for most people.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Preparations of calendula flower are likely safe for most people.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy: Don't take calendula by mouth if you are pregnant. It is likely unsafe. There is a concern that it might cause a miscarriage. It's best to avoid topical use as well until more is known.\n\nBreast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if calendula is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\nAllergy to ragweed and related plants: Calendula may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking calendula.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nSedative medications (CNS depressants)\nCalendula might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking calendula with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\nThere are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is it typically used?**\nThere isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of calendula might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\nCaléndula, Calendula officinalis, Calendule, Common Marigold, English Garden Marigold, English Marigold, Fleur de Calendule, Fleur de Tous les Jours, Fleur de Tous les Mois, Garden Marigold, Gold-Bloom, Holligold, Marigold, Marybud, Pot Marigold, Souci des Champs, Souci des Jardins, Souci des Vignes, Souci Officinal, Zergul.\n\n---\n\n**Calendula: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Content:**\n\nes Jours, Fleur de Tous les Mois, Garden Marigold, Gold-Bloom, Holligold, Marigold, Marybud, Pot Marigold, Souci des Champs, Souci des Jardins, Souci des Vignes, Souci Officinal, Zergul.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Que S, Ma X, Yang T, He J.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003429.htm",
    "content": "**Caloric Stimulation**\n\nCaloric stimulation is a test that uses differences in temperature to diagnose damage to the acoustic nerve, which is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. The test is done in the following way:\n\n*   Before the test, your ear, especially the eardrum, will be checked to make sure it's normal.\n*   One ear is tested at a time.\n*   A small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.\n*   Next, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back.\n*   Your other ear is tested in the same way.\n\nDuring the test, the health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called electronystagmography.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nDo not eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid the following at least 24 hours before the test, because they can affect the results:\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Allergy medicines\n*   Caffeine\n*   Sedatives\n\nDo not stop taking your regular medicines without first talking to your provider.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may find the cold water or air in the ear uncomfortable. You may feel your eyes scanning back and forth during nystagmus. You may have vertigo, and sometimes, you may also have nausea. This lasts only a very short time. Vomiting is rare.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be used to find the cause of:\n\n*   Dizziness or vertigo\n*   Hearing loss that may be due to certain antibiotics or other drugs\n\nIt may also be done to look for brain damage in people who are in a coma.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nRapid, side-to-side eye movements should occur when cold or warm water is placed into the ear. The eye movements should be similar on both sides.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIf the rapid, side-to-side eye movements do not occur even after ice cold water is given, there may be damage to the:\n\n*   Nerve of the inner ear\n*   Balance sensors of the inner ear\n*   Brain\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n*   Poor blood supply to the ear\n*   Bleeding (hemorrhage)\n*   Blood clot\n*   Brain or brain stem damage\n*   Cholesteatoma (a type of skin cyst in the middle ear and mastoid bone in the skull)\n*   Birth defects of the ear structure or brain\n*   Damage to the ear nerves (from infections such as rubella or from medicines)\n*   Poisoning\n*   Stroke\n*   Trauma\n\nThe test may also be done to diagnose or rule out:\n\n*   Acoustic neuroma (tumor of the acoustic nerve)\n*   Benign positional vertigo (a type of dizziness)\n*   Labyrinthitis (irritation and swelling of the inner ear)\n*   Meniere disease (inner ear disorder that affects balance and hearing)\n\n**Risks**\n\nToo much water pressure can injure an already damaged eardrum. This rarely occurs because the amount of water to be used is measured.\n\nWater caloric stimulation should not be done if the eardrum is torn (perforated). This is because it can cause an ear infection. It also should not be done during an episode of vertigo because it can make symptoms worse.\n\n---\n\n**Caloric Stimulation**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Caloric Stimulation?**\n\nCaloric stimulation is a test that uses differences in temperature to diagnose damage to the acoustic nerve.

The eye movements should be similar on both sides.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\t+ If the rapid, side-to-side eye movements do not occur even after ice cold water is given, there may be damage to:\n\t\t- Nerve of the inner ear\n\t\t- Balance sensors of the inner ear\n\t\t- Brain\n\t+ Abnormal results may be due to:\n\t\t- Poor blood supply to the ear\n\t\t- Bleeding (hemorrhage)\n\t\t- Blood clot\n\t\t- Brain or brain stem damage\n\t\t- Cholesteatoma (a type of skin cyst in the middle ear and mastoid bone in the skull)\n\t\t- Birth defects of the ear structure or brain\n\t\t- Damage to the ear nerves (from infections such as rubella or from medicines)\n\t\t- Poisoning\n\t\t- Stroke\n\t\t- Trauma\n\n---\n\n**Caloric Stimulation**\n\n**What is Caloric Stimulation?**\n\nCaloric stimulation, also known as the caloric test or bithermal caloric testing, is a medical procedure used to diagnose problems with balance and hearing. It involves introducing cold or warm air into the ear canal to stimulate the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium.\n\n**When is Caloric Stimulation Used?**\n\nCaloric stimulation may be used to diagnose or rule out various conditions, including:\n\n*   **Birth defects of the ear structure or brain**\n*   **Damage to the ear nerves (from infections such as rubella or from medicines)**\n*   **Poisoning**\n*   **Stroke**\n*   **Trauma**\n\nThe test may also be done to diagnose or rule out other conditions, such as:\n\n*   **Acoustic neuroma (tumor of the acoustic nerve)**\n*   **Benign positional vertigo (a type of dizziness)**\n*   **Labyrinthitis (irritation and swelling of the inner ear)**\n*   **Meniere disease (inner ear disorder that affects balance and hearing)**\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nIf the rapid, side-to-side eye movements do not occur even after ice cold water is given, there may be damage to the:\n\n*   **Nerve of the inner ear**\n*   **Balance sensors of the inner ear**\n*   **Brain**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to various factors, including:\n\n*   **Poor blood supply to the ear**\n*   **Bleeding (hemorrhage)**\n*   **Blood clot**\n*   **Brain or brain stem damage**\n*   **Cholesteatoma (a type of skin cyst in the middle ear and mastoid bone in the skull)**\n\n**Risks**\n\nToo much water pressure can injure an already damaged eardrum. This rarely occurs because the amount of water to be used is measured.\n\nWater caloric stimulation should not be done if the eardrum is torn (perforated). This is because it can cause an ear infection. It also should not be done during an episode of vertigo because it can make symptoms worse.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCaloric test; Bithermal caloric testing; Cold water calorics; Warm water calorics; Air caloric testing\n\n**References**\n\n*   Baloh RW, Jen JC.

    "content": "**Calprotectin Stool Test**\n\nA calprotectin stool test measures a protein called calprotectin in a sample of your stool (poop). The test is also called a fecal calprotectin test. It's used to check for inflammation (swelling and irritation) in your intestines.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCalprotectin is a protein that is released into the stool when there is inflammation in the intestines. It's normal to have a small amount of calprotectin in your stool, but high levels are a sign that your intestines are inflamed.\n\n**Why do I need a calprotectin stool test?**\n\nYou may need a calprotectin stool test if you have symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as:\n\n* Watery or bloody diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain and cramping\n* Weight loss\n\nThe test can help your healthcare provider decide what other tests you may need and what treatments are best for you.\n\n**What happens during a calprotectin stool test?**\n\nYou will need to provide a stool sample for your test. Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample. There are different ways to collect stool samples, so follow the instructions carefully.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nAsk your provider if you need to stop taking any medicines before your test. But never stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a calprotectin stool test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nNormal or low levels of calprotectin usually mean that your intestines are not inflamed, which means you don't have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Your symptoms are probably caused by a type of non-inflammatory condition. But it's possible to have normal calprotectin test results even when your intestines are inflamed.\n\nHigh levels of calprotectin usually mean that your intestines are inflamed. The higher the amount of calprotectin in your stool, the more inflammation you have. If your calprotectin levels are high, your provider may retest you in a few weeks to see if they change.\n\nSeveral conditions can cause high calprotectin levels, so you may need other tests to find the cause.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about a calprotectin stool test?\n\n---\n\n**Calprotectin Stool Test**\n\n\\n\\nIf your provider thinks you could have IBD, you may first have a blood test to check for inflammation. The blood test may be a C-reactive protein (CRP) test or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test. But a calprotectin stool test is more accurate at finding inflammation in the intestines.\n\n**What is a Calprotectin Stool Test?**\n\nA calprotectin stool test measures a protein called calprotectin in a sample of your stool (poop). The test is also called a fecal calprotectin test. It's used to check for inflammation (swelling and irritation) in your intestines.\n\nIt's normal to have a small amount of calprotectin in your stool. But high levels are a sign that your intestines are inflamed. When you have inflammation in your intestines, your immune system sends certain types of white blood cells (neutrophils) to the inflamed area. These white blood cells release calprotectin into your intestines where it mixes with your stool.\n\nInflammation in your intestines can cause severe watery or bloody diarrhea with abdominal (belly) pain and/or cramping that last for more than a few days. Other types of digestive conditions can also cause these symptoms. If these symptoms last a long time or come and go, it's important to know if your intestines are inflamed. That's because inflammation can damage the lining of your intestines and lead to other serious health conditions over time.\n\nA calprotectin test can find out whether your intestinal condition involves inflammation. But it can't diagnose the specific cause. Knowing whether your intestines are inflamed helps your health care provider decide what other tests you may need and what treatments are best for you.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nCalprotectin stool testing is used to check for inflammation in the intestines. In most cases, providers use calprotectin stool testing to help tell the difference between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nIBD and IBS are both chronic (long-lasting) conditions that affect adults and children. They cause similar symptoms that can come and go, including diarrhea, belly pain, and cramps. But only IBD involves inflammation:\n\n*   Crohn's disease\n*   Ulcerative colitis\n\nIBS is a group of symptoms that happen together. They include bloating, pain and/or cramps when you have bowel movements, and diarrhea, constipation, or both. Researchers think IBS may be caused by a problem with how your brain and intestines (gut) work together. IBS does not damage your intestines and tests do not show inflammation.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Calprotectin Stool Test?**\n\nMost watery diarrhea goes away on its own after a day or two, and your provider doesn't need to do tests. But if your symptoms don't improve after a few days or keep coming back, you may need a calprotectin stool test to check for inflammation in your intestines.\n\nAlong with diarrhea, belly pain and cramping, other symptoms of inflammation in your intestines may include:\n\n*   Blood, mucus, and/or pus in your stool. Contact your provider right away if you see blood or pus in your stool, or if your stool is black and tarry.\n*   Always feeling like you need to move your bowels (poop) even when there's no stool. This condition may be painful and cause cramps.\n*   Feeling an urgent need to move your bowels.\n*   Weight loss when you're not trying to lose weight.\n\nIf you already have IBD, you may need calprotectin testing to monitor your condition. This information helps your provider choose treatment and check whether it's working.\n\n**What Happens During a Calprotectin Stool Test?**\n\nYou will need to provide a stool sample for your test. Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample. There are different ways to collect stool samples, so follow the instructions carefully. In general, you'll need to:\n\n*   Label the container with your name, the collection date, and time.\n*   Collect a stool sample as instructed. This usually involves using a clean, dry container, or special paper or plastic wrap placed over the toilet to catch the stool.\n*   Make sure the stool doesn't mix with any urine (pee), toilet paper, or water from the toilet.\n*   Close the container tightly.\n*   Wash your hands well with soap and water.\n*   Return the container according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Calprotectin Stool Test: Understanding Your Results**\n\nIf your provider orders a calprotectin stool test, you may be wondering what it means for your results. In this article, we'll break down how to interpret your test results and what they might indicate about your health.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nNormal or low levels of calprotectin usually mean that your intestines are not inflamed, which means you don't have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Your symptoms are probably caused by a type of non-inflammatory condition. Your provider may order other tests to figure out which condition is causing your symptoms.\n\nBut it's possible to have normal calprotectin test results even when your intestines are inflamed. This is called a \"false negative.\" False negative calprotectin results mostly happen in children.\n\nHigh levels of calprotectin usually mean that your intestines are inflamed. The higher the amount of calprotectin in your stool, the more inflammation you have. If your calprotectin levels are high, your provider may retest you in a few weeks to see if they change.\n\nSeveral conditions can cause high calprotectin levels, so you may need other tests to find the cause. In general:\n\n*   Very high levels of calprotectin are often linked to:\n    *   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n    *   Food poisoning caused by certain types of bacteria\n*   Somewhat high levels of calprotectin are often linked to:\n    *   Intestinal or colorectal cancer\n    *   Celiac disease\n    *   Certain bacterial infections in your intestines, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff)\n    *   Taking NSAIDs\n    *   IBD that has been treated\n\n**What Do the Results Mean for My Health?**\n\nIf your calprotectin test results show that your intestines are inflamed, your provider may order a colonoscopy to further investigate the cause of the inflammation. On the other hand, if your test results show that your intestines probably aren't inflamed, a colonoscopy is unlikely to help make a diagnosis.\n\nIn this way, a calprotectin stool test can help avoid unnecessary colonoscopies. If you have questions about your test results, be sure to talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests**\n\nWant to learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results? Check out our resources section for more information.\n\nBy understanding what your calprotectin stool test results mean, you can take the next step in managing your health. Talk with your provider today!\n\n---\n\n**Calprotectin Stool Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 4/4)**\n\nAre you looking for a more accurate way to detect inflammation in your intestines? Look no further than the calprotectin stool test. This test is more effective than a blood test, which may be a C-reactive protein (CRP) test or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test.\n\n**Why Calprotectin Stool Test?**\n\nThe calprotectin stool test is a better option for detecting inflammation in the intestines because it directly measures the presence of inflammatory proteins in your stool. This makes it more accurate than blood tests, which can be affected by various factors such as infections or medications.\n\n**References:**\n\n* ARUP Consult: Inflammatory Bowel Disease - IBD\n* Bjarnason I.

    "content": "**Campylobacter Infections**\n\n**Summary**\n\nCampylobacter infection is a common foodborne illness. You usually get it from eating contaminated food, especially raw or undercooked poultry. You can also get it from drinking contaminated water or raw milk, or handling infected animal feces (poop).\n\nSome infected people don't have any symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they start two to five days after you are infected. They usually last about one week, and can include:\n\n* Diarrhea (which could be bloody)\n* Cramping\n* Abdominal pain\n* Fever\n* Fatigue\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\nHealth care providers use stool tests to make a diagnosis. Most people get better without treatment. You should drink extra fluids for as long as the diarrhea lasts. People who have a severe infection or a weakened immune system may need to take antibiotics.

    "content": "**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\nPeople have two copies of most genes, one copy inherited from each parent. In some cases, however, the number of copies varies—meaning that a person can have one, three, or more copies of particular genes. Less commonly, both copies of a gene may be missing. These types of genetic difference are known as **copy number variations (CNV)**.\n\n**Copy Number Variation**\n\nCopy number variation results from insertions, deletions, and duplications of large segments of DNA that are at least one thousand nucleotides in length. These segments are often big enough to include whole genes. Variation in gene copy number can influence the activity of genes and the functioning of proteins made from them, which may affect body processes.\n\nCopy number variation accounts for a significant amount of genetic difference between people. More than 10 percent of the human genome appears to contain differences in gene copy number. While much of this variation does not affect health or development, some differences influence a person’s risk of disease, particularly some types of cancer, or response to certain drugs.\n\n**Resources**\n\nFor more information about copy number variation:\n\n*   More information about copy number variation is available in a video from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n*   A definition of copy number variation is included in the Talking Genome Glossary from the National Human Genome Research Institute. \n*   For people interested in more technical data, several institutions provide databases of structural differences in human DNA, including copy number variation:\n    *   The Centre for Applied Genomics Database of Genomic Variants\n    *   The Sanger Institute: Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER)\n\n---\n\n**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\n\\n\\n**What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?**\n\nGene variants, also known as alleles, are different forms of a particular gene. They can occur due to mutations or changes in the DNA sequence.\n\n\\n\\n**How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nGene variants can affect health and development by altering the function of the protein produced by the gene. This can lead to various health problems or developmental issues.\n\n\\n\\n**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nNo, not all gene variants have a significant impact on health and development. Some may be harmless or even beneficial.\n\n\\n\\n**What kinds of gene variants are possible?**\n\nThere are several types of gene variants, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and duplications.\n\n\\n\\n**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, a change in the number of genes can affect health and development. For example, having too many or too few copies of a particular gene can lead to problems.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in the number of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in the number of chromosomes can affect health and development. For example, having an extra chromosome (trisomy) or missing a chromosome (monosomy) can lead to developmental issues.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in the structure of chromosomes can affect health and development. For example, having a translocation or inversion of chromosomal material can lead to problems.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in noncoding DNA affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in noncoding DNA can affect health and development. Noncoding DNA makes up most of the genome and plays a crucial role in gene regulation.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in mitochondrial DNA affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in mitochondrial DNA can affect health and development. Mitochondrial DNA is responsible for encoding proteins involved in energy production.\n\n\\n\\n**What are complex or multifactorial disorders?**\n\nComplex or multifactorial disorders are conditions that result from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n**What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?**\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to a disease means that an individual is more likely to develop the condition due to their genetic makeup.\n\n\\n\\n**How are gene variants involved in evolution?**\n\nGene variants play a crucial role in evolution, as they provide the raw material for natural selection to act upon. Variants that confer a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to be passed on to subsequent generations.\n\n\\n\\n**What information can statistics provide about a genetic condition?**\n\nStatistics can provide valuable insights into the prevalence, inheritance pattern, and clinical features of a genetic condition.\n\n\\n\\n**How are genetic conditions and genes named?**\n\nGenetic conditions and genes are named using a standardized system that ensures consistency and clarity.",

    "content": "**Can a Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test Tell Me Whether I Will Develop Alzheimer's Disease?**\n\nWhile a direct-to-consumer genetic test can estimate your risk, it cannot tell you for certain whether you will or will not develop Alzheimer's disease. Variations in multiple genes, together with lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, all play a role in determining a person’s risk.\n\n**The FDA-Approved Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test**\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed at least one direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe, to offer a test for Alzheimer's disease risk. The test analyzes a gene called APOE. Certain variations in this gene are associated with the likelihood of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (the most common form of the condition, which begins after age 65). Specifically, the test allows you to find out how many copies (zero, one, or two) you have of a version of the gene called the e4 allele.\n\n**Understanding Your Risk**\n\nPeople who have zero copies of the e4 allele have the same risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease as the general population. The risk increases with the number of copies of the e4 allele, so people with one copy have an increased chance of developing the disease, and people with two copies have an even greater risk. However, many people who have one or two copies of the e4 allele never develop Alzheimer's disease, and many people with no copies of this allele ultimately get the disease.\n\n**The Limitations of Genetic Testing**\n\nVariations in the APOE gene are among many factors that influence a person’s overall risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Variations in many other genes, which are not reported in the FDA-approved direct-to-consumer genetic test, also contribute to disease risk. Additionally, there are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease that have yet to be discovered. Therefore the APOE e4 allele represents only one piece of your overall Alzheimer's disease risk.\n\n**The Importance of Consultation**\n\nCurrently, there are no effective approaches for preventing Alzheimer's disease, and while the disease can be treated, it has no cure. For these reasons, the National Institute on Aging and patient advocacy groups strongly recommend that people considering genetic testing for Alzheimer's disease, including direct-to-consumer genetic testing, talk with a doctor or genetic counselor about the reasons they want to undergo testing and how they would cope with the results.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n*   National Institute on Aging: Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Fact Sheet\n*   Alzheimer’s Association: Is Alzheimer's Genetic?\n*   Alzheimer’s Society (UK): Genetics of Dementia: Genetic Testing\n\n---\n\n**Can a Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test Tell Me Whether I Will Develop Alzheimer's Disease?**\n\n\\n\\n**Introduction**\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a complex condition that has puzzled scientists and healthcare professionals for decades. While there is no definitive test to predict its onset, direct-to-consumer genetic testing has raised hopes of identifying individuals at risk. In this article, we will explore whether a direct-to-consumer genetic test can tell you whether you will develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Understanding Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing**\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to understand what direct-to-consumer genetic testing entails. This type of testing allows individuals to purchase genetic tests directly from companies, without the need for a healthcare provider's involvement. The tests typically involve sending a DNA sample to the company, which then analyzes the genetic material and provides a report on various traits or conditions.\n\n**What Can Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Tell You?**\n\nDirect-to-consumer genetic testing can provide information on various aspects of an individual's health, including:\n\n*   **Genetic ancestry**: Information about your ancestral origins\n*   **Disease risk**: Predictions of the likelihood of developing certain diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease\n*   **Trait inheritance**: Insights into the presence of specific traits, like eye color or height\n\n**Can a Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test Tell Me Whether I Will Develop Cancer?**\n\nWhile direct-to-consumer genetic testing can provide some information on disease risk, it is essential to understand the limitations of these tests. They are not diagnostic tools and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care.\n\n**What Does It Mean to Have Neanderthal DNA or Denisovan DNA?**\n\nSome direct-to-consumer genetic tests may reveal the presence of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in your genetic makeup. These findings can provide interesting insights into your ancestral heritage, but it is crucial to understand that they do not necessarily imply a higher risk of developing specific diseases.\n\n**Protecting Your Privacy**\n\nWhen considering direct-to-consumer genetic testing, it is essential to be aware of the companies' policies regarding customer privacy. Ensure that you understand how your genetic information will be handled and protected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile direct-to-consumer genetic testing can provide some valuable insights into your health and ancestry, it is crucial to approach these tests with a critical perspective. They should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice. If you have questions about your health, contact a healthcare provider for guidance.",

    "content": "**Can a Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test Tell Me Whether I Will Develop Cancer?**\n\nWhile a direct-to-consumer genetic test can estimate your risk, it cannot tell you for certain whether you will or will not develop certain forms of cancer. Many other factors, including sex, age, diet and exercise, ethnic background, a history of previous cancer, hormonal and reproductive factors, and family history also contribute to a person’s overall cancer risk.\n\n**The FDA-Approved Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test**\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed at least one direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe, to offer a test for cancer risk. The test identifies specific genetic changes that are associated with particular cancers. For example, it looks for 44 specific genetic variants in two genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2. The variants are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and potentially other forms of cancer.\n\n**The Limitations of the Test**\n\nResearchers estimate that 5 to 10 percent of all cancers run in families. Some of these cancers are associated with inherited variants in particular genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. More than 1,000 variants in each of these genes have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. However, the FDA-approved direct-to-consumer genetic test analyzes only 44 of these genetic changes.\n\n**The Test's Ability to Detect Cancer-Related Genetic Variations**\n\nThe test offered by 23andMe also looks for two variants in the MUTYH gene. These variants can cause a condition called MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP; also known as autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis). MAP greatly increases a person's risk of developing colorectal cancer, but it accounts for less than 1 percent of colorectal cancer cases.\n\n**Interpreting Test Results**\n\nBecause the variants included in these tests are uncommon, most people will have a negative result. A negative result does not mean that you will never get cancer. Similarly, a positive result (one that indicates a cancer-related genetic variation) does not mean that you will definitely develop cancer.\n\n**The Importance of Genetic Counseling**\n\nDirect-to-consumer genetic testing for cancer risk can be stressful and anxiety-producing. Health professional organizations and patient advocacy groups strongly recommend that people considering genetic testing for cancer-associated gene variants, including those included in direct-to-consumer genetic tests, talk with a genetic counselor about the reasons they want to undergo testing and what the results could mean for their health.\n\n---\n\n**Can a Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Test Tell Me Whether I Will Develop Cancer?**\n\nIf you're considering direct-to-consumer genetic testing, talk with a genetic counselor about the reasons you want to undergo testing and what the results could mean for your health.\n\n**Learn More About Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing for Cancer Risk:**\n\n*   National Cancer Institute: Can at-home or direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests be used to test for cancer risk?\n*   American Cancer Society: What Should I Know Before Getting Genetic Testing?\n*   National Society of Genetic Counselors: Reasons to See a Genetic Counselor: Cancer\n\n**Topics in the Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Chapter**\n\n*   What is direct-to-consumer genetic testing?\n*   What kinds of direct-to-consumer genetic tests are available?\n*   What is genetic ancestry testing?\n*   What are the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer genetic testing?\n*   How do I choose a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company?\n*   How is direct-to-consumer genetic testing done?\n*   How much does direct-to-consumer genetic testing cost, and is it covered by health insurance?\n*   What do the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing mean?\n*   What can raw data from a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me?\n*   Can a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me whether I will develop cancer?\n*   Can a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me whether I will develop Alzheimer's disease?\n*   What does it mean to have Neanderthal DNA or Denisovan DNA?\n*   How do direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies protect their customers’ privacy?\n*   What should I know before proceeding with direct-to-consumer genetic testing?\n*   Where can I read more about the diseases and traits covered in my direct-to-consumer genetic testing report?",

    "content": "**Can Changes in Mitochondrial DNA Affect Health and Development?**\n\nMitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). In some cases, inherited changes in mitochondrial DNA can cause problems with growth, development, and function of the body's systems.\n\n**Conditions Caused by Variants in Mitochondrial DNA**\n\nConditions caused by variants in mitochondrial DNA often involve multiple organ systems. The effects of these conditions are most pronounced in organs and tissues that require a lot of energy (such as the heart, brain, and muscles). Although the health consequences of inherited mitochondrial DNA alterations vary widely, frequently observed features include:\n\n*   Muscle weakness and wasting\n*   Problems with movement\n*   Diabetes\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Heart disease\n*   Loss of intellectual functions (dementia)\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Problems involving the eyes and vision\n\n**Somatic Variants in Mitochondrial DNA**\n\nGenetic changes that are not inherited (which are known as somatic variants) may also occur in mitochondrial DNA. Somatic variants occur in the DNA of certain cells (not sperm or egg cells) during a person's lifetime and are not passed to future generations. Because mitochondrial DNA has a limited ability to repair errors, these variants tend to build up over time.\n\n**Association with Cancer and Age-Related Disorders**\n\nA buildup of somatic variants in mitochondrial DNA has been associated with some forms of cancer and an increased risk of certain age-related disorders such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, research suggests that the progressive accumulation of these variants over a person's lifetime may play a role in the normal process of aging.\n\n**Resources for Further Information**\n\nFor more information about conditions caused by mitochondrial DNA changes:\n\n*   An overview of mitochondrial disorders is available from GeneReviews.\n*   The Muscular Dystrophy Association offers an introduction to mitochondrial disorders as part of their fact sheet called Mitochondrial Myopathies.\n*   The Neuromuscular Disease Center at Washington University in St. Louis provides an in-depth description of many mitochondrial disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Can changes in mitochondrial DNA affect health and development?**\n\nMitochondrial disorders are a group of diseases caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells.

    "content": "**Can changes in noncoding DNA affect health and development?**\n\nIt is well established that changes in genes can alter a protein's function in the body, potentially causing health problems. Scientists have determined that changes in regions of DNA that do not contain genes (noncoding DNA) can also lead to disease.\n\n**How does noncoding DNA work?**\n\nMany regions of noncoding DNA play a role in the control of gene activity, meaning they help determine when and where certain genes are turned on or off. Other regions of noncoding DNA are important for protein assembly. By altering one of these regions, a variant (also known as a mutation) in noncoding DNA can turn on a gene and cause a protein to be produced in the wrong place or at the wrong time. Alternatively, a variant can reduce or eliminate the production of an important protein when it is needed.\n\n**What are some examples of noncoding DNA-related disorders?**\n\nVariants in noncoding DNA have been linked to several types of cancer and developmental disorders such as isolated Pierre Robin sequence. This condition is caused by changes in regions of noncoding DNA that act as enhancer elements. Enhancers attach proteins that help turn on particular genes. The enhancers altered in isolated Pierre-Robin sequence control the activity of the SOX9 gene.\n\n**What are some other types of regulatory elements in noncoding DNA?**\n\nIn addition to enhancer elements, variants in noncoding DNA can disrupt other regulatory elements. These other elements include promoters, where proteins that turn on genes attach; insulators, where proteins that help shape the activity of genes in different ways attach; and silencers, where proteins that turn off genes attach.\n\n**What are some functional RNA molecules found in noncoding DNA?**\n\nSome regions of noncoding DNA provide instructions for making certain kinds of RNA molecules that play roles in regulating gene activity or assembling proteins. Variants that interrupt these functional RNA molecules, such as transfer RNAs, microRNAs, or long noncoding RNAs, have also been implicated in disease.\n\n**What types of genetic changes can occur in noncoding DNA?**\n\nThe same types of genetic changes that occur in genes or that alter the structure of chromosomes can affect health and development when they occur in noncoding DNA. These alterations include changes in single DNA building blocks (substitution variants), insertions, deletions, duplications, and translocations. Noncoding DNA variants can be inherited from a parent or acquired during a person's life.\n\n**What is still unknown about noncoding DNA?**\n\nMuch is still unknown about how to identify regions of noncoding DNA that have a function in cells and the roles such regions play.

Gene variants can occur due to mutations, such as point mutations, insertions, deletions, or duplications, in the DNA sequence.\n\n\\n\\n**How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nGene variants can affect health and development by altering the function of a protein or disrupting the normal functioning of a cell. The impact of a variant on an individual's health depends on various factors, including the location and type of mutation, as well as the presence of other genetic or environmental influences.\n\n\\n\\n**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nNo, not all gene variants have a significant impact on health and development. Many variants are neutral and do not significantly alter protein function or cellular processes. However, some variants can have detrimental effects, while others may be beneficial.\n\n\\n\\n**What kinds of gene variants are possible?**\n\nGene variants can take various forms, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. The type and location of a mutation can significantly impact its effect on an individual's health.\n\n\\n\\n**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in the number of genes can affect health and development. For example, some genetic conditions result from having too few or too many copies of a gene.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in the number of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in the number of chromosomes can affect health and development. Abnormalities in chromosome number, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), can lead to various health issues.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in the structure of chromosomes can affect health and development. Structural rearrangements, like translocations or inversions, can disrupt gene function and lead to genetic disorders.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in noncoding DNA affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in noncoding DNA can affect health and development. Noncoding regions play critical roles in gene regulation, and alterations in these areas can impact protein production and cellular processes.\n\n\\n\\n**Can changes in mitochondrial DNA affect health and development?**\n\nYes, changes in mitochondrial DNA can affect health and development. Mitochondrial mutations can lead to disorders affecting energy production and cellular function.\n\n\\n\\n**What are complex or multifactorial disorders?**\n\nComplex or multifactorial disorders result from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. These conditions often exhibit variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, making them challenging to diagnose and treat.\n\n\\n\\n**What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?**\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to a disease means that an individual is more likely to develop the condition due to their genetic makeup. This doesn't guarantee the disease will occur, but rather increases the risk.\n\n\\n\\n**How are gene variants involved in evolution?**\n\nGene variants play a crucial role in evolution by providing the raw material for natural selection. Variants can offer advantages or disadvantages, influencing an individual's fitness and ultimately contributing to the adaptation of populations.\n\n\\n\\n**What information can statistics provide about a genetic condition?**\n\nStatistics can provide valuable insights into the prevalence, inheritance pattern, and clinical features of a genetic condition. This information helps clinicians diagnose and manage patients with genetic disorders.\n\n\\n\\n**How are genetic conditions and genes named?**\n\nGenetic conditions and genes are named using a standardized system.

    "content": "**Can Changes in the Number of Chromosomes Affect Health and Development?**\n\nHuman cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes in each cell. A change in the number of chromosomes can cause problems with growth, development, and function of the body's systems.\n\n**What is Aneuploidy?**\n\nA gain or loss in the number of chromosomes from the normal 46 is called aneuploidy. This can occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm), in early fetal development, or in any cell after birth.\n\n**Types of Aneuploidy**\n\n*   **Trisomy**: The presence of an extra chromosome in cells. People with trisomy have three copies of a particular chromosome in cells instead of the normal two copies.\n*   **Monosomy**: The loss of one chromosome in cells. People with monosomy have one copy of a particular chromosome in cells instead of the normal two copies.\n\n**Rare Forms of Aneuploidy**\n\nCells with one additional set of chromosomes, for a total of 69 chromosomes, are called triploid. Cells with two additional sets of chromosomes, for a total of 92 chromosomes, are called tetraploid. A condition in which every cell in the body has an extra set of chromosomes is not compatible with life.\n\n**Chromosomal Mosaicism**\n\nWhen an individual's cells differ in their chromosomal makeup, it is known as chromosomal mosaicism. This occurs from an error in cell division in cells other than eggs and sperm. Most commonly, some cells end up with one extra or missing chromosome (for a total of 45 or 47 chromosomes per cell), while other cells have the usual 46 chromosomes.\n\n**Cancer Cells**\n\nMany cancer cells also have changes in their number of chromosomes. These changes are not inherited; they occur in somatic cells (cells other than eggs or sperm) during the formation or progression of a cancerous tumor.\n\nFor more information about chromosomal disorders, visit [www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genetics](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genetics).\n\n---\n\n**Can changes in the number of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nChanges that are not inherited; they occur in somatic cells (cells other than eggs or sperm) during the formation or progression of a cancerous tumor.\n\nFor more information about chromosomal disorders:\n\n*   MedlinePlus provides a Medical Encyclopedia article about chromosomal mosaicism.\n*   A discussion of how chromosomal abnormalities happen is provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n*   The Centre for Genetics Education offers a fact sheet about changes in chromosome number or size.\n*   The National Organization for Rare Disorders offers an overview of triploidy.\n\n**Topics in the Variants and Health chapter**\n\n*   What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   Do all gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What kinds of gene variants are possible?\n*   Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in the number of chromosomes affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in noncoding DNA affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in mitochondrial DNA affect health and development?\n\n**What are complex or multifactorial disorders?**\n\nComplex or multifactorial disorders are conditions that involve multiple genetic and environmental factors. They cannot be explained by a single gene variant, but rather by the interaction of several genes and environmental influences.\n\n**What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?**\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to a disease means that an individual has a higher risk of developing the condition due to their genetic makeup. However, having a genetic predisposition does not guarantee that the disease will develop, as other factors such as lifestyle and environment also play a role.\n\n**How are gene variants involved in evolution?**\n\nGene variants can be involved in evolution through several mechanisms, including natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation.

    "content": "**Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nChanges that affect the structure of chromosomes can cause problems with growth, development, and function of the body's systems. These changes can affect many genes along the chromosome and disrupt the proteins made from those genes.\n\nStructural changes can occur during the formation of egg or sperm cells, in early fetal development, or in any cell after birth. Pieces of DNA can be rearranged within one chromosome or transferred between two or more chromosomes. The effects of structural changes depend on their size and location, whether gene function is interrupted, and whether any genetic material is gained or lost. Some changes cause health problems, while others may have no effect on a person's health.\n\n**Changes in chromosome structure**\n\nChanges in chromosome structure include the following:\n\n*   **Translocations**: A translocation occurs when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. This type of rearrangement is described as balanced if no genetic material is gained or lost in the cell. If there is a gain or loss of genetic material, the translocation is described as unbalanced.\n*   **Deletions**: Deletions occur when a chromosome breaks and some genetic material is lost. Deletions can be large or small, and can occur anywhere along a chromosome.\n*   **Duplications**: Duplications occur when part of a chromosome is abnormally copied (duplicated). This type of chromosomal change results in extra copies of genetic material from the duplicated segment.\n*   **Inversions**: An inversion occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and re-inserted into the chromosome. Genetic material may or may not be lost as a result of the chromosome breaks. An inversion that includes the chromosome's constriction point (centromere) is called a pericentric inversion. An inversion that occurs in the long (q) arm or short (p) arm and does not involve the centromere is called a paracentric inversion.\n*   **Isochromosomes**: An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. Instead of one q arm and one p arm, an isochromosome has two q arms or two p arms. As a result, these abnormal chromosomes have an extra copy of some genes and are lacking copies of genes on the missing arm.\n*   **Dicentric chromosomes**: Unlike normal chromosomes, which have one centromere, a dicentric chromosome contains two centromeres. Dicentric chromosomes result from the abnormal fusion of two chromosome pieces, each of which includes a centromere. These structures are unstable and often involve a loss of some genetic material.\n*   **Ring chromosomes**: Ring chromosomes usually occur when a chromosome breaks in two places, typically at the ends of the p and q arms, and then the arms fuse together to form a circular structure. The ring may or may not include the centromere, depending on where on the chromosome the breaks occur. In many cases, genetic material near the ends of the chromosome is lost.\n\nMany cancer cells also have changes in their chromosome structure. These changes are not inherited; they occur in somatic cells (cells other than eggs or sperm) during the formation or progression of a cancerous tumor.\n\n---\n\n**Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\nChanges in the structure of chromosomes can indeed impact an individual's health and development. These alterations can occur during the formation of egg or sperm cells, in early fetal development, or even in any cell after birth.\n\n**What are these structural changes?**\n\nThere are several types of structural changes that can affect chromosome structure:\n\n*   **Translocations**: A piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. This type of rearrangement is described as balanced if no genetic material is gained or lost in the cell.\n*   **Deletions**: A chromosome breaks, and some genetic material is lost. Deletions can be large or small and can occur anywhere along a chromosome.\n*   **Duplications**: Part of a chromosome is abnormally copied (duplicated).

Dicentric chromosomes result from the abnormal fusion of two chromosome pieces, each of which includes a centromere.\n\n**What are the effects of these structural changes?**\n\nThe effects of structural changes depend on their size and location, whether gene function is interrupted, and whether any genetic material is gained or lost. Some changes cause health problems, while others may have no effect on a person's health.\n\n**How can I learn more about structural changes to chromosomes?**\n\nFor further information, you can consult the following resources:\n\n*   The National Human Genome Research Institute provides a list of questions and answers about chromosome abnormalities, including a glossary of related terms.\n*   Chromosome Disorder Outreach offers a fact sheet on this topic titled Introduction to Chromosomes. This resource includes illustrated explanations of several chromosome abnormalities.\n*   The Centre for Genetics Education provides a fact sheet about chromosome changes.\n\n**What are some other topics related to gene variants and health?**\n\nYou may also be interested in the following topics:\n\n*   What is a gene variant, and how do variants occur?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   Do all gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What kinds of gene variants are possible?\n*   Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in the number of chromosomes affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in noncoding DNA affect health and development?\n*   Can changes in mitochondrial DNA affect health and development?\n\nThese topics are discussed in the Variants and Health chapter of this website.\n\n---\n\n**Can changes in the structure of chromosomes affect health and development?**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?**\n\nA gene variant, also known as an allele, is a variation of a gene that can occur at a specific location on a chromosome. Gene variants can occur due to mutations, such as point mutations or insertions/deletions, or through genetic recombination during reproduction.\n\n**How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nGene variants can affect health and development in various ways, including altering the function of a protein, changing the amount of a protein produced, or affecting the regulation of gene expression. Some gene variants may have no effect on health, while others can increase the risk of developing certain diseases.\n\n**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nNo, not all gene variants affect health and development. Many gene variants are neutral and do not impact an individual's health. However, some gene variants can have significant effects on health, particularly those that alter protein function or regulation.\n\n**What kinds of gene variants are possible?**\n\nThere are several types of gene variants, including:\n\n*   Point mutations: changes in a single nucleotide base\n*   Insertions/deletions: additions or removals of nucleotides\n*   Chromosomal rearrangements: changes in the structure of chromosomes\n\n**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\nYes, a change in the number of genes can affect health and development.

Once granted a gene patent, the holder of the patent dictates how the gene can be used, in both commercial settings, such as clinical genetic testing, and in noncommercial settings, including research, for 20 years from the date of the patent.\n\n**The Supreme Court Ruling**\n\nOn June 13, 2013, in the case of the Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that human genes cannot be patented in the U.S. because DNA is a \"product of nature.\" The Court decided that because nothing new is created when discovering a gene, there is no intellectual property to protect, so patents cannot be granted.\n\n**Prior to the Ruling**\n\nPrior to this ruling, more than 4,300 human genes were patented. The Supreme Court's decision invalidated those gene patents, making the genes accessible for research and for commercial genetic testing.\n\n**DNA Manipulated in a Lab**\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling did allow that DNA manipulated in a lab is eligible to be patented because DNA sequences altered by humans are not found in nature. The Court specifically mentioned the ability to patent a type of DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA). This synthetic DNA is produced from the molecule that serves as the instructions for making proteins (called messenger RNA).\n\n**For More Information**\n\nRead about the Supreme Court case and ruling against gene patenting.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Medical Association voice their support for the Supreme Court's ruling on gene patents.\n\nThe National Human Genome Research Institute discusses the relationship between Intellectual Property and Genomics.\n\n---\n\n**Can Genes Be Patented?**\n\n\\n\\nAs we delve into the world of genetic testing, it's essential to understand the complexities surrounding gene patents. In 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled that human genes cannot be patented, citing their natural occurrence in the human body as the primary reason.\n\nHowever, this ruling doesn't necessarily extend to other genetic materials, such as DNA sequences or genetic information derived from humans. The patentability of these materials remains a gray area, with ongoing debates and court battles.\n\nFor individuals considering genetic testing, it's crucial to be aware of the potential implications of gene patents on their personal genetic data. While the Supreme Court's ruling provides some clarity, the landscape is constantly evolving, and patients must stay informed to make informed decisions about their genetic information.\n\n**Other Topics in the Genetic Testing Chapter**\n\n\\n\\n* What are the different types of genetic tests?\n* What are the uses of genetic testing?\n* How is genetic testing done?\n* What is informed consent?\n* How can I be sure a genetic test is valid and useful?\n* What do the results of genetic tests mean?\n* What is the cost of genetic testing, and how long does it take to get the results?\n* Will health insurance cover the costs of genetic testing?\n* What are the benefits of genetic testing?\n* What are the risks and limitations of genetic testing?\n* What is genetic discrimination?\n\n**Other Chapters in Help Me Understand Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n* Topics in the Genetic Testing chapter\n* Other chapters in Help Me Understand Genetics",

    "title": "Can the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing affect my ability to get insurance?: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/dtcgenetictesting/dtcinsurancerisk",
    "content": "**Can the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing affect my ability to get insurance?**\n\nPassed in 2008, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) made it illegal for health insurance providers in the United States to use genetic information in decisions about a person's health insurance eligibility or coverage. This means that health insurance companies cannot use the results of a direct-to-consumer genetic test (or any other genetic test) to deny coverage or require you to pay higher premiums. However, GINA does not apply when an employer has fewer than 15 employees.\n\n**GINA and Insurance**\n\nGINA does not apply to other forms of insurance, such as disability insurance, long-term care insurance, or life insurance. However, some states have laws that cover these forms of insurance. Unless prohibited by state laws, companies that offer these policies have the right to request medical information, including the results of any genetic testing, when making decisions about coverage and rates. Some of these companies request information about genetic testing as part of their application process, but others do not.\n\n**Weighing the Risks**\n\nYou should weigh the possible benefits and risks of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, including potential impacts on insurance eligibility and coverage, before you start the testing process.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nNational Human Genome Research Institute: Genetic Discrimination \n\nNational Human Genome Research Institute: Genome Statute and Legislation Database \n\nWharton Public Policy Podcast: Why Genetic Testing Is a ‘Perfect Storm’ for Insurers\n\n---\n\n**Can the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing affect my ability to get insurance?**\n\n\\n\\nIf you've undergone direct-to-consumer genetic testing, you may be wondering whether the results could impact your ability to secure insurance. The answer is yes, they can. Insurance companies have been known to use genetic information to determine policy premiums or even deny coverage altogether.\n\n**What kinds of direct-to-consumer genetic tests are available?**\n\n\\n\\nDirect-to-consumer genetic tests typically fall into three categories: health risk assessment, pharmacogenomics, and genetic ancestry testing. Health risk assessment tests identify genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing certain diseases, such as breast cancer or heart disease. Pharmacogenomics tests determine how your body will react to specific medications based on your genetic profile. Genetic ancestry testing, on the other hand, reveals information about your ancestral origins.\n\n**What do the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing mean?**\n\n\\n\\nThe results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing can be complex and multifaceted. They may indicate a predisposition to certain health conditions, suggest potential medication interactions, or provide insights into your ancestral heritage. However, it's essential to remember that genetic testing is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather a tool for identifying potential risks or trends.\n\n**Can the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing affect my ability to get insurance?**\n\n\\n\\nYes, the results of direct-to-consumer genetic testing can impact your ability to secure insurance. Insurance companies may use genetic information to determine policy premiums or deny coverage altogether. As a result, it's crucial to understand the potential implications of your test results on your future insurance prospects.\n\n**What should I know before proceeding with direct-to-consumer genetic testing?**\n\n\\n\\nBefore undergoing direct-to-consumer genetic testing, it's essential to be aware of the following: the tests may not provide definitive diagnoses; the results may have limited utility in predicting disease onset or progression; and, most importantly, your test results could potentially impact your future insurance prospects. By understanding these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether direct-to-consumer genetic testing is right for you.\n\n**Where can I read more about the diseases and traits covered in my direct-to-consumer genetic testing report?**\n\n\\n\\nFor a comprehensive understanding of the diseases and traits covered in your direct-to-consumer genetic testing report, we recommend consulting reputable sources such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the American Cancer Society. These organizations provide accurate and up-to-date information on various health conditions, which can help you better interpret your test results.\n\n**How do I choose a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company?**\n\n\\n\\nWhen selecting a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, consider the following factors: the company's reputation and credibility; the types of tests offered; the accuracy and reliability of their results; and their policies regarding data privacy and confidentiality. By carefully evaluating these aspects, you can make an informed decision about which company to trust with your genetic information.\n\n**What are the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer genetic testing?**\n\n\\n\\nThe pros of direct-to-consumer genetic testing include increased awareness of potential health risks, personalized recommendations for disease prevention, and a deeper understanding of your ancestral heritage. However, the cons include the potential for misinterpretation or misuse of test results, limited utility in predicting disease onset or progression, and the risk of impacting future insurance prospects. By weighing these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether direct-to-consumer genetic testing is right for you.\n\n**How much does direct-to-consumer genetic testing cost, and is it covered by health insurance?**\n\n\\n\\nThe cost of direct-to-consumer genetic testing varies widely depending on the company and the specific tests offered. Some companies may charge a flat fee for their services, while others may offer tiered pricing based on the type and scope of testing. As for coverage by health insurance, most policies do not currently cover direct-to-consumer genetic testing. However, this landscape is subject to change as the industry continues to evolve.\n\n**How is direct-to-consumer genetic testing done?**\n\n\\n\\nDirect-to-consumer genetic testing typically involves a simple cheek swab or saliva sample, which is then sent to the testing company for analysis. The company's laboratory technicians extract your DNA from the sample and perform various tests to identify specific genetic variants associated with certain health conditions or traits.\n\n**What can raw data from a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me?**\n\n\\n\\nRaw data from a direct-to-consumer genetic test can provide valuable insights into your genetic profile, including information about your ancestral heritage, potential health risks, and medication interactions. However, it's essential to remember that this data should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional to ensure accurate and meaningful results.\n\n**Can a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me whether I will develop cancer?**\n\n\\n\\nWhile direct-to-consumer genetic testing can identify certain genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, it is not a definitive predictor of disease onset. Many factors contribute to the development of cancer, and genetics is only one piece of the puzzle.\n\n**Can a direct-to-consumer genetic test tell me whether I will develop Alzheimer's disease?**\n\n\\n\\nSimilar to cancer, direct-to-consumer genetic testing can identify certain genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not a definitive predictor of disease onset, and many factors contribute to the development of this complex condition.\n\n**What does it mean to have Neanderthal DNA or Denisovan DNA?**\n\n\\n\\nHaving Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in your genetic profile indicates that you have inherited certain genetic variants from these ancient human ancestors. While this may seem fascinating, it's essential to remember that the presence of these variants has limited utility in predicting disease risk or other health outcomes.\n\n**How do direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies protect their customers’ privacy?**\n\n\\n\\nReputable direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies take data privacy and confidentiality seriously. They implement robust security measures to protect customer information, including encryption, secure servers, and strict access controls. Additionally, many companies offer anonymous testing options or provide clear guidelines on how customer data will be used and shared.\n\n**What is genetic ancestry testing?**\n\n\\n\\nGenetic ancestry testing uses your DNA to identify your ancestral origins, providing insights into your ethnic and cultural heritage. This type of testing can be a fascinating way to learn more about your family's history and connect with your roots.\n\n**How do I choose a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company?**\n\n\\n\\nWhen selecting a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, consider the following factors: the company's reputation and credibility; the types of tests offered; the accuracy and reliability of their results; and their policies regarding data privacy and confidentiality.

    "content": "**Can You Boost Your Metabolism?**\n\nYour metabolism is the process your body uses to convert energy from food for all its functions. You rely on your metabolism to breathe, think, digest, circulate blood, keep warm in the cold, and stay cool in the heat.\n\nIt's a common belief that raising your metabolism helps you burn more calories. Unfortunately, there are more myths about boosting metabolism than tactics that work. Some myths can backfire. If you think you're burning more calories than you actually are, you could end up eating more than you should.\n\nHere are the facts on 6 metabolism myths:\n\n**Myth #1: Exercise Boosts Your Metabolism Long After You Stop**\n\nExercise does burn more calories when you do it, especially with activities like biking or swimming. But that increased calorie burn only lasts as long as your workout. You might keep burning extra calories for an hour or so after that, but the aftereffects of exercise stop there.\n\nIf you load up on calories after a workout, thinking your body will keep burning calories the rest of the day, you risk weight gain. Exercise for your health and refuel with modest amounts of healthy foods. Don't let exercise give you an excuse to overindulge in high-calorie foods and drinks.\n\n**Myth #2: Adding Muscle Will Help You Lose Weight**\n\nMuscle burns more calories than fat, but building muscle only makes a small difference in the number of calories you burn. Most regular exercisers only gain a few pounds (fewer kilograms) of muscle, which isn't enough to make a big impact.\n\nLift weights for stronger bones and muscles, and make strength training part of a well-rounded exercise program that includes activities to get your heart pumping. To keep off extra weight, you also need to eat a healthy diet and appropriate portions.\n\n**Myth #3: Eating Certain Foods Can Boost Your Metabolism**\n\nConsuming foods like green tea, caffeine, or hot chili peppers won't help you shed excess pounds (kilograms). Some may provide a small boost in your metabolism, but it's not enough to make a difference in your weight. Choose foods for their good nutrition and taste, and eat a variety of healthy foods that fill you up without filling you out.\n\n**Myth #4: Eating Small Meals During the Day Increases Your Metabolism**\n\nThere's little scientific evidence that eating small, frequent meals boosts metabolism. Spreading your meals throughout the day might keep you from getting too hungry and overeating, but it's not a proven way to increase your metabolism.\n\nPay attention to your hunger cues and eat when you feel hungry. Keep track of your daily diet and limit high-sugar, high-fat snacks.\n\n**Myth #5: Getting a Full Night's Sleep Is Good for Your Metabolism**\n\nA good night's sleep won't boost your metabolism, but going without sleep can lead to adding weight. Sleep-deprived people tend to eat more calories than they need, possibly to deal with feeling tired.\n\nPlan your schedule so you have enough time for sleep. If you have trouble sleeping, look into ways to unwind before bedtime and make your bedroom comfortable for sleep. Talk to your healthcare provider if self-care tips for better sleep don't help.\n\n**Myth #6: You Will Gain Weight as You Age Because Your Metabolism Slows Down**\n\nWhile it's true that our metabolism is slower than when we were kids, a lot of mid-life weight gain happens because we become less active. Jobs and family may push exercise to the back burner. When we don't move as much, we lose muscle and gain fat.\n\nAs you get older, make exercise a regular part of every day. By staying active and sticking with smaller portions of healthy foods, you can ward off weight gain as you age.\n\n---\n\n**Can You Boost Your Metabolism?**\n\nYour metabolism is the process your body uses to convert energy from food for all its functions.

Don't let exercise give you an excuse to overindulge in high-calorie foods and drinks.\n\n**Myth #2: Adding Muscle Will Help You Lose Weight**\n\nMuscle burns more calories than fat. So, will building more muscle not boost your metabolism? Yes, but only by a small amount. Most regular exercisers only gain a few pounds (fewer kilograms) of muscle. That's not enough to make a big difference in the number of calories you burn. Plus, when not in active use, muscles burn very few calories. Most of the time, your brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs account for most of your metabolism.\n\n**What to Do:** Lift weights for stronger bones and muscles. Make strength training part of a well-rounded exercise program that includes activities to get your heart pumping.

Spreading your meals throughout the day might keep you from getting too hungry and overeating. If so, it's a good idea. Athletes perform better when they eat more often in smaller amounts. If you are someone who has a hard time stopping once you start eating, 3 meals a day may make it easier for you to stick to an appropriate intake than lots of little snacks.\n\n**What to Do:** Pay attention to your hunger cues and eat when you feel hungry.

    "content": "**Can't Sleep? Try These Tips**\n\nEveryone has trouble sleeping some of the time. But if it happens often, lack of sleep can affect your health and make it hard to get through the day. Learn lifestyle tips that can help you get the rest you need.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nSome people have trouble falling asleep. Others wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep. You can change your habits and your home to make sleep less fleeting.\n\n* **Stick to a Sleep Schedule:**\n\t+ Go to bed and get up at the same time.\n\t+ Going to sleep at the same time every night trains your body and brain to wind down and get ready for slumber.\n\t+ Get up if you cannot sleep. If you lay awake for 15 minutes, get out of bed and go to another part of the house. This way your bed is less likely to become a place of stress.\n\t+ Do something quiet and relaxing like read a book. This can also help take your mind off the fact that you are not sleeping. When you feel drowsy, return to bed.\n* **Make Your Bedroom Comfortable:**\n\t+ Get a comfortable mattress. If your mattress is lumpy, too soft, or too hard, it will be hard to get comfortable enough for sleep.\n\t+ Keep it cool. Your body temperature goes down when you sleep. Make sure your bedroom is cool enough but not so cool that you wake up cold. Experiment with the thermostat and blankets to find what temperature works for you.\n\t+ Control the light. Light from the street, a TV, or the next room can make it hard to stay asleep. Use curtains and doors to make your room dark so you can sleep. You can also try using a sleep mask.\n\t+ Control sounds. Make your room as quiet as you can. You might use a fan, soft music, or sound machine to create white noise you can sleep to.\n\t+ Hide the clock. Watching the hours tick by can stress you out. Turn the clock so you cannot see it from your pillow.\n\t+ Put away electronics. Silence any device that reminds you of emails you need to send or things you need to do. You will be better off doing those things after a good night's sleep.\n\n**Practice Relaxation**\n\nTry different ways to relax. Find what works for you. Such as:\n\n* Drink something warm and non-caffeinated like warm milk or herbal tea.\n* Take a warm shower or bath.\n* Read a book or magazine.\n* Listen to soft music or an audiobook.\n* Count backward from 300 by 3.\n* Meditate.\n* Starting at your feet and working your way up to your head, tense each group of muscles for a second or two and then relax them.\n* Do belly breathing. Put your hand on your belly. Take a breath in, letting it push your hand out as your belly rises. Your chest should not move. Hold it for a count of 5, release for a count of 5. Repeat.\n\n**Live for Good Sleep**\n\nThings you do during the day can affect how well you sleep at night. You should:\n\n* Limit evening activities. When you are on the run, your day may not end until late evening. Try to limit evening plans to a few nights a week. Give yourself time for a soothing bedtime ritual to help prepare you for sleep, such as a warm bath or reading in bed.\n* Exercise. Regular exercise will help you sleep better. Just be sure you plan your workout right. Overtraining or exercising less than 3 hours before bedtime can make you toss and turn.\n* Limit naps. If you are having trouble sleeping, cut out the catnaps. You will sleep better at night.\n* Limit caffeine. It might be a helpful pick-up in the morning, but you may go to bed wired if you drink coffee, tea, or caffeinated sodas in the afternoon or evening.\n* Limit alcohol. It may help you get to sleep at first, but alcohol keeps you from deep, restoring sleep later at night.\n* Kick the habit. Need another reason to quit smoking? The nicotine in cigarettes can disrupt sleep.\n* Eat smart. Avoid heavy meals before bedtime. Try to eat 2 or 3 hours before bedtime. If you feel hungry right before you go to bed, have a small, healthy snack like a small bowl of yogurt or low sugar cereal.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your health care provider if lack of sleep is interfering with your daily activities.\n\n---\n\n**Can't Sleep? Try These Tips**\n\nAre you tired of lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling? Do you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night? You're not alone. Everyone has trouble sleeping some of the time, but if it happens often, lack of sleep can affect your health and make it hard to get through the day.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nSome people have trouble falling asleep, while others wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep. But there are things you can do to change your habits and your home to make sleep less fleeting.\n\n* **Stick to a Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends. This trains your body and brain to wind down and get ready for slumber.\n* **Get Up If You Can't Sleep**: If you lay awake for 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing like reading a book. When you feel drowsy, return to bed.\n\n**Make Your Bedroom Comfortable**\n\nYour bedroom should be a sleep haven, not a source of stress. Make it comfortable by:\n\n* **Getting a Comfortable Mattress**: If your mattress is lumpy, too soft, or too hard, it will be hard to get comfortable enough for sleep.\n* **Keeping It Cool**: Your body temperature goes down when you sleep. Make sure your bedroom is cool enough but not so cool that you wake up cold.\n* **Controlling the Light**: Light from the street, a TV, or the next room can make it hard to stay asleep. Use curtains and doors to make your room dark, or try using a sleep mask.\n* **Controlling Sounds**: Make your room as quiet as you can. You might use a fan, soft music, or sound machine to create white noise you can sleep to.\n* **Hiding the Clock**: Watching the hours tick by can stress you out. Turn the clock so you cannot see it from your pillow.\n* **Putting Away Electronics**: Silence any device that reminds you of emails you need to send or things you need to do. You will be better off doing those things after a good night's sleep.\n\n**Practice Relaxation**\n\nTry different ways to relax and find what works for you:\n\n* **Drink Something Warm**: Try warm milk or herbal tea.\n* **Take a Warm Shower or Bath**: Soak your worries away.\n* **Read a Book or Magazine**: Get lost in a good story.\n* **Listen to Soft Music or an Audiobook**: Calm your mind with soothing sounds.\n* **Count Backward from 300 by 3**: Try this relaxing technique.\n* **Meditate**: Find inner peace and calmness.\n* **Tense and Relax Your Muscles**: Start at your feet and work your way up to your head, tensing each group of muscles for a second or two before relaxing them.\n* **Do Belly Breathing**: Put your hand on your belly and take a breath in, letting it push your hand out as your belly rises. Your chest should not move. Hold it for a count of 5, release for a count of 5. Repeat.\n\n**Live for Good Sleep**\n\nThings you do during the day can affect how well you sleep at night. Remember to:\n\n* **Limit Evening Activities**: Try to limit evening plans to a few nights a week and give yourself time for a soothing bedtime ritual.\n* **Exercise**: Regular exercise will help you sleep better, but be sure to plan your workout right. Avoid overtraining or exercising less than 3 hours before bedtime.\n* **Limit Naps**: Cut out the catnaps if you're having trouble sleeping. You'll sleep better at night.\n* **Limit Caffeine**: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon or evening, as it can disrupt sleep.\n* **Limit Alcohol**: While it may help you get to sleep at first, alcohol keeps you from deep, restorative sleep later at night.\n* **Kick the Habit**: Quit smoking, as nicotine can disrupt sleep.\n* **Eat Smart**: Avoid heavy meals before bedtime and try to eat 2 or 3 hours beforehand. If you feel hungry right before bed, have a small, healthy snack like a small bowl of yogurt or low sugar cereal.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve the quality of your sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.\n\n---\n\n**Can't Sleep?

    "content": "**Canavan Disease**\n\n**Description**\n\\n\\n\nCanavan disease is a rare inherited disorder that damages the ability of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain to send and receive messages. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies disrupt the growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses.\n\n**Neonatal/Infantile Form**\n\\n\\n\nThe neonatal/infantile form of Canavan disease is the most common and most severe form of the condition. Affected infants appear normal for the first few months of life, but by age 3 to 5 months, problems with development become noticeable. These infants usually do not develop motor skills such as turning over, controlling head movement, and sitting without support. Other common features of this condition include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), and irritability. Feeding and swallowing difficulties, seizures, and sleep disturbances may also develop.\n\n**Mild/Juvenile Form**\n\\n\\n\nThe mild/juvenile form of Canavan disease is less common. Affected individuals have mildly delayed development of speech and motor skills starting in childhood. These delays may be so mild and nonspecific that they are never recognized as being caused by Canavan disease.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\\n\\n\nThe life expectancy for people with Canavan disease varies. Most people with the neonatal/infantile form live only into childhood, although some survive into adolescence or beyond. People with the mild/juvenile form do not appear to have a shortened lifespan.\n\n---\n\n**Canavan Disease**\n\n**What is Canavan disease?**\n\nCanavan disease is a rare inherited disorder that damages the ability of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain to send and receive messages.\n\n**Forms of Canavan disease**\n\nThere are two forms of Canavan disease:\n\n*   **Neonatal/infantile form**: This is the most common and severe form of the condition. Affected infants appear normal for the first few months of life, but by age 3 to 5 months, problems with development become noticeable.\n*   **Mild/juvenile form**: This form is less common and has a milder effect on the enzyme's activity, leading to less accumulation of NAA.\n\n**Causes of Canavan disease**\n\nMutations in the ASPA gene cause Canavan disease. The ASPA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartoacylase. This enzyme normally breaks down a compound called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA), which is predominantly found in neurons in the brain.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nWhile this condition occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. Studies suggest that this disorder affects 1 in 6,400 to 13,500 people in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The incidence in other populations is unknown.\n\n**Life expectancy**\n\nThe life expectancy for people with Canavan disease varies. Most people with the neonatal/infantile form live only into childhood, although some survive into adolescence or beyond. People with the mild/juvenile form do not appear to have a shortened lifespan.\n\n---\n\n**Canavan Disease**\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ACY2 deficiency\n* Aminoacylase 2 deficiency\n* Aspa deficiency\n* Aspartoacylase deficiency\n* Canavan's disease\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic Testing Information**\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Canavan Disease, Familial Form\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Mild Canavan disease\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Spongy degeneration of central nervous system\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\t+ Canavan disease\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Clinical Trials**\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ CANAVAN DISEASE\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Baslow MH, Guilfoyle DN.

    "content": "**Cancer Alternative Therapies**\n\nAre you considering complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as part of your cancer treatment? CAM involves caring for your mind, body, and spirit. Some methods focus on breathing or body movements to help you relax, while others use special foods, supplements, or diets.\n\nExamples of CAM therapies include:\n\n*   Acupuncture\n*   Chiropractic\n*   Herbal medicines\n\n**What are Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Care?**\n\nYou have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might consider is using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and therapies that are not part of standard medical care.\n\n**How Are Complementary and Alternative Therapies Used for Cancer Care?**\n\nIf you're thinking about using CAM along with your standard care, it's called integrative medicine.

    "content": "**Cancer Immunotherapy**\n\nWelcome to the world of cancer immunotherapy, a revolutionary approach to treating cancer that harnesses the power of the immune system. In this article, we'll explore the basics of cancer immunotherapy and its potential benefits for patients.\n\n**What is Cancer Immunotherapy?**\n\nCancer immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Unlike traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, which can have severe side effects, immunotherapy works by stimulating the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\n**How Does Cancer Immunotherapy Work?**\n\nImmunotherapy for cancer works by modifying or enhancing the immune response to cancer. This can be achieved through various methods, including:\n\n* **Vaccines**: These are used to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that specifically target cancer cells.\n* **Checkpoint inhibitors**: These are medications that release the brakes on the immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack cancer cells.\n* **Adoptive cell therapy**: This involves using a patient's own immune cells, such as T-cells, to fight cancer.\n\n**Benefits of Cancer Immunotherapy**\n\nCancer immunotherapy has several benefits over traditional treatments:\n\n* **Fewer side effects**: Immunotherapy tends to have fewer and less severe side effects compared to chemotherapy and radiation.\n* **Improved survival rates**: Studies have shown that patients who receive immunotherapy tend to have better survival rates than those who receive traditional treatments.\n* **Increased quality of life**: By stimulating the immune system, immunotherapy can help improve a patient's quality of life by reducing symptoms and improving overall well-being.\n\n**Languages**\n\nCancer Immunotherapy is available in multiple languages:\n\n* Arabic (العربية)\n* Chinese, Simplified (Mandarin dialect) (简体中文)\n* French (français)\n* Haitian Creole (Kreyol ayisyen)\n* Hindi (हिन्दी)\n* Korean (한국어)\n* Polish (polski)\n* Portuguese (português)\n* Russian (Русский)\n* Spanish (español)\n* Tagalog (Wikang Tagalog)\n* Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)\n\n**Resources**\n\nFor more information on cancer immunotherapy, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* American Cancer Society\n* National Library of Medicine\n\nBy understanding the basics of cancer immunotherapy and its potential benefits, patients and healthcare providers can work together to develop effective treatment plans that prioritize patient well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Cancer Immunotherapy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is cancer immunotherapy?**\n\nCancer immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. It works by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does cancer immunotherapy work?**\n\nCancer immunotherapy can take several forms, including:\n\n*   **Vaccines**: These are medicines that help the immune system recognize cancer cells as foreign.\n*   **Checkpoint inhibitors**: These are medicines that release the brakes on the immune system, allowing it to attack cancer cells more effectively.\n*   **Cytokines**: These are proteins that help stimulate the immune system to fight cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of cancer immunotherapy?**\n\nThe benefits of cancer immunotherapy include:\n\n*   **Improved survival rates**: Cancer immunotherapy has been shown to improve survival rates for some types of cancer.\n*   **Fewer side effects**: Compared to traditional chemotherapy, cancer immunotherapy often has fewer side effects.\n*   **Increased quality of life**: By helping the immune system fight cancer, cancer immunotherapy can improve a patient's quality of life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the risks and side effects of cancer immunotherapy?**\n\nAs with any type of treatment, there are risks and side effects associated with cancer immunotherapy. These may include:\n\n*   **Allergic reactions**: Some patients may experience allergic reactions to cancer immunotherapy medicines.\n*   **Infections**: Cancer immunotherapy can weaken the immune system, making patients more susceptible to infections.\n*   **Autoimmune disorders**: In some cases, cancer immunotherapy can trigger autoimmune disorders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I learn more about cancer immunotherapy?**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about cancer immunotherapy, we recommend speaking with a healthcare professional. They can provide you with personalized information and guidance based on your specific situation.",

    "content": "**Cancer Immunotherapy**\n\n**What is Immunotherapy?**\n\nImmunotherapy is a cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer. It's a type of biological therapy that uses substances made from living organisms or versions of these substances made in a lab.\n\n**When is Immunotherapy Used for Cancer Treatment?**\n\nImmunotherapy isn't used as often as other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. However, it is used for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types.\n\n**How Does Immunotherapy Work Against Cancer?**\n\nCancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. When you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping, and old cells don't die when they should. They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they can hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can \"mark\" your cancer cells, making it easier for your immune system to find and destroy them.\n\n**How Is Immunotherapy Given?**\n\nThere are different forms of immunotherapy, so how they are given varies. You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into your bladder.\n\n**How Often and How Long You Get Immunotherapy Varies**\n\nIt depends on your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles, so your body has time to rest and recover.\n\n**What Are the Side Effects of Immunotherapy?**\n\nYou may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at the needle site if you get it by IV.

    "content": "**Cancer and Lymph Nodes**\n\nLymph nodes are part of the lymph system, a network of organs, nodes, ducts, and vessels that support the body's immune system.\n\n*   **Nodes as filters**: Nodes are little filters throughout the body. The cells in lymph nodes help to destroy infection, such as from a virus, or harmful cells, such as cancer cells.\n*   **Cancer spread**: Cancer can spread to or start in lymph nodes.\n\n**How Cancer Gets in the Lymph Nodes**\n\nThere are two ways cancer gets into the lymph nodes:\n\n1.  **Lymphoma**: Cancer can start in the lymph nodes. This is called lymphoma. There are several types of lymphomas, such as Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n2.  **Metastatic cancer**: Cancer cells can also spread to the lymph nodes from a cancer in any part of the body. This is called metastatic cancer. Cancer cells may leave a tumor in the body and travel to an area of lymph nodes. The cancer cells often travel to nodes near the tumor first.\n\n**How Cancer in Lymph Nodes is Found**\n\nNodes swell as they work hard to fight cancer cells. You or your health care provider may feel or see swollen lymph nodes if they are close to the surface of the skin, such as in the neck, groin, or underarms. Keep in mind that many other things also can cause lymph nodes to swell. So having swollen lymph nodes does not mean you definitely have cancer.\n\nWhen a provider suspects that cancer cells may be present in lymph nodes, certain tests may be performed to detect cancer, such as:\n\n*   **Lymph node biopsy or removal**\n*   **B-cell leukemia/lymphoma panel on the lymph node**\n*   **Other imaging tests**\n\n**What it Means When Cancer is Found**\n\nA node can have a small or large amount of cancer cells in it. There are hundreds of nodes throughout the body. Several clusters or only a few nodes may be affected. Nodes near or far from the primary tumor may be affected.\n\nThe location, amount of swelling, and number of nodes affected will often help determine the treatment plan. When cancer has spread to lymph nodes, it is in a more advanced stage.\n\nThe cancer in lymph nodes can be treated with:\n\n*   **Surgery**\n*   **Chemotherapy**\n*   **Immunotherapy**\n*   **Radiation**\n*   **Removing Lymph Nodes**\n\nSurgical removal of lymph nodes is called lymphadenectomy. Surgery can help to get rid of the cancer before spreading further.\n\nAfter nodes are removed, lymph fluid has fewer places to go.

    "content": "**Cancer Prevention: Take Charge of Your Lifestyle**\n\nLike any illness or disease, cancer can occur without warning. Many factors that increase your cancer risk are beyond your control, such as your family history and your genes. Others, such as whether you smoke or get regular cancer screenings, are within your control.\n\nChanging certain habits can give you a powerful tool to help prevent cancer. It all starts with your lifestyle.\n\n**Quit Smoking and Using Tobacco**\n\nQuitting smoking has a direct and strong positive effect on your risk for cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals that damage your cells and may cause cancer. Harming your lungs is not the only concern. Smoking and tobacco use cause many types of cancer, such as:\n\n* Lung\n* Throat\n* Mouth\n* Esophagus\n* Bladder\n* Kidney\n* Pancreatic\n* Certain leukemias\n* Stomach\n* Colon\n* Rectum\n* Cervix\n\nTobacco leaves and the chemicals added to them are not safe. Smoking tobacco in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, or chewing tobacco can all give you cancer.\n\nIf you smoke, talk with your health care provider today about ways to quit smoking and all tobacco use.\n\n**Protect Yourself from UV Rays**\n\nThe ultraviolet radiation in sunlight can cause changes to your skin. The sun's rays (UVA and UVB) damage skin cells. These harmful rays are also found in tanning beds and sunlamps. Sunburns and many years of sun exposure can lead to skin cancer.\n\nIt is unclear whether avoiding the sun or using sunscreen can prevent all skin cancers. Still, you are better off protecting yourself from UV rays:\n\n* Stay in the shade.\n* Cover up with protective clothing, a hat, and sunglasses.\n* Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going outside. Use SPF 30 or higher and reapply every 2 hours if you will be swimming, sweating, or outside in direct sun for a long time.\n* Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps.\n\n**Maintain a Healthy Weight**\n\nCarrying a lot of extra weight creates changes in your hormones. These changes can trigger cancer growth. Being overweight or having obesity puts you at higher risk for:\n\n* Breast cancer (after menopause)\n* Brain cancer\n* Colon cancer\n* Endometrial cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Thyroid cancer\n* Liver cancer\n* Kidney cancer\n* Gallbladder cancer\n\nYour risk is higher if your body mass index (BMI) is high enough to be considered obese. You can use an online tool to calculate your BMI at www.cdc.gov/bmi/index.html. You can also measure your waist to see where you stand. In general, a woman with a waist over 35 inches (in) or 89 centimeters (cm) or a man with a waist over 40 in (102 cm) is at increased risk for health problems from obesity.\n\nExercise regularly and eat healthy foods to keep your weight in check. Ask your provider for advice on how to lose weight safely.\n\n**Get Regular Exercise**\n\nExercise is healthy for all, for many reasons. Studies have shown that people who exercise seem to have a lower risk for certain cancers. Exercise can help you keep your weight down. Staying active may help protect you against colon, breast, lung, and endometrial cancers.\n\nAccording to national guidelines, you should exercise for at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week for health benefits. That is 30 minutes at least 5 days per week. Doing more is even better for your health.\n\n**Eat Healthy Foods**\n\nGood food choices can build up your immune system and may help protect you from cancer. Take these steps:\n\n* Eat more plant-based foods like fruits, beans, legumes, and green vegetables\n* Drink water and low-sugar drinks\n* Avoid processed foods from boxes and cans\n* Avoid processed meats like hotdogs, bacon, and deli meats\n* Choose lean proteins such as fish and chicken; limit red meat\n* Eat whole grain cereals, pasta, crackers, and breads\n* Limit high-calorie fattening foods, such as French fries, doughnuts, and fast foods\n* Limit candy, baked goods, and other sweets\n* Consume smaller portions of foods and drinks\n* Prepare most of your own foods at home, rather than buying pre-made or eating out\n* Prepare foods by baking rather than broiling or grilling; avoid heavy sauces and creams\n\nStay informed. The chemicals and added sweeteners in certain foods are being looked at for their possible links to cancer.\n\n**Limit Alcohol**\n\nWhen you drink alcohol, your body has to break it down. During this process, a chemical byproduct is left in the body that can damage cells. Too much alcohol may also get in the way of healthy nutrients your body needs.\n\nDrinking too much alcohol is linked to the following cancers:\n\n* Oral cancer\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Breast cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Liver cancer\n\nLimit your alcohol to at most 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women. Better yet, don't drink alcohol at all.\n\n**Have Regular Check-ups**\n\nYour provider can help you assess your risk for cancer and steps you can take. Visit your provider for a checkup. That way you stay on top of what cancer screenings you should have. Screening can help to detect cancer early and improve your chance of recovery.\n\nSome infections can also cause cancer. Talk with your provider about whether you should have these vaccinations:\n\n* Human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus increases the risk for cancers of the cervix, penis, vagina, vulvar, anus, and throat.\n* Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B infection increases the risk for liver cancer.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have questions or concerns about your cancer risk and what you can do\n* You are due for a cancer screening test\n\n---\n\n**Cancer Prevention: Take Charge of Your Lifestyle**\n\nMany factors that increase your cancer risk are beyond your control, such as your family history and your genes. Others, such as whether you smoke or get regular cancer screenings, are within your control.\n\nChanging certain habits can give you a powerful tool to help prevent cancer. It all starts with your lifestyle.\n\n**Quit Smoking and Using Tobacco**\n\nQuitting smoking has a direct and strong positive effect on your risk for cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals that damage your cells and may cause cancer. Harming your lungs is not the only concern. Smoking and tobacco use cause many types of cancer, such as:\n\n* Lung\n* Throat\n* Mouth\n* Esophagus\n* Bladder\n* Kidney\n* Pancreatic\n* Certain leukemias\n* Stomach\n* Colon\n* Rectum\n* Cervix\n\nTobacco leaves and the chemicals added to them are not safe. Smoking tobacco in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, or chewing tobacco can all give you cancer.\n\nIf you smoke, talk with your health care provider today about ways to quit smoking and all tobacco use.\n\n**Protect Yourself from UV Rays**\n\nThe ultraviolet radiation in sunlight can cause changes to your skin. The sun's rays (UVA and UVB) damage skin cells. These harmful rays are also found in tanning beds and sunlamps. Sunburns and many years of sun exposure can lead to skin cancer.\n\nIt is unclear whether avoiding the sun or using sunscreen can prevent all skin cancers. Still, you are better off protecting yourself from UV rays:\n\n* Stay in the shade.\n* Cover up with protective clothing, a hat, and sunglasses.\n* Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going outside. Use SPF 30 or higher and reapply every 2 hours if you will be swimming, sweating, or outside in direct sun for a long time.\n* Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps.\n\n**Maintain a Healthy Weight**\n\nCarrying a lot of extra weight creates changes in your hormones. These changes can trigger cancer growth. Being overweight or having obesity puts you at higher risk for:\n\n* Breast cancer (after menopause)\n* Brain cancer\n* Colon cancer\n* Endometrial cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Thyroid cancer\n* Liver cancer\n* Kidney cancer\n* Gallbladder cancer\n\nYour risk is higher if your body mass index (BMI) is high enough to be considered obese. You can use an online tool to calculate your BMI at www.cdc.gov/bmi/index.html. You can also measure your waist to see where you stand. In general, a woman with a waist over 35 inches (in) or 89 centimeters (cm) or a man with a waist over 40 in (102 cm) is at increased risk for health problems from obesity.\n\nExercise regularly and eat healthy foods to keep your weight in check. Ask your provider for advice on how to lose weight safely.\n\n**Get Regular Exercise**\n\nExercise is healthy for all, for many reasons. Studies have shown that people who exercise seem to have a lower risk for certain cancers. Exercise can help you keep your weight down. Staying active may help protect you against colon, breast, lung, and endometrial cancers.\n\nAccording to national guidelines, you should exercise for at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week for health benefits. That is 30 minutes at least 5 days per week. Doing more is even better for your health.\n\n**Eat Healthy Foods**\n\nGood food choices can build up your immune system and may help protect you from cancer. Take these steps:\n\n* Eat more plant-based foods like fruits, beans, legumes, and green vegetables\n* Drink water and low-sugar drinks\n* Avoid processed foods from boxes and cans\n* Avoid processed meats like hotdogs, bacon, and deli meats\n* Choose lean proteins such as fish and chicken; limit red meat\n* Eat whole grain cereals, pasta, crackers, and breads\n* Limit high-calorie fattening foods, such as French fries, doughnuts, and fast foods\n* Limit candy, baked goods, and other sweets\n* Consume smaller portions of foods and drinks\n* Prepare most of your own foods at home, rather than buying pre-made or eating out\n* Prepare foods by baking rather than broiling or grilling; avoid heavy sauces and creams\n\nStay informed. The chemicals and added sweeteners in certain foods are being looked at for their possible links to cancer.\n\n**Limit Alcohol**\n\nWhen you drink alcohol, your body has to break it down. During this process, a chemical byproduct is left in the body that can damage cells. Too much alcohol may also get in the way of healthy nutrients your body needs.\n\nDrinking too much alcohol is linked to the following cancers:\n\n* Oral cancer\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Breast cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Liver cancer\n\nLimit your alcohol to at most 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women.

    "content": "**Cancer Treatment - Dealing with Pain**\n\nCancer can sometimes cause pain. This pain can come from the cancer itself, or from the treatments for cancer.\n\nTreating your pain should be part of your overall treatment for cancer. You have a right to receive treatment for cancer pain. There are many medicines and other treatments that can help. If you have any pain, be sure to talk with your health care provider about your options.\n\n**What Causes Pain**\n\nThe pain from cancer can have a few different causes:\n\n*   **The Cancer**: When a tumor grows, it can press on nerves, bones, organs, or the spinal cord, causing pain.\n*   **Medical Tests**: Some medical tests, such as a biopsy or bone marrow test, can cause pain.\n*   **Treatment**: Many types of cancer treatments can cause pain, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nEveryone's pain is different. Your pain can range from mild to severe and may last for only a short time or continue for a long time.\n\n**Why Treat Pain**\n\nMany people with cancer do not get enough treatment for their pain. This may be because they do not want to take pain medicine, or they do not think it will help. But treating your pain is part of treating your cancer. You should get treatment for pain just as you would for any other side effect.\n\nManaging pain can also help you feel better overall. Treatment can help you:\n\n*   Sleep better\n*   Be more active\n*   Want to eat\n*   Feel less stress and depression\n*   Improve your sex life\n\n**Addiction Concerns**\n\nSome people are afraid to take pain medicines because they think they will become addicted. Over time, your body may develop a tolerance for pain medicine. This means that you may need more of it to treat your pain. This is normal and can happen with other medicines as well. It does not mean you are addicted. As long as you are taking the medicine as prescribed by your provider, you have little chance of becoming addicted.\n\n**How to Talk About Pain**\n\nTo make sure you get the right treatment for your pain, it is important to be as honest as possible with your provider. You will want to tell your provider:\n\n*   What your pain feels like (aching, dull, throbbing, constant, or sharp)\n*   Where you feel the pain\n*   How long the pain lasts\n*   How strong it is\n*   If there is a time of day it feels better or worse\n*   If there is anything else that makes it feel better or worse\n*   If your pain keeps you from doing any activities\n\nYour provider may ask you to rate your pain using a scale or a chart. It may be helpful to keep a pain diary to help track your pain. You can also keep track of when you take medicine for your pain and how much it helps. This will help your provider know how well the medicine is working.\n\n**Types of Medicines for Pain**\n\nThere are three main types of medicines for cancer pain. Your provider will work with you to find a medicine that works best for you with the least amount of side effects. In general, you will start with the least amount of medicine with the fewest side effects that relieves your pain. If one medicine does not work, your provider may suggest another. It may take a little time to find the right medicine and the right dose that is right for you.\n\n*   **Non-opioid pain relievers**: These medicines include acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). They are best to treat mild to moderate pain. You can buy most of these medicines over the counter.\n*   **Opioids or narcotics**: These are stronger medicines that are used to treat moderate to severe pain. You need to have a prescription to take them. Some common opioids include codeine, fentanyl, morphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. You may take these medicines in addition to other pain relievers.\n*   **Other types of medicines**: Your provider may prescribe other medicines to help with your pain. These can include anticonvulsants or antidepressants for nerve pain or steroids to treat pain from swelling.\n\n**How to Take Pain Medicine**\n\nIt is important to take your pain medicine exactly as your provider tells you to. Here are some tips to get the most out of your pain medicine:\n\n*   Tell your provider about all other medicines you are taking. Some pain medicines can interact with other medicines.\n*   Do not skip doses or try to go longer between doses. Pain is easiest to treat when you treat it early. Do not wait until pain is severe before taking your medicine. This may make your pain harder to treat and cause you to need larger doses.\n*   Do not stop taking the medicine on your own. Tell your provider if you have side effects or other issues. Your provider can help you find ways to deal with side effects or other problems. If the side effects are too severe, you may need to try another medicine.\n*   Tell your provider if the medicine is not working. They may increase your dose, have you take it more often, or try another medicine.\n\n**Other Treatments for Cancer Pain**\n\nIn some cases, your provider may suggest another type of treatment for your cancer pain. Some options include:\n\n*   **Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS)**: TENS is a mild electrical current that can help ease pain. You place it on the part of your body where you feel pain.\n*   **Nerve block**: This is a special type of pain medicine injected around or into a nerve to ease pain.\n*   **Radiofrequency ablation**: Radio waves heat up regions of nerve tissue to help ease pain.\n*   **Radiation therapy**: This treatment can shrink a tumor that is causing pain.\n*   **Chemotherapy**: These medicines can also shrink a tumor to reduce pain.\n*   **Surgery**: Your provider may use surgery to remove a tumor that is causing pain. In some cases, a type of brain surgery can cut the nerves that carry pain messages to your brain.\n*   **Complementary or alternative treatments**: You may also choose to try treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic, meditation, or biofeedback to help treat your pain. In most cases, people use these methods in addition to medicines or other types of pain relief.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCancer pain\n\n**References**\n\nNational Cancer Institute website.

    "content": "**Cancer Treatment - Early Menopause**\n\nCertain types of cancer treatments can cause women to have early menopause. This is menopause that occurs before age 40. It happens when your ovaries stop working. At that point, you will no longer have periods and cannot get pregnant.\n\nEarly menopause can cause symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Your health care provider can help you find treatments for these symptoms.\n\n**Treatments That Can Cause Early Menopause**\n\nCancer treatments that can cause early menopause include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Having both ovaries removed causes menopause to happen right away. If you are age 50 or younger, your surgeon may try to leave an ovary or part of an ovary if possible. This can keep you from having early menopause.\n*   **Chemotherapy (chemo)**: Some types of chemo can damage your ovaries and cause early menopause. You may have menopause right away or months after treatment. Your risk of early menopause from chemo depends on the type and amount of chemo medicine you get. The younger you are, the less likely you will have early menopause from chemo.\n*   **Radiation**: Getting radiation in your pelvic area can also damage your ovaries. In some cases, your ovaries may heal and start working again. But, if you get large doses of radiation, the damage may be permanent.\n*   **Hormone therapy**: These treatments used to treat breast and uterine cancers can often cause early menopause.\n\nAsk your surgeon if your cancer treatment may cause early menopause.\n\n**Effects of Early Menopause**\n\nWhen your ovaries are removed or stop working, they no longer make estrogen. This causes the same symptoms as natural menopause.\n\n*   **Vaginal dryness or tightness**\n*   **Hot flashes**\n*   **Mood changes**\n*   **Lower sex drive**\n*   **Problems sleeping**\n\nIn some cases, these symptoms may come on strong and can be severe.\n\nLess estrogen in your body also increases your risk for certain health conditions, such as:\n\n*   **Heart disease**\n*   **Osteoporosis (thinning of bones)**\n\n**How to Ease Symptoms**\n\nMany treatments can help ease the symptoms of early menopause. They include medicines and lifestyle treatments you can do at home.\n\nSome medicines that may help include:\n\n*   **Hormone therapy**: In some cases, your provider may prescribe female hormones to help with hot flashes and other symptoms. But, there are some risks with hormones, and you may not be able to take them if you have had certain types of cancer.\n*   **Vaginal estrogen**: Even if you cannot take hormone therapy by mouth or skin patch, you may be able to use small amounts of estrogen in or around your vagina to help with dryness. These hormones come in creams, gels, tablets, and rings. You need a prescription from your provider for these medicines.\n*   **Other medicines**: If you cannot take hormones, your provider may prescribe another type of medicine to help with hot flashes, such as certain antidepressants (even if you are not depressed) or other medicines. Because of their chemical effects, these are effective for hot flashes even if you are not depressed.\n*   **Lubricants or moisturizers**: These products can help make sex more comfortable if you have vaginal dryness. Look for a water-based lubricant, such as K-Y Jelly or Astroglide. Or, try using a vaginal moisturizer like Replens every few days.\n*   **Medicines for bone loss**: Some women take medicines to help reduce bone loss after menopause. Ask your provider if this type of medicine may be right for you.\n\nTreatments you can try at home include:\n\n*   **Staying active**: Getting regular exercise can help with mood swings, sleep problems, and mild hot flashes.\n*   **Healthy sleep habits**: Getting enough sleep may help ease mood swings. But, if you are having trouble sleeping at night, try skipping naps during the day. You should also avoid caffeine late in the day, and do not have large meals or do anything too active right before bedtime.\n*   **Dressing in layers**: This can help with hot flashes, since you can remove layers when you feel hot. It can also help to dress in loose, cotton clothing.\n\nAsk your provider what treatments might work best for you.\n\n**Protecting Your Bones and Heart**\n\nSince early menopause can affect your bone and heart health, it's important to take steps to keep them healthy. Here is how:\n\n*   **Eat healthy foods**: Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, nuts, beans, and low-fat dairy products.\n*   **Get enough calcium and vitamin D**: These nutrients help build bones. Foods rich in calcium include yogurt and milk, spinach, and white beans. Your body makes most of its vitamin D from the sun, but you can also get it from salmon, eggs, and milk that has vitamin D added. Ask your provider if you need to take supplements.\n*   **Get exercise**: The best kinds of exercise for your bones are weight-bearing exercises that work your body against gravity. Some ideas include walking, yoga, hiking, dancing, lifting weights, gardening, and tennis.\n*   **Do not smoke**: Smoking raises your risk for both osteoporosis and heart disease. If you need help quitting, ask your provider.\n*   **Ask about a bone density test**: This is a test that checks for osteoporosis. This is a recommended test for all women at age 65, but you should consider one earlier if you have early menopause.\n*   **Keep track of your numbers**: Make sure your provider checks your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels regularly. These simple tests can help tell you if you are at risk for heart disease or stroke.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPremature menopause; Ovarian insufficiency - cancer\n\n**References**\n\nMitsis D, Beaupin LK, O'Connor T.

    "content": "**Cancer Treatment - Preventing Infection**\n\nWhen you have cancer, you may be at higher risk for infection. Some cancers and cancer treatments weaken your immune system. This makes it harder for your body to fight off germs such as viruses and bacteria. If you get an infection, it can quickly become serious and be hard to treat. In some cases, you may need to go to the hospital for treatment. So it is important to learn how to prevent and treat any infections before they spread.\n\n**How Having Cancer Increases Infection Risk**\n\nAs part of your immune system, your white blood cells help fight infection. White blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Some types of cancer, such as leukemia, and some treatments including bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy affect your bone marrow and immune system. This makes it harder for your body to make new white blood cells that can fight infection and increases your infection risk.\n\nYour health care provider will check your white blood cell count during your treatment. When levels of certain white blood cells drop too low, it is called neutropenia. Often this is a short-lived and expected side effect of cancer treatment. Your provider may give you medicines to help prevent infection if this occurs. But, you should also take some precautions.\n\n**Other Risk Factors for Infection**\n\nCatheters (intravenous and urinary)\nMedical conditions such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nRecent surgery\nMalnutrition\n\n**Ways to Prevent Infection**\n\nThere are many things you can do to help prevent infection. Here are some tips:\n\n*   **Wash your hands often**: Hand washing is very important after using the bathroom, before eating or cooking, after touching animals, after blowing your nose or coughing, and after touching surfaces that other people have touched.\n*   **Take care of your mouth**: Brush your teeth often with a soft toothbrush and use a mouth rinse that does not contain alcohol.\n*   **Stay away from sick people**: It is easy to catch a cold, the flu, chickenpox, the SARS-CoV-2 virus (that causes COVID-19 disease) or other infection from someone who has it. You should also avoid anyone who has had a live virus vaccine.\n*   **Clean yourself carefully after bowel movements**: Use baby wipes or water instead of toilet paper and let your provider know if you have any bleeding or hemorrhoids.\n*   **Make sure your food and drinks are safe**: Do not eat fish, eggs, or meat that is raw or undercooked. And do not eat anything that is spoiled or past the freshness date.\n*   **Ask someone else to clean up after pets**: Do not pick up pet waste or clean fish tanks or birdcages.\n*   **Carry sanitizing wipes**: Use them before touching public surfaces such as doorknobs, ATM machines, and railings.\n*   **Guard against cuts**: Use an electric razor to avoid nicking yourself while shaving and do not tear at nail cuticles. Also be careful when using knives, needles, and scissors. If you do get a cut, clean it right away with soap, warm water, and an antiseptic. Clean your cut this way every day until it forms a scab.\n*   **Use gloves when gardening**: Bacteria and fungi are often in soil.\n*   **Stay away from crowds**: Plan your outings and errands for times that are less crowded. Wear a mask when you have to be around people.\n*   **Be gentle with your skin**: Use a towel to gently pat dry your skin after a shower or bath, and use lotion to keep it soft. Do not pick at pimples or other spots on your skin.\n*   **Ask about getting a flu shot or other vaccines**: Do not get any vaccines without first checking with your provider. You should not receive any vaccines that contain a live virus.\n\n**Know How to Spot an Infection**\n\nIt is important to know the symptoms of an infection so you can call your provider right away. They include:\n\n*   A fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher\n*   Chills or sweats\n*   Redness or swelling anywhere on your body\n*   Cough\n*   Earache\n*   Headache, stiff neck\n*   Sore throat\n*   Sores in your mouth or on your tongue\n*   Rash\n*   Bloody or cloudy urine\n*   Pain or burning with urination\n*   Nasal congestion, sinus pressure or pain\n*   Vomiting or diarrhea\n*   Pain in your stomach or rectum\n\nDo not take acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or any medicine that reduces a fever without first checking with your provider.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nDuring or right after cancer treatment, contact your provider right away if you have any of the signs of infection mentioned above. Getting an infection during cancer treatment is an emergency.\n\nIf you go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room, tell the staff right away that you have cancer.

Used as hormone therapy for some women with certain types of breast cancer.\n*   Opioids. Strong pain relievers given to some people with cancer.\n*   Tamoxifen. A medicine used to treat breast cancer in both women and men. It is also used to prevent cancer in some women.\n*   Tricyclic antidepressants. A type of antidepressant medicine.\n*   Steroids. Used to reduce swelling. They also may be used to treat some cancers.\n\n**Medicines That Can Help**\n\nThere are a few kinds of medicines that can help ease hot flashes and night sweats, depending on their cause. But they also may cause side effects or have certain risks. Talk with your health care provider about your options. If one medicine does not work for you, your provider may recommend you try another.\n\n*   Hormone therapy (HT). HT works well to reduce symptoms that are due to a lack of estrogen. But women need to use caution with HT. Also, women who have had breast cancer should not take estrogen. Men can use estrogen or progesterone to treat these symptoms after treatment for prostate cancer.\n*   Antidepressants, mainly paroxetine.\n*   Clonidine (a type of blood pressure medicine).\n*   Gabapentin or pregabalin (which are also used to treat seizures).\n*   Oxybutynin (to treat overactive bladder).\n\n**Other Treatment Options**\n\nSome other types of treatments may help with hot flashes and night sweats.\n\n*   Relaxation techniques or stress reduction. Learning how to decrease stress and anxiety may help relieve hot flashes in some people.\n*   Hypnosis. During hypnosis, a therapist can help you relax and focus on feeling cool. Hypnosis also may help you lower your heart rate, lessen stress, and balance your body temperature, which can help reduce hot flashes.\n*   Acupuncture. Although some studies have found that acupuncture can help with hot flashes, others have not found a benefit. If you are interested in acupuncture, ask your provider if it might be an option for you.\n\n**Home Treatment for Night Sweats**\n\nYou can also try some simple things at home to help relieve night sweats.\n\n*   Open windows and keep fans running to get air moving through your home.\n*   Wear loose-fitting cotton clothing.\n*   Try breathing deeply and slowly to help reduce symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Hot Flashes and Night Sweats**\n\nCertain types of cancer treatments can cause hot flashes and night sweats. Hot flashes are when your body suddenly feels hot. In some cases, hot flashes can make you sweat. Night sweats are often associated with hot flashes but they can occur on their own.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople who are treated for breast cancer or prostate cancer are likely to have hot flashes or night sweats during or after treatment.\n\nIn women, some cancer treatments can cause them to go into early menopause. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms of menopause. These treatments include some types of:\n\n* Radiation\n* Chemotherapy\n* Hormone treatment\n* Surgery, for example, to remove your ovaries\n\nLymphoma is the most common type of cancer to cause night sweats.\n\nIn men, surgery to remove one or both testicles or treatment with certain hormones can cause these symptoms.\n\nHot flashes and night sweats also may be caused by some medicines:\n\n* Aromatase inhibitors.

    "content": "**Cancer Treatment: Fertility and Sexual Side Effects in Women**\n\nGetting treatment for cancer can cause side effects. Some of these side effects can affect your sex life or fertility, which is your ability to have children. These side effects may last for a short time or be permanent. The type of side effect you have depends on your type of cancer and your treatment.\n\n**Cancers Most Likely to Have Sexual Side Effects**\n\nMany cancer treatments can cause sexual side effects. But you are more likely to have these side effects if you are being treated for one of these types of cancer:\n\n* Cervical cancer\n* Ovarian cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Uterine cancer\n* Vaginal cancer\n* Breast cancer\n* Bladder cancer\n\n**Types of Sexual Side Effects**\n\nFor women, the most common sexual side effects include:\n\n* Loss of desire\n* Pain during sex\n\nOther side effects can include:\n\n* Not being able to have an orgasm\n* Numbness or pain in the genitals\n* Problems with fertility\n\nMany people also have emotional side effects after cancer treatment, such as feeling depressed or bad about your body. These side effects can also affect your sex life. You may not feel like having sex or may not want your partner to touch your body.\n\n**How Cancer Treatment Causes These Side Effects**\n\nDifferent types of cancer treatment can affect your sexuality and fertility in different ways.\n\n* Surgery for cancer:\n\t+ Pelvic surgery can cause pain and problems having sex or getting pregnant.\n\t+ Some women who have surgery to remove all or part of a breast find they have less interest in sex.\n* Chemotherapy can cause:\n\t+ Loss of sexual desire\n\t+ Pain with sex and problems having an orgasm\n\t+ Vaginal pain or dryness and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.\n\t+ Problems with fertility\n* Radiation therapy can cause:\n\t+ Loss of sexual desire\n\t+ Changes in the lining of your vagina. This can cause pain and problems with fertility.\n\n**Talk About Side Effects**\n\nOne of the most important things you can do is to talk with your health care provider about sexual side effects before your treatment. Ask what types of possible side effects to expect and how long they will last. This way, you will know what to expect. You should also talk about these changes with your partner.\n\nIf your treatment can cause fertility problems, you may want to see a fertility specialist before your treatment to discuss your options if you want to have children. These options may include freezing your eggs or ovarian tissue.\n\n**Sex During Treatment**\n\nAlthough many women continue to have sex during cancer treatment, you may find you are not interested in sex. Both of these responses are normal.\n\nIf you do want to have sex, make sure to ask your provider if it is OK. Also ask about using birth control. In most cases, it is not safe to get pregnant during cancer treatment.\n\n**Coping with Sexual Changes**\n\nSex may feel different for you after your treatment, but there are ways to help cope.\n\n* Focus on the positive. Feeling bad about your body can affect your sex life. Look for little ways to give yourself a lift, such as a new hairstyle, new makeup or a new outfit.\n* Give yourself time. It can take months to heal after cancer treatment. Do not push yourself to have sex just because you think you should. Once you are ready, remember that it may take longer for you to feel aroused. You also may need to use a lubricant.\n* Keep an open mind. There is not just one way to have sex. Try to stay open to all ways of being intimate. Experiment with new ways of touching. You may find that what feels good after treatment is not the same as what felt good before treatment.\n* See your provider. If you are having pain with sex, tell your provider. You may be recommended creams, lubricants, or other treatments.\n* Talk with your partner. This is very important. Try to be open about your feelings. Be honest about what would make you feel good. And try to listen to your partner's concerns or desires with an open mind.\n* Share your feelings. It is normal to feel anger or grief after cancer treatment. Do not hold it in. Talk with close friends and family. It can also help to talk with a counselor if you cannot shake feelings of loss and grief.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRadiotherapy - fertility; Radiation - fertility; Chemotherapy - fertility; Sexual dysfunction - cancer treatment\n\n---\n\n**Cancer Treatment and Fertility in Women**\n\nIf you're a woman undergoing cancer treatment, you may be worried about the potential impact on your fertility and sex life. Unfortunately, many cancer treatments can cause sexual side effects that can last for a short time or even be permanent.\n\n**Types of Cancer Most Likely to Have Sexual Side Effects**\n\nYou are more likely to experience these side effects if you're being treated for one of the following types of cancer:\n\n* Cervical cancer\n* Ovarian cancer\n* Colorectal cancer\n* Uterine cancer\n* Vaginal cancer\n* Breast cancer\n* Bladder cancer\n\n**Common Sexual Side Effects in Women**\n\nThe most common sexual side effects in women include:\n\n* Loss of desire\n* Pain during sex\n* Not being able to have an orgasm\n* Numbness or pain in the genitals\n* Problems with fertility\n\n**Emotional Side Effects**\n\nMany people also experience emotional side effects after cancer treatment, such as feeling depressed or bad about their body. These side effects can also affect your sex life and relationships.\n\n**How Cancer Treatment Causes Sexual Side Effects**\n\nDifferent types of cancer treatment can cause sexual side effects in different ways:\n\n* Surgery for cancer: Pelvic surgery can cause pain and problems having sex or getting pregnant.\n* Chemotherapy: Can cause loss of sexual desire, pain with sex, vaginal pain or dryness, and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.\n* Radiation therapy: Can cause loss of sexual desire and changes in the lining of your vagina, leading to pain and problems with fertility.\n* Hormone therapy for breast cancer: Can cause loss of sexual desire, vaginal pain or dryness, and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.\n\n**Talking About Side Effects**\n\nOne of the most important things you can do is talk with your healthcare provider about sexual side effects before your treatment. Ask what types of possible side effects to expect and how long they will last. This way, you'll know what to expect and can plan accordingly.\n\nIf your treatment can cause fertility problems, you may want to see a fertility specialist before your treatment to discuss your options if you want to have children.\n\n**Coping with Sexual Changes**\n\nSex may feel different for you after your treatment, but there are ways to help cope:\n\n* Focus on the positive: Feeling good about your body can help improve your sex life.\n* Give yourself time: It can take months to heal after cancer treatment. Don't push yourself to have sex just because you think you should.\n* Keep an open mind: There's not just one way to have sex.

    "content": "**Cancer Treatments**\n\nIf you have cancer, your health care provider will recommend one or more ways to treat the disease. The most common treatments are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Other options include targeted therapy, immunotherapy, laser, hormonal therapy, and others.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Surgery**\n\nSurgery is a common treatment for many types of cancer. During the operation, the surgeon takes out the mass of cancerous cells (tumor) and some of the nearby tissue. Sometimes, surgery is done to relieve side effects caused by a tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Chemotherapy**\n\nChemotherapy refers to medicines used to kill cancer cells. The medicines may be given by mouth or into a blood vessel (IV). Different types of medicines may be given together at the same time or one after the other.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Radiation**\n\nRadiation therapy uses x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death.\n\nThe two main types of radiation therapy are:\n\n*   **External beam**: This is the most common form. It aims x-rays or particles at the tumor from outside the body.\n*   **Internal beam**: This form delivers radiation inside your body. It may be given by radioactive seeds placed into or near the tumor; a liquid or pill that you swallow; or through a vein (intravenous, or IV).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Targeted Therapies**\n\nTargeted therapy uses medicines to stop cancer from growing and spreading. It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Immunotherapy**\n\nImmunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body's ability to fight infection (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hormonal Therapy**\n\nHormone therapy is used to treat cancers that are fueled by hormones, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. It uses surgery, or medicines to stop or block the body's natural hormones. This helps slow the growth of cancer cells. The surgery involves removing organs that make hormones: the ovaries or testes. The medicines are given by injection or as pills.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hyperthermia**\n\nHyperthermia uses heat to damage and kill cancer cells without harming normal cells.\n\nIt may be used for:\n\n*   A small area of cells, such as a tumor\n*   Parts of the body, such as an organ or limb\n*   The whole body\n\nThe heat is delivered from a machine outside the body or through a needle or probe placed in the tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Laser Therapy**\n\nLaser therapy uses a very narrow, focused beam of light to destroy cancer cells. Laser therapy can be used to:\n\n*   Destroy tumors and precancerous growths\n*   Shrink tumors that are blocking the stomach, colon, or esophagus\n*   Help treat cancer symptoms, such as bleeding\n*   Seal nerve endings after surgery to reduce pain\n*   Seal lymph vessels after surgery to reduce swelling and keep tumor cells from spreading\n\nLaser therapy is often given through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Thin fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. Lasers are also used on the skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Photodynamic Therapy**\n\nIn photodynamic therapy, a person gets a shot of a medicine that is sensitive to a special type of light. The medicine stays in cancer cells longer than it stays in healthy cells. Then, the doctor directs light from a laser or other source at the cancer cells. The light changes the medicine to a substance that kills the cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cryotherapy**\n\nAlso called cryosurgery, this therapy uses very cold gas to freeze and kill cancer cells. It is sometimes used to treat cells that might turn into cancer (called pre-cancerous cells) on the skin or cervix, for example. Providers can also use a special instrument to deliver cryotherapy to tumors inside the body, such as the liver or prostate.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Cancer Society website.

It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments.\n\nStandard chemotherapy works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the medicine disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread.\n\nTargeted therapy medicines work in a few different ways. They may:\n\n*   Turn off the process in cancer cells that causes them to grow and spread\n*   Trigger cancer cells to die on their own\n*   Kill cancer cells directly\n\nTargeted therapies are given as a pill or IV.\n\n**Immunotherapy**\n\nImmunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body's ability to fight infection (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells.\n\nImmunotherapy works by:\n\n*   Stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells\n*   Preventing cancer from spreading to other parts of the body\n*   Boosting the immune system's ability to get rid of cancer cells\n\nThese medicines are designed to seek and attack certain parts of a cancer cell. Some have toxins or radioactive substances attached to them. Immunotherapy is given by IV.\n\n**Hormonal Therapy**\n\nHormone therapy is used to treat cancers that are fueled by hormones, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers.

Other options include targeted therapy, immunotherapy, laser, hormonal therapy, and others.\n\n* **Surgery**: Surgery is a common treatment for many types of cancer. During the operation, the surgeon takes out the mass of cancerous cells (tumor) and some of the nearby tissue. Sometimes, surgery is done to relieve side effects caused by a tumor.\n* **Chemotherapy**: Chemotherapy refers to medicines used to kill cancer cells. The medicines may be given by mouth or into a blood vessel (IV). Different types of medicines may be given together at the same time or one after the other.\n* **Radiation**: Radiation therapy uses x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death.\n* **Targeted Therapies**: Targeted therapy uses medicines to stop cancer from growing and spreading. It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments.\n* **Immunotherapy**: Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body's ability to fight infection (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells.\n* **Hormonal Therapy**: Hormone therapy is used to treat cancers that are fueled by hormones, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. It uses surgery, or medicines to stop or block the body's natural hormones. This helps slow the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Cancer Society website.
