    "content": "**Citrullinemia**\n\n_Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood._\n\n*Two types of citrullinemia have been described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes.*\n\n**Type I Citrullinemia (Classic Citrullinemia)**\n\n_Type I citrullinemia usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up, they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness._\n\n*Some affected individuals develop serious liver problems. The health problems associated with type I citrullinemia are life-threatening in many cases.*\n\n*Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, blind spots (scotomas), problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia), and lethargy.*\n\n*Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder.*\n\n**Type II Citrullinemia**\n\n_Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma._\n\n*Affected individuals often have specific food preferences, preferring protein-rich and fatty foods and avoiding carbohydrate-rich foods.*\n\n*The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake.*\n\n*These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia.*\n\n---\n\n**Citrullinemia**\n\n_Causes_\n\nMutations in the ASS1 and SLC25A13 genes cause citrullinemia. The proteins produced from these genes play roles in the urea cycle.\n\n_Type I Citrullinemia_\n\nType I citrullinemia is the most common form of the disorder, affecting about 1 in 57,000 people worldwide. It usually becomes evident in the first few days of life and is characterized by a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness.\n\n_Type II Citrullinemia_\n\nType II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. It typically appears during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake.\n\n_Adult-Onset Type II Citrullinemia_\n\nAdult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This condition blocks the flow of bile and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD go away within a year, but some individuals may develop other signs and symptoms in early childhood or even decades later.\n\n_Frequency_\n\nType I citrullinemia is the most common form of the disorder, affecting about 1 in 57,000 people worldwide. Type II citrullinemia is found primarily in the Japanese population, where it occurs in an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 230,000 individuals. It has also been reported in other populations, including East Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\nNote: The cleaned output maintains the original structure and medical information while removing code blocks, ads, disclaimers, standalone URLs, and formatting inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Citrullinemia**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ASS1 and SLC25A13 genes cause citrullinemia. The proteins produced from these genes play roles in the urea cycle.\n\n*   **Urea Cycle**: A sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells, processing excess nitrogen generated when protein is used by the body.\n*   **Nitrogen Processing**: Excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted in urine.\n\n**Type I Citrullinemia**\n\nMutations in the ASS1 gene cause type I citrullinemia. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase 1, responsible for one step of the urea cycle.\n\n*   **Enzyme Activity**: Mutations in the ASS1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, disrupting the urea cycle and preventing the body from processing nitrogen effectively.\n*   **Ammonia Accumulation**: Excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to neurologic symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia.\n\n**Adult-Onset Type II Citrullinemia**\n\nMutations in the SLC25A13 gene are responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia, NICCD, and FTTDCD. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin.\n\n*   **Protein Function**: Within cells, citrin helps transport molecules used in the production and breakdown of simple sugars, the production of proteins, and the urea cycle.\n*   **Ammonia Buildup**: The resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the signs and symptoms of adult-onset type II citrullinemia.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nBoth types of citrullinemia are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the respective gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Genes Associated with Citrullinemia**\n\n*   **ASS1**\n*   **SLC25A13**\n\n**Learn More About the Genes Associated with Citrullinemia**\n\nTo learn more about the genes associated with citrullinemia, expand this section.\n\n---\n\n**Citrullinemia**\n\n**What is Citrullinemia?**\n\nCitrullinemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain amino acids, leading to a buildup of toxic substances in the blood.\n\n**Types of Citrullinemia**\n\nThere are two main types of citrullinemia:\n\n* **Type I**: Also known as classic citrullinemia, this type is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase. It is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n* **Type II**: This type is caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial aspartate glutamate carrier (citrin) and is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of citrullinemia can vary depending on the type, but may include:\n\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain\n* Jaundice\n* Enlarged liver\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCitrullinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the respective gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with citrullinemia typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help diagnose citrullinemia by identifying mutations in the genes responsible for the disorder.\n\n**References**\n\n* Faghfoury H, Baruteau J, de Baulny HO, Haberle J, Schulze A.

There are two types of citrullinemia: type I and type II.\n\n**Causes of Citrullinemia**\n\nResearch has shown that mitochondrial aspartate glutamate carrier (citrin) deficiency is the cause of adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (NICCD).\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of citrullinemia can vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* Vomiting\n* Abdominal pain\n* Diarrhea\n* Fever\n* Enlarged liver\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can detect mutations in the SLC25A20 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for citrullinemia, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Dietary restrictions to limit protein intake\n* Medications to reduce ammonia levels\n* Supportive care to manage symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with citrullinemia varies depending on the type and severity of the disorder. With proper treatment and management, some individuals may experience a good quality of life, while others may experience more severe complications.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nCitrullinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder. Carriers of the mutation may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the mutation on to their children.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genetic Brain Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Metabolic Disorders\n* Newborn Screening",

    "content": "**Clean Catch Urine Sample**\n\nA clean catch is a method of collecting a urine sample to be tested. The clean-catch urine method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nIf possible, collect the sample when urine has been in your bladder for 2 to 3 hours.\n\nYou will use a special kit to collect the urine. It will most likely have a cup with a lid and wipes.\n\nWash your hands with soap and warm water.\n\n* **People with a vagina:**\n\t+ Wash the area between the vagina \"lips\" (labia) with sterile wipes.\n\t+ Sit on the toilet with your legs spread apart. Use two fingers to spread open your labia.\n\t+ Use the first wipe to clean the inner folds of the labia. Wipe from the front to the back.\n\t+ Use a second wipe to clean over the opening where urine comes out (urethra), just above the opening of the vagina.\n* **People with a penis:**\n\t+ Clean the head of the penis with a sterile wipe. If you are not circumcised, you will need to pull back (retract) the foreskin first.\n\t+ Urinate a small amount into the toilet bowl, and then stop the flow of urine.\n\t+ Then collect a sample of urine into the clean or sterile cup, until it is half full.\n\n**INFANTS**\n\nYou will be given a special bag to collect the urine. It will be a plastic bag with a sticky strip on one end, made to fit over your baby's genital area.\n\n*   Wash the area well with soap and water, and dry.\n*   Open and place the bag on your infant.\n*   The entire penis can be placed in the bag or place the bag over the labia.\n*   You can put on a diaper over the bag.\n*   Check the baby often and remove the bag after the urine collects in it. Active infants may displace the bag, so you may need to make more than one attempt.\n\n**AFTER COLLECTING THE SAMPLE**\n\nScrew the lid tightly on the cup.

This type of test is often used to diagnose urinary tract infections (UTIs) or other conditions affecting the urinary system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is a clean catch urine sample collected?**\n\nTo collect a clean catch urine sample, the healthcare provider will typically instruct the patient to:\n\n1. **Wash their hands**: Before collecting the urine sample, the patient should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n2. **Use a sterile container**: The healthcare provider will provide a sterile container for the patient to collect their urine in.\n3. **Midstream collection**: The patient should urinate into the toilet or a urinal until a significant amount of urine has been released (about half). Then, they should stop urinating and collect the remaining urine in the sterile container.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is a clean catch urine sample important?**\n\nA clean catch urine sample is important because it helps to ensure that the urine test results are accurate and reliable. If the urine sample is contaminated with bacteria or other foreign substances, the test results may be misleading or incorrect. This can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment of UTIs or other conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine and Urination",

Germs are also on the surfaces and objects that we touch.\n\n**How can I avoid getting germs from surfaces and objects?**\n\nTo avoid becoming infected by germs from surfaces and objects, it is important to wash your hands often. But you can't wash your hands every time you touch something. So it's also important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects.\n\n**What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting?**\n\nSome people think that disinfecting is same thing as cleaning or sanitizing. But they are actually different:\n\n* **Cleaning**: removes dirt, dust, crumbs, and germs from surfaces or objects. When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you.\n* **Disinfecting**: uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs.\n* **Sanitizing**: could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc.\n\n**Which surfaces and objects do I need to clean and disinfect?**\n\nTo prevent the spread of infection, you should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. For example, in your house, this would include countertops, doorknobs, faucet and toilet handles, light switches, remotes, and toys.\n\n**How can I safely clean and disinfect?**\n\nIt's important to be safe when using cleaning and disinfecting products:\n\n* Store them in the containers they came in.\n* Always follow the instructions and pay attention to the warnings on the label.\n* Do not mix cleaners and disinfectants unless the labels say that it is safe to do so.\n* Check the label to see whether you need to use gloves to protect your hands and/or eye protection when using the products\n* If you swallow, inhale, or get them on your skin, follow the directions on the label or get medical help\n* Store them out of the reach of children\n\n---\n\n**Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sanitizing**\n\n**Why Clean and Disinfect?**\n\nGerms are a part of everyday life.

This causes an opening in the upper lip.\n\n* The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose.\n* It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.\n\n**What is Cleft Palate?**\n\nChildren with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the \"palate.\" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.\n\n* Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChildren with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with:\n\n* Feeding\n* Talking\n* Ear infections\n* Hearing loss\n* Problems with their teeth\n\n**Treatment**\n\nOften, surgery can close the lip and palate.

They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.\n\n_*Causes of Cleft Lip and Palate:_*\n\n*   A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth.\n*   This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose.\n*   It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.\n\n_*Symptoms and Complications:_*\n\n*   Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate.\n*   The roof of the mouth is called the \"palate.\" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.\n*   Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.\n*   Children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking.\n*   They also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth.\n\n_*Treatment and Therapies:_*\n\n*   Often, surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months.\n*   Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older.\n\n_*Living With Cleft Lip and Palate:_*\n\n*   With treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.\n\n_*Genetics:_*\n\n*   Some babies are born with a combination of birth defects that can include cleft lip and/or palate. These conditions may be caused by genetic mutations.\n*   For example, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body and can cause cleft lip and/or palate.\n\n_*Specifics:_*\n\n*   Cleft Lip: A cleft lip is an opening in the upper lip.\n*   Cleft Palate: A cleft palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth.\n*   Cleft Palate With Cleft Lip: This is a combination of both conditions.\n\n_*Learning About Velocardiofacial Syndrome:_*\n\n*   Velocardiofacial syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body and can cause cleft lip and/or palate.\n\n---\n\n**Cleft Lip and Palate**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Cleft Lip and Palate?**\n\nCleft lip and palate are birth defects that occur when the tissues of the mouth don't come together properly during pregnancy. This can cause a gap in the upper lip (cleft lip) and/or the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).\n\n\\n\\n* **Causes:** The exact causes of cleft lip and palate are still not fully understood, but research suggests that it may be related to genetic factors, environmental factors, or a combination of both.\n* **Risk Factors:** Certain risk factors have been identified, including:\n\t+ Family history\n\t+ Ethnicity (more common in certain populations)\n\t+ Prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke\n\t+ Poor maternal nutrition\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cleft lip and palate can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* **Cleft Lip:** A visible gap or split in the upper lip\n* **Cleft Palate:** A visible gap or split in the roof of the mouth\n* **Difficulty Feeding:** Babies with cleft lip and palate may have trouble feeding due to difficulty latching onto the breast or bottle.\n* **Ear Infections:** Children with cleft lip and palate are at a higher risk for ear infections, which can lead to hearing problems if left untreated.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for cleft lip and palate typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including:\n\n* **Surgery:** To repair the cleft lip and/or palate\n* **Speech Therapy:** To help improve speech and communication skills\n* **Dental Care:** Regular dental check-ups to ensure proper oral health\n\n\\n\\n**Research**\n\nThe National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research is the primary NIH organization for research on Cleft Lip and Palate. Ongoing research aims to better understand the causes of cleft lip and palate, as well as develop new treatments and prevention strategies.",

    "content": "**Cleft Lip and Palate Repair - Discharge**\n\nYour child had surgery to repair birth defects that caused a cleft in which the lip or the roof of the mouth did not grow together normally while your child was in the womb. Your child had general anesthesia (asleep and not feeling pain) for the surgery.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAfter anesthesia, it is normal for children to have stuffy noses. They may need to breathe through their mouths for the first week. There will be some drainage from their mouths and noses. The drainage should go away after about 1 week.\n\n**Incision Care**\n\nClean the incision (surgery wound) after feeding your child.\n\n*   Your surgeon may give you a special liquid (hydrogen peroxide) for cleaning the wound. Use a cotton swab (Q-tip) to do so.\n*   If not, clean with warm water and soap.\n*   Wash your hands before starting.\n*   Begin at the end that is closer to the nose.\n*   Always begin cleaning away from the incision in small circles. Do not rub right on the wound.\n*   If your surgeon gave you an antibiotic ointment, put it on your child's incision after it is clean and dry.\n\nSome stitches will break apart or go away on their own. The surgeon will need to take others out at the first follow-up visit. Do not remove your child's stitches yourself unless instructed by your surgeon.\n\nYou will need to protect your child's incision.\n\n**Feeding**\n\nYoung infants should be eating only breast milk or formula. When feeding, hold your infant in an upright position.\n\nUse a cup or the side of a spoon for giving your child drinks. If you use a bottle, use only the kind of bottle and nipple that your surgeon has recommended.\n\nOlder infants or young children will need to have their food softened or pureed for some time after surgery so it is easy to swallow. Use a blender or food processor to prepare food for your child.\n\nChildren who are eating foods other than breast milk or formula should be sitting when they eat. Feed them only with a spoon. Do not use forks, straws, chopsticks, or other utensils that can harm their incisions.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYour child may play quietly. Avoid running and jumping until the surgeon says it is OK.\n\nYour child may go home with arm cuffs or splints. These will keep your baby from rubbing or scratching the incision. Your child will need to wear the cuffs most of the time for about 2 weeks. Put on the cuffs over a long-sleeve shirt. Tape them to the shirt to keep them in place if needed.\n\nYou may take the cuffs off 2 or 3 times a day. Take off only 1 at a time.\nMove your child's arms and hands around, always holding on and keeping them from touching the incision.\nMake sure there is no red skin or sores on your child's arms where the cuffs are placed.\nYour child's surgeon will tell you when you can stop using the cuffs.\n\n**Follow-up Care**\n\nYour health care provider will refer your child to a speech therapist. The provider may also make a referral to a dietician. Most times, speech therapy lasts 2 months. You will be told when to make a follow-up appointment.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n*   Any part of the incision is opening or stitches come apart.\n*   The incision is red, or there is drainage.\n*   There is any significant bleeding from the incision, mouth, or nose. If bleeding does not stop with gentle pressure, go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number.\n*   Your child is not able to drink any liquids.\n*   Your child has a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher.\n*   Your child has a fever that does not go away after 2 or 3 days.\n*   Your child has problems breathing.\n\n---\n\n**Cleft Lip and Palate Repair - Discharge**\n\nYou've just brought home your little one from surgery to repair their cleft lip and palate. Now, it's time to focus on a smooth recovery at home.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAfter anesthesia, it's normal for kids to have stuffy noses. They may need to breathe through their mouths for the first week. There will be some drainage from their mouths and noses, but this should clear up within about 1 week.\n\n**Incision Care**\n\nTo keep your child's incision clean and healthy:\n\n*   Clean the incision after feeding your child.\n*   Wash your hands before starting.\n*   Begin at the end closer to the nose.\n*   Always clean away from the incision in small circles. Don't rub directly on the wound.\n*   If instructed, apply an antibiotic ointment to the cleaned and dried incision.\n\nSome stitches will break apart or disappear on their own. Your surgeon will need to remove others at the first follow-up visit. Unless instructed by your surgeon, don't attempt to remove your child's stitches yourself.\n\n**Important Care Instructions**\n\n*   Protect your child's incision.\n*   Feed your child only as directed by your surgeon.\n*   Avoid giving your child a pacifier.\n*   For babies, sleep in an infant seat on their backs.\n*   Don't hold your child with their face towards your shoulder, as this can harm their incision.\n*   Keep hard toys out of reach.\n*   Dress your child in clothes that don't need to be pulled over their head or face.\n\nBy following these care instructions and keeping a close eye on your child's recovery, you'll help them heal smoothly and get back to their happy, healthy self in no time.\n\n---\n\n**Cleft Lip and Palate Repair - Discharge**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Incision Care**\n\n*   Clean the incision (surgery wound) after feeding your child.\n*   Your surgeon may give you a special liquid (hydrogen peroxide) for cleaning the wound.

Cleft lip and palate may occur along with other syndromes or birth defects.\n\n_Affects the Appearance of the Face_\n_Leads to Problems with Feeding and Speech_\n_Leads to Ear Infections_\n\n_Babies are more likely to be born with a cleft lip and palate if they have a family history of these conditions or other birth defects._\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* A child may have one or more birth defects and the severity can vary significantly.\n* A cleft lip may be just a small notch in the lip. It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.\n* A cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth. It may go the full length of the palate.\n* Other symptoms include:\n\t+ Change in nose shape (how much the shape changes varies)\n\t+ Poorly aligned teeth\n* Problems that may be present because of a cleft lip or palate are:\n\t+ Failure to gain weight\n\t+ Feeding problems\n\t+ Flow of milk through nasal passages during feeding\n\t+ Poor growth\n\t+ Repeated ear infections\n\t+ Speech difficulties\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms a cleft lip or cleft palate. Medical tests may be done to rule out other possible health conditions.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery to close the cleft lip is often done when the child is between 2 to 9 months old. Surgery may be needed later in life if the problem has a major effect on the nose area. Some patients may receive tympanostomy tubes during the surgery also.\n\nA cleft palate is most often closed within the first year of life so that the child's speech develops normally. Sometimes, a prosthetic device is temporarily used to close the palate so the baby can feed and grow until surgery can be done.\n\nContinued follow-up may be needed with speech therapists and orthodontists.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nFor more resources and information, see cleft palate support groups.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost babies will heal without problems. How your child will look after healing depends on the severity of their condition. Your child might need another surgery to fix the scar from the surgery wound.\n\nChildren who had a cleft palate repair may need to see a dentist or orthodontist. Their teeth may need to be corrected as they come in.\n\nHearing problems are common in children with cleft lip or palate. Your child should have a hearing test at an early age, and it should be repeated over time.\n\nYour child may still have problems with speech after the surgery. This is caused by muscle problems in the palate. Speech therapy will help your child.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCleft lip and palate is most often diagnosed at birth. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for follow-up visits. Contact your provider if problems develop between visits.\n\n---\n\n**Cleft Lip and Palate**\n\n_Causes_\n\nThere are many causes of cleft lip and palate. Problems with genes passed down from 1 or both parents, drugs, viruses, or other toxins can all cause these birth defects. Cleft lip and palate may occur along with other syndromes or birth defects.\n\nA cleft lip and palate can:\n\n* Affect the appearance of the face\n* Lead to problems with feeding and speech\n* Lead to ear infections\n\nBabies are more likely to be born with a cleft lip and palate if they have a family history of these conditions or other birth defects.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nA child may have one or more birth defects and the severity can vary significantly.\n\nA cleft lip may be just a small notch in the lip. It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.\n\nA cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth. It may go the full length of the palate.\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n* Change in nose shape (how much the shape changes varies)\n* Poorly aligned teeth\n\nProblems that may be present because of a cleft lip or palate are:\n\n* Failure to gain weight\n* Feeding problems\n* Flow of milk through nasal passages during feeding\n* Poor growth\n* Repeated ear infections\n* Speech difficulties\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nA physical exam of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms a cleft lip or cleft palate. Medical tests may be done to rule out other possible health conditions.\n\n_Treatment_\n\nSurgery to close the cleft lip is often done when the child is between 2 to 9 months old. Surgery may be needed later in life if the problem has a major effect on the nose area. Some patients may receive tympanostomy tubes during the surgery also.\n\nA cleft palate is most often closed within the first year of life so that the child's speech develops normally. Sometimes, a prosthetic device is temporarily used to close the palate so the baby can feed and grow until surgery can be done.\n\nContinued follow-up may be needed with speech therapists and orthodontists.\n\n_Support Groups_\n\nFor more resources and information, see cleft palate support groups.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nMost babies will heal without problems.

It is passed down through families as an autosomal dominant trait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to inherit the disease.\n\nCleidocranial dysostosis is a congenital condition, which means it is present from before birth. The condition affects girls and boys equally.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nPeople with cleidocranial dysostosis have a jaw and brow area that sticks out. The middle of their nose (nasal bridge) is wide.\n\nThe collar bones may be missing or abnormally developed. This pushes the shoulders together in front of the body.\n\nPrimary teeth do not fall out at the expected time. Adult teeth may develop later than normal and an extra set of adult teeth grow in. This causes the teeth to become crooked.\n\nIntelligence level is most often normal.\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n* Ability to touch shoulders together in front of body\n* Delayed closure of fontanelles (\"soft spots\")\n* Loose joints\n* Prominent forehead (frontal bossing)\n* Short forearms\n* Short fingers\n* Short stature\n* Increased risk of getting flat foot, abnormal curvature of spine (scoliosis) and knee deformities\n* High risk of hearing loss due to infections\n* Increased risk of fracture due to decreased bone density\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nThe health care provider will take your family history. The provider will do a physical examination and may do series of x-rays to check for:\n\n* Undergrowth of the collarbone\n* Undergrowth of the shoulder blade\n* Failure of the area in the front of the pelvis bone to close\n\n_Treatment_\n\nThere is no specific treatment for it and management depends on each person's symptoms. Most people with the disease need:\n\n* Regular dental care\n* Head gear to protect skull bones until they close\n* Ear tubes for frequent ear infections\n* Surgery to correct any bone abnormalities\n\n_Support Groups_\n\nMore information and support for people with cleidocranial dysostosis and their families can be found at:\n\n* Little People of America -- www.lpaonline.org/about-lpa\n* FACES: The National Craniofacial Association -- www.faces-cranio.org/\n* Children's Craniofacial Association -- ccakids.org/\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nIn most cases, the bone symptoms cause few problems. Appropriate dental care is important.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nComplications include dental problems and shoulder dislocations.\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nConsult a doctor if you or your child has any of the symptoms mentioned above.\n\n---\n\n**Cleidocranial Dysostosis**\n\n**Complications**\n\n*   Dental problems\n*   Shoulder dislocations\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have a:\n\n*   Family history of cleidocranial dysostosis and are planning to have a child.\n*   Child with similar symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is appropriate if a person with a family or personal history of cleidocranial dysostosis is planning to have children.

If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.\n\nUse clindamycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using clindamycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n**How to Use Clindamycin Injection**\n\nClindamycin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 10 to 40 minutes or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is usually given two to four times a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how well you respond to the medication.\n\nYou may receive clindamycin injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home.

Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Medication Interactions**\n\nClobazam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking antidepressants; medications for anxiety, mental illness, and seizures; sedatives; sleeping pills; opioids such as codeine, fentanyl (Duragesic, Subsys), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian), or oxycodone (in Percocet, in Roxicet, others); or tranquilizers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alcohol and Street Drugs**\n\nDo not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment with clobazam. Drinking alcohol or using street drugs also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nClobazam is used with other medication(s) to control seizures in adults and children 2 years of age and older who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (a disorder that causes seizures and often causes developmental delays). Clobazam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nClobazam comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth, and as a film to apply on the tongue. It is usually taken once or twice a day, with or without food. Take clobazam at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Instructions for Use**\n\nIf you are unable to swallow the tablets whole, you may break them in half on the score mark or crush and mix them with a small amount of applesauce.\n\nThe liquid comes an adapter and two oral dosing syringes. Use only one of the two oral dosing syringes to measure your dose and save the second syringe. If the first oral syringe is damaged or lost, the second provided syringe may be used as a replacement.\n\nTo take the liquid, follow these steps:\n\nBefore the first use, uncap the bottle and firmly insert the adapter into the neck of the bottle until the adapter top is even with the bottle top. Do not remove the adapter during the period of time you are using this bottle.\n\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nTo measure your dose, push the plunger of the syringe all the way down and insert the syringe into the adapter of the upright bottle. Then turn the bottle upside down and slowly pull the plunger back until the black ring is in line with your prescribed dose.\n\nRemove the syringe from the bottle adapter and slowly squirt the liquid from the syringe into the corner of your mouth.\n\nPlace the bottle cap over the adapter after each use.\n\nWash the oral syringe after each use. To wash the syringe, remove the plunger completely, wash the barrel and plunger with soap and water, rinse, and allow to dry. Do not place the syringe parts in the dishwasher.\n\nTo take the film, follow these steps:\n\nOpen the foil pouch and remove the film. Be sure that your hands are dry and clean.\n\nPlace the film on the top of your tongue.\n\nClose your mouth and swallow your saliva normally. Do not chew, spit, or talk while the film dissolves. Do not take with liquids.\n\nWash your hands.\n\nIf your doctor has told you to take more than one film per dose, wait until the first film has completely dissolved before applying the second film.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clobazam and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.\n\nSome people may respond differently to clobazam based on their heredity or genetic makeup. Your doctor may order a blood test to help find the dose of clobazam that is best for you.\n\nClobazam may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take clobazam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clobazam without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Clobazam: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nClobazam comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth, and as a film to apply on the tongue.
