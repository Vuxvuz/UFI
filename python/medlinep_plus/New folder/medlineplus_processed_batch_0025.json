It is often caused by an enlarged prostate. Bladder stones and bladder cancer are also more commonly seen in men than women. As a man ages, the chances of getting these diseases increase greatly.\n\nOther common causes of BOO include:\n\n*   Pelvic tumors (cervix, prostate, uterus, rectum)\n*   Narrowing of the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder (urethra), due to scar tissue or certain birth defects\n\nLess common causes include:\n\n*   Cystocele (when the bladder falls into the vagina)\n*   Foreign objects in the bladder or urethra\n*   Urethral or pelvic muscle spasms\n*   Inguinal (groin) hernia\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of BOO may vary, but can include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Continuous feeling of a full bladder\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Pain during urination (dysuria)\n*   Problems starting urination (urinary hesitancy)\n*   Slow, uneven urine flow, at times being unable to urinate\n*   Straining to urinate\n*   Urinary tract infection\n*   Waking up at night to urinate (nocturia)\n*   Urinary incontinence\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will undergo a physical exam.\n\nOne or more of the following problems may be found:\n\n*   Abdominal swelling\n*   Cystocele (women)\n*   Enlarged bladder\n*   Enlarged prostate (men)\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Blood chemistries to look for signs of kidney damage\n*   Cystoscopy and retrograde urethrogram (x-ray) to look for narrowing of the urethra\n*   Tests to determine how fast urine flows out of the body (uroflowmetry)\n*   Tests to see how much the urine flow is blocked and how well the bladder contracts (urodynamic testing)\n*   Ultrasound to locate the blockage of urine and find out how well the bladder empties\n*   Urinalysis to look for blood or signs of infection in the urine\n*   Urine culture to check for an infection\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment of BOO depends on its cause. A tube, called a catheter, is inserted into the bladder through the urethra. This is done to relieve the blockage.\n\nSometimes, a catheter is placed through the belly area into the bladder to drain the bladder. This is called a suprapubic tube.\n\nMost often, you will need surgery for long-term cure of BOO. However, many of the diseases that cause this problem can be treated with medicines. Talk to your provider about possible treatments.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost causes of BOO can be cured if diagnosed early. However, if the diagnosis or treatment is delayed, this can cause permanent damage to the bladder or kidneys.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of BOO.\n\n---\n\n**Bladder Outlet Obstruction**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of BOO.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* BOO\n* Lower urinary tract obstruction\n* Prostatism\n* Urinary retention - BOO\n\n**Images**\n\n* Kidney anatomy\n* Female urinary tract\n* Male urinary tract\n* Kidney - blood and urine flow\n\n**References**\n\n* Andersson KE, Wein AJ.

They can cause pain and other symptoms when they irritate the lining of the bladder or block the flow of urine.\n\n**Causes of Bladder Stones**\n\nAlmost all bladder stones occur in men. They are much less common than kidney stones. Bladder stones may occur when urine in the bladder is concentrated, causing materials in the urine to form crystals. This can also result from foreign objects in the bladder.\n\nBladder stones are most often caused by another urinary system problem, such as:\n\n*   **Bladder diverticulum**: a condition where a small pouch forms on the bladder wall\n*   **Blockage at the base of the bladder**: a blockage that prevents urine from flowing out of the bladder\n*   **Enlarged prostate (BPH)**: a condition where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, causing urinary problems\n*   **Neurogenic bladder**: a condition where the bladder muscles do not function properly due to nerve damage\n*   **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: an infection of the urinary tract that can cause inflammation and scarring\n*   **Incomplete emptying of the bladder**: a condition where the bladder does not fully empty during urination\n*   **Foreign objects in the bladder**: objects such as stones, gravel, or other foreign bodies that can form in the bladder\n\n**Symptoms of Bladder Stones**\n\nSymptoms occur when the stone irritates the lining of the bladder. The stones may also block the flow of urine from the bladder.\n\nSymptoms can include:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain, pressure**: a feeling of discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen\n*   **Abnormally colored or dark-colored urine**: urine that is darker than usual due to the presence of blood or other substances\n*   **Blood in the urine**: the presence of blood in the urine, which can be detected through urinalysis\n*   **Difficulty urinating**: a feeling of difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine\n*   **Frequent urge to urinate**: a sudden and frequent need to urinate\n*   **Inability to urinate except in certain positions**: a condition where urination is only possible when in specific positions\n*   **Interruption of the urine stream**: a feeling of interruption or stoppage during urination\n*   **Pain, discomfort in the penis**: pain or discomfort in the penis due to the presence of bladder stones\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will also include a rectal exam. The exam may reveal an enlarged prostate in men or other problems.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n*   **Bladder or pelvis x-ray**: an imaging test that uses X-rays to visualize the bladder and pelvic area\n*   **Cystoscopy**: a procedure where a small telescope is passed through the urethra into the bladder to visualize the inside of the bladder\n*   **Urinalysis**: a laboratory test that examines the urine for various substances, including blood and bacteria\n*   **Urine culture (clean catch)**: a laboratory test that grows bacteria from a urine sample to identify any infections\n*   **Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan**: imaging tests that use sound waves or X-rays to visualize the bladder and surrounding tissues\n\n**Treatment of Bladder Stones**\n\nYou may be able to help small stones pass on their own.

This fungus is found in decaying wood and soil.\n\n**Causes**\n\nYou can get blastomycosis by contact with moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting wood and leaves. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, where the infection starts. The fungus can then spread to other parts of the body. The disease may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.\n\nBlastomycosis is rare. It occurs in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.\n\nThe key risk factor for the disease is contact with infected soil. It most often affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or who have had an organ transplant, but it can also infect healthy people. Men are more likely to be affected than women.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nLung infection may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms may be seen if the infection spreads. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Joint pain\n* Chest pain\n* Cough (may produce brown or bloody mucus)\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* Night sweats\n* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\n* Muscle pain\n* Unintentional weight loss\n\nMost people develop skin symptoms when the infection spreads. You may get papules, pustules, or nodules on exposed body areas.\n\nThe pustules:\n\n* May look like warts or ulcers\n* Are usually painless\n* Vary in color from gray to violet\n* May appear in the nose and mouth\n* Bleed easily and form ulcers\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

    "content": "**Blau Syndrome**\n\nBlau syndrome is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the skin, joints, and eyes. Signs and symptoms begin in childhood, usually before age 4.\n\n* **Skin Inflammation**: A form of skin inflammation called granulomatous dermatitis is typically the earliest sign of Blau syndrome. This skin condition causes a persistent rash that can be scaly or involve hard lumps (nodules) that can be felt under the skin. The rash is usually found on the torso, arms, and legs.\n* **Arthritis**: Arthritis is another common feature of Blau syndrome. In affected individuals, arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the lining of the joints (the synovium). This inflammation, known as synovitis, is associated with swelling and joint pain. Synovitis usually begins in the joints of the hands, feet, wrists, and ankles. As the condition worsens, it can involve additional joints and restrict movement by decreasing the range of motion in many joints. In people with Blau syndrome, the tendons as well as the joints can be inflamed, causing tenosynovitis.\n* **Uveitis**: Most people with Blau syndrome also develop uveitis, which is swelling and inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (the uvea). The uvea includes the colored portion of the eye (the iris) and related tissues that underlie the white part of the eye (the sclera). Uveitis can cause eye irritation and pain, increased sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), and blurred vision. Other structures in the eye can also become inflamed, including the outermost protective layer of the eye (the conjunctiva), the tear glands, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), and the nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). While individuals with Blau syndrome may have normal vision, inflammation of any of these structures can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness.\n* **Kidney Disease**: Some individuals with Blau syndrome develop kidney disease (nephritis) due to inflammation. They may also have deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and often develop chronic kidney failure. Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) can cause scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.\n\nLess commonly, Blau syndrome can affect other parts of the body, including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, blood vessels, lungs, and heart. Inflammation involving these organs and tissues can impair their function and cause life-threatening complications. Rarely, affected individuals have disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), episodes of fever, or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).\n\n---\n\n**Blau Syndrome**\n\n**What is Blau Syndrome?**\n\nBlau syndrome is a rare inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the skin, joints, and eyes.

The protein produced from this gene helps defend the body from foreign invaders by playing several essential roles in the immune response, including inflammatory reactions. An inflammatory reaction occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair.\n\nThe NOD2 gene mutations that cause Blau syndrome result in a NOD2 protein that is overactive, which can alter immune responses and trigger an abnormal inflammatory reaction. However, it is unclear how overactivation of the NOD2 protein causes the specific pattern of inflammation affecting the joints, eyes, and skin that is characteristic of Blau syndrome.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBlau syndrome is a very rare disorder, estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 1 million children worldwide.\n\n---\n\n**Blau Syndrome**\n\n**What is Blau syndrome?**\n\nBlau syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints, eyes, and skin.\n\n**Causes of Blau syndrome**\n\nBlau syndrome results from mutations in the NOD2 gene.

It is characterized by the presence of granulomas, which are abnormal collections of immune cells, in various organs.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nBlau syndrome is caused by mutations in the NOD2 gene, which plays a crucial role in the functioning of the immune system. The disorder tends to affect males more frequently than females and often presents in childhood or adolescence.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Blau syndrome can vary widely from person to person but may include:\n\n*   Joint inflammation and pain\n*   Skin rashes and lesions\n*   Eye problems, including uveitis\n*   Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing Blau syndrome typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis. A definitive diagnosis can be made through the identification of specific mutations in the NOD2 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Blau syndrome, but various treatment options are available to manage its symptoms and prevent complications. These may include:\n\n*   Anti-inflammatory medications\n*   Immunosuppressive therapies\n*   Physical therapy and occupational therapy\n*   Regular monitoring of eye health and other affected systems\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Blau syndrome varies depending on the severity of their symptoms, the effectiveness of treatment, and their overall health. With proper management, many people with this disorder can lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nBlau syndrome is a genetic disorder that tends to run in families. If you have a family history of this condition or are concerned about your risk, it is essential to discuss your concerns with a healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on genetic testing, counseling, and other resources available to you.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Arthritis\n*   Eye Diseases\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Skin Conditions",

Varices are enlarged veins that may be found in the esophagus in people with cirrhosis of the liver. These veins may rupture and bleed.\n\n**Causes**\n\nScarring (cirrhosis) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver, causing more blood to flow through the veins of the esophagus. The extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward forming esophageal varices. Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with chronic liver disease and esophageal varices may have no symptoms. If there is only a small amount of bleeding, the only symptom may be dark or black streaks in the stools. If larger amounts of bleeding occur, symptoms may include:\n\n* Black, tarry stools\n* Bloody stools\n* Lightheadedness\n* Paleness\n* Symptoms of chronic liver disease\n* Vomiting blood\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stop acute bleeding as soon as possible.

    "content": "**Bleeding Gums**\n\nBleeding gums can be a sign that you have or may develop gum disease. Ongoing gum bleeding may be due to plaque buildup on the teeth. It can also be a sign of a serious medical condition.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe main cause of bleeding gums is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This may lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar, which may lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jaw bone disease known as periodontitis.\n\nOther causes of bleeding gums include:\n\n*   Any bleeding disorders\n*   Brushing too hard\n*   Hormonal changes during pregnancy\n*   Ill-fitting dentures or other dental appliances\n*   Improper flossing\n*   Infection, which can be either in a tooth or the gum\n*   Leukemia, a type of blood cancer\n*   Scurvy, a vitamin C deficiency\n*   Use of blood thinners\n*   Vitamin K deficiency\n\n**Home Care**\n\nVisit the dentist at least once every 6 months for plaque removal. Follow your dentist's home care instructions.\n\nBrush your teeth gently with a soft-bristle toothbrush at least twice a day. It is best if you can brush after every meal. Also, flossing teeth twice a day can prevent plaque from building up and turning into tartar.\n\nYour dentist may tell you to rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide and water, or a mouth rise designed to treat gum inflammation. Some rinses contain alcohol, so consult with your dentist prior to using one of these types.\n\nIt can help to follow a balanced, healthy diet. Try to avoid snacking between meals and cut down on the carbohydrates you eat.\n\nOther tips to help with bleeding gums:\n\n*   Have a periodontal exam.\n*   Do not use tobacco, since it makes bleeding gums worse. Tobacco use can also mask other problems that cause bleeding of the gums.\n*   Control gum bleeding by applying pressure directly on the gums with a gauze pad soaked in ice water.\n*   If you have been diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, take vitamin supplements.\n*   Avoid aspirin unless your health care provider has recommended that you take it.\n*   If side effects of a medicine are causing the bleeding gums, ask your provider to prescribe a different medicine. Never change your medicines without first talking to your provider.\n*   Use an oral irrigation device on the low setting to massage your gums.\n*   See your dentist if your dentures or other dental appliances do not fit well or are causing sore spots on your gums.\n*   Follow your dentist's instructions on how to brush and floss so you can avoid hurting your gums.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nConsult your provider if:\n\n*   The bleeding is severe or long-term (chronic)\n*   Your gums continue to bleed even after treatment\n*   You have other unexplained symptoms with the bleeding\n\n---\n\n**Bleeding Gums**\n\nBleeding gums can be a sign that you have or may develop gum disease.

Some of them are:\n\n* Injury or trauma\n* Allergic reaction\n* Autoimmune disorders\n* Viral infection or illness affecting blood clotting (coagulation)\n* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)\n* Medical treatment, including radiation and chemotherapy\n* Antiplatelet medicines such as clopidogrel (Plavix)\n* Bruise (ecchymosis)\n* Birth (petechiae in the newborn)\n* Aging skin (ecchymosis)\n* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (petechiae and purpura)\n* Henoch-Schonlein purpura (purpura)\n* Leukemia (purpura and ecchymosis)\n* Medicines -- Anticoagulants such as warfarin or heparin (ecchymosis), aspirin (ecchymosis), steroids (ecchymosis)\n* Septicemia (petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nProtect aging skin. Avoid trauma such as bumping or pulling on skin areas. For a cut or scrape, use direct pressure to stop the bleeding.\n\nIf you have a drug reaction, ask your provider about stopping the drug. Otherwise, follow your prescribed therapy to treat the underlying cause of the problem.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have sudden bleeding into the skin for no apparent reason\n* You notice unexplained bruising that does not go away\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will examine you and ask questions about the bleeding, such as:\n\n* Have you recently had an injury or accident?\n* Have you been ill lately?\n* Have you had radiation therapy or chemotherapy?\n* What other medical treatments have you had?\n* Do you take aspirin more than once a week?\n* Do you take Coumadin, heparin, or other \"blood thinners\" (anticoagulants)?\n* Has the bleeding occurred repeatedly?\n* Have you always had a tendency to bleed into the skin?\n* Did the bleeding start in infancy (for example, with circumcision)?\n* Did it start with surgery or when you had a tooth pulled?\n\nThe following diagnostic tests may be performed:\n\n* Coagulation tests including INR, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and levels of clotting factors\n* Complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and blood differential\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEcchymoses; Skin spots - red; Pinpoint red spots on the skin; Petechiae; Purpura\n\n---\n\n**Bleeding into the skin**\n\nWhen a patient presents with suspected bleeding disorders, it's essential to consider various causes and approach the diagnosis systematically. In _Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice_, Hoffman R et al note that \"bleeding disorders\" is one of the many possible diagnoses for patients presenting with bleeding or bruising.\n\nA thorough evaluation involves considering both acquired and inherited conditions. As Schafer AI points out in _Goldman-Cecil Medicine_, approach to the patient with bleeding and thrombosis requires a careful consideration of both causes. This includes evaluating for underlying disorders such as liver disease, which can lead to coagulopathy.\n\nIn addition to bleeding disorders, other conditions should be considered in patients presenting with bruising or bleeding. For instance, infections like those described by Juliano JJ et al in _Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases_ can also present with skin manifestations.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   **Bleeding**\n*   **Bleeding Disorders**\n*   **Bruises**\n\n**Images**\n\n*   **Black eye**",

    "content": "**Bleeding Time**\n\n_Bleeding time is a medical test that measures how fast small blood vessels in the skin stop bleeding._\n\nBecause it is difficult to perform correctly, it is rarely used today.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood pressure cuff is inflated around your upper arm. While the cuff is on your arm, the health care provider makes two small cuts on the lower arm. They are just deep enough to cause a tiny amount of bleeding.\n\nThe blood pressure cuff is immediately deflated. Blotting paper is touched to the cuts every 30 seconds until the bleeding stops. The provider records the time it takes for the cuts to stop bleeding.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nCertain medicines can change blood test results.\n\n* Tell your provider about all the medicines you take.\n* Your provider will tell you if you need to temporarily stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This may include dextran and aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n* DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your doctor first.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe tiny cuts are very shallow, and can be made with a small lancet or with a special instrument with a spring that makes a very shallow cut. Most people say it feels like a skin scratch.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test helps diagnose bleeding problems.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nBleeding normally stops within 1 to 9 minutes.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nLonger-than-normal bleeding time may be due to:\n\n* Blood vessel defect\n* Platelet aggregation defect (clumping problem with platelets, which are parts of the blood that helps the blood clot)\n* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a very slight risk of infection where the skin is cut.\n\n**References**\n\nPai M, Moffat KA.

    "content": "**Blindness and Vision Loss**\n\n**What is Blindness?**\n\nBlindness is a lack of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. It refers to the complete loss of vision, where a person cannot see anything and does not perceive light.\n\n**Types of Blindness**\n\nThere are two types of blindness:\n\n*   **Partial Blindness**: This means having very limited vision.\n*   **Complete Blindness**: This is the total inability to see anything, including light.\n\n**Legal Definition of Blindness**\n\nIn most states in the United States, people with vision worse than 20/200, even with glasses or contact lenses, are considered legally blind.\n\n**Causes of Vision Loss**\n\nVision loss has many causes, and some of the leading ones in the United States include:\n\n*   **Accidents or Injuries**: Chemical burns or sports injuries to the surface of the eye.\n*   **Diabetes**: Blurred vision, shadows, missing areas of vision, and difficulty seeing at night.\n*   **Glaucoma**: Tunnel vision and missing areas of vision.\n*   **Macular Degeneration**: Slow loss of central vision.\n\nOther causes of vision loss include:\n\n*   Blocked blood vessels to the retina\n*   Complications of premature birth (retrolental fibroplasia)\n*   Complications of eye surgery\n*   Lazy eye\n*   Optic neuritis\n*   Stroke\n*   Retinitis pigmentosa\n*   Tumors, such as retinoblastoma and optic nerve glioma\n\n**Total Blindness**\n\nTotal blindness (no light perception) is often due to severe trauma or injury, complete retinal detachment, end-stage glaucoma, end-stage diabetic retinopathy, severe internal eye infection (endophthalmitis), or vascular occlusion (stroke in the eye).\n\n**Home Care for Low Vision**\n\nWhen you have low vision, you may struggle with daily tasks like driving, reading, or sewing. You can make changes to your home and routines to stay safe and independent. Many services provide training and support to help you live independently, including the use of low vision aids.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSudden vision loss is always an emergency, even if you haven't completely lost vision. Don't ignore vision loss, thinking it will get better. Contact an ophthalmologist or go to the emergency room immediately. Most serious forms of vision loss are painless, and the absence of pain doesn't diminish the urgent need for medical care.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour healthcare provider will perform a complete eye exam to determine the cause of your vision loss. The treatment will depend on the underlying cause.\n\nFor long-term vision loss, see a low-vision specialist who can help you learn to care for yourself and live a full life.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLoss of vision; No light perception (NLP); Low vision; Vision loss and blindness\n\n---\n\n**Blindness and Vision Loss**\n\n**What is Blindness?**\n\n*   Blindness is a lack of vision\n*   It may also refer to a loss of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses\n\n**Types of Blindness**\n\n*   **Partial Blindness**: very limited vision\n*   **Complete Blindness**: unable to see anything, including light\n\n**Legal Definition of Blindness**\n\n*   In the United States, people with vision worse than 20/200, even with glasses or contact lenses, are considered legally blind in most states.\n\n**Causes of Vision Loss**\n\n*   Leading causes in the US:\n    *   Accidents or injuries to the surface of the eye (chemical burns or sports injuries)\n    *   Diabetes\n    *   Glaucoma\n    *   Macular degeneration\n\n**Types of Partial Vision Loss**\n\n*   With cataracts: cloudy or fuzzy vision, glare from bright light\n*   With diabetes: blurred vision, shadows or missing areas of vision, difficulty seeing at night\n*   With glaucoma: tunnel vision, missing areas of vision\n*   With macular degeneration: side vision normal, central vision slowly lost\n\n**Other Causes of Vision Loss**\n\n*   Blocked blood vessels to the retina\n*   Complications of premature birth (retrolental fibroplasia)\n*   Complications of eye surgery\n*   Lazy eye\n*   Optic neuritis\n*   Stroke\n*   Retinitis pigmentosa\n*   Tumors, such as retinoblastoma and optic nerve glioma\n\n**Total Blindness**\n\n*   Often due to severe trauma or injury, complete retinal detachment, end-stage glaucoma, end-stage diabetic retinopathy, severe internal eye infection (endophthalmitis), vascular occlusion (stroke in the eye)\n\n**Home Care for Low Vision**\n\n*   Make changes in your home and routines to stay safe and independent\n*   Many services provide training and support for low vision aids\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   Sudden vision loss is always an emergency, even if you have not completely lost vision\n*   Never ignore vision loss, thinking it will get better\n*   Contact an ophthalmologist or go to the emergency room immediately\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\n*   A complete eye exam by your healthcare provider\n*   Treatment depends on the cause of vision loss\n*   For long-term vision loss, see a low-vision specialist for help learning to care for yourself and live a full life\n\n---\n\n**Blindness and Vision Loss**\n\nThe treatment of blindness and vision loss depends on the cause of the condition.

It also includes low vision, which means you have some vision, but the vision loss makes it hard to do everyday activities. You may have trouble reading, shopping, cooking, writing, and watching TV. Low vision can't be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.\n\n**Causes of Vision Impairment**\n\nAging doesn't cause vision loss on its own. But many diseases that are more common in older adults can cause it. The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma. Other eye disorders, eye injuries, and birth defects can also cause vision loss.\n\n**Diagnosing Vision Impairment**\n\nVision impairment is diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. Early warning signs of a vision problem can include not being able to see well enough to:\n\n* Do everyday tasks like reading and driving\n* Recognize people's faces\n* Tell the difference between colors\n* See the television or computer screen clearly\n\nYou can have these symptoms even though you are wearing glasses or contacts.\n\n**Types of Low Vision**\n\nThere are several types of low vision. Which type you have depends on the condition that caused your low vision.\n\nCommon types of low vision include:\n\n* Central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision)\n* Peripheral (side) vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes)\n* Night blindness (not being able to see in low light)\n* Blurry or hazy vision\n\n**Treatments for Low Vision**\n\nLow vision is permanent. Glasses, medicine, and surgery can't cure low vision. But sometimes they can improve your vision, help you do everyday activities more easily, or keep your remaining vision.\n\nYour treatment options will depend on the condition that caused your low vision. Ask your eye doctor which treatments might help you. They may recommend vision aids or vision rehabilitation, which might make everyday activities easier.\n\nVision rehabilitation teaches you how to live with your vision loss. It may include:\n\n* Showing you how to use a magnifying device or screen readers for reading\n* Helping you set up your home so you can move around more easily\n* Employment and job training\n* Assistive devices, like lighting and reading stands\n\n**Living With Low Vision**\n\nThe sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated, the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. Whatever the cause, lost vision cannot be restored. But it can be managed. A loss of vision means you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. Your provider may make suggestions to help make life easier.\n\nThese may include:\n\n* If you have some vision:\n\t+ Visual aids such as magnifiers\n\t+ Telescopic glasses or monoculars for seeing distance\n\t+ Large print books\n\t+ Clocks with larger numbers\n\t+ Brighter lights\n\t+ Anti-glare sunglasses or glare shields\n\n* If you have no vision (blindness):\n\t+ Devices like text-reading software and braille books\n\n---\n\n**Blindness | Low Vision | MedlinePlus**\n\n\\n\\n**What is vision impairment?**\n\nVision impairment is the loss of vision.

    "content": "**Blisters**\n\nAlso called: Bulla, Vesicle\n\n**What are blisters?**\n\nBlisters are fluid-filled sacs on the outer layer of your skin. They form because of rubbing, heat, or diseases of the skin. They are most common on your hands and feet.\n\nOther names for blisters are vesicles (usually for smaller blisters) and bulla (for larger blisters).\n\n**What causes blisters?**\n\nBlisters often happen when there is friction - rubbing or pressure - on one spot. For example, if your shoes don't fit quite right and they keep rubbing part of your foot. Or if you don't wear gloves when you rake leaves and the handle keeps rubbing against your hand. Other causes of blisters include:\n\n* Burns\n* Sunburn\n* Frostbite\n* Eczema\n* Allergic reactions\n* Poison ivy, oak, and sumac\n* Autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus\n* Epidermolysis bullosa, an illness that causes the skin to be fragile\n* Viral infections such as varicella zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles) and herpes simplex (which causes cold sores)\n* Skin infections including impetigo\n\n**What are the treatments for blisters?**\n\nBlisters will usually heal on their own. The skin over the blister helps keep out infections. You can put a bandage on the blister to keep it clean. Make sure that there is no more rubbing or friction on the blister.\n\nYou should contact your health care provider if:\n\n* The blister looks infected - if it is draining pus, or the area around the blister is red, swollen, warm, or very painful\n* You have a fever\n* You have several blisters, especially if you cannot figure out what is causing them\n* You have health problems such as circulation problems or diabetes\n\nNormally you don't want to drain a blister, because of the risk of infection. But if a blister is large, painful, or looks like it will pop on its own, you can drain the fluid.\n\n**Can blisters be prevented?**\n\nThere are some things you can do to prevent friction blisters:\n\n* Make sure that your shoes fit properly\n* Always wear socks with your shoes, and make sure that the socks fit well. You may want to wear socks that are acrylic or nylon, so they keep moisture away from your feet.\n* Wear gloves or protective gear on your hands when you use any tools or sports equipment that cause friction.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nBlisters, Calluses, and Corns (Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in Spanish\nBlisters, First Aid (VisualDX)\nBlisters: First Aid (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nAlso in Spanish\nHow To Prevent and Treat Blisters (American Academy of Dermatology)\nVesicles (Medical Encyclopedia)\nAlso in Spanish\n\n---\n\n**Blisters**\n\n\\n\\n* **Causes:** \n\t+ Integrin mutations in blistering skin diseases\n\t+ Related genetically engineered mouse models\n\n\\n\\n**Related Articles:**\n\n\\n\\n* Article: Integrin mutations in blistering skin diseases and related genetically engineered mouse... \n\n\\n\\n**Topic Image**\n\n\\n\\n**MedlinePlus Disclaimer:**\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

    "content": "**Blockage of Upper Airway**\n\nThe upper airway blockage occurs when the upper breathing passages become narrowed or blocked, making it hard to breathe. The areas in the upper airway that can be affected are the windpipe (trachea), voice box (larynx), or throat (pharynx).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe airway can become narrowed or blocked due to many causes, including:\n\n*   Allergic reactions in which swelling of the trachea or throat in response to bee sting, peanuts, and tree nuts, or medicines such as antibiotics (such as penicillin), and ACE inhibitors (a medicine to treat high blood pressure)\n*   Chemical burns and reactions\n*   Epiglottitis (infection of the structure separating the trachea from the esophagus)\n*   Fire or burns from breathing in smoke\n*   Foreign bodies, such as peanuts and other breathed-in foods, pieces of a balloon, buttons, coins, and small toys\n*   Infections of the upper airway area\n*   Injury to the upper airway area\n*   Peritonsillar abscess (collection of infected material near the tonsils)\n*   Poisoning from certain substances, such as strychnine\n*   Retropharyngeal abscess (collection of infected material in the back of the airway)\n*   Severe asthma attack\n*   Throat cancer\n*   Tracheomalacia (weakness of the cartilage that supports the trachea)\n*   Vocal cord problems\n*   Passing out or being unconscious\n\n**People at Higher Risk**\n\nPeople who have neurologic problems such as swallowing difficulty after a stroke or head injury, lost teeth, certain mental health problems, young children, and older adults are also at higher risk for airway obstruction.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary, depending on the cause. But some symptoms are common to all types of airway blockage. These include:\n\n*   Agitation or fidgeting\n*   Bluish color of the skin (cyanosis)\n*   Changes in consciousness\n*   Choking\n*   Confusion\n*   Difficulty breathing, gasping for air, leading to panic\n*   Unconsciousness (lack of responsiveness)\n*   Wheezing, crowing, whistling, or other unusual breathing noises indicating breathing difficulty\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical examination and check the airway. The provider will also ask about the possible cause of the blockage.\n\nTests are usually not necessary, but may include:\n\n*   Bronchoscopy (tube through the mouth into the trachea and bronchial tubes)\n*   Laryngoscopy (tube through the mouth into the back of the throat and voicebox)\n*   X-rays or CT scan (computerized tomography)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the blockage.\n\nObjects stuck in the airway may be removed with special instruments.\nA tube may be inserted into the airway (endotracheal tube) to help with breathing.\nSometimes an opening is made through the neck into the airway (tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy).\n\nIf the obstruction is due to a foreign body, such as a piece of food that has been breathed in, doing abdominal thrusts, back blows, or chest compressions can save the person's life.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPrompt treatment is often successful.

This includes:\n\n*   Eating slowly and chewing food completely\n*   Not drinking too much alcohol before or while eating\n*   Keeping small objects away from young children\n*   Ensuring dentures fit properly\n\n**When to Seek Medical Help**\n\nAirway obstruction is often an emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. If you suspect someone has a blocked airway, call 911 or the local emergency number for medical help. Follow instructions on how to help keep the person breathing until help arrives.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIf the obstruction is not relieved, it can cause:\n\n*   Brain damage\n*   Breathing failure\n*   Death\n\n**References**\n\nDriver BE, Reardon RF.

    "content": "**Blocked Tear Duct**\n\nA blocked tear duct is a partial or complete blockage in the pathway that carries tears from the surface of the eye into the nose.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTears are constantly being made to help protect the surface of your eye. They drain into a very small opening (punctum) in the corner of your eye, near your nose. This opening is the entrance to the nasolacrimal duct. If this duct is blocked, the tears will build up and overflow onto the cheek. This occurs even when you are not crying.\n\nIn children, the duct may not be completely developed at birth. It may be closed or covered by a thin film, which causes a partial blockage.\n\nIn adults, the duct can be damaged by an infection, injury, or a tumor.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom is increased tearing (epiphora), which causes tears to overflow onto the face or cheek. In babies, this tearing becomes noticeable during the first 2 to 3 weeks after birth.\n\nSometimes, the tears may appear to be thicker. The tears may dry and become crusty.\n\nIf there is pus in the eyes or the eyelids get stuck together, your baby may have an eye infection called conjunctivitis.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost of the time, the health care provider will not need to do any tests.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Eye exam\n*   Special eye stain (fluorescein) to see how tears drain\n*   X-ray studies to examine the tear duct (rarely done)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCarefully clean the eyelids using a warm, wet washcloth if tears build up and leave crusts.\n\nFor infants, you may try gently massaging the area 2 to 3 times a day. Using a clean finger, rub the area from the inside corner of the eye toward the nose. This may help to open the tear duct.\n\nMost of the time, the tear duct will open on its own by the time the infant is 1 year old. If this does not happen, probing may be necessary. This procedure is most often done using general anesthesia, so the child will be asleep and pain-free. It is almost always successful.\n\nIn adults, the cause of the blockage must be treated. This may re-open the duct if there is not too much damage. Surgery using tiny tubes or stents to open the passageway may be needed to restore normal tear drainage.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor infants, a blocked tear duct will most often go away on its own before the child is 1 year old. If not, the outcome is still likely to be good with probing.\n\nIn adults, the outlook for a blocked tear duct varies, depending on the cause and how long the blockage has been present.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nTear duct blockage may lead to an infection (dacryocystitis) in part of the nasolacrimal duct called the lacrimal sac. Most often, there is a bump on the side of the nose right next to the corner of the eye. Treatment for this often requires oral antibiotics. Sometimes, the sac needs to be surgically drained.\n\nTear duct blockage can also increase the chance of other infections, such as conjunctivitis.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSee your provider if you have tear overflow onto the cheek. Earlier treatment is more successful. In the case of a tumor, early treatment may be life-saving.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany cases cannot be prevented. Proper treatment of nasal infections and conjunctivitis may reduce the risk of having a blocked tear duct. Using protective eyewear may help prevent a blockage caused by injury.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDacryostenosis; Blocked nasolacrimal duct; Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO)\n\n**References**\n\nHurwitz JJ, Olver JM, Dutton JJ.

    "content": "**Blond Psyllium**\n\n**What is it?**\nBlond psyllium (Plantago ovata) is an herb. Its seed husk is used as a laxative and stool softener and to help reduce cholesterol.\n\nPsyllium seed husks absorb water in the stomach and form a large mass. This mass stimulates the bowel in people with constipation. In people with diarrhea, it can slow down the bowel and reduce bowel movements. This mass can also reduce the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the body.\n\nBlond psyllium is commonly used as a stool softener in people with constipation and hemorrhoids. It is also used for diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes. It's used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BLOND PSYLLIUM are as follows:\n\n* **Effective for...**\n\t+ Constipation. Taking blond psyllium by mouth, alone or as a combination product, can relieve constipation and improve stool consistency.\n* **Likely effective for...**\n\t+ Heart disease. Blond psyllium is a soluble fiber. Eating foods high in soluble fiber as part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet can help prevent heart disease. You must eat at least 7 grams of psyllium husk daily to reduce the risk for heart disease.\n\t+ High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Taking blond psyllium by mouth reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol in people with mild to moderate high cholesterol. But it seems to be less effective in older people.\n* **Possibly effective for...**\n\t+ Diabetes. Taking blond psyllium by mouth can improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. But it's not clear if it helps prevent diabetes.\n\t+ Diarrhea. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to reduce diarrhea symptoms.\n\t+ Hemorrhoids. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to relieve bleeding and pain in people with hemorrhoids.\n\t+ A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Taking blond psyllium by mouth can relieve constipation and improve stomach pain, diarrhea, and overall well-being in people with IBS. It might take up to four weeks for it to help.\n\t+ Obesity. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to help reduce body weight in people with overweight and obesity. It may need to be taken just before meals and for a couple of months for it to help.\n\t+ Treating side effects of a drug called Orlistat (Xenical, Alli). Taking blond psyllium by mouth with each dose of orlistat seems to relieve orlistat side effects such as gas, stomach rumbling, stomach cramps, and oily spotting.\n* **Possibly ineffective for...**\n\t+ Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Taking blond psyllium by mouth doesn't seem to reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Blond psyllium is likely safe for most people when taken with plenty of fluids. Drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed. It might cause gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. Start with a lower dose and increase the dose slowly to reduce the risk for side effects.\n\nBlond psyllium is likely unsafe when taken without enough fluids. It might cause choking or block the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\nWhen applied into the eye: Blond psyllium mucilage in eyedrops is possibly safe for most people.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if blond psyllium is safe or what the side effects might be.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Blond psyllium is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately when pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\n---\n\n**Blond Psyllium: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma):**\nBlond psyllium might increase the risk of new growths in people with a history of colorectal adenoma. People who have had this condition should avoid blond psyllium.\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders:**\nDon't use blond psyllium if you tend to develop hard stools in the rectum due to GI tract narrowing, obstruction, or conditions that can lead to obstruction, such as spastic bowel.\n\n**Allergy:**\nSome people can have severe allergic reactions to blond psyllium. This is more likely in people who have been exposed to blond psyllium at work. Don't use blond psyllium if you are sensitive to it.\n\n**Phenylketonuria:**\nSome blond psyllium preparations are sweetened with aspartame and should be avoided in patients with phenylketonuria.\n\n**Swallowing disorders:**\nDo not use blond psyllium if you have problems swallowing. Blond psyllium might increase your risk of choking.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Blond psyllium is likely safe for most people when taken with plenty of fluids. Drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed. It might cause gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea.

Take lithium at least one hour after blond psyllium.\n    *   Metformin (Glucophage): Blond psyllium might change metformin absorption. Take blond psyllium 30-60 minutes after taking metformin.\n    *   Olanzapine (Zyprexa): Fiber in blond psyllium can decrease olanzapine absorption.\n*   Minor:\n    *   Digoxin (Lanoxin): Fiber in blond psyllium can decrease digoxin absorption. Take digoxin one hour before or four hours after blond psyllium.\n    *   Ethinyl estradiol: Psyllium might decrease ethinyl estradiol absorption, but this is unlikely to be a concern.\n\n**Interactions with herbs and supplements:**\n\n*   Iron: Taking blond psyllium with iron supplements can reduce iron absorption. Take iron supplements one hour before or four hours after blond psyllium.\n*   Riboflavin: Psyllium might slightly reduce riboflavin absorption, but this is unlikely to be a concern.\n\n**Interactions with foods:**\n\nTaking psyllium can make it difficult to digest fat from the diet. This can increase the amount of fat lost in the stool. Taking psyllium with meals over a long period of time might also affect nutrient absorption. In some cases, it might be necessary to take vitamin or mineral supplements.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nBlond psyllium has most often been used by adults in doses of 3-24 grams by mouth daily for up to 20 weeks. Always drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed.\n\n---\n\n**Blond Psyllium**\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nBlond psyllium has most often been used by adults in doses of 3-24 grams by mouth daily for up to 20 weeks.

    "content": "**Blood Alcohol Level**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nWhat is a blood alcohol test?\n\nA blood alcohol test measures the amount of alcohol in a sample of your blood. You will have alcohol in your blood if you've been drinking alcoholic beverages.\n\nAlcohol is also called ethanol. It's the main ingredient of alcoholic drinks, such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits (liquor). When you have an alcoholic drink, the alcohol is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. Your liver breaks down the alcohol so your body can get rid of it.\n\nIf you drink faster than your liver can break down alcohol, the alcohol level in your blood will increase and you may start to feel intoxicated (drunk). Alcohol intoxication affects how your brain works. At first, you may feel more relaxed, or talkative than usual. As alcohol levels increase, you may have some problems thinking clearly. You make have difficulty with your balance, slurred speech, slowed reaction time, and loss of judgement.\n\nContinuing to drink after you are intoxicated can lead to an alcohol overdose. Symptoms include vomiting, trouble breathing, and passing out. An alcohol overdose can lead to coma or death.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA blood alcohol test may be used for many purposes, including:\n\n* Legal evidence\n\t+ A check to see if you've been \"driving while drunk.\" This means that your alcohol level is above the legal limit.\n\t+ An investigation into a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation\n\t+ A court case or as part of a parole agreement\n* Employment\n\t+ Employers test for alcohol use before hiring you. After you're hired, they may test you to check for on-the-job drinking. If you have a work accident, you may be tested to see whether alcohol was involved.\n* Testing for alcohol poisoning\n\t+ Hospital emergency staff may use a blood alcohol test to check for this life-threatening condition that can happen if blood alcohol level gets very high after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Young children can also get alcohol poisoning from drinking household products that contain alcohol, such as mouthwash and certain cold medicines.\n* Monitoring treatment for alcohol use disorder\n\t+ Some programs may require testing to see if you have been able to avoid drinking.\n\n**Why do I need a blood alcohol test?**\n\nYou may need a blood alcohol test if you are suspected of drunk driving and/or have symptoms of intoxication. These include:\n\n* Difficulty with balance and coordination\n* Slurred speech\n* Slowed reflexes\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Mood changes\n* Poor judgment\n\nYou or your child may also need this test if there are symptoms of alcohol poisoning. In addition to the above symptoms, alcohol poisoning can cause:\n\n* Confusion\n* Irregular breathing\n* Seizures\n* Low body temperature\n\n**What happens during a blood alcohol test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a blood alcohol test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nBlood alcohol level results may be given in different ways, including percentage of blood alcohol content (BAC). Typical results are below.\n\n* Sober: 0.0 percent BAC\n* Legally intoxicated: .08 percent BAC\n* Very impaired: .08–0.40 percent BAC. At this blood alcohol level, you may have difficulty walking and speaking. Other symptoms may include confusion, nausea, and drowsiness.\n* At risk for serious complications: Above .40 percent BAC. At this blood alcohol level, you may be at risk for coma or death.\n\nThe timing of this test can affect the accuracy of the results. A blood alcohol test is only accurate within 6–12 hours after your last drink. If you have questions or concerns about your results, you may want to talk to a health care provider and/or a lawyer.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\n---\n\n**Blood Alcohol Level Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA blood alcohol test measures the amount of alcohol in a sample of your blood.

    "content": "**Blood Clots**\n\nAlso called: Hypercoagulability\n\n**What is a Blood Clot?**\n\nA blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should.\n\n**Where Can Blood Clots Form?**\n\nBlood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:\n\n* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis.\n* A pulmonary embolism (PE) can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs.\n* Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain.\n* Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Blood Clots?**\n\nCertain factors can raise your risk of developing blood clots:\n\n* Atherosclerosis\n* Atrial fibrillation\n* Being overweight or having obesity\n* Cancer and cancer treatments\n* Certain genetic disorders\n* Certain surgeries\n* COVID-19\n* Diabetes\n* Family history of blood clots\n* Overweight and obesity\n* Pregnancy and giving birth\n* Serious injuries\n* Some medicines, including birth control pills\n* Smoking\n* Staying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Blood Clots?**\n\nThe symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:\n\n* In the abdomen: abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\n* In an arm or leg: sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmth\n* In the lungs: shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rate\n* In the brain: trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headache\n* In the heart: chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left arm\n\n**How Are Blood Clots Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have one or more blood clots, your health care provider:\n\n* Will do a physical exam.\n* Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms.\n* May order blood tests, including a D-dimer test.\n* May order imaging tests, such as ultrasound, x-rays of the veins (venography) or blood vessels (angiography), CT scan.\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Blood Clots?**\n\nTreatments for blood clots depend on where the blood clot is located and how severe it is. Treatments may include:\n\n* Blood thinners.\n* Other medicines, including thrombolytics.\n* Surgery and other procedures to remove the blood clots.\n\n**Can Blood Clots Be Prevented?**\n\nYou may be able to help prevent blood clots by:\n\n* Moving around as soon as possible after having been confined to your bed, such as after surgery, illness, or injury\n* Getting up and moving around every few hours when you have to sit for long periods of time\n* Wearing compression stockings after surgery or during a long flight\n* Regular physical activity\n* Not smoking\n* Staying at a healthy weight\n\nSome people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Clots**\n\nA blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together.

They are usually used where the blood clots are severe.\n* Surgery and other procedures to remove the blood clots\n\n**Preventing Blood Clots**\n\nYou may be able to help prevent blood clots by:\n\n* Moving around as soon as possible after having been confined to your bed, such as after surgery, illness, or injury\n* Getting up and moving around every few hours when you have to sit for long periods of time, for example if you are on a long flight or car trip\n* Wearing compression stockings after surgery or during a long flight\n* Regular physical activity\n* Not smoking\n* Staying at a healthy weight\n\nSome people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Clots**\n\nTo find out if you have one or more blood clots, your health care provider will perform tests to determine where the blood clot is located and how severe it is. The location of the blood clot can affect treatment options.\n\n**Treatments for Blood Clots**\n\nTreatments may include:\n\n* Medications to dissolve the clot\n* Procedures to remove the clot\n* Surgery to repair or replace a damaged vein\n\n**Preventing Blood Clots**\n\nYou may be able to help prevent blood clots by:\n\n* Maintaining good circulation through exercise and movement\n* Avoiding prolonged bed rest or immobility\n* Managing conditions that increase your risk of blood clots, such as cancer or inflammation\n\nSome people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nCoagulation factor tests can help diagnose bleeding disorders. Other tests include:\n\n* D-dimer test: measures the presence of a protein produced when a blood clot dissolves\n* MPV blood test: measures the average size of red blood cells, which can indicate the presence of a blood clot\n* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test: measures the time it takes for blood to clot and can help diagnose bleeding disorders\n* Protein C and protein S tests: measure the levels of these proteins in your blood, which are involved in blood clotting\n* Prothrombin time test and INR (PT/INR): measure the time it takes for blood to clot and can help diagnose bleeding disorders\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nUnderstanding your risk for excessive blood clotting is crucial. The American Heart Association provides information on how to understand your risk.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nBlood thinners are medications that prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is a procedure where a catheter is inserted into the affected vein to deliver medication directly to the clot.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nIf you're taking blood thinners, you may still be at risk for blood clots under certain circumstances. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on how travel can increase your risk of blood clots.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a condition where your immune system produces antibodies that attack healthy tissues, leading to blood clots. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a type of blood clot that forms in the brain's veins. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition where your blood vessels become inflamed and damaged, leading to blood clots.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nCertain genetic conditions can increase your risk of developing blood clots. These include:\n\n* Factor V Leiden thrombophilia: a genetic disorder that affects the protein responsible for blood clotting\n* Hereditary antithrombin deficiency: a rare genetic disorder that affects the protein responsible for preventing excessive blood clotting\n* Protein C deficiency: a genetic disorder that affects the protein responsible for preventing excessive blood clotting\n* Protein S deficiency: a genetic disorder that affects the protein responsible for preventing excessive blood clotting\n* Prothrombin thrombophilia: a genetic disorder that affects the protein responsible for blood clotting\n\n**Videos and Tutorials**\n\nThe Medical Encyclopedia provides information on how blood clots form and what treatments are available.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has published research on blood clots, including studies on how to clear blockages in the system.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov lists clinical trials related to thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, and venous thrombosis.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed list articles on topics such as impaired membrane lipids in ischemic stroke, a novel KGD-based αIIbβ3 antagonist, and exploring the histopathological features of thrombus-associated localized amyloid deposition.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Clots**\n\n**What You Need to Know**\n\nBlood clots are a serious medical condition that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. In this article, we will explore the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for blood clots.\n\n**Causes of Blood Clots**\n\nThere are several causes of blood clots, including:\n\n*   **Genetic disorders**: Certain genetic disorders, such as antithrombin III deficiency or protein C or S deficiency, can increase the risk of developing blood clots.\n*   **Injury or surgery**: Trauma or surgery can cause blood to pool in the legs, increasing the risk of clot formation.\n*   **Prolonged bed rest**: Prolonged periods of immobility can increase the risk of blood clots.\n*   **Family history**: A family history of blood clots may increase an individual's risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Symptoms of Blood Clots**\n\nThe symptoms of blood clots can vary depending on the location and severity of the clot. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Pain or swelling in the affected limb**\n*   **Warmth or redness in the affected area**\n*   **Shortness of breath or coughing up blood** (in cases of pulmonary embolism)\n*   **Seizures or altered mental status** (in cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis)\n\n**Treatment Options for Blood Clots**\n\nThe treatment options for blood clots depend on the location and severity of the clot. Common treatments include:\n\n*   **Anticoagulant medications**: Medications such as heparin, warfarin, or aspirin may be prescribed to prevent further clot formation.\n*   **Thrombolytic therapy**: In severe cases, thrombolytic agents may be administered to dissolve the clot.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the clot.\n\n**Prevention of Blood Clots**\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to prevent blood clots:\n\n*   **Stay active**: Regular exercise can help improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of blood clots.\n*   **Avoid prolonged bed rest**: If possible, try to get up and move around regularly to reduce the risk of blood clots.\n*   **Manage underlying medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, may increase the risk of blood clots. Working with a healthcare provider to manage these conditions can help reduce the risk of complications.\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for blood clots, individuals can take steps to prevent this serious medical condition. If you are experiencing any symptoms of blood clots, seek medical attention immediately.",

    "content": "**Blood Differential**\n\n**What is a Blood Differential Test?**\n\nA blood differential test measures the amount of each type of white blood cell (WBC) that you have in your blood. This test can help diagnose or monitor an infection or condition that affects your immune system.\n\n**White Blood Cells: An Important Part of Your Immune System**\n\nWhite blood cells are also called leukocytes and WBCs. They are a type of blood cell that is made in your bone marrow and found in your blood and lymph tissue (which is part of your lymphatic system). White blood cells are an important part of your immune system. When you are injured or sick, your white blood cells will travel through your bloodstream and tissues to where they are needed. There, they will help your body fight off the infection or disease.\n\n**Types of White Blood Cells**\n\nThere are five different types of white blood cells:\n\n*   **Neutrophils**: The most common type of white blood cell. They are your body's main defense against infection when bacteria, viruses, or other germs enter your body.\n*   **Lymphocytes**: Include two main types of white blood cells: B cells and T cells. B cells fight off invading viruses, bacteria, or toxins. Certain T cells can target and destroy your body's own cells, such as cancer cells and cells that have been infected by viruses.\n*   **Monocytes**: Kill bacteria, viruses, and other germs that may make you sick. They also boost your body's immune response and clear away dead cells.\n*   **Eosinophils**: Defend against parasites and infections. They are also involved in allergies and help control inflammation (swelling and redness).\n*   **Basophils**: Release enzymes during allergic reactions and asthma attacks.\n\n**What is a Blood Differential Test Used For?**\n\nA blood differential test is often part of a routine checkup. Because the five types of white blood cell do different jobs, measuring them separately can give your health care provider important information about your health.\n\nThe test can also help diagnose a variety of medical conditions, such as:\n\n*   Infections\n*   Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Leukemia and other types of cancer\n\n---\n\n**Blood Differential Test**\n\nA blood differential test is often part of a routine checkup. Because the five types of white blood cell do different jobs, measuring them separately can give your health care provider important information about your health.\n\nThe test can also help diagnose a variety of medical conditions, such as:\n\n* Infections\n* Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis\n* Leukemia and other types of cancer\n\n**Why Do I Need a Blood Differential Test?**\n\nA blood differential test is used for many reasons. Your provider may order the test to:\n\n* Monitor your overall health or as part of a routine checkup.\n* Diagnose the cause of your symptoms or your abnormal WBC count from another blood test.\n* Monitor an existing blood disorder or related condition.\n\n**What Happens During a Blood Differential Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. After the test, some people experience mild pain, dizziness, or bruising. These symptoms usually go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour blood differential test results may be higher or lower than normal for many reasons.\n\nConditions that may cause a high white blood cell count, also called leukocytosis, can include:\n\n* Infections\n* Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders\n* Leukemia or Hodgkin disease\n* Allergic reactions\n* Certain steroids\n\nConditions that may cause a low white blood cell count, also called leukopenia, can include:\n\n* Bone marrow diseases\n* Chemotherapy\n* Certain medicines, such as antibiotics\n* Cancer\n* HIV\n\nBut abnormal results don't always mean you have a condition that needs medical treatment. Some other factors that may affect your results can include:\n\n* Physical injury or extreme stress\n* Smoking\n* Alcohol use\n\nIf your results seem abnormal, your provider may order other tests to help figure out the cause. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. To understand your results, your provider will also consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Cancer Society: All about Cancer: Blood-related Problems.

It's an important tool for doctors to diagnose and monitor various health conditions.\n\n**Types of White Blood Cells**\n\nThere are five main types of white blood cells:\n\n* **Neutrophils**: These cells fight off bacterial infections.\n* **Lymphocytes**: These cells help fight off viral infections and other foreign substances.\n* **Monocytes**: These cells mature into macrophages, which engulf and digest foreign particles and microorganisms.\n* **Eosinophils**: These cells play a role in fighting off parasites and in allergic reactions.\n* **Basophils**: These cells are involved in inflammatory reactions, such as those that occur during an allergic response.\n\n**Why is a Blood Differential Important?**\n\nA blood differential can help doctors diagnose and monitor various health conditions, including:\n\n* **Infections**: A high WBC count can indicate the presence of an infection.\n* **Cancer**: Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia, can cause abnormal white blood cell counts.\n* **Allergic reactions**: Eosinophilia, a condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, can occur in response to allergic reactions.\n* **Autoimmune disorders**: Some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can cause changes in white blood cell counts.\n\n**How is a Blood Differential Performed?**\n\nA blood differential is typically performed using a sample of blood drawn from a vein in your arm. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**What are the Results of a Blood Differential?**\n\nThe results of a blood differential will show the percentage of each type of white blood cell in your body. A normal WBC count ranges from 4,500 to 13,000 cells per microliter (mcL) of blood. Abnormal counts can indicate various health conditions.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Autoimmune Diseases**\n* **Bacterial Infections**\n* **Blood Count Tests**\n* **Blood Disorders**\n* **Eosinophilic Disorders**\n* **Leukemia**\n* **Viral Infections**\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* **Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Test**\n* **BCR-ABL1 Genetic Test**\n* **Bone Marrow Tests**\n* **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**\n* **How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety**\n* **How to Prepare for a Lab Test**\n* **How to Understand Your Lab Results**\n* **Pneumococcal Disease Tests**\n* **What You Need to Know About Blood Testing**\n* **White Blood Count (WBC)**",

    "content": "**Blood Glucose Test**\n\n**What is a blood glucose test?**\n\nA blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar that comes from the food you eat. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells for use as energy.\n\n**High Blood Glucose Levels (Hyperglycemia)**\n\nHigh blood glucose levels may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than what is healthy for you, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or can't use it as well as it should, or both.\n\n**Low Blood Glucose Levels (Hypoglycemia)**\n\nLow blood glucose levels may be caused by certain diabetes medicines for type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, including insulin. In people without diabetes, low blood glucose is much less common and may be caused by certain medicines and conditions, such as some kidney or liver diseases.\n\n**Types of Blood Glucose Tests**\n\nSeveral types of blood tests check blood glucose levels. Your health care provider will choose the test that's right for you.\n\n*   Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\n*   Fasting blood sugar (FBS)\n*   Random blood sugar\n*   Glucose challenge test\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n*   Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA blood glucose test may be used:\n\n*   As part of a routine checkup to screen for prediabetes and diabetes\n*   To help diagnose the cause of symptoms that may mean your blood glucose is too high or too low\n*   To monitor the side effects of certain long-term medicines that may affect blood glucose\n\n**Why do I need a blood glucose test?**\n\nYour provider may order a blood glucose test as part of your routine checkup. Routine blood tests that include a glucose test include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\n\nThe most common reasons for a blood glucose test are to screen for and monitor prediabetes and diabetes.\n\n**Symptoms of High Blood Glucose Levels**\n\n*   Increased thirst\n*   Frequent urination (peeing)\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Fatigue\n*   Sores that are slow to heal\n*   Losing weight without trying\n*   Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands\n\n**Symptoms of Low Blood Glucose Levels**\n\n*   Feeling shaky or jittery\n*   Hunger\n*   Fatigue\n*   Feeling dizzy, confused, or irritable\n*   Headache\n*   A fast heartbeat or arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n*   Having trouble seeing or speaking clearly\n*   Fainting or seizures\n\n**What happens during a blood glucose test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.\n\nThere are several types of blood glucose tests:\n\n*   Fasting blood glucose test\n*   Random blood glucose test\n*   Glucose challenge test\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n*   Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nIf your provider orders a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. If your glucose test is part of a BMP or CMP test, you may need to fast.\n\nOther blood glucose tests don't require any special preparations. Ask your provider whether you need to fast before your glucose test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After an oral glucose tolerance test, you may feel light-headed. Your provider may suggest that you plan to have someone take you home.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe meaning of your test results will depend on which test you had, the results of other tests, and your medical history. Ask your provider what your test results say about your health.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Glucose Test**\n\nA blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar that comes from the food you eat and is your body's main source of energy.\n\n**What Does it Mean if My Results Show Higher Than Normal Glucose Levels?**\n\nIf your results show higher than normal glucose levels, it may mean you have or are at risk for getting diabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes are the most common causes of high glucose levels, but other possible causes include:\n\n*   An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n*   A problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis\n*   Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma\n*   A problem with your adrenal glands, including Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma\n*   Certain medicines\n\n**What Does it Mean if I Have Diabetes and My Results Show Lower Than Normal Glucose Levels?**\n\nIf you have diabetes, glucose levels that are lower than normal for you may be caused by:\n\n*   Certain diabetes medicines and other medicines that may lower blood glucose\n*   Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine\n*   Being more physically active than usual\n\n**What Does it Mean if I Don't Have Diabetes and My Results Show Lower Than Normal Glucose Levels?**\n\nIf you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels aren't common. If they happen, they may be caused by:\n\n*   Liver or kidney disease\n*   Underactive adrenal glands, for example, Addison disease\n*   Certain pituitary disorders\n*   An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n*   Malnutrition\n*   Certain medicines\n*   Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n\n**How Do I Check My Blood Glucose Levels?**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may need to do blood glucose testing at home to help manage your blood glucose levels. Your provider will let you know how often you should test. There are two ways to check your blood glucose:\n\n*   **Blood Glucose Meters**: These require you to prick your finger with a small device called a lancet. Then, you apply a drop of blood to a test strip and insert it into a small electronic glucose meter, which measures the glucose in your blood.\n*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM)**: These usually use a tiny sensor placed under the skin of your arm or belly. Depending on the type of CGM you use, the sensor stays in place from a week to several months. It automatically estimates your glucose level every few minutes and tracks it so you can see what your blood glucose level is at any time.\n\n**What Is a Blood Glucose Test Used For?**\n\nA blood glucose test may be used:\n\n*   As part of a routine checkup to screen for prediabetes and diabetes\n*   To help diagnose the cause of symptoms that may mean your blood glucose is too high or too low\n*   To monitor the side effects of certain long-term medicines that may affect blood glucose\n\n**Why Do I Need a Blood Glucose Test?**\n\nYour provider may order a blood glucose test as part of your routine checkup.

Your provider may order a blood glucose test if:\n\n*   You have a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes\n*   You have symptoms of high or low glucose levels, which could mean you have diabetes or another condition that affects blood glucose levels\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of High Blood Glucose Levels?**\n\nSymptoms of high blood glucose levels include:\n\n*   Increased thirst\n*   Frequent urination (peeing)\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Fatigue\n*   Sores that are slow to heal\n*   Losing weight without trying\n*   Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands\n\n---\n\n**Blood Glucose Test**\n\n**What does the test measure?**\n\nThe blood glucose test measures the level of glucose (sugar) in your blood.\n\n**Symptoms of high or low blood glucose levels**\n\n* Increased thirst\n* Frequent urination (peeing)\n* Blurred vision\n* Fatigue\n* Sores that are slow to heal\n* Losing weight without trying\n* Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands\n\nSymptoms of low blood glucose levels include:\n\n* Feeling shaky or jittery\n* Hunger\n* Fatigue\n* Feeling dizzy, confused, or irritable\n* Headache\n* A fast heartbeat or arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n* Having trouble seeing or speaking clearly\n* Fainting or seizures\n\n**Who needs a blood glucose test?**\n\nYou have prediabetes or diabetes. Your provider may schedule blood glucose tests to monitor your condition. You may also monitor your blood glucose at home.\n\nYou are pregnant. You will likely have a blood glucose test between the 24th and 28th week of your pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes. If you have a high risk for gestational diabetes, your provider may test you earlier.\n\nYou take long-term medicines, other than diabetes medicines, that may affect blood glucose levels. Examples of medicines that may cause high blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\n\n* Steroids\n* Antipsychotics\n* Beta-blockers\n* Statins\n\nExamples of medicines that may cause low blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\n\n* ACE inhibitors\n* Antibiotics called quinolones\n* Medicines to treat malaria\n\n**Types of blood glucose tests**\n\nThere are several types of blood glucose tests:\n\n* Fasting blood glucose test: measures your glucose after you fast (not eating or drinking, except for water) for at least 8 hours.\n* Random blood glucose test: can be done at any time, even after eating.\n* Glucose challenge test: used to screen for gestational diabetes if you are pregnant. You don't need to fast for this test.\n* Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): used to diagnose gestational diabetes or confirm a diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. You will need to fast for this test.\n* Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test: provides information about your average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months.\n\n**Preparing for the test**\n\nIf your provider orders a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. If your glucose test is part of a BMP or CMP test, you may need to fast. Other blood glucose tests don't require any special preparations.\n\n**Risks of the test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After an oral glucose tolerance test, you may feel light-headed. Your provider may suggest that you plan to have someone take you home.\n\n**Interpreting results**\n\nThe meaning of your test results will depend on which test you had, the results of other tests, and your medical history. Ask your provider what your test results say about your health.\n\nIf your results show higher than normal glucose levels, it may mean you have or are at risk for getting diabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes are the most common causes of high glucose levels, but other possible causes include:\n\n* An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n* A problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis\n* Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma\n* A problem with your adrenal glands, including Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma\n* Certain medicines\n\nIf you have diabetes, glucose levels that are lower than normal for you may be caused by:\n\n* Certain diabetes medicines and other medicines that may lower blood glucose\n* Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine\n* Being more physically active than usual\n\nIf you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels aren't common. If they happen, they may be caused by:\n\n* Liver or kidney disease\n* Underactive adrenal glands, for example, Addison disease\n* Certain pituitary disorders\n* An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n* Malnutrition\n* Certain medicines\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n\n---\n\n**Blood Glucose Test**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your provider will let you know how often you should test your blood glucose levels. There are two ways to check your blood glucose:\n\n* **Using a Blood Glucose Meter**: This device requires you to prick your finger with a small lancet and apply a drop of blood to a test strip. The meter then measures the glucose in your blood.\n* **Using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)**: A CGM usually uses a tiny sensor placed under the skin of your arm or belly. Depending on the type of CGM, the sensor stays in place from a week to several months. It automatically estimates your glucose level every few minutes and tracks it so you can see what your blood glucose level is at any time.\n\nYour provider will help you decide which method is best for you. If you have diabetes, you may need to do blood glucose testing at home to help manage your blood glucose levels.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Glucose Test**\n\nAre you wondering what a blood glucose test is and how it can help diagnose diabetes? In this article, we'll break down the basics of the test and what it entails.\n\n**What is a Blood Glucose Test?**\n\nA blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It's an essential tool for diagnosing diabetes, as high blood sugar levels are a hallmark of the condition.\n\n**How Does the Test Work?**\n\nDuring a blood glucose test, a healthcare professional will draw a sample of your blood and send it to a laboratory for analysis. The lab will then measure the amount of glucose in your blood using a technique called enzymatic assay.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of a blood glucose test can indicate several things:\n\n*   **Normal blood sugar levels**: If your blood sugar levels are within the normal range (typically between 70 and 99 mg/dL), it means that your body is producing insulin properly, and your cells are using it effectively.\n*   **High blood sugar levels**: If your blood sugar levels are elevated (above 100-125 mg/dL), it may indicate that you have diabetes or are at risk of developing the condition. In some cases, high blood sugar levels can be a sign of other health issues, such as pancreatitis or Cushing's syndrome.\n*   **Low blood sugar levels**: If your blood sugar levels are low (below 70 mg/dL), it may indicate that you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).\n\n**What Happens Next?**\n\nIf your blood glucose test results indicate high or low blood sugar levels, your healthcare provider will likely recommend further testing to confirm the diagnosis. This may involve additional blood tests, a physical examination, and possibly even a urine test to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\nBy understanding what a blood glucose test entails and how it can help diagnose diabetes, you'll be better equipped to take control of your health and make informed decisions about your care.",

It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream.\n\n**What is Diabetes?**\n\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range.\n\n**Blood Glucose Targets**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are:\n\n* Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\n* Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL\n\nYour blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team about the best target range for you.\n\n**Checking Your Blood Glucose**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it.\n\nThe most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip.\n\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose.\n\nYour provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals.\n\n**High Blood Glucose**\n\nHigh blood glucose is called hyperglycemia. Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include:\n\n* Feeling thirsty\n* Feeling tired or weak\n* Headaches\n* Urinating (peeing) often\n* Blurred vision\n\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\n\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands.\n\n**Low Blood Glucose**\n\nHypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\n\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\n\n* Shaking\n* Sweating\n* Nervousness or anxiety\n* Irritability or confusion\n* Dizziness\n* Hunger\n\nLow blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Glucose | Blood Sugar | Diabetes**\n\n**What is Blood Glucose?**\n\nBlood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-smear/",
    "content": "**Blood Smear**\n\nWhat is a blood smear?\n\nA blood smear is a test that's used to help diagnose and monitor a wide variety of blood disorders and other conditions that affect your blood. The test checks a sample of your blood under a microscope to see whether your blood cells look normal. It looks at your:\n\n* Red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body\n* White blood cells (WBCs), which fight infection and are part of your immune system\n* Platelets, which help your blood clot to stop bleeding when you have a cut or wound\n\nTo do a blood smear, a sample of blood is spread on a glass slide. The slide is treated with a special stain that makes the cells easier to see. Then a laboratory professional looks at the slide under a microscope to check the size, shape, and number of cells in your blood sample. Automatic computer programs may be used to help examine your blood smears.\n\nOther names: peripheral smear, peripheral blood film, smear, blood film, manual differential, differential slide, blood cell morphology, blood smear analysis, leukocyte differential\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nA blood smear alone can't diagnose a disease. But it can be used with other tests to help diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions, such as:\n\n* Blood and bone marrow disorders\n* Certain types of cancer, including those that affect your blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic system (a part of your immune system)\n* Infections\n* Certain parasites\n\nWhy do I need a blood smear?\n\nYou may need a blood smear if:\n\n* You had a complete blood count (CBC) with abnormal results. A CBC is a group of blood tests that measures the number and size of the different cells in your blood.\n* You have symptoms of a condition that affects your blood cells, such as fatigue, jaundice, nosebleeds or other unusual bleeding, easy bruising, fever, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes.\n* You are being treated for a condition that affects your blood cells, such as anemia or blood cancer.\n* You have symptoms of certain diseases caused by parasites, and you live in or travel to areas where those diseases are common.\n\nWhat happens during a blood smear?\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nYou don't need any special preparation for a blood smear. If your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nThe results of a blood smear alone usually can't diagnose a medical condition. Your provider will use your test results combined with your medical history, symptoms, and the results of other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nYour blood smear results will describe what your blood cells look like and how many there are. The results will also show anything else that's unusual about your blood, for example, if any parasites were found.\n\nRed blood cell results that aren't normal may be a sign of conditions such as anemia, sickle cell disease, hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, bone marrow disorders.\n\nWhite blood cell results that aren't normal may be a sign of conditions such as infection, leukemia, bone marrow disorders.\n\nPlatelet results that aren't normal may be a sign of conditions such as thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, thrombocythemia.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Smear: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\nYou may need a blood smear if:\n\n* You had a complete blood count (CBC) with abnormal results. A CBC is a group of blood tests that measures the number and size of the different cells in your blood.\n* You have symptoms of a condition that affects your blood cells, such as:\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n\t+ Nosebleeds or other unusual bleeding\n\t+ Easy bruising\n\t+ Fever\n\t+ Bone pain\n\t+ Swollen lymph nodes, also called \"swollen glands\"\n* You are being treated for a condition that affects your blood cells, such as anemia or blood cancer.\n* You have symptoms of certain diseases caused by parasites, and you live in or travel to areas where those diseases are common.\n\n**What Happens During a Blood Smear?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nSometimes, the blood sample will be taken by pricking your finger with a needle. When testing a baby, the heel is pricked.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparation for a blood smear. If your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test.

If your blood smear results are not normal, your provider may order more tests to help find the cause.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Smear: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What is it?**\nA blood smear test, also known as a peripheral blood smear, is a laboratory test that examines the cells in your blood to detect various conditions such as anemia, infections, and blood disorders.\n\n**How is it done?**\nDuring the test, a healthcare provider will take a sample of your blood from a vein in your arm or finger. The blood sample is then spread onto a glass slide and stained with special dyes to make the cells visible under a microscope.\n\n**What does it show?**\nThe blood smear test can reveal various abnormalities in your blood cells, such as:\n\n* Anemia: a decrease in red blood cell count or hemoglobin level\n* Infections: presence of bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms\n* Blood disorders: conditions affecting the production or function of blood cells\n\n**What happens next?**\nAfter the test results are available, your healthcare provider will discuss the findings with you and determine the next course of action. Depending on the results, further tests may be ordered to help identify the underlying cause of any abnormalities.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bain B.

    "content": "**Blood Culture**\n\nA blood culture is a laboratory test to check for bacteria or other germs in a blood sample.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A blood sample is needed.\n*   The site where blood will be drawn is first cleaned with an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine to reduce the chance of contamination.\n*   The sample is sent to a laboratory, where it is placed in a special dish (culture) and watched for bacterial growth. A Gram stain may also be done.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others may only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but these symptoms usually go away quickly.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have symptoms of a serious infection, also known as sepsis. Symptoms of sepsis can include high fever, chills, rapid breathing and heart rate, confusion, and low blood pressure.\n\nThe blood culture helps identify the type of bacteria causing the infection, which informs your provider's treatment decisions.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal value means that no bacteria or other germs were seen in your blood sample.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal (positive) result means that germs were identified in your blood. If the germs are bacteria, the medical term for this is bacteremia, which can cause sepsis. Sepsis is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission for treatment.\n\nOther types of germs, such as a fungus or a virus, may also be found in a blood culture. Sometimes, an abnormal result can be due to contamination, which means bacteria were present but came from your skin or lab equipment, not your blood.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCulture - blood\n\n**References**\n\nPlourde AR, Beavis KG.

Editorial team.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Culture**\n\nA blood culture is a laboratory test to check for bacteria or other germs in a blood sample.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A blood sample is needed.\n*   The site where blood will be drawn is first cleaned with an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine. This reduces the chance of an organism from the skin getting into (contaminating) the blood sample and causing a false-positive result.\n*   The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria or other disease-causing germs grow. A Gram stain may also be done.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have symptoms of a serious infection, also known as sepsis. Symptoms of sepsis can include high fever, chills, rapid breathing and heart rate, confusion, and low blood pressure.\n\nThe blood culture helps identify the type of bacteria causing the infection. This helps your provider determine how best to treat the infection.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal value means that no bacteria or other germs were seen in your blood sample.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal (positive) result means that germs were identified in your blood. If the germs are bacteria, the medical term for this is bacteremia. This can cause sepsis. Sepsis is a medical emergency and you will be admitted to a hospital for treatment.\n\nOther types of germs, such as a fungus or a virus, may also be found in a blood culture.\n\nSometimes, an abnormal result can be due to contamination. This means bacteria may be found, but it came from your skin or from the lab equipment, instead of your blood. This is called a false-positive result. It means you do not have a true infection.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Blood Culture**\n\n**What is a Blood Culture?**\n\nA blood culture is a laboratory test used to detect the presence of bacteria or other microorganisms in the blood. It involves collecting a sample of blood from a patient and then growing the bacteria in a special medium to identify the type of infection.\n\n**How is a Blood Culture Performed?**\n\nTo perform a blood culture, a healthcare professional will typically insert a needle into a vein in the arm or leg to collect a sample of blood. The blood is then placed into a special container called a culture bottle, which contains a nutrient-rich medium that allows the bacteria to grow.\n\n**Risks Associated with Having Blood Drawn**\n\nWhile there is little risk involved with having your blood taken, some risks associated with having blood drawn include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**References**\n\nPlourde AR, Beavis KG.

    "content": "**Blood Donation Before Surgery**\n\nYour surgeon will be very careful during surgery to limit the amount of blood you lose. But blood may continue to ooze from tissues that were cut, even after the operation is over. To replace this blood, you may be given a blood transfusion. This is a safe and common procedure, during which you receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line placed in one of your blood vessels.\n\n**Sources of Blood**\n\nSeveral sources of blood are described here.\n\n*   **Blood From the Public (Volunteer Blood Donation)**: The most common source of blood given during or after surgery is from volunteers in the general public. This kind of donation is called homologous blood donation. Your blood will be tested to make sure you receive the correct type of donor blood.\n*   **Directed Donor Blood From a Family Member or Friend**: This method involves a family member or friend donating blood before your surgery. This blood is then set aside and held only for your use.\n*   **Autologous Blood Donation (Your Own Blood)**: Although blood donated by the general public and used for most people is thought to be very safe, some people choose to use a method called autologous blood donation. Autologous blood is blood donated by you, which you later receive if you need a transfusion during or after surgery.\n\n**Safety of Blood Transfusions**\n\nYou may have read about the danger of becoming infected with hepatitis, HIV, or other viruses after a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are not 100% safe. But the current blood supply is thought to be safer now than ever. Donated blood is tested for many different infections, and the tests are very accurate. Also, blood centers keep a list of unsafe donors, so the risk of infection from blood transfusions is low.\n\n**Arranging Blood Donation**\n\nIf you wish to donate your own blood, you must make arrangements yourself. Your hospital may be set up to receive these donations and store the blood. Otherwise, your local blood bank may handle this process. Most of the time, you will need to pay for this process.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Donation Before Surgery**\n\nIf you're considering donating your own blood before surgery, there are some things to keep in mind. You can have blood taken from 6 weeks to 5 days before your surgery, and it will be stored for a few weeks.\n\n**Arranging Autologous Blood Donation**\n\nYou'll need to make arrangements yourself for autologous blood donation. Your hospital may be set up to receive these donations and store the blood, or your local blood bank may handle this process. In most cases, you'll need to pay for this process.\n\n**Potential Problems with Autologous Blood Donation**\n\nDonating your own blood can make you anemic or lower your blood count before surgery. This means that even after receiving your donated blood, you may still need a blood transfusion from the general public. To avoid this, your provider may suggest not donating too close to your surgery date.\n\nIn rare cases, mistakes by the blood center or hospital can result in receiving the wrong unit of blood, which may cause a reaction.\n\n**Boosting Your Blood Count**\n\nTo help your body make more blood cells, your provider may ask you to take extra vitamins and minerals, including:\n\n* Iron tablets\n* Folic acid\n* Vitamin C\n\nYou may also receive a medicine by injection to boost your blood count before surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Blood donation before surgery**\n\nIf you're about to undergo surgery, your surgeon may ask you to donate blood in advance. This is because the amount of blood lost during surgery can be significant, and having a supply of your own blood on hand can help ensure a smoother recovery.\n\n**Why donate blood?**\n\nDonating blood before surgery can help prevent complications related to blood loss. If you lose a lot of blood during surgery, your body may not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. This can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and even organ failure.\n\n**How do I donate my own blood?**\n\nIf you want to donate your own blood before surgery, you'll need to make arrangements with your hospital or local blood bank. They may have a special program in place for autologous blood donation (ABD). You'll typically need to pay for this process out of pocket.\n\n**What are the risks of donating my own blood?**\n\nWhile ABD is generally safe, there are some potential risks to consider. These include:\n\n*   Infection: As with any medical procedure, there's a risk of infection when collecting and storing your blood.\n*   Blood clotting: If your blood clots too quickly, it can cause problems during surgery or after the procedure.\n*   Anemia: If you lose too much blood during surgery, you may develop anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.\n\n**What are my options for blood donation before surgery?**\n\nYou have three main options for blood donation before surgery:\n\n1.  **Blood from the public**: This is the most common source of blood used during or after surgery. Blood banks collect donations from healthy individuals in the community, which are then tested and matched to patients who need them.\n2.  **Directed donor blood**: In this scenario, a family member or friend donates blood specifically for your use before surgery. This blood is then set aside and held only for your needs.\n3.  **Autologous blood donation (your own blood)**: As mentioned earlier, you can choose to donate your own blood before surgery. This involves collecting and storing your blood in advance of the procedure.\n\n**What precautions are taken to ensure safe blood transfusions?**\n\nTo minimize the risk of infection or other complications, blood banks take several precautions:\n\n*   **Testing for infections**: Donated blood is thoroughly tested for various infections, including hepatitis and HIV.\n*   **Screening donors**: Potential donors are asked a series of questions about their health and lifestyle to identify any risks factors.\n*   **Safe storage and handling**: Blood is stored and handled in a sterile environment to prevent contamination.\n\nBy understanding your options for blood donation before surgery, you can make an informed decision about which approach is best for your needs.",

Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\n**Other Names for a Blood Gas Test**\n\n* Arterial blood gas analysis; ABG\n* Hypoxia - ABG\n* Respiratory failure - ABG\n\n**References**\n\nSunwoo BY, Mokhlesi B.

    "content": "**Blood in Urine**\n\nHaving blood in your urine is called hematuria. The blood may make your urine or the water in the toilet bowl turn pink, red, or reddish brown. But you might not always be able to see the blood without a lab test.\n\nThere are two main types of hematuria, based on whether you can see the blood:\n\n* **Gross Hematuria**: When you can see blood in your urine without having a test.\n* **Microscopic Hematuria**: When you can't see small amounts of blood in your urine, but it can be seen under a microscope or is found using a urinalysis.\n\nHaving blood in your urine usually isn't serious. Some medicines and certain foods, such as beets or rhubarb, might also cause your urine to turn red. But in some cases, red or white blood cells in your urine may mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney disease, or liver disease.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA urinalysis, which includes a test for blood in urine, is used to check your general health, including the health of your urinary tract, kidneys, and liver. The test can also be used to check for other health problems besides blood in urine.\n\n**Why do I need a blood in urine test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a urinalysis as part of a routine exam. You may also need this test if you have seen blood in your urine or have other symptoms that could be caused by a problem with your kidneys or urinary tract. These symptoms include:\n\n* Painful urination\n* Frequent urination\n* Back pain\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\n**What happens during a blood in urine test?**\n\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample.\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n* Open the container without touching the inside.\n* Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n\t+ For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n\t+ For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n* Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n* Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n* Finish urinating into the toilet.\n* Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\n\nIf you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test. Outside blood could get into your urine sample and affect your test results.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations before getting a test for blood in your urine. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. They will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a blood in urine test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nMany things can cause blood in urine, and most of them aren't serious. Blood may be caused by certain medicines, intense exercise, sexual activity, or menstruation. But blood in your urine can sometimes be a sign of a more serious problem, such as:\n\n* Infection in your bladder, kidney, or prostate\n* Bladder or kidney stones\n* Kidney injury from an accident or sports\n* A viral infection, including hepatitis (a disease of the liver causing inflammation)\n* Cancer of the bladder, kidney, or prostate\n* Enlarged prostate (BPH)\n* Inflammation of the kidney, urethra, or bladder\n* A blood disorder\n* Polycystic kidney disease\n* Disorders of the ureters (tubes that connect your kidneys to your bladder)\n\nIf your test result shows blood in your urine, you may need more tests to find out why. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a blood in urine test?**\n\nA blood in urine test is usually part of a routine urinalysis. A urinalysis also measures other substances in the urine, including proteins, acid and sugar levels, cell fragments, and crystals.\n\n---\n\n**Blood in Urine: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Why do I need a blood in urine test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have seen blood in your urine or have other symptoms that could be caused by a problem with your kidneys or urinary tract.

    "content": "**Blood Pressure**\n\nThe force of blood on artery walls is called blood pressure. Normal pressure is important for the proper flow of blood from the heart to the body's organs and tissues. Each heart beat forces blood to the rest of the body. Near the heart, pressure is higher, and away from it lower.\n\n**What Determines Blood Pressure?**\n\nBlood pressure depends on many things, including how much blood the heart is pumping and the diameter of the arteries the blood is moving through. Generally, the more blood that's pumped and the narrower the artery, the higher the pressure is.\n\n**How Is Blood Pressure Measured?**\n\nBlood pressure is measured both as the heart contracts, which is called systole, and as it relaxes, which is called diastole. Systolic blood pressure is measured when the heart ventricles contract. Diastolic blood pressure is measured when the heart ventricles relax.\n\n**What Is Considered Normal Blood Pressure?**\n\nA systolic pressure of 115 millimeters of mercury is considered normal, as is a diastolic pressure of 70. Commonly, this pressure would be stated as 115 over 70.\n\n**Can Stress Affect Blood Pressure?**\n\nStressful situations can temporarily cause blood pressure to rise. If a person has a consistent blood pressure reading of 140 over 90, he would be evaluated for high blood pressure.\n\n**What Are the Consequences of Untreated High Blood Pressure?**\n\nLeft untreated, high blood pressure can damage important organs, such as the brain and kidneys, as well as lead to a stroke.\n\n---\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\nThe force of blood on artery walls is called blood pressure.
