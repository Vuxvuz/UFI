    "content": "**Eucalyptus: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\nEucalyptus is a tree, and its leaves and oil have been consumed, chewed, and applied to the skin for many conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using eucalyptus for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: People often consume eucalyptus as a flavoring in small amounts in foods. It's possibly safe to take eucalyptol, a chemical that is found in eucalyptus oil, daily for up to 12 weeks.\n\nBut it is unsafe to take pure eucalyptus oil by mouth. Taking only 3.5 mL (less than one teaspoon) of the pure oil can be fatal. Eucalyptus oil can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Eucalyptus poisoning can cause stomach pain, dizziness, muscle weakness, feelings of suffocation, drowsiness, seizures, and coma.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: It's possibly unsafe to use pure eucalyptus oil. It can cause serious problems with the nervous system. There isn't enough reliable information to know if diluted eucalyptus oil is safe.\n\nWhen inhaled: There isn't enough reliable information to know if eucalyptus oil is safe when inhaled as aromatherapy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: People often consume eucalyptus as a flavoring in small amounts in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if eucalyptus oil is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nChildren: People often consume eucalyptus as a flavoring in small amounts in foods. But it is likely unsafe for children to take eucalyptus oil by mouth, apply it to the skin, or inhale it. There are reports of seizures and other nervous system side effects in infants and children who were exposed to eucalyptus oil.\n\nCross-allergenicity: Some people who are allergic to other essential oils might also be allergic to eucalyptus oil.\n\nSurgery: Since eucalyptus might affect blood sugar levels, there is concern that it might make blood sugar control difficult during and after surgery. Stop using eucalyptus at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nAmphetamines\nInhaling eucalyptol, a chemical found in eucalyptus oil, might reduce the levels of amphetamines in the blood. In theory, the effectiveness of amphetamines may be reduced in people who inhale eucalyptol.\n\nMedications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates)\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eucalyptus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\nMedications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) substrates)\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eucalyptus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\nMedications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates)\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eucalyptus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\nMedications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Eucalyptus might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\nMedications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)\nEucalyptus might lower blood sugar levels. Taking eucalyptus along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n\nPentobarbital (Nembutal)\nInhaling eucalyptol, a chemical found in eucalyptus oil, might reduce the amount of pentobarbital that reaches the brain. In theory, the effectiveness of pentobarbital may be reduced in people who inhale eucalyptol.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\nNot enough reliable information is available to say whether eucalyptus oil interacts with other herbs and supplements.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\nNot enough reliable information is available to say whether eucalyptus oil interacts with foods.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is it typically used?**\nEucalyptus oil can be inhaled, applied to the skin, or taken by mouth. However, due to its potential toxicity and side effects, it's recommended to consult a healthcare professional before using it.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\nNot available.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Methodology**\nReferences: Not available.\n\nNote: The cleaned output is formatted according to the provided guidelines, with bold headings, * for lists, and \\n\\n separating sections.\n\n---\n\n**Eucalyptus: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates)**\n\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver.

In theory, the effectiveness of pentobarbital may be reduced in people who inhale eucalyptol.\n\n**Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar**\n\nEucalyptus might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n\n**Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)-containing herbs and supplements**\n\nSome supplements contain PAs, dangerous chemicals that can harm the liver. Taking eucalyptus along with supplements that contain PAs might increase the chance of developing serious side effects, including liver damage and cancer. Examples of supplements containing PAs include alkanna, butterbur, coltsfoot, comfrey, and groundsel.\n\n**There are no known interactions with foods.**\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nThere isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of eucalyptus might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.\n\n**Other names**\n\nBlue Gum, Blue Mallee, Blue Mallee Oil, Eucalipto, Eucalypti Folium, Eucalyptol, Eucalyptol Oil, Eucalyptus blatter, Eucalyptus bicostata, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus cinereal, Eucalyptus dives, Eucalyptus Essential Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Eucalyptus fructicetorum, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus gunnii, Eucalyptus Leaf, Eucalyptus microcorys, Eucalyptus odorata, Eucalyptus Oil, Eucalyptus piperita, Eucalyptus polybractea, Eucalyptus pulverulenta, Eucalyptus radiata, Eucalyptus sideroxylon, Eucalyptus smithii, Fever Tree, Fieberbaumblatter, Gully Gum, Gully Gum Oil, Gum Tree, Huile Essentielle d'Eucalyptus, Huile d'Eucalyptol, Huile d'Eucalyptus, Red Gum, Stringy Bark Tree, Sugandhapatra, Tailapatra, Tallowweed, Tasmanian Blue Gum.\n\n**References**\n\nLee KW, Chang YY, Wu XF, et al.

    "content": "**Evaluating Health Information**\n\nYou can find health information easily, but finding reliable health information takes a little effort. Some sources are trustworthy, while others are not. It's essential to evaluate health information for yourself.\n\n**Two Key Steps**\n\n1. **Ask questions before trusting what you read or hear**: Be skeptical and don't rely on information without verifying its accuracy.\n2. **Discuss the information with your healthcare provider**: They can help you determine if the information is suitable for your needs.\n\n**Evaluating Health Information on the Internet**\n\nTo evaluate a website, ask:\n\n* Who runs the site?

    "content": "**Evaluating Internet Health Information Tutorial**\n\n**Welcome to the Evaluating Internet Health Information tutorial from the National Library of Medicine**\n\nUsing the internet to find health information is easier than ever. Sometimes it even finds its way to you when you aren't searching for it. For example, someone you know or follow on social media may share a link to online health content. Or they may share a photo or meme with health-related content. But how can you be sure the information is trustworthy? Health information that is false, not accurate, or misleading is known as misinformation.\n\n**The Problem of Misinformation**\n\nOften, we don't realize we're sharing misinformation. Misinformation can be many things. Sometimes it is out-of-date facts or research. It can also be memes that started as jokes but now people take them seriously. Sometimes it is content meant to grab your attention. But if you share a social media post without being sure the content is trustworthy, you could be spreading misinformation. Sharing misinformation can be dangerous and even harmful.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nYou might feel overwhelmed knowing that misinformation is out there, but don't worry! By the end of this tutorial, you will have the tools to help you identify trustworthy health information online.\n\nAs an example, imagine that your doctor just told you that you have high cholesterol. You want to learn more about it before your next doctor's appointment. So, you do an online search and find these two websites.\n\n**Evaluating Health Information**\n\nThis tutorial will take a closer look at these websites to show you how to uncover important clues about the quality of health information you might find online.\n\nWe'll explore three categories of questions to ask:\n\n* **Provider and Purpose**\n\t+ Who manages the site?\n\t+ Why have they created the site? What is their purpose?\n\t+ What do they want from you?\n\t+ Who is paying for the site? Does the site's information favor the sponsor?\n* **Information Quality**\n\t+ Is the information reviewed by experts?\n\t+ Where did the information come from?\n\t+ Does the site make claims that sound too good to be true?\n\t+ Is the information up to date?\n* **Privacy**\n\t+ Does the site ask for your personal information?\n\t+ If so, how will it be used?\n\nYou can usually find most of the answers on a website's main page or the \"About Us\" page.\n\nLet's look at the two sample websites for clues to help figure out if they are trustworthy.",

    "content": "**Ewing Sarcoma**\n\nEwing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that forms in the bone or soft tissue around it. It affects mostly teens and young adults.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEwing sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood and young adulthood. But it usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. It is more common in White children than in Black or Asian children.\n\nThe tumor may start anywhere in the body. Most often, it starts in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It can also develop in the skull or the flat bones of the trunk.\n\nThe tumor often spreads (metastasizes) to the lungs and other bones. At the time of diagnosis, spread is seen in about one third of children with Ewing sarcoma.\n\nIn rare cases, Ewing sarcoma occurs in adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere are few symptoms. The most common is pain and sometimes swelling at the site of the tumor.\n\nBecause the tumor weakens the bone, children may also break a bone at the site of the tumor after a minor injury.\n\nFever may also be present.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf a tumor is suspected, tests to locate the primary tumor and any spread (metastasis) often include:\n\n* Bone scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the chest\n* MRI of the tumor\n* X-ray of the tumor\n\nA biopsy of the tumor will be done. Different tests are done on this tissue to help determine how aggressive the cancer is and what treatment may be best.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment often includes a combination of:\n\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Surgery to remove the primary tumor\n\nTreatment depends on the following:\n\n* Stage of the cancer\n* Age and sex of the person\n* Results of the tests on the biopsy sample\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBefore treatment, outlook depends on:\n\n* Whether the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body\n* Where in the body the tumor started\n* How large the tumor is when it's diagnosed\n* Whether the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in the blood is higher than normal\n* Whether the tumor has certain gene changes\n* Whether the child is younger than 15 years\n* Child's sex\n* Whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma\n* Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has come back\n\nThe best chance for cure is with a combination of treatments that includes chemotherapy plus radiation or surgery.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe treatments needed to fight this disease may have many complications. Discuss these with your health care provider.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your child has any of the symptoms of Ewing sarcoma. An early diagnosis can increase the possibility of a favorable outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Ewing Sarcoma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nEwing sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood and young adulthood.

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBefore treatment, outlook depends on:\n\n*   Whether the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body\n*   Where in the body the tumor started\n*   How large the tumor is when it's diagnosed\n*   Whether the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in the blood is higher than normal\n*   Whether the tumor has certain gene changes\n*   Whether the child is younger than 15 years\n*   Child's sex\n*   Whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma\n*   Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has come back\n\nThe best chance for cure is with a combination of treatments that includes chemotherapy plus radiation or surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe treatments needed to fight this disease may have many complications. Discuss these with your health care provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your child has any of the symptoms of Ewing sarcoma.

    "content": "**Exagamglogene Autotemcel**\n\n**What is Exagamglogene Autotemcel?**\n\nExagamglogene autotemcel is a medication used in adults and children 12 years of age and older who have sickle cell disease (SCD) with a history of vaso-occlusive events or with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.\n\n**How Does Exagamglogene Autotemcel Work?**\n\nExagamglogene autotemcel is in a class of medications called autologous cellular immunotherapy. It works by helping the body to make hemoglobin, which helps keep cells from sickling in SCD and produces more healthy hemoglobin in TDT patients.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nExagamglogene autotemcel comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or infusion center. Before receiving the dose, other chemotherapy medications are administered to prepare the body for exagamglogene autotemcel.\n\n**Preparation and Administration**\n\nA sample of blood stem cells is taken at a hospital or treatment center using mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated. The sample is sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of exagamglogene autotemcel injection, which may take up to 6 months after collection.\n\n**Side Effects and Monitoring**\n\nAfter receiving the dose, patients must stay in the hospital for about 4-6 weeks to monitor for any side effects. Patients should talk to their doctor about how to prepare for mobilization and apheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.\n\nNote: This cleaned output maintains the original structure and medical information while removing code blocks, ads, disclaimers, standalone URLs, and formatting errors.\n\n---\n\n**Exagamglogene Autotemcel: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving exagamglogene autotemcel, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to exagamglogene autotemcel, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in exagamglogene autotemcel injection. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with exagamglogene autotemcel: iron chelators. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking lovotibeglogene autotemcel.

    "content": "**Excessive Carrying Angle of the Elbow**\n\nWhen your arms are held out at your sides and your palms are facing forward, your forearm and hands should normally point about 5 to 15 degrees away from your body. This is the normal \"carrying angle\" of the elbow. This angle allows your forearms to clear your hips when you swing your arms, such as during walking or other activities. It is also important when carrying objects.\n\n**Causes of Excessive Carrying Angle**\n\nCertain fractures of the elbow can increase the carrying angle of the elbow, causing the arms to stick out too much from the body. This is called an excessive carrying angle.\n\nOther fractures of the elbow can decrease the carrying angle of the elbow. If the angle is decreased, the arm points toward the body. This is known as a \"gunstock deformity.\"\n\n**Importance of Comparison**\n\nBecause the carrying angle varies from person to person, it is important to compare one elbow with the other when evaluating a problem with the carrying angle.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nElbow carrying angle - excessive; Cubitus valgus\n\n**References**\n\nLazinski M, Lazinski M, Fedorczyk JM.

    "content": "**Excessive or Unwanted Hair in Women**\n\nMost of the time, women have fine hair above their lips and on their chin, chest, abdomen, or back. The growth of coarse dark hair in these areas (more typical of male-pattern hair growth) is called hirsutism.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWomen normally produce low levels of male hormones (androgens). If your body makes too much of this hormone, you may have unwanted hair growth.\n\nIn most cases, the exact cause is never known. The condition often runs in families.\n\nA common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS and other hormone conditions that cause unwanted hair growth may also have:\n\n* Acne\n* Problems with menstrual periods\n* Trouble losing weight\n* Diabetes\n\nIf these symptoms start suddenly, you may have a tumor that releases male hormones.\n\nOther, less common causes of unwanted hair growth may include:\n\n* Thyroid disorders\n* Tumor or cancer of the adrenal gland\n* Tumor or cancer of the ovary\n* Cushing syndrome\n* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n* Hyperthecosis -- a condition in which the ovaries produce too much male hormones\n\nUse of certain medicines may also be the cause of unwanted hair growth, including:\n\n* Testosterone\n* Danazol\n* Anabolic steroids\n* DHEA\n* Glucocorticoids\n* Cyclosporine\n* Minoxidil\n* Phenytoin\n\nFemale body builders may take male hormones (anabolic steroids), which may result in excessive hair growth.\n\nIn rare cases, women with hirsutism have normal levels of male hormones, and the specific cause of the unwanted hair growth cannot be identified.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of this condition is the presence of coarse dark hair in areas that are sensitive to male hormones. These areas include:\n\n* Chin and upper lip\n* Chest and upper abdomen\n* Back and buttocks\n* Inner thigh\n\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done may include any of the following:\n\n* Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\n* Prolactin\n* Testosterone test\n* DHEA-sulfate test\n* Pelvic ultrasound (if virilization, or development of male characteristics, is present)\n* CT scan or MRI (if virilization is present)\n* 17-hydroxyprogesterone blood test\n* ACTH stimulation test\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHirsutism is generally a long-term problem. There are many ways to remove or treat unwanted hair. Some treatment effects last longer than others.\n\nMedicines -- Drugs such as birth control pills, anti-androgen medicines, and spironolactone are a few options for some women.\nElectrolysis -- Electrical current is used to permanently damage individual hair follicles so they do not grow back. This method is expensive, and multiple treatments are needed. Swelling, scarring, and redness of the skin may occur.\nLaser energy directed at the dark color (melanin) in the hairs -- This method is best for a large area of very dark hair. It does not work on blond or red hair.\n\nTemporary options include:\n\n* Shaving\n* Chemicals\n* Plucking\n* Waxing\n\nFor women who are overweight, weight loss may be able to help reduce hair growth.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHair follicles grow for about 6 months before falling out. Therefore, it takes many months of taking medicine before you will notice a decrease in hair growth.\n\nMany women get good results with temporary steps to remove hair or lighten it.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nMost of the time, hirsutism does not cause health problems. But many women find it bothersome or embarrassing.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n* The hair grows rapidly.\n* You also have male features such as acne, deepening voice, increased muscle mass, male pattern thinning of your hair, increasing size of the clitoris, and decreased breast size.\n* You are concerned that medicine you are taking may be increasing the growth of unwanted hair.\n\n---\n\n**Excessive or Unwanted Hair in Women**\n\n**What is Hirsutism?**\n\nHirsutism is the growth of coarse dark hair in areas that are sensitive to male hormones, such as the chin and upper lip, chest and upper abdomen, back and buttocks, and inner thigh.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Low levels of male hormones (androgens) in women\n*   Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n*   Hormone conditions that cause unwanted hair growth\n*   Tumors that release male hormones\n*   Thyroid disorders\n*   Adrenal gland tumors or cancer\n*   Ovarian tumors or cancer\n*   Cushing syndrome\n*   Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n*   Hyperthecosis - a condition in which the ovaries produce too much male hormones\n*   Use of certain medicines, such as testosterone, danazol, anabolic steroids, DHEA, glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, minoxidil, and phenytoin\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of this condition is the presence of coarse dark hair in areas that are sensitive to male hormones.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\n*   Prolactin\n*   Testosterone test\n*   DHEA-sulfate test\n*   Pelvic ultrasound (if virilization, or development of male characteristics, is present)\n*   CT scan or MRI (if virilization is present)\n*   17-hydroxyprogesterone blood test\n*   ACTH stimulation test\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHirsutism is generally a long-term problem.

    "content": "**Exchange Transfusion**\n\nExchange transfusion is a potentially life-saving procedure that is done to counteract the effects of serious jaundice or changes in the blood due to diseases such as sickle cell anemia.\n\n**Description**\n\nAn exchange transfusion requires that the person's blood be removed and replaced. In most cases, this involves placing one or more thin tubes, called catheters, into a blood vessel. The exchange transfusion is done in cycles, each one most often lasts a few minutes.\n\nThe person's blood is slowly withdrawn (most often about 5 to 20 mL at a time, depending on the person's size and the severity of illness). An equal amount of fresh, prewarmed blood or plasma flows into the person's body. This cycle is repeated until the correct volume of blood has been replaced.\n\nAfter the exchange transfusion, catheters may be left in place in case the procedure needs to be repeated.\n\nIn diseases such as sickle cell anemia, blood is removed and replaced with donor blood.\n\nIn conditions such as neonatal polycythemia, a specific amount of the child's blood is removed and replaced with a normal saline solution, plasma (the clear liquid part of blood), or albumin (a normal blood protein). This decreases the total number of red blood cells in the body and makes it easier for blood to flow through the body.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nAn exchange transfusion may be needed to treat the following conditions:\n\n* Dangerously high red blood cell count in a newborn (neonatal polycythemia)\n* Rh-induced hemolytic disease of the newborn\n* Severe disturbances in body chemistry\n* Severe newborn jaundice that does not respond to phototherapy with bili lights\n* Severe sickle cell crisis\n* Toxic effects of certain drugs\n\n**Risks**\n\nGeneral risks are the same as with any transfusion. Other possible complications include:\n\n* Blood clots\n* Changes in blood chemistry (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, change in acid-base balance in the blood)\n* Heart and lung problems\n* Infection (very low risk due to careful screening of blood)\n* Shock if not enough blood is replaced\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe person may need to be monitored for several days in the hospital after the transfusion. The length of stay depends on what condition the exchange transfusion was performed to treat.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHemolytic disease - exchange transfusion\n\n---\n\n**Exchange Transfusion**\n\nAn exchange transfusion is a potentially life-saving procedure that is done to counteract the effects of serious jaundice or changes in the blood due to diseases such as sickle cell anemia.\n\n**Description**\n\nAn exchange transfusion requires that the person's blood be removed and replaced.

The goal of exchange transfusion is to remove the abnormal bilirubin and replace it with healthy red blood cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does exchange transfusion work?**\n\nDuring an exchange transfusion, a portion of the baby's blood is removed and replaced with donor blood that has been washed to remove bilirubin. The procedure is typically performed in a hospital setting by a team of experienced healthcare providers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of exchange transfusion?**\n\nExchange transfusion can help reduce the risk of kernicterus, a serious condition caused by high levels of bilirubin in the blood. By removing abnormal bilirubin and replacing it with healthy red blood cells, exchange transfusion can help prevent long-term damage to the baby's brain and other organs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is at risk for exchange transfusion?**\n\nNewborns with severe jaundice caused by HDN or other conditions that lead to an excessive breakdown of red blood cells may require exchange transfusion. The procedure is typically performed in a hospital setting by a team of experienced healthcare providers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I learn more about exchange transfusion?**\n\nIf you have concerns about your newborn's jaundice or are interested in learning more about exchange transfusion, consider speaking with your pediatrician or a qualified healthcare provider. They can provide personalized guidance and support to help ensure the best possible outcome for your baby.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Blood Transfusion and Donation\n*   Common Infant and Newborn Problems\n*   Jaundice\n*   Uncommon Infant and Newborn Problems",

    "content": "**Exenatide Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nExenatide injection is used with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in certain people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not make or use insulin normally). Exenatide is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy.\n\nOver time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nExenatide injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin).

Here are some ideas:\n\n*   Walk or bike to school\n*   Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n*   Ride a bike with family or friends\n*   Take the dog for a walk\n*   Play outside - shoot some hoops, kick around a ball, or play tag\n*   Dance to music\n*   Skate, ice-skate, skateboard, or roller-skate\n*   Do household chores like sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, or loading the dishwasher\n*   Take a family walk or hike\n*   Play computer games that get you moving\n*   Rake leaves and jump in the piles (before bagging them up)\n*   Mow the lawn\n*   Weed the garden\n\nThe key is to find activities that your child enjoys and can stick with. And don't worry if they don't like traditional sports - there are plenty of other ways to get moving.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Exercise and Activity for Weight Loss**\n\nAn active lifestyle and exercise routine, along with eating healthy foods in limited amounts, is the best way to start trying to lose weight.\n\n**The Weight-Loss Formula**\n\nCalories used in exercise and daily living > calories eaten = weight loss.\n\nThis means that to lose weight, the number of calories you burn by daily living and exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink. Even if you work out a lot, if you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.\n\nAnother way to look at this is that a woman aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintain her normal weight. A man aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 2,200 calories to maintain his normal weight.\n\n**Calories Burned per Hour of Exercise**\n\n* Light activity: 240-300 calories\n* Moderate activity: 370-460 calories\n* Vigorous activity: 580-730 calories\n\n**Benefits of Weight Loss**\n\nAn exercise weight-loss program that works needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a specific goal. Your goal might be managing a health condition, reducing stress, improving your stamina, or being able to buy clothes in a smaller size.\n\nYou may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do, you will begin to notice other benefits. Improved sleep and self-esteem might be a couple of them. Other benefits you may not notice include increased bone and muscle strength and a lower risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nYou do not need to join a gym to get exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a slow 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start. Then make it more brisk over time. Add time and frequency if you can.\n\nYou can also try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.\n\n**Build Physical Activity into Your Regular Routine**\n\nSimple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.\n\n* Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n* Walk down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an e-mail\n* Add a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch\n* Park at the far end of the parking lot or down the street when running errands\n* Try taking on common chores such as vacuuming, washing a car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow\n\n**Reduce Your Screen Time**\n\nSedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight.\n\nSome ways to decrease the harm of too much screen time are:\n\n* Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch and turn off the TV when they are over\n* Don't keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead.\n* Don't eat while you are watching TV.\n* Before you turn on the TV, take your dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.\n\n**How Much Exercise Do You Need?**\n\nAim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week or more. Do moderate-intensity aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise 30 minutes 5 days a week or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.\n\nYou do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Exercise and Activity for Weight Loss**\n\nLosing weight is not just about cutting calories, but also about increasing your physical activity. The more you move, the more calories you'll burn, and the easier it will be to lose weight.\n\n**The Weight-Loss Formula**\n\nCalories used in exercise and daily living > calories eaten = weight loss.\n\nThis means that to lose weight, the number of calories you burn by daily living and exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink.

If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a slow 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start. Then make it more brisk over time. Add time and frequency if you can.\n\n**Build Physical Activity into Your Regular Routine**\n\nSimple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.\n\n*   At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an e-mail, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.\n*   When you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street. Even better, try walking to the store.\n*   At home, try taking on common chores such as vacuuming, washing a car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow.\n*   If you ride the bus, get off the bus one or more stops before your usual stop and walk the rest of the way.\n\n**Reduce Your Screen Time**\n\nSedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behavior is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices.\n\nSome ways to decrease the harm of too much screen time are:\n\n*   Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch and turn off the TV when they are over.\n*   Don't keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen to the radio.\n*   Don't eat while you are watching TV.\n*   Before you turn on the TV, take your dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.\n*   Find activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening class.\n*   Work out on an exercise mat while you watch TV. You will burn calories.\n*   Ride a stationary bike or use a treadmill while you watch TV.\n\nIf you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.\n\n---\n\n**Exercise and Activity for Weight Loss**\n\nIf you want to lose weight, your daily living and exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink. Even if you work out a lot, if you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.\n\nFor example, a woman aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintain her normal weight. A man aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 2,200 calories to maintain his normal weight.\n\nHere's how many calories you can burn through different activities:\n\n* Light activity (such as cleaning house or playing baseball/golf): 240-300 calories per hour\n* Moderate activity (such as a brisk walk, gardening, biking, or dancing): 370-460 calories per hour\n* Vigorous activity (such as jogging, playing football, or swimming laps): 580-730 calories per hour\n* Very vigorous activity (such as running, playing racquetball, or skiing): 740-920 calories per hour\n\nEven if you don't change the amount of calories in your diet, but you do add activity to your daily life, you'll lose weight or gain less weight.\n\n**Benefits of Weight Loss**\n\nAn exercise weight-loss program that works needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a specific goal. Your goal might be managing a health condition, reducing stress, improving your stamina, or being able to buy clothes in a smaller size. Your exercise program may also be a way for you to be with other people. Exercise classes or exercising with a buddy are both good social outlets.\n\nYou may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do, you will begin to notice other benefits. Improved sleep and self-esteem might be a couple of them. Other benefits you may not notice include increased bone and muscle strength and a lower risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nYou do not need to join a gym to get exercise.

Add time and frequency if you can.\n\nYou can also try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.\n\nThe most important thing is that you do exercises that you enjoy and are practical so that it is easier to sustain what you are doing.\n\n**Build Physical Activity into Your Regular Routine**\n\nSimple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.\n\nAt work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an e-mail, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.\n\nWhen you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street.

All of these activities are called \"screen time.\"\n\nSome ways to decrease the harm of too much screen time are:\n\n* Limit your TV watching to less than 2 hours a day\n* Take regular breaks from your computer and do something else for at least 10 minutes\n* Try to do things that get you moving, such as stretching or taking a short walk\n\n---\n\n**Exercise and Activity for Weight Loss**\n\n**Reduce Your Screen Time**\n\nDecreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behavior is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices.\n\nSome ways to decrease the harm of too much screen time are:\n\n* Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch and turn off the TV when they are over.\n* Don't keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen to the radio.\n* Don't eat while you are watching TV.\n* Before you turn on the TV, take your dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.\n* Find activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening class.\n* Work out on an exercise mat while you watch TV. You will burn calories.\n* Ride a stationary bike or use a treadmill while you watch TV.\n\nIf you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.\n\n**How Much Exercise Do You Need?**\n\nAim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week or more. Do moderate-intensity aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise 30 minutes 5 days a week or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.\n\nYou do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.\n\nAs you become more fit, you can challenge yourself by increasing the intensity of your exercise by going from light activity to moderate activity. You can also increase the amount of time you exercise.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nWeight loss - activity; Weight loss - exercise; Obesity - activity\n\n---\n\n**Exercise and Activity for Weight Loss**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Importance of Regular Exercise**\n\nRegular exercise is essential for weight loss and overall health. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Benefit of regular exercise**: Reduces the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.\n*   **Exercise 30 minutes a day**: Aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day can have significant health benefits.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Citing This Page**\n\nIf you'd like to cite this page in your research or writing, please use the following format:\n\nBrodkey, F.

Staying active will allow you to continue being independent and the lifestyle you enjoy. The right kinds of regular exercise can also reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and falls.\n\n**Information**\n\nYou don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to see benefits. Moving your body just 30 minutes a day is enough to improve your health.\n\nAn effective exercise program needs to be fun and helps to keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:\n\n* Manage a health condition\n* Reduce stress\n* Improve your stamina\n* Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size\n\nYour exercise program may also be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.\n\nYou may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.\n\nExercise and physical activity can also:\n\n* Improve or maintain your strength and fitness\n* Make it easier to do the things you want to do\n* Help your balance and walking\n* Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood\n* Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older\n* Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis\n\nAlways talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program. Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.\n\n**Exercises**\n\nExercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:\n\n* **AEROBIC EXERCISE**\n\t+ Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.\n\t+ Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball\n\t+ Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming\n* **MUSCLE STRENGTH**\n\t+ Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:\n\t\t- Lifting weights or using a resistance band\n\t\t- Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden\n* **BALANCE EXERCISES**\n\t+ Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.\n\t+ Balance exercises may include:\n\t\t- Standing on one foot\n\t\t- Walking heel-to-toe\n\t\t- Tai chi\n\t\t- Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf\n\t\t- Walking up and down the stairs\n* **STRETCHING**\n\t+ Stretching can help your body stay flexible.

Exercise helps build muscle mass and maintain flexibility, making everyday activities easier.\n*   **Better balance and coordination**: Balance exercises can help prevent falls, a significant concern for older adults.\n*   **Enhanced mental well-being**: Exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, promoting overall mental health.\n\n**Types of Exercises**\n\nExercise can be categorized into four main types:\n\n1.  **Aerobic exercise**: Increases breathing and heart rate, helping the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n2.  **Muscle strength**: Builds muscle mass, essential for daily activities like climbing stairs or carrying groceries.\n3.  **Balance exercises**: Improves balance and reduces the risk of falls.\n4.  **Stretching**: Helps maintain flexibility and range of motion.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nTo incorporate exercise into your lifestyle:\n\n*   Consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best exercises for your age and health status.\n*   Start with short, manageable sessions (30 minutes a day) and gradually increase duration and intensity.\n*   Find activities you enjoy, whether it's walking, yoga, or dancing. Exercise should be fun!\n\nBy embracing exercise as a natural part of aging, we can take control of our physical health and well-being. So, get moving and enjoy the benefits of regular exercise!",

You may feel better if you take a daily walk or follow a simple exercise routine a few times a week.\n\n**Benefits of Exercise**\n\nExercise helps decrease your chances of developing heart disease. It also keeps your bones healthy and strong.\n\n**Theories on Exercise and Immunity**\n\nWe do not know exactly if or how exercise increases your immunity to certain illnesses. There are several theories, but none have been proven. Some of these theories include:\n\n*   Physical activity may help flush bacteria out of the lungs and airways, reducing your chance of getting a cold, flu, or other illness.\n*   Exercise causes changes in antibodies and white blood cells (WBCs), which could detect illnesses earlier than they might have before. However, no one knows whether these changes help prevent infections.\n*   The brief rise in body temperature during and right after exercise may prevent bacteria from growing, helping the body fight infection better.\n*   Exercise slows down the release of stress hormones, which can increase the chance of illness.\n\n**Exercise is Good for You**\n\nExercise is good for you, but don't overdo it. People who already exercise should not exercise more just to increase their immunity. Heavy, long-term exercise (such as marathon running and intense gym training) could actually cause harm.\n\n**Moderate Exercise Program**\n\nStudies have shown that people who follow a moderately active lifestyle benefit most from starting (and sticking to) an exercise program. A moderate program can consist of:\n\n*   Bicycling with your children a few times a week\n*   Taking daily 20 to 30 minute walks\n*   Going to the gym every other day\n*   Playing golf regularly\n\n**Exercise Makes You Feel Healthier**\n\nExercise makes you feel healthier and more energetic. It can help you feel better about yourself. So go ahead, take that aerobics class or go for that walk.

Having the right footwear and clothing for your sport can give you both comfort and safety.\n\n**Thinking About Where and How You Exercise**\n\nThinking about where and how you exercise can help you choose the best clothing and shoes for your workouts. You can find many of the items you need at your local sporting goods, department, or discount stores or online.\n\n**Exercise Clothing Basics**\n\nWhen choosing exercise clothing, consider both fabric and fit.\n\n* **FABRICS**\n\t+ Choose fabrics that pull sweat away from your skin and dry quickly.\n\t+ Look for terms like moisture-wicking, Dri-fit, Coolmax, or Supplex.\n\t+ Wool is also a good choice to keep you cool, dry, and naturally odor-free.\n\t+ Some workout clothing is made with special antimicrobial solutions to combat odor from sweat.\n* **FIT**\n\t+ Make sure your clothing does not get in the way of your activity.\n\t+ You want to be able to move easily. Clothing should not catch on equipment or slow you down.\n\n**Clothing for Different Activities**\n\nYou can wear loose-fitting clothing for activities like:\n\n* Walking\n* Gentle yoga\n* Strength training\n* Basketball\n\nYou may want to wear form-fitting, stretchy clothing for activities like:\n\n* Running\n* Biking\n* Advanced yoga/Pilates\n* Swimming\n\n**Shoes to Match Your Activity**\n\nThe right shoes can make all the difference between feeling refreshed and having aching feet after your workout. It is worth the extra money you may need to spend for a good quality athletic shoe.\n\nMake sure your shoes fit your activity:\n\n* For running, buy running shoes.\n* For walking, choose stiffer shoes with good support and thick soles.\n* For strength or CrossFit training, choose training shoes with good support and rubber soles that are not too bulky.\n* If you are playing a sport like basketball or soccer, get shoes that match your activity.\n\n**When Exercising Outside**\n\nIf it is cold, dress in layers. Wear a fitted layer that wicks sweat away. Add a warmer layer, like a fleece jacket, on top. Wear gloves, a hat, and ear coverings if you need them. Take off the layers as you warm up.\n\nIn the rain or wind, wear an outer layer that protects you, like a windbreaker or nylon shell. Look for the words \"waterproof\" or \"water-resistant\" on the label. Ideally, this layer should also be breathable.\n\nIn the hot sun, wear light-colored clothing that dries fast. You can also buy clothing made to block out the harmful rays of the sun. These clothes come with a sun protection factor (SPF) label.\n\nWhen exercising in the evening or early morning, make sure your clothing has reflective parts so drivers can see you. You can also wear a reflective belt or vest.\n\nProtect yourself from Lyme disease and other tick- and mosquito-transmitted diseases if you exercise in wooded areas. Wear long sleeves and pants and tuck your pants into your socks. You can also use an insect repellant containing DEET or permethrin.\n\n---\n\n**Exercise Clothing Basics**\n\nWhen choosing exercise clothing, consider both fabric and fit.\n\n**FABRICS**\n\nTo help you stay comfortable and dry, choose fabrics that pull sweat away from your skin and dry quickly. Many quick-drying fabrics are synthetic and made of polyester or polypropylene. Look for terms like moisture-wicking, Dri-fit, Coolmax, or Supplex. Wool is also a good choice to keep you cool, dry, and naturally odor-free. Some workout clothing is made with special antimicrobial solutions to combat odor from sweat.\n\nSocks also come in quick-drying fabrics that absorb sweat. They can help you stay cool and dry, and avoid blisters. Choose socks made with a polyester blend or other special fabric.\n\nIn general, it is best to avoid cotton. Cotton absorbs sweat and does not dry quickly. And because it stays wet, it can make you cold in cooler weather. In warm weather, it is not as good as synthetic fabrics at keeping you cool and dry if you sweat a lot.\n\n**FIT**\n\nIn general, make sure your clothing does not get in the way of your activity. You want to be able to move easily. Clothing should not catch on equipment or slow you down.\n\nYou can wear loose-fitting clothing for activities like:\n\n* Walking\n* Gentle yoga\n* Strength training\n* Basketball\n\nYou may want to wear form-fitting, stretchy clothing for activities like:\n\n* Running\n* Biking\n* Advanced yoga/Pilates\n* Swimming\n\nYou may be able to wear a combination of loose and form-fitting clothing. For example, you might wear a moisture-wicking loose t-shirt or tank top with form-fitting workout shorts. You can choose what is comfortable for you. Just make sure the material you choose helps pull sweat away from your skin.\n\n**Shoes to Match Your Activity**\n\nThe right shoes can make all the difference between feeling refreshed and having aching feet after your workout. It is worth the extra money you may need to spend for a good quality athletic shoe.\n\nMake sure your shoes fit your activity.\n\nFor running, buy running shoes. They are light, flexible, and supportive for simple forward strides. Make sure they have good arch support and cushioning for impact. For walking, choose stiffer shoes with good support and thick soles.\nFor strength or CrossFit training, choose training shoes with good support and rubber soles that are not too bulky.\nIf you are playing a sport like basketball or soccer, get shoes that match your activity.\n\nEvery foot is different. You may have wide or narrow feet, low arches, trouble areas, or flat feet. Even in adults, foot size can change, so get fitted every year. Also, you will need to replace shoes when they start to feel uncomfortable or the soles look worn.\n\nYour shoe salesperson can help size and fit you for the right athletic shoes. Many stores will allow you to return shoes if you find they do not work for you.\n\n**When Exercising Outside**\n\nIf it is cold, dress in layers. Wear a fitted layer that wicks sweat away. Add a warmer layer, like a fleece jacket, on top. Wear gloves, a hat, and ear coverings if you need them. Take off the layers as you warm up. If you will be out running or walking, you may want to add a backpack. Then you can take off layers as you heat up, as well as carry a water bottle.\n\nIn the rain or wind, wear an outer layer that protects you, like a windbreaker or nylon shell.

Here are some tips:\n\n*   **Evening or Early Morning Exercise**: Make sure your clothing has reflective parts so drivers can see you. You can also wear a reflective belt or vest.\n*   **Lyme Disease and Other Tick- and Mosquito-Transmitted Diseases**: If you exercise in wooded areas, protect yourself by wearing long sleeves and pants, and tucking your pants into your socks. You can also use an insect repellant containing DEET or permethrin.\n*   **Cold Weather**: Dress in layers. Wear a fitted layer that wicks sweat away, and add a warmer layer like a fleece jacket on top. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and ear coverings if needed. Take off the layers as you warm up.\n*   **Rain or Wind**: Wear an outer layer that protects you, such as a windbreaker or nylon shell. Look for the words \"waterproof\" or \"water-resistant\" on the label. Ideally, this layer should also be breathable.\n*   **Hot Sun**: Wear light-colored clothing that dries fast. You can also buy clothing made to block out the harmful rays of the sun. These clothes come with a sun protection factor (SPF) label.\n\n**Proper Shoe Fit**\n\nTo prevent foot problems, make sure your shoes fit properly. Here are 10 points to consider:\n\n1.  The shoe should be half a size larger than your regular shoe size.\n2.  The toe box should be roomy enough for your toes to wiggle.\n3.

    "content": "**Exercise Stress Test**\n\nAn exercise stress test is used to measure the effect of exercise on your heart.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done at a medical center or health care provider's office. The technician will place 10 flat, sticky patches called electrodes on your chest. These patches are attached to an ECG monitor that follows the electrical activity of your heart during the test.\n\nYou will walk on a treadmill or pedal on an exercise bicycle. Slowly (about every 3 minutes), you will be asked to walk (or pedal) faster and on an incline or with more resistance. It is like walking fast or jogging up a hill.\n\nWhile you exercise, the activity of your heart is measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Your blood pressure readings are also taken.\n\nThe test continues until:\n\n* You reach a target heart rate.\n* You develop chest pain or a change in your blood pressure that is concerning.\n* ECG changes suggest that your heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen.\n* You are too tired or have other symptoms, such as leg pain, that keep you from continuing.\n\nYou will be monitored for 10 to 15 minutes after exercising, or until your heart rate returns to baseline. The total time of the test is around 60 minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nWear comfortable shoes and loose clothing to allow you to exercise.\n\nAsk your provider if you should take any of your regular medicines on the day of the test. Some medicines may interfere with test results. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\nTell your provider if you are taking sildenafil citrate (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) and have taken a dose within the past 24 to 48 hours.\n\nYou must not eat, smoke, or drink beverages containing caffeine or alcohol for 3 hours (or more) before the test. In most cases, you will be asked to avoid caffeine or caffeine-like substances for 24 hours before the test. This includes:\n\n* Tea and coffee\n* All sodas, even ones that are labeled caffeine-free\n* Chocolates\n* Certain pain relievers that contain caffeine\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nElectrodes (conductive patches) will be placed on your chest to record the heart's activity. The preparation of the electrode sites on your chest may produce a mild burning or stinging sensation.\n\nThe blood pressure cuff on your arm will be inflated every few minutes. This produces a squeezing sensation that may feel tight. Baseline measurements of heart rate and blood pressure will be taken before exercise starts.\n\nYou will start walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The pace and incline of the treadmill (or the pedaling resistance) will slowly be increased.\n\nSometimes, people experience some of the following symptoms during the test:\n\n* Chest discomfort\n* Dizziness\n* Palpitations\n* Shortness of breath\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nReasons why an exercise stress test may be performed include:\n\n* You are having chest pain (to check for coronary artery disease, narrowing of the arteries that feed the heart muscle).\n* Your angina is getting worse or is happening more often.\n* You have had a heart attack.\n* You have had angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.\n* You are going to start an exercise program and you have heart disease or certain risk factors, such as diabetes.\n* To identify heart rhythm changes that may occur during exercise.\n* To further test for a heart valve problem (such as aortic valve or mitral valve stenosis).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal test will most often mean that you were able to exercise as long as or longer than most people of your age and sex. You also did not have symptoms or concerning changes in blood pressure or your ECG.\n\nThe meaning of your test results depends on the reason for the test, your age, and your history of heart and other medical problems.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms during exercise\n* Changes in your ECG that may mean there is a blockage in the arteries that supply your heart (coronary artery disease)\n\nWhen you have an abnormal exercise stress test, you may have other tests performed on your heart such as:\n\n* Cardiac catheterization\n* Nuclear stress test\n* Stress echocardiography\n\n**Risks**\n\nStress tests are generally safe. Some people may have chest pain or may faint or collapse.

    "content": "**Exercise, Lifestyle, and Your Bones**\n\nOsteoporosis, or weak bones, is a disease that causes bones to become brittle and more likely to fracture (break). With osteoporosis, the bones lose density. Bone density is the amount of calcified bone tissue in your bones.\n\nA diagnosis of osteoporosis means you are at risk for bone fractures even with everyday activities or minor accidents or falls.\n\n**Why Exercise?**\n\nMake exercise a regular part of your life. It helps keep your bones strong and lower your risk of osteoporosis and fractures as you get older.\n\nBefore you begin an exercise program, talk with your health care provider if:\n\n* You are 50 years of age or older\n* You have not been active for a while\n* You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or any other health condition\n\n**How Much and What Type of Exercise?**\n\nTo build up bone density, the exercise must make your muscles pull on your bones. These are called weight-bearing exercises. Some of them are:\n\n* Brisk walks, jogging, playing tennis, dancing, or other weight-bearing activities such as aerobics and other sports\n* Careful weight training, using weight machines or free weights\n\nWeight-bearing exercises also:\n\n* Increase bone density even in young people\n* Help preserve bone density in women who are approaching menopause\n\nTo protect your bones, do weight-bearing exercises 3 or more days a week for a total of over 90 minutes a week.\n\nIf you are older, check with your provider before doing high-impact aerobics, such as step aerobics. This type of exercise may increase your risk for fractures if you have osteoporosis.\n\nLow-impact exercises, like yoga and tai chi, do not help bone density very much. But they can improve your balance and lower your risk of falling and breaking a bone. And, even though they are good for your heart, swimming and biking do not increase bone density.\n\n**Other Lifestyle Changes to Help Your Bones**\n\nIf you smoke, quit. Also limit how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol can damage your bones and raise your risk of falling and breaking a bone.\n\nIf you do not get enough calcium, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium from the foods you eat, your body may not make enough new bone. Talk with your provider about calcium and your bones.\n\nVitamin D helps your body absorb enough calcium.\n\nAsk your provider if you should take a vitamin D supplement.\nYou may need more vitamin D during the winter or if you need to avoid sun exposure to prevent skin cancer.\nAsk your provider about how much sun is safe for you.\n\n---\n\n**Exercise, Lifestyle, and Your Bones**\n\n**What is Osteoporosis?**\n\nOsteoporosis, or weak bones, is a disease that causes bones to become brittle and more likely to fracture (break). With osteoporosis, the bones lose density. Bone density is the amount of calcified bone tissue in your bones.\n\nA diagnosis of osteoporosis means you are at risk for bone fractures even with everyday activities or minor accidents or falls.\n\n**Exercise Plays a Key Role**\n\nExercise plays a key role in preserving bone density as you age.\n\n**Why Exercise?**\n\nMake exercise a regular part of your life. It helps keep your bones strong and lower your risk of osteoporosis and fractures as you get older.\n\nBefore you begin an exercise program, talk with your health care provider if:\n\n* You are 50 years of age or older\n* You have not been active for a while\n* You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or any other health condition\n\n**How Much and What Type of Exercise?**\n\nTo build up bone density, the exercise must make your muscles pull on your bones. These are called weight-bearing exercises. Some of them are:\n\n* Brisk walks, jogging, playing tennis, dancing, or other weight-bearing activities such as aerobics and other sports\n* Careful weight training, using weight machines or free weights\n\nWeight-bearing exercises also:\n\n* Increase bone density even in young people\n* Help preserve bone density in women who are approaching menopause\n\nTo protect your bones, do weight-bearing exercises 3 or more days a week for a total of over 90 minutes a week.\n\nIf you are older, check with your provider before doing high-impact aerobics, such as step aerobics. This type of exercise may increase your risk for fractures if you have osteoporosis.\n\nLow-impact exercises, like yoga and tai chi, do not help bone density very much. But they can improve your balance and lower your risk of falling and breaking a bone. And, even though they are good for your heart, swimming and biking do not increase bone density.\n\n**Other Lifestyle Changes to Help Your Bones**\n\nIf you smoke, quit. Also limit how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol can damage your bones and raise your risk of falling and breaking a bone.\n\nIf you do not get enough calcium, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium from the foods you eat, your body may not make enough new bone. Talk with your provider about calcium and your bones.\n\nVitamin D helps your body absorb enough calcium.\n\nAsk your provider if you should take a vitamin D supplement. You may need more vitamin D during the winter or if you need to avoid sun exposure to prevent skin cancer. Ask your provider about how much sun is safe for you.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOsteoporosis - exercise; Low bone density - exercise; Osteopenia - exercise\n\n---\n\n**Exercise, Lifestyle, and Your Bones**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Osteoporosis with Exercise and Lifestyle Changes**\n\nRegular exercise, a healthy diet, and not smoking can help prevent osteoporosis. Exercise helps build strong bones by stimulating bone growth and density. Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking or running, are particularly effective in building strong bones.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Importance of Exercise in Preventing Osteoporosis**\n\nExercise plays a crucial role in preventing osteoporosis. It helps build strong bones by stimulating bone growth and density. Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking or running, are particularly effective in building strong bones.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Lifestyle Changes to Prevent Osteoporosis**\n\nIn addition to exercise, making healthy lifestyle changes can also help prevent osteoporosis. A healthy diet that includes calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products and leafy greens, is essential for maintaining strong bones. Not smoking is also crucial, as smoking can weaken bones and increase the risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Benefits of Exercise\n*   Exercise and Physical Fitness\n*   How Much Exercise Do I Need?\n*   Osteoporosis",

    "content": "**Exercise-induced Asthma**\n\nSometimes exercise triggers asthma symptoms. This is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). In the past, this was called exercise-induced asthma. Exercise does not cause asthma, but it can cause airways to constrict (narrow). Most people with asthma have EIB, but not everyone with EIB has asthma.\n\n**Symptoms of EIB**\n\nThe symptoms of EIB are coughing, wheezing, a feeling of tightness in your chest, or shortness of breath. Most times, these symptoms start soon after you stop exercising. Some people may have symptoms after they start exercising.\n\n**Be Careful Where and When You Exercise**\n\nHaving asthma symptoms when you exercise does not mean you cannot or should not exercise. But be aware of your EIB triggers.\n\n* Cold or dry air may trigger asthma symptoms. If you do exercise in cold or dry air:\n\t+ Breathe through your nose.\n\t+ Wear a scarf or mask over your mouth.\n* Do not exercise when the air is polluted. Avoid exercising near fields or lawns that have just been mowed.\n* Warm up before you exercise, and cool down afterward:\n\t+ To warm up, walk or do your exercise activity slowly before you speed up.\n\t+ The longer you warm up, the better.\n\t+ To cool down, walk or do your exercise activity slowly for several minutes.\n\n**Some Kinds of Exercise May Be Less Likely to Trigger Asthma Symptoms**\n\n* Swimming is a good sport for people with EIB. The warm, moist air helps keep asthma symptoms away.\n* Football, baseball, and other sports with periods when you do not move fast are less likely to trigger your asthma symptoms.\n* Activities that keep you moving fast all the time are more likely to trigger asthma symptoms, such as running, basketball, or soccer.\n\n**Use Your Asthma Medicine Before You Exercise**\n\nTake your short-acting, or quick-relief, inhaled medicines before you exercise.\n\n* Take them 10 to 15 minutes before exercise.\n* They can help for up to 4 hours.\n* Long-acting, inhaled medicines may also help.\n* Use them at least 30 minutes before exercise.\n* They can help for up to 12 hours. Children can take this medicine before school, and it will help for the whole day.\n* Be aware that using this kind of medicine every day before exercise may make it less effective over time.\n\nFollow your health care provider's advice on which medicines to use and when.\n\n---\n\n**Exercise-induced asthma**\n\n**What is exercise-induced asthma?**\n\nExercise-induced asthma, also known as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), is a condition where the airways constrict or narrow during physical activity, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\n**Understanding EIB**\n\nMost people with asthma have EIB, but not everyone with EIB has asthma.

This can lead to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of exercise-induced asthma are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to an overactive immune response to exercise. Certain factors may increase the risk of developing EIB, including:\n\n* Family history of asthma or allergies\n* Personal history of asthma or allergies\n* Participation in sports that involve high-intensity exercise, such as running or cycling\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of exercise-induced asthma can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Wheezing or coughing during or after exercise\n* Shortness of breath or feeling like you can't catch your breath\n* Chest tightness or discomfort\n* Fatigue or feeling tired after exercise\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing exercise-induced asthma typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. These may include:\n\n* Spirometry: a test that measures lung function by assessing the amount and speed of air exhaled\n* Peak flow meter: a device that measures the fastest rate at which you can exhale\n* Exercise challenge test: a test where you exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike while your lung function is monitored\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for exercise-induced asthma typically involves a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and emergency preparedness. These may include:\n\n* Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce inflammation and prevent symptoms\n* Short-acting beta2 agonists (SABAs) to relieve symptoms during an attack\n* Long-acting beta2 agonists (LABAs) to control symptoms between attacks\n* Leukotriene modifiers to reduce inflammation and prevent symptoms\n* Mast cell stabilizers to prevent symptoms\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nIn addition to medication, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to help manage exercise-induced asthma. These may include:\n\n* Warmer weather: exercising outdoors in warmer weather may help alleviate symptoms\n* Avoiding triggers: identifying and avoiding triggers such as cold air or pollution may help reduce symptoms\n* Proper hydration: staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after exercise may help reduce symptoms\n\n**Emergency Preparedness**\n\nIn the event of an asthma attack, it's essential to have a plan in place for emergency treatment. This may include:\n\n* Carrying an inhaler with you at all times\n* Knowing your peak flow meter readings and being able to recognize when your symptoms are worsening\n* Having a backup plan in case your primary medication is not available\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nExercise-induced asthma is a condition that can be challenging to diagnose and manage, but with the right treatment and lifestyle changes, it's possible to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. If you suspect you may have exercise-induced asthma, be sure to discuss your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare provider.",

    "content": "**Exogenous Cushing Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nCushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is normally made in the adrenal glands.\n\nExogenous means caused by something outside the body. Exogenous Cushing syndrome occurs when a person takes man-made (synthetic) glucocorticoid medicines to treat a disease. These medicines act like cortisol in the body.\n\nGlucocorticoids are given for many diseases, such as lung diseases, skin conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, brain tumors, and joint disease. These medicines come in many forms, including pill, intravenous (IV), injection into a joint, enema, skin creams, inhalers, and eye drops.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with Cushing syndrome have:\n\n* Round, red, full face (moon face)\n* Slow growth rate (in children)\n* Weight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity)\n\nSkin changes that are often seen include:\n\n* Skin infections\n* Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae, on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts\n* Thin skin with easy bruising\n\nMuscle and bone changes include:\n\n* Backache, which occurs with routine activities\n* Bone pain or tenderness\n* Collection of fat between the shoulders and above the collar bone\n* Rib and spine fractures caused by thinning of the bones\n* Weak muscles, especially of the hips and shoulders\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and the medicines you are taking. Tell the provider about all medicines you have been taking for the past several months. Also, tell the provider about shots that you received at a provider's office.\n\nIf you use cortisone, prednisone, or other corticosteroids, the following test results may suggest exogenous Cushing syndrome:\n\n* Low ACTH level\n* Low cortisol level (or high cortisol level) in the blood or urine, depending on the medicine you are taking\n* Abnormal response to a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test\n* Higher than normal fasting glucose level\n* Low blood potassium level\n* Low bone density, as measured by bone mineral density test\n* High cholesterol, particularly high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\n\nA method called high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can show a high level of the suspected medicine in the urine.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is to decrease and eventually stop taking any corticosteroids. This may be done slowly or quickly, depending on why you are being treated with corticosteroid. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. Suddenly stopping corticosteroids after taking them for a long time (usually more than 2 weeks) can result in a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis.\n\nIf you cannot stop taking the medicine because of the disease it is treating (for example, you need glucocorticoid medicine to treat severe asthma), follow your provider's instructions on how to reduce the possibility of developing complications, including:\n\n* Treating high blood sugar with diet, oral medicines, or insulin.\n* Treating high cholesterol with diet or medicines.\n* Taking medicines to prevent bone loss. This can help reduce the risk for fractures if you develop osteoporosis.\n* Taking other medicines to decrease the amount of glucocorticoid medicine that you need.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSlowly tapering the medicine that is causing the condition can help reverse the effects of adrenal gland shrinkage (atrophy). This may take months to as long as a year. During this time, you may need to restart or increase the dosage of your steroids in times of stress or illness.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHealth problems that may result from exogenous Cushing syndrome include any of the following:\n\n* Low immune system, which may lead to frequent infections\n* Damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves due to untreated high blood sugar\n* Diabetes\n* High cholesterol levels\n* Increased risk for heart attack from untreated diabetes and high cholesterol\n* Increased risk for blood clots\n* Weak bones (osteoporosis) and increased risk for fractures\n\nThese complications can generally be prevented with proper treatment.\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact for an appointment with your provider if you are taking a corticosteroid and you develop symptoms of Cushing syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Exogenous Cushing Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol.

These devices have a drainable pouch attached to an adhesive wafer. This wafer has a hole cut through the center that fits over the anal opening (rectum).\n\nIf put on properly, a fecal incontinence device may stay in place for 24 hours. It is important to remove the pouch if any stool has leaked. Liquid stool can irritate the skin.\n\nAlways clean the skin and apply a new pouch if any leakage has occurred.\n\nThe device should be applied to clean, dry skin:\n\nYour health care provider may prescribe a protective skin barrier. This barrier is usually a paste. You apply the barrier to the skin before attaching the device. You can put the paste in the skin folds of the buttocks to prevent liquid stool from leaking through this area.\nSpread the buttocks apart, exposing the anus, and apply the wafer and pouch. It may help to have someone help you. The device should cover the skin with no gaps or creases.\nYou may need to trim the hair around the anus to help the wafer stick better to the skin.\n\nAn enterostomal therapy nurse or skin care nurse can provide you with a list of products that are available in your area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Urinary Incontinence Devices**\n\nUrine collection devices are mainly used by men with urinary incontinence. Women are generally treated with medicines and disposable undergarments. An alternative for some women may be a urinary wicking device.\n\nThe systems for men most often consist of a pouch or condom-like device. This device is securely placed around the penis. This is often called a condom catheter. A drainage tube is attached at the tip of the device to remove urine. This tube empties into a storage bag, which can be emptied directly into the toilet.\n\nCondom catheters are most effective when applied to a clean, dry penis. You may need to trim the hair around the pubic area for better grip of the device.\n\nYou must change the device at least every other day to protect the skin and prevent urinary tract infections. Make sure the condom device fits snugly, but not too tightly. Skin damage may occur if it is too tight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Condom catheter\n* Incontinence devices\n* Fecal collection devices\n* Urinary incontinence - devices\n* Fecal incontinence - devices\n* Stool incontinence - devices\n\n---\n\n**External incontinence devices**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional therapies for storage and emptying failure**\n\nIn cases where conservative management is not sufficient, additional therapies may be necessary to address storage and emptying failures. These can include:\n\n*   **Behavioral therapy**: Techniques such as bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and lifestyle modifications can help manage urinary incontinence.\n*   **Urethral devices**: Devices placed in the urethra, such as catheters or inserts, can provide support and prevent leakage.\n*   **Pelvic floor devices**: Devices that target the pelvic floor muscles, such as pessaries or artificial sphincters, can help restore continence.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conservative management of urinary incontinence**\n\nIn addition to behavioral therapy and urethral/pelvic devices, other conservative management options may include:\n\n*   **Pelvic floor exercises**: Strengthening the muscles that control urination through exercises like Kegels.\n*   **Dietary changes**: Modifying food intake to reduce bladder irritation or improve muscle function.\n*   **Lifestyle modifications**: Adjusting habits such as fluid intake, physical activity, and sleep patterns.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**External incontinence devices**\n\nFor individuals with severe urinary incontinence, external devices may be recommended.

Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is done in a hospital or specialized procedure unit. You will lie on an x-ray table. You may ask for some medicine to make you sleep and relax (sedative).\n\nDuring the test, your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be checked.\nThe health care provider will shave and clean an area, most often in the groin.\nA numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin over an artery.\nA needle is placed into that artery.\nA thin plastic tube called a catheter is passed through the needle into the artery. The doctor (usually a radiologist with special training in this technique) moves it into the area of the body being studied. The doctor can see live images of the area on a TV-like monitor, and uses them as a guide.\nDye flows through the catheter and into the arteries.\nX-ray images of the arteries are taken.\n\n**Certain Treatments Can Be Done During This Procedure**\n\nThese treatments include:\n\n* Dissolving a blood clot with medicine\n* Opening a partially blocked artery with a balloon\n* Placing a small tube called a stent into an artery to help hold it open\n\n**After the Test**\n\nAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The arm or leg where the needle was placed is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\n\nYou may be told to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin or other blood thinners for a short while before the test. Never stop taking any medicines unless told to do so by your provider.\n\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take, including those you bought without a prescription. This includes herbs and supplements.\n\nTell your provider if you:\n\n* Are pregnant\n* Are allergic to any medicines\n* Have ever had an allergic reaction to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\n* Have ever had any bleeding problems\n\n---\n\n**Extremity Angiography**\n\nThis test is used to see the arteries in the hands, arms, feet, or legs.

Seek immediate medical help if you have:\n\n*   Swelling\n*   Bleeding that doesn't go away\n*   Severe pain in an arm or leg\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a narrowed or blocked blood vessel in the arms, hands, legs, or feet.\n\nThe test may also be done to diagnose:\n\n*   Internal bleeding\n*   Swelling or inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis)\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe x-ray shows normal structures for your age.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn abnormal result is commonly due to narrowing and hardening of the arteries in the arms or legs from plaque buildup (hardening of the arteries) in the artery walls.\n\nThe x-ray may show a blockage in the vessels caused by:\n\n*   Aneurysms (abnormal widening or ballooning of part of an artery)\n*   Blood clots\n*   Other diseases of the arteries\n\nAbnormal results may also be due to:\n\n*   Inflammation of the blood vessels\n*   Injury to the blood vessels\n*   Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease)\n*   Takayasu disease\n\n---\n\n**Extremity Angiography**\n\n**Risks**\n\n*   Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n*   Damage to the blood vessel as the needle and catheter are inserted\n*   Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg\n*   Heart attack or stroke\n*   Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture\n*   Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site\n*   Kidney damage from the dye\n*   Injury to the blood vessels being tested\n*   Limb loss from problems with the procedure\n\nThere is low-level radiation exposure. However, most experts feel that the risk for most x-rays is low compared with benefits. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks for the x-ray.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Angiography of the extremity\n*   Peripheral angiography\n*   Lower extremity angiogram\n*   Peripheral angiogram\n*   Arteriography of the extremity\n*   PAD - angiography\n*   Peripheral artery disease - angiography\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Heart Association website.

It can occur in adults and children, although it is more common in adults.\n\n**Types of Eye Cancer**\n\nThere are two main types of eye cancer:\n\n*   **Retinoblastoma**: This is the most common type of eye cancer in children, accounting for about 80% of all cases. It starts in the cells of the retina and can spread to other parts of the body.\n*   **Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma**: This type of cancer affects the pigment-producing cells in the eye and is more common in adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of eye cancer can vary depending on the type and location of the tumor. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Vision problems**: Blurred vision, double vision, or loss of vision\n*   **Eye pain**: Pain or discomfort in the eye\n*   **Redness and swelling**: Redness and swelling of the eye or eyelid\n*   **Changes in the pupil**: Changes in the size or shape of the pupil\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing eye cancer typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory tests. Some common diagnostic tools include:\n\n*   **Dilating eye drops**: These are used to enlarge the pupils and allow for a more thorough examination of the inside of the eye.\n*   **Ultrasound**: This test uses sound waves to create images of the eye and detect any abnormalities.\n*   **Biopsy**: A sample of tissue is removed from the eye and examined under a microscope.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for eye cancer depends on the type and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Removing the tumor or affected part of the eye\n*   **Radiation therapy**: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells\n*   **Freezing or heat therapy**: Freezing or heating the tumor to destroy it\n*   **Laser therapy**: Using a laser to destroy the tumor\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent eye cancer, some risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing the disease. These include:\n\n*   **Family history**: Having a family history of eye cancer or other types of cancer\n*   **Genetic mutations**: Certain genetic mutations, such as those associated with retinoblastoma\n*   **Exposure to radiation**: Exposure to high levels of radiation, particularly in childhood\n\n**Living With Eye Cancer**\n\nLiving with eye cancer can be challenging, but there are ways to manage the disease and maintain quality of life. Some tips include:\n\n*   **Following treatment plans**: Adhering to treatment recommendations and attending follow-up appointments\n*   **Practicing self-care**: Engaging in activities that promote physical and emotional well-being\n*   **Seeking support**: Connecting with others who have experienced eye cancer or other types of cancer\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nEye cancer is a relatively rare disease, but it can have a significant impact on those affected. Some statistics include:\n\n*   **Incidence rates**: According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 2,500 new cases of eye cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States.\n*   **Survival rates**: The five-year survival rate for eye cancer is around 80%, although this can vary depending on the type and stage of the disease.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are continually working to improve our understanding of eye cancer and develop more effective treatments. Some ongoing clinical trials include:\n\n*   **Investigating new treatments**: Evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel therapies, such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy\n*   **Exploring combination therapies**: Investigating the use of multiple treatments in conjunction with one another\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nResearchers have published numerous studies on eye cancer, shedding light on various aspects of the disease. Some recent articles include:\n\n*   **Epidemiology of oculo-orbital tumours in Malawian children**: A 10-year review of cases and outcomes\n*   **Tumor immune microenvironment in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland**: An investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this rare type of cancer\n*   **Artificial intelligence to enhance the diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia**: A study exploring the potential of AI-powered diagnostic tools\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nIf you or a loved one has been diagnosed with eye cancer, it's essential to find a qualified healthcare provider who can provide guidance and support.

Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some eye diseases can lead to vision loss, so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible.\n\n**Eye Care Tips**\n\nThere are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:\n\n*   Eat a healthy, balanced diet.\n*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n*   Get regular exercise.\n*   Wear sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.\n*   Wear protective eye wear when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.\n*   Avoid smoking.\n*   Know your family medical history.\n*   Know your other risk factors.\n*   If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections.\n\n**Eye Tests and Exams**\n\nEveryone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.\n\n**Getting Comprehensive Dilated Eye Exams**\n\nThe exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.

Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some eye diseases can lead to vision loss, so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible. You should get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends it, or if you have any new vision problems. And just as it is important to keep your body healthy, you also need to keep your eyes healthy.\n\n**Eye Care Tips**\n\nThere are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:\n\n*   Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes.\n*   Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma.\n*   Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.\n*   Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.\n*   Wear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.\n*   Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve.\n*   Know your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.\n*   Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know your risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.\n*   If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.\n*   Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.\n\n**Eye Tests and Exams**\n\nEveryone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.\n\nGetting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.\n\nThe exam includes several tests:\n\n*   A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.\n*   A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances\n*   Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.\n*   Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina, macula, and optic nerve.\n\nIf you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.\n\nAt what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.\n\n---\n\n**Eye Care**\n\n**Start Here**\n\n*   **Overall Health**: Taking care of your overall health is crucial for maintaining good eye health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year.\n*   **Prevent Blindness America**: Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Eye Exam and Vision Testing Basics**: An eye exam is a thorough check of the eyes to detect any problems. It involves a series of tests to assess vision, eye alignment, and other aspects of eye health.\n*   **Get a Dilated Eye Exam**: A dilated eye exam is a comprehensive eye examination that involves the use of special drops to dilate the pupils, allowing for a more thorough inspection of the eyes.\n*   **Get an Eye Disease Screening at 40**: Regular eye exams are essential for detecting eye diseases early on. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends getting an eye disease screening at age 40.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n*   **Diet and Nutrition**: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is essential for maintaining good eye health.\n*   **Eye Protection**: Wearing protective eyewear can help prevent eye injuries. This includes safety glasses, goggles, or other forms of protective eyewear.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **Tired, Achy Eyes? Finding Relief for Eye Discomfort**: If you're experiencing tired, achy eyes, there are several remedies that may provide relief. These include applying a warm compress to the eyes, using artificial tears to lubricate the eyes, or taking breaks to rest the eyes.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   **Difference Between an Ophthalmologist, Optometrist, and Optician**: Understanding the difference between an ophthalmologist, optometrist, and optician is crucial for making informed decisions about eye care.\n*   **Foods for Eye Health**: Certain foods are rich in nutrients that can help promote eye health. These include leafy greens like spinach and kale, fatty fish like salmon, and nuts like almonds.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Fireworks Eye Safety**: When handling fireworks, it's essential to take precautions to protect your eyes from potential hazards.\n*   **How Do Smoking and Vaping Damage the Eyes?**: Smoking and vaping can cause significant damage to the eyes, including an increased risk of cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and other eye problems.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   **Modulation of TTR gene expression in the eye using modified siRNAs.**\n*   **SS-OCT-based ocular biometric characteristics of patients with nuclear cataract.**\n*   **Ocular markers of microangiopathy and their possible association with cardiovascular risk...**\n\n**Children**\n\n*   **About the Eye**: The human eye is a complex and fascinating organ that plays a crucial role in our overall health and well-being.\n*   **First Aid Tips**: In case of an eye injury, it's essential to seek medical attention immediately. However, there are some basic first aid tips that can help alleviate discomfort until proper treatment can be administered.\n\n**Older Adults**\n\n*   **Aging and Your Eyes**: As we age, our eyes undergo significant changes that can impact our vision and overall health.\n*   **Your Aging Eyes: How You See as Time Goes By**: Understanding how our eyes change with age is crucial for maintaining good eye health and preventing age-related eye problems.\n\n**Topic Image**\n\n*   **Eye Diseases**\n*   **Eye Infections**\n*   **Eye Injuries**\n*   **Eye Wear**\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\n*   **The primary NIH organization for research on Eye Care is the National Eye Institute**\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\n*   **MedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

Still, injuries can damage your eye, sometimes severely enough that you could lose your vision. Most eye injuries are preventable. If you play sports or work in certain jobs, you may need protection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common type of injury happens when something irritates the outer surface of your eye. Certain jobs such as industrial jobs or hobbies such as carpentry make this type of injury more likely. It's also more likely if you wear contact lenses.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nChemicals or heat can burn your eyes. With chemicals, the pain may cause you to close your eyes. This traps the irritant next to the eye and may cause more damage. You should wash out your eye right away while you wait for medical help.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nStart Here:\n* Eye Injury and Safety (American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus)\n* Recognizing and Treating Eye Injuries (American Academy of Ophthalmology)\n\nSymptoms:\n* Eye Symptoms (American Academy of Ophthalmology)\n\nDiagnosis and Tests:\n* What Are Dilating Eye Drops?
