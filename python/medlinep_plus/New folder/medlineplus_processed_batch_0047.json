    "content": "**Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery**\n\nAlso called: Bypass surgery, CABG, Coronary artery bypass graft\n\n**What is coronary artery bypass surgery?**\n\nCoronary artery bypass surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to your heart. This surgery is sometimes called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. You may need this surgery if you have a blocked or partially blocked artery in your heart.\n\n**This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD).**\n\nYour coronary arteries supply blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. This can cause them to harden and narrow. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.\n\n**Before recommending surgery, your health care provider may try other treatments.**\n\nThese could include lifestyle changes, medicines, or angioplasty, a procedure to open your arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n**Who might benefit from coronary artery bypass surgery?**\n\nYour provider may recommend surgery if you have obstructive coronary artery disease to help lower your risk of a heart attack. They will consider your overall health before deciding if surgery is your best option.\n\nYou may benefit from surgery if you have:\n\n*   **Coronary heart disease with angina (chest pain)**\n*   **Diabetes**\n*   **Multiple blocked coronary arteries**\n*   **Serious heart failure**\n\nYou might need emergency coronary artery bypass surgery to treat a severe heart attack.\n\n**What happens during coronary artery bypass surgery?**\n\nDuring surgery, the surgeon takes healthy blood vessels from another part of your body. These blood vessels are attached to blood vessels above and below the blocked artery to let blood bypass (get around) the blockage. You might need more than one bypass if you have a few blocked arteries.\n\nMethods to perform coronary artery bypass surgery include:\n\n*   **Traditional CABG**: The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine pumps blood through your body during the surgery.\n*   **Off-pump CABG**: The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine for pumping blood is not used.\n*   **Minimally invasive CABG methods**: Small cuts are made in the chest. A machine for pumping blood is not used.\n*   **Robotic-assisted surgery**: This is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. A machine for pumping blood may be used.\n\n**Are there any risks from coronary artery bypass surgery?**\n\nLike all surgery, CABG has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks can include:\n\n*   **Arrhythmia**\n*   **Bleeding**\n*   **Heart attack**\n*   **Infection**\n*   **Kidney failure**\n*   **Stroke**\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery**\n\n_Coronal view of heart bypass surgery_\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting, also known as CABG or heart bypass, is the most common type of heart surgery in adults.

However, you may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins, or if blockages happen in arteries that weren't blocked before. Lifestyle changes and medicines may help stop your arteries from becoming clogged again.\n\n**NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute**\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting creates a new path for blood to flow to your heart by bypassing blocked or partially blocked arteries. This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery?**\n\nCoronary artery bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), is a surgical procedure that improves blood flow to the heart by bypassing blocked or narrowed sections of the coronary arteries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does CABG Work?**\n\nDuring CABG, a surgeon creates a detour around the blocked area by connecting a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body to the coronary artery. This new pathway allows blood to flow freely to the heart muscle, reducing the risk of heart attack and improving overall cardiac function.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits of CABG?**\n\nCABG can provide several benefits for patients with severe coronary artery disease, including:\n\n*   Reduced risk of heart attack\n*   Improved quality of life\n*   Increased exercise tolerance\n*   Enhanced ability to perform daily activities\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Is a Candidate for CABG?**\n\nPatients with severe coronary artery disease who have not responded well to other treatments, such as medication or angioplasty, may be candidates for CABG. The decision to undergo CABG should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Risks and Complications of CABG?**\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, CABG carries risks and complications, including:\n\n*   Bleeding and infection\n*   Damage to surrounding tissues or organs\n*   Stroke or neurological problems\n*   Death (although rare)\n\nIt is essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of CABG with a healthcare provider before making a decision.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Learn More About CABG?**\n\nFor more information on CABG, you can:\n\n*   Consult with a healthcare provider\n*   Visit online resources, such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)\n*   Discuss your options with a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon\n\nRemember to always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before making any decisions about your care.",

All of the above\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary heart disease describe the same condition: the buildup of plaque in the arteries that carry blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n**What causes plaque to build up in the arteries?**\n\nA. Smoking\nB. High blood pressure\nC. High cholesterol\nD. High blood sugar\nE. All of the above\n\n**Correct Answer:** E. All of the above\n\nAny of these factors cause damage to the inside walls of the coronary arteries. Cholesterol and other chemicals in the blood then build up on these injured areas as plaque.\n\n**Can you have CAD and not have any symptoms?**\n\nA. True\nB. False\n\n**Correct Answer:** A. True\n\nPlaque buildup occurs slowly over time, so you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is especially true in the early stages of heart disease.\n\n**What are the noticeable symptoms of CAD?**\n\nA. Chest pain or pressure, called angina\nB. Shortness of breath\nC. Fatigue\nD. Weakness\nE. All of the above\n\n**Correct Answer:** E. All of the above\n\nAngina (chest heaviness, pressure, or pain) is the most common symptom. It often occurs during activity or stress and goes away with rest or when you take an angina medicine.\n\n**Is angina another name for a heart attack?**\n\nA. True\nB. False\n\n**Correct Answer:** B. False\n\nAngina is a sign that your heart isn't getting enough oxygen. A heart attack occurs when heart muscle cells die due to a blocked artery.\n\n**Which heart problems can be caused by CAD?**\n\nA. Heart failure\nB. Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm)\nC. Heart attack\nD. All of the above\n\n**Correct Answer:** D. All of the above\n\nReduced blood flow can damage the heart in different ways. Heart failure occurs when the weakened heart muscle can't pump enough blood to the rest of the body.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n* Coronary Artery Disease\n* Read More: Coronary heart disease\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Disease Quiz**\n\nWelcome to the Coronary Artery Disease Quiz, where you'll learn about the risks and treatments of CAD. In this quiz, we'll cover topics such as the causes of CAD, its symptoms, and how it can be treated.\n\n**Question 1: Is there a link between depression and heart disease?**\n\nA. True\nB. False\n\nThe correct answer is true. It's unclear why, but there is a link between depression and heart disease, angina, and heart attack. Being depressed may make it harder to follow your treatment plan, and treating depression can help you better manage heart disease.\n\n**Question 2: How may CAD be treated?**\n\nA. Healthy lifestyle changes\nB. Medicines\nC. Angioplasty, a procedure to open blocked arteries\nD. Heart bypass surgery\nE. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Your treatment depends on your symptoms and how much artery blockage you have. For some people, lifestyle changes alone can treat CAD. Others may need medicine, angioplasty, or surgery.\n\n**Question 3: Which lifestyle change WON'T help treat CAD?**\n\nA. Quitting smoking\nB. Eating a healthy, low-fat, low-sodium, high-fiber diet\nC. Getting regular exercise\nD. Managing stress\nE. Maintaining a healthy weight\nF. Following a gluten-free diet\n\nThe correct answer is following a gluten-free diet. Most people don't need to follow a gluten-free diet, and avoiding gluten certainly won't help treat CAD.\n\n**Question 4: Can plaque buildup begin in childhood?**\n\nA. True\nB. False\n\nThe correct answer is true. It may seem hard to believe, but plaque starts building up on artery walls in our childhood and teen years. That's why it's never too early to eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and manage stress.\n\n**Correct Answer**\n\nThe correct answers are:\n\n1. A\n2. E\n3. F\n4. A\n\nBy taking this quiz, you'll learn about the risks and treatments of CAD and how you can prevent it by making healthy lifestyle changes.

It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.\n\n**How does it happen?**\n\nCAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThis can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.\n\n**Long-term effects**\n\nOver time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Start Here**\n\n* Coronary Artery Disease (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Coronary Artery Disease - Coronary Heart Disease (American Heart Association)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Screening With Electrocardiography (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) - PDF\n* Coronary CTA (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Heart Health Tests: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n* How to Prevent Heart Disease: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\n* Also in Spanish\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Disease**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, and the leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women.

We could also see the heart beating. Here are the left and right coronary arteries. They supply blood to specific regions of the heart. If either is damaged or blocked, it could injure the heart wall.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nIn a healthy artery, red blood cells flow through unimpeded. But if the inner wall is damaged, cholesterol plaque can build up. This progressively narrows the space through which blood flows.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nEventually, the artery may become too narrow for clotted blood to pass through. If it does, the artery could become completely blocked.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nThat would cause a lack of oxygen, or ischemia, in the part of the heart the artery supplies. The result is a heart attack, known as a myocardial infarction.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review Date:** 4/10/2023\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is coronary artery disease?**\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition in which the coronary arteries, the main blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, become damaged or diseased. This damage can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the risk factors for coronary artery disease?**\n\nThe following are some of the risk factors for CAD:\n\n*   **Age**: The risk of developing CAD increases with age.\n*   **Family history**: A family history of CAD can increase your risk.\n*   **High blood pressure**: High blood pressure can damage the arteries and increase the risk of CAD.\n*   **High cholesterol**: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can increase the risk of CAD.\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking can damage the arteries and increase the risk of CAD.\n*   **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of CAD.\n*   **Physical inactivity**: A lack of regular exercise can increase the risk of CAD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?**\n\nCAD can be diagnosed using various tests, including:\n\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart and can detect abnormalities in the heartbeat.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of the heart and can detect problems with the heart's structure and function.\n*   **Stress test**: A stress test involves exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike while hooked up to an ECG machine. The test can help determine if the heart is receiving enough blood flow during exercise.\n*   **Coronary angiogram**: A coronary angiogram involves injecting a special dye into the coronary arteries through a catheter inserted into an artery in the leg or arm. The test can help diagnose CAD by visualizing the blockages in the arteries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is coronary artery disease treated?**\n\nCAD can be treated using various methods, including:\n\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Making healthy lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet, can help manage CAD.\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins can help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart attack, and improve overall cardiovascular health.\n*   **Angioplasty**: Angioplasty involves using a catheter to compress or remove blockages in the coronary arteries. The procedure can help restore blood flow to the heart.\n*   **Bypass surgery**: Bypass surgery involves creating a new route for blood to flow around blocked or narrowed sections of the coronary arteries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention is key**\n\nWhile CAD cannot be completely prevented, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight**\n*   **Exercise regularly**\n*   **Eat a balanced diet**\n*   **Don't smoke**\n*   **Limit alcohol consumption**\n*   **Get regular check-ups with your healthcare provider**\n\nBy understanding the risks and symptoms of CAD, you can take steps to prevent it or manage its effects if you do develop the condition.",

It generally occurs when one of the coronary arteries fails to form properly. This most often takes place when the baby is developing in the womb. The coronary artery abnormally attaches to one of the chambers of the heart (the atrium or ventricle) or another blood vessel (for example, the pulmonary artery).\n\nA coronary artery fistula can also develop after birth. It may be caused by:\n\n* An infection that weakens the wall of the coronary artery and the heart\n* Certain types of heart surgery\n* Injury to the heart from an accident or surgery\n\n_Congenital Heart Defects_\n\nCoronary artery fistula is a rare condition. Infants who are born with it sometimes also have other heart defects. These may include:\n\n* Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)\n* Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nInfants with this condition often do not have any symptoms.\n\nIf symptoms do occur, they can include:\n\n* Heart murmur\n* Chest discomfort or pain\n* Easy fatigue\n* Failure to thrive\n* Fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\n* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nIn most cases, this condition is not diagnosed until later in life.

This is a special x-ray test of the heart using dye to see how and where blood is flowing. It is often done along with cardiac catheterization, which involves passing a thin, flexible tube into the heart to evaluate blood pressure and flow in the heart and surrounding arteries and veins.\n\nOther diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Ultrasound exam of the heart (echocardiogram)\n* Using magnets to create images of the heart (MRI)\n* CT scan of the heart\n\n_Treatment_\n\nA small fistula that is not causing symptoms very often will not need treatment. Some small fistulas will close on their own. Often, even if they do not close, they will never cause symptoms or need treatment.\n\nInfants with a larger fistula will need to have surgery to close the abnormal connection. The surgeon closes the site with a patch or stitches.\n\nAnother treatment option plugs up the opening without surgery, using a special wire (coil) that is inserted into the heart with a long, thin tube called a catheter.

It is often done along with cardiac catheterization, which involves passing a thin, flexible tube into the heart to evaluate blood pressure and flow in the heart and surrounding arteries and veins.\n\nOther diagnostic tests may include:\n\n*   Ultrasound exam of the heart (echocardiogram)\n*   Using magnets to create images of the heart (MRI)\n*   CT scan of the heart\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA small fistula that is not causing symptoms very often will not need treatment. Some small fistulas will close on their own. Often, even if they do not close, they will never cause symptoms or need treatment.\n\nInfants with a larger fistula will need to have surgery to close the abnormal connection. The surgeon closes the site with a patch or stitches.\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Fistula**\n\nA coronary artery fistula is an abnormal connection between one of the coronary arteries and a heart chamber or another blood vessel. It's usually present at birth, but can also occur due to injury or infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn infants, symptoms may include:\n\n* Rapid breathing\n* Poor appetite\n* Vomiting\n* Failure to gain weight\n\nSome people with this condition may not experience any symptoms, and the fistula will never cause problems. In these cases, treatment is usually not necessary.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nInfants with a larger fistula will need surgery to close the abnormal connection. The surgeon closes the site with a patch or stitches.\n\nAnother treatment option plugs up the opening without surgery, using a special wire (coil) that is inserted into the heart with a long, thin tube called a catheter. After the procedure in children, the fistula will most often close.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChildren who have surgery mostly do well, although a small percentage may need to have surgery again. Most people with this condition have a normal lifespan.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications include:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\n* Heart attack\n* Heart failure\n* Opening (rupture) of the fistula\n* Poor oxygen to the heart\n\nComplications are more common in older people.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCoronary artery fistula is most often diagnosed during an exam by your provider. Contact your provider if your infant has symptoms of this condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent this condition.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCongenital heart defect - coronary artery fistula; Birth defect heart - coronary artery fistula",

A medicine called nitroglycerin (NTG) can relieve an episode of pain.\n\nYour health care provider may prescribe other medicines to prevent chest pain. You may need long-term treatment with a type of medicine called a calcium channel blocker or a long-acting nitrate.\n\nBeta-blockers are another type of medicine that is used with other coronary artery problems. However, beta-blockers may make coronary artery spasm worse. They should be used with care.\n\nIf you have this condition, you should avoid coronary artery spasm triggers. These include exposure to cold, cocaine or amphetamine use, cigarette smoking, and high-stress situations.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCoronary artery spasm is a long-term (chronic) condition. However, treatment most often helps control symptoms.\n\nThe disorder may be a sign that you have a high risk for heart attack or deadly irregular heart rhythms. The outlook is most often good if you follow your treatment, your provider's advice, and avoid certain triggers.\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Spasm**\n\n**What is Coronary Artery Spasm?**\n\nCoronary artery spasm is a long-term (chronic) condition characterized by sudden and temporary constriction of one or more of the coronary arteries. This constriction can lead to chest pain, known as angina.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of coronary artery spasm is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some risk factors that may contribute to the development of coronary artery spasm include:\n\n*   Family history\n*   Smoking\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Diabetes\n*   High cholesterol levels\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of coronary artery spasm is chest pain, which can be described as a squeezing or crushing sensation in the center of the chest. This pain can radiate to other areas of the body, such as the arms, back, and jaw.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing coronary artery spasm can be challenging, as the symptoms may be similar to those of other heart conditions. A diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of:\n\n*   Medical history\n*   Physical examination\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Echocardiogram\n*   Coronary angiogram\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for coronary artery spasm usually involves a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes may include:\n\n*   Quitting smoking\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Managing stress\n\nMedications that may be prescribed to help manage symptoms include:\n\n*   Nitroglycerin\n*   Calcium channel blockers\n*   Beta blockers\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent coronary artery spasm, making lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing heart disease. Some studies have shown that making a few lifestyle changes can reduce your risk for heart disease.\n\nLifestyle changes can also help prevent some angina attacks. Your provider may tell you to:\n\n*   Lose weight if you are overweight\n*   Stop smoking\n*   Exercise regularly\n*   Drink alcohol in moderation only\n*   Eat a healthy diet that is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meats\n\nYour provider will also recommend that you keep other health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels under control.\n\n**Complications**\n\nCoronary artery spasm can lead to several complications, including:\n\n*   Abnormal heart rhythms\n*   Heart attacks\n\n---\n\n**Coronary Artery Spasm**\n\n**What is coronary artery spasm?**\n\nCoronary artery spasm, also known as Prinzmetal's angina, is a rare condition where the small arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle suddenly constrict or go into spasm. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact causes of coronary artery spasm are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to:\n\n*   **Spasms in the small arteries**: The most common cause of coronary artery spasm.\n*   **Blood vessel abnormalities**: Abnormalities in the blood vessels can increase the risk of spasms.\n*   **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal changes during pregnancy or menopause may contribute to coronary artery spasm.\n*   **Smoking and high blood pressure**: Smoking and high blood pressure are also associated with an increased risk of coronary artery spasm.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of coronary artery spasm can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Chest pain**: A squeezing or tightness in the chest that may radiate to the arms, back, or jaw.\n*   **Shortness of breath**: Feeling like you can't catch your breath or feeling winded even when sitting still.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling extremely tired or weak.\n*   **Panic attacks**: Some people with coronary artery spasm may experience panic attacks.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing coronary artery spasm can be challenging, as the symptoms are similar to those of other heart conditions. To diagnose coronary artery spasm, your doctor may:\n\n*   **Perform a physical exam**: Your doctor will perform a physical exam to check for signs of heart disease.\n*   **Run tests**: Your doctor may run tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or stress test to rule out other conditions.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for coronary artery spasm depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers may be prescribed to help relax the blood vessels and reduce symptoms.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Making lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet can also help manage symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent coronary artery spasm, making lifestyle changes such as:\n\n*   **Quitting smoking**\n*   **Exercising regularly**\n*   **Eating a healthy diet**\n*   **Managing stress**\n\ncan help reduce the risk of developing this condition.",

CHD is also called coronary artery disease.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCHD is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women. CHD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries to your heart, also known as hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis.\n\nFatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart. This buildup causes the arteries to get narrow, which can slow down or stop blood flow to the heart.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nA risk factor for heart disease is something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is more often true in the early stages of CHD.\n\nChest pain or discomfort (angina) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person.\n\nIt may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your breast bone (sternum). You may also feel it in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back.\n\nThe pain most often occurs with activity or emotion. It goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin.\n\nOther symptoms can include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion), or even feeling lightheaded or passing out with exertion.\n\nSome people have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Shortness of breath\n* General weakness\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you.

This can lead to a heart attack if the flow of blood is severely restricted.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of coronary heart disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Some of the known risk factors include:\n\n* High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol\n* Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\n* Family history of coronary heart disease\n* Smoking\n* Obesity\n* Physical inactivity\n* Diabetes\n* Hypertension\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of coronary heart disease can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Chest pain or discomfort, often described as a squeezing or pressure sensation\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Pain or numbness in the arms or legs\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of coronary heart disease is typically made using a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Some of the common diagnostic tests include:\n\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Echocardiogram\n* Stress test\n* Coronary angiogram\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of coronary heart disease depends on the severity of the condition and may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgical procedures. Some of the common treatments include:\n\n* Cholesterol-lowering medications\n* Antiplatelet medications\n* Beta blockers\n* Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n* Surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent coronary heart disease, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition.

This can lead to a reduction in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain or discomfort.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of coronary heart disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Some of the known risk factors for coronary heart disease include:\n\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol levels\n*   Smoking\n*   Obesity\n*   Physical inactivity\n*   Family history of coronary heart disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of coronary heart disease can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n*   Chest pain or discomfort (angina)\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Pain or discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosing coronary heart disease typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as:\n\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Echocardiogram\n*   Stress test\n*   Coronary angiogram\n\nTreatment for coronary heart disease may include lifestyle changes, medication, or surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile some risk factors cannot be changed, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease:\n\n*   Maintain a healthy weight\n*   Engage in regular physical activity\n*   Eat a balanced diet\n*   Quit smoking\n*   Manage stress\n\nBy understanding the causes and symptoms of coronary heart disease, as well as taking steps to prevent it, individuals can reduce their risk of developing this condition.",

    "content": "**Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)**\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness that causes fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, but many other symptoms can occur. COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious virus. Most people get mild to moderate illness. Older adults and people with certain health conditions are at high risk for severe illness and death. More than one million people in the United States have died from COVID-19.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can affect people and animals. They can cause mild to moderate respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold. Some coronaviruses can cause severe illness that can lead to pneumonia and even death.\n\nCOVID-19 most readily spreads to people within close contact (about 6 feet or 2 meters). When someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, droplets and very small particles spray into the air. You can catch the illness if you breathe in these droplets or particles or they land on your eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nIn some instances, COVID-19 may spread through the air and infect people who are more than 6 feet away. Small droplets and particles can remain in the air for minutes to hours. This is called airborne (or aerosol) transmission, and it occurs especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. However, it is more common for COVID-19 to spread through close contact.\n\nLess often, the illness can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it, and then touch your eyes, nose, mouth, or face. But this is thought to be a much less common way in which the virus spreads.\n\nCOVID-19 can spread from person to person quickly. As the virus spreads, it can change, and new variants of the virus will occur. Different variants may spread more quickly or be more resistant to treatments or vaccines. Taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, such as by getting a COVID-19 vaccine, can help slow the development of new variants.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. Older people and people with certain existing health conditions have a higher risk of developing severe illness and death. Health conditions that increase this risk include:\n\n* Asthma (if it's moderate or severe)\n* Cancer\n* COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* Dementia\n* Diabetes (type 1 and type 2)\n* Down syndrome or other disabilities\n* Heart disease and stroke\n* HIV\n* Kidney, lung, or liver disease\n* Mental health conditions\n* Overweight and obesity (BMI of 25 kg per square meter or above)\n* Physical inactivity\n* Pregnancy\n* Organ or stem cell transplantation\n* Sickle cell disease or thalassemia\n* Smoking (current or former)\n* Substance use disorders\n* Tuberculosis\n* Weak immune system (immunocompromised)\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Cough\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle aches\n* Headache\n* Loss of sense of taste or smell\n* Sore throat\n* Stuffy or runny nose\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n\nThis is not a complete list of possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new variants of the virus.\n\nSome people may have no symptoms at all. Many people have some, but not all of these symptoms. Symptoms can also vary, depending on whether you are vaccinated and boosted.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19, you can perform a self-test. Your health care provider also may decide to test you for the disease.\n\nIf you get tested for COVID-19, swabs from the back of the nose, the front of the nose, or the throat will be collected to test for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you are recovering at home, supportive care is given to help relieve symptoms. People with severe illness will be treated in the hospital.\n\nThe types of medicines given may vary depending upon how sick you are, your risk factors for serious illness from the disease, your age, and possibly what variant of the virus is causing the infection.\n\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, your provider may recommend antiviral medicines.\n\nIf given soon after you become infected (5 to 7 days, depending on the medicine), these medicines help your immune system fight off the virus. They may be given to adults and children with mild to moderate illness who are not hospitalized. These medicines include:\n\n* Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid), an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus. It is a pill you take at home.\n* Remdesivir (Veklury), an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus. This medicine is given through the vein (IV). You will need to go to a health care facility for 3 days in a row to receive this medicine.\n* Molnupiravir (Lagevrio), an antiviral medicine used only for adults. It is a pill you take at home.\n\nIf you are being cared for in the hospital and are receiving oxygen therapy, treatment for COVID-19 may include the following medicines:\n\n* Remdesivir, an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus.\n* Dexamethasone, a steroid medicine, to help reduce an overactive immune response in the body. If dexamethasone is not available, you may be given another corticosteroid such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, or hydrocortisone.\n* You may be given one or the other medicine or both medicines together.\n* Baricitinib or tocilizumab to help reduce immune system activity, depending on your condition.\n* Medicines for any complications from the disease. For example, you may be given blood thinners to help reduce the chance of blood clots, or you may have dialysis if your kidneys do not function properly.\n\nBased on available evidence, current treatment guidelines from the National Institutes of Health recommend against using some drugs for COVID-19, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin. Do not take any drugs to treat COVID-19 except those prescribed by your provider. Check with your provider before treating yourself or a loved one with vitamins, nutrients, or any medicines prescribed in the past for other health problems. Since some COVID-19 medicines have interactions with other medicines or supplements you may be taking, always check with your provider before starting them.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications can include:\n\n* Long COVID, which is defined by lasting COVID-19 symptoms that continue 4 weeks or longer after infection with the virus (post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection [PASC])\n* Damage to the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal organs\n* Respiratory failure\n* Death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nYou should contact your provider:\n\n* If you have symptoms and think you may have COVID-19\n* If you have COVID-19 and you are in a group for whom antiviral medicine may be given\n\nIf you have COVID-19 and your symptoms are getting worse\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Chest pain or pressure\n* Confusion or inability to wake up\n* Blue lips or face\n* Any other symptoms that are severe or concern you\n\n---\n\n**Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)**\n\n\\n\\n**Get Vaccinated**\n\n*   Get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n*   If you have children, make sure they get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevent the Spread of COVID-19**\n\n*   Stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have COVID-19 or symptoms of it.\n*   Wear a well-fitted face mask or respirator.\n*   Practice good hygiene. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\n\\n\\n**Keep Your Hands Clean**\n\n*   Wash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) if soap and water are not available.\n\n\\n\\n**Breathe Easier**\n\n*   Take steps for cleaner air in your home. Open windows, use fans and portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners, and setting the fan on your furnace or air conditioning to \"on.\"\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of COVID-19**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).

It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can be a mild to serious illness and even fatal.\n\n**Many Coronaviruses Originate in Bats**\n\nBats are a common source of coronaviruses, which can then infect other animals. For example, SARS-CoV spreads from civet cats, while MERS-CoV spreads from camels. The latest virus, SARS-CoV-2, is also suspected to have originated from animals.\n\n**How Does Coronavirus Spread?**\n\nOnce a person has been infected by a coronavirus, the infection can spread to a healthy person (person-to-person transmission). You can catch coronavirus infection when:\n\n*   An infected person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you and releases the virus into the air (droplet infection)\n*   You touch, hug, shake hands with, or kiss an infected person\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nHuman coronaviruses that cause the common cold spread from person-to-person. Symptoms develop in 2 to 14 days and may include:\n\n*   Runny nose\n*   Sore throat\n*   Sneezing\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Fever, often with chills\n*   Headache\n*   Body aches\n*   Cough\n\nExposure to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe symptoms, including:\n\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Blood in cough\n*   Death\n\nSevere coronavirus infection may cause:\n\n*   Croup\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Bronchiolitis\n*   Bronchitis\n\nSymptoms may be severe in certain people, including:\n\n*   Children\n*   Older adults\n*   People with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, or HIV infection\n*   People with respiratory illnesses such as asthma or COPD\n\n---\n\n**Coronavirus: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many different coronaviruses. They affect both humans and animals. Common human coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold.\n\nSome animal coronaviruses evolve (mutate) and are passed from animals to humans. They may then spread through person-to-person contact. The coronaviruses that spread from animals to humans can sometimes cause more severe illness:\n\n*   **Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)**: a serious form of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV coronavirus. No cases in humans have been reported since 2004.\n*   **Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)**: a severe respiratory illness caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 30% of people who have gotten this illness have died. Some people only have mild symptoms. MERS continues to cause illness in humans, mainly in the Arabian Peninsula.\n*   **COVID-19**: can be a respiratory illness that causes cold or flu-like symptoms, but it can also affect other parts of your body. It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). COVID-19 can be a mild to serious illness and even fatal. COVID-19 is a serious public health threat globally and in the United States.\n\nMany coronaviruses originate in bats, which can then infect other animals. SARS-CoV spreads from civet cats, while MERS-CoV spreads from camels. The latest virus, SARS-CoV-2, is also suspected to have originated from animals. It is from the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV, which is why they have similar names. There are many other coronaviruses circulating in animals, but they haven't spread to humans.\n\nOnce a person has been infected by a coronavirus, the infection can spread to a healthy person (person-to-person transmission). You can catch coronavirus infection when:\n\n*   An infected person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you and releases the virus into the air (droplet infection)\n*   You touch, hug, shake hands with, or kiss an infected person\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nHuman coronaviruses that cause the common cold spread from person-to-person.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/corticosterone-methyloxidase-deficiency/",
    "content": "**Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency**\n\n_Corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency, also known as aldosterone synthase deficiency, is a disorder characterized by excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), along with insufficient release of potassium in the urine, usually beginning in the first few weeks of life._\n\n**Description**\n\nThis imbalance leads to low levels of sodium and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, respectively). Individuals with corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency can also have high levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis).\n\nThe hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis associated with corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness. Affected infants often experience failure to thrive, which means they do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Severe cases of corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency can result in seizures and coma and can be life-threatening. However, affected individuals who survive infancy generally have a normal life expectancy, and the signs and symptoms of the disorder typically become milder or disappear by adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCorticosterone methyloxidase deficiency is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. Researchers have described two types of the condition: Type I is more common in the Amish population of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, while type II is more common in people of Iranian Jewish ancestry. The two types have similar signs and symptoms but can be distinguished by laboratory testing.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CYP11B2 gene cause corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldosterone synthase.\n\n---\n\n**Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency?**\n\nCorticosterone methyloxidase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CYP11B2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldosterone synthase, which helps produce a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone regulates blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.\n\n**How Does Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency Affect the Body?**\n\nThe CYP11B2 gene mutations that cause corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency lead to insufficient production of aldosterone, which impairs the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) into the blood and release potassium in the urine. As a result, excessive amounts of salt in the form of charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) leave the body in the urine, while not enough potassium is released.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 18-hydroxylase deficiency\n* 18-oxidase deficiency\n* Aldosterone deficiency\n* Aldosterone deficiency due to deficiency of steroid 18-hydroxylase\n* Aldosterone deficiency due to deficiency of steroid 18-oxidase\n* Aldosterone synthase deficiency\n* CMO deficiency\n* Congenital hypoaldosteronism\n* Corticosterone 18-monooxygenase deficiency\n* Familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism\n* Steroid 18-hydroxylase deficiency\n* Steroid 18-oxidase deficiency\n* Visser-Cost syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Corticosterone methyloxidase type 2 deficiency\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Corticosterone 18-monooxygenase deficiency\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ CORTICOSTERONE METHYLOXIDASE TYPE I DEFICIENCY\n\t+ CORTICOSTERONE METHYLOXIDASE TYPE II DEFICIENCY\n\n---\n\n**Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Corticosterone Methyloxidase Deficiency?**\n\nCorticosterone methyloxidase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. The disorder is caused by mutations in the CYP11B2 gene, which codes for the enzyme corticosterone methyloxidase.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the disorder and the individual's overall health. They may include:\n\n* High blood pressure\n* Low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia)\n* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)\n* Fluid retention\n* Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency are genetic mutations that affect the production of aldosterone. The disorder can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n* Medications to lower blood pressure and reduce fluid retention\n* Diuretics to remove excess fluids from the body\n* Potassium-lowering medications to reduce high potassium levels\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency varies depending on the severity of the disorder and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with this condition can lead normal lives.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nCorticosterone methyloxidase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the production of aldosterone. The disorder is caused by mutations in the CYP11B2 gene, which codes for the enzyme corticosterone methyloxidase.\n\n* **Inheritance Pattern:** Autosomal recessive\n* **Genetic Mutation:** Mutations in the CYP11B2 gene\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Adrenal Gland Disorders\n* Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n* Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Corticotropin Repository Injection**\n\n**What is Corticotropin Repository Injection?**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection is used to treat various conditions, including infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, systemic dermatomyositis or polymyositis, serious allergic reactions, serum sickness, allergic reactions or other conditions that cause swelling of the eyes and the area around them, sarcoidosis, and nephrotic syndrome.\n\n**How is Corticotropin Repository Injection Used?**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection comes as a long-acting gel to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). The dosage and frequency of administration vary depending on the condition being treated. For infantile spasms, it is usually injected into a muscle twice a day for two weeks and then injected on a gradually decreasing schedule for another two weeks. For multiple sclerosis, it is usually injected once a day for 2 to 3 weeks, and then the dose is gradually decreased.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nYou should not stop using corticotropin repository injection without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using corticotropin repository injection, you may experience symptoms such as weakness, tiredness, pale skin, changes in skin color, weight loss, stomach pain, and loss of appetite. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**What Should I Know About Storage and Disposal of This Medication?**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. The medication should not be frozen or exposed to direct sunlight. Dispose of the medication properly after use.\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of overdose, such as weakness, tiredness, pale skin, changes in skin color, weight loss, stomach pain, and loss of appetite, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection is in a class of medications called hormones. It treats many conditions by decreasing the activity of the immune system so that it will not cause damage to the organs. There is not enough information to tell how corticotropin repository injection works to treat infantile spasms.\n\n**Brand Names**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection is available under various brand names, including Acthar Gel and H.P. Acthar Gel.\n\n---\n\n**Corticotropin Repository Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/6)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Administering Corticotropin Repository Injection**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection comes as a vial where you will use a syringe to withdraw the prescribed dose before injecting or as an autoinjector (prefilled syringe). Ask your doctor which type of needle and syringe you should use to inject corticotropin repository injection from the vial. Do not share needles or syringes or use them more than once. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-proof container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-proof container.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Choosing an Injection Site**\n\nIf you are injecting corticotropin repository injection under your skin, you can inject it anywhere in your upper thigh, upper arm, or stomach area except for your navel (belly button) and the 1 inch area around it. If you are injecting corticotropin repository injection into a muscle, you can inject it anywhere on your upper arm or upper outer thigh. If you are giving the injection to a baby you should inject it into the upper outer thigh. Choose a new spot at least 1 inch away from a spot where you have already injected the medication each time you inject it. Do not inject the medication into any area that is red, swollen, painful, hard, or sensitive, or that has tattoos, warts, scars, or birthmarks. Do not inject the medication into your knee or groin areas.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparing Your Dose**\n\nIf using the vial to inject your corticotropin repository injection, follow these directions to give the dose:\n\n*   Look at the vial of corticotropin repository injection before you prepare your dose. Be sure that the vial is labeled with the correct name of the medication and an expiration date that has not passed.\n*   The medication in the vial should be clear and colorless and should not be cloudy or contain flecks or particles. If you do not have the right medication, if your medication is expired, or if it does not look as it should, call your pharmacist and do not use that vial.\n*   Allow your medication to warm to room temperature before you inject it. You can warm the medication by rolling the vial between your hands or holding it under your arm for a few minutes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using the Autoinjector**\n\nIf using the autoinjector to administer corticotropin repository injection, remove the autoinjector from the refrigerator and allow to warm to room temperature for 45 minutes before injecting. Corticotropin repository autoinjector is only for subcutaneous injection. Rotate area or site for each injection and do not use the same site more than one time per week.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Giving Corticotropin Repository Injection to a Child**\n\nIf you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child, you can hold your child on your lap or have your child lie flat while you are giving the injection. You may find it helpful to have someone else hold the child in position or distract the child with a noisy toy while you are injecting the medication. You can help decrease your child's pain by placing an ice cube on the spot where you will inject the medication before or after the injection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Medication Guide**\n\nIf you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child to treat infantile spasms, your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when your child begins treatment with corticotropin repository injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nCorticotropin repository injection comes as a long acting gel to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat infantile spasms, it is usually injected into a muscle twice a day for two weeks and then injected on a gradually decreasing schedule for another two weeks. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat multiple sclerosis, it is usually injected once a day for 2 to 3 weeks, and then the dose is gradually decreased. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat other conditions, it is injected once every 24 to 72 hours, depending on the condition being treated and how well the medication works to treat the condition. Inject corticotropin repository injection at around the same time(s) of day on every day that you are told to inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use corticotropin repository injection exactly as directed.

    "content": "**Cortisol Test**\n\n**What is a cortisol test?**\n\nA cortisol test measures the level of cortisol in your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). Cortisol is a hormone made by your adrenal glands, two small glands that sit above your kidneys. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs.\n\n**What does cortisol do?**\n\nCortisol affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It helps your body:\n\n* Respond to stress (cortisol is sometimes called the \"stress hormone.\")\n* Reduce inflammation (swelling)\n* Control blood glucose (also called \"blood sugar\") and metabolism (how your body uses food for energy)\n* Control your blood pressure\n\n**Why do I need a cortisol test?**\n\nYou may need a cortisol test if you have symptoms of a condition that affects cortisol levels.\n\nSymptoms of Cushing's syndrome (too much cortisol) may include:\n\n* Weight gain\n* Thin arms and legs\n* Round face\n* Increased fat around the base of your neck or between your shoulder blades\n* Easy bruising\n* Wide purple streaks on your stomach, breasts, hips, and under your arms\n* Muscle weakness\n\nCommon symptoms of Addison disease and adrenal insufficiency (too little cortisol) may include:\n\n* Long-lasting fatigue\n* Muscle weakness\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\n**What happens during a cortisol test?**\n\nMost of your cortisol is in your blood, so cortisol tests often use a sample of blood drawn at a lab. But some cortisol passes into your urine and saliva. Measuring cortisol in these fluids is also an accurate way to estimate how much cortisol is in your blood.\n\nFor a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.\n\nFor a cortisol urine test, your provider may ask you to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a \"24-hour urine sample test.\"\n\nA cortisol saliva test may be done at your provider's office or at home with a kit you use to collect a saliva sample.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThe preparations for a cortisol test will depend on the type of test you are having. Be sure to follow all the instructions that your provider gives you.\n\nStress and exercise can raise your cortisol levels, so you may need to rest before your test. For a blood test, you'll need two appointments at different times on the same day. Before a saliva test, you may need to stop using certain medicines. Let your provider know about all the medicines you use, including skin creams.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA cortisol test alone can't diagnose the cause of abnormal cortisol levels. If your cortisol level isn't normal, you will usually have more tests to find out what is causing the problem.\n\nHigh levels of cortisol may be a sign that you have Cushing's syndrome. It may be caused by:\n\n* Taking high doses of certain steroid medicines for a long period of time\n* Tumors that make extra ACTH, which tells your adrenal glands to make cortisol\n* Tumors in your adrenal glands that make extra cortisol\n\nLow levels of cortisol may mean you have Addison disease or secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Cortisol Test: Understanding Your Results**\n\nAre you wondering what a cortisol test can reveal about your body? In this article, we'll delve into the world of cortisol testing and explore its significance in diagnosing and monitoring various medical conditions.\n\n**What is Cortisol?**\n\nCortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, two small glands located above the kidneys. It plays a vital role in responding to stress, reducing inflammation, controlling blood glucose levels, and regulating blood pressure.\n\n**Common Causes of Addison Disease**\n\nAddison disease, a condition characterized by low cortisol levels, can be caused by:\n\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Certain infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) and HIV\n\n**Common Causes of Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency**\n\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency, another condition with low cortisol levels, can be caused by:\n\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Problems with the pituitary gland\n* Traumatic brain injury\n* Surgical removal of the pituitary gland to treat other conditions\n\n**Factors Affecting Cortisol Levels**\n\nCortisol levels can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n* Stress\n* Pregnancy\n* Exercise\n* Hot and cold temperatures\n* Certain medicines, such as birth control pills\n\n**Interpreting Test Results**\n\nTo understand your cortisol test results, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider. They will help you interpret the findings and determine the next course of action.\n\n**High Cortisol Levels: Pseudo-Cushing's Syndrome**\n\nHigh cortisol levels may come and go in some individuals, a condition known as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome or non-neoplastic hypercortisolism. This can be caused by depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorder, poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, and other health issues.\n\n**What is a Cortisol Test?**\n\nA cortisol test measures the level of cortisol in your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). It's an essential tool for diagnosing and monitoring conditions that affect cortisol levels.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Cortisol Test?**\n\nYou may need a cortisol test if you experience symptoms related to cortisol imbalances, such as:\n\n* Weight gain\n* Thin arms and legs\n* Round face\n* Easy bruising\n* Wide purple streaks on the stomach, breasts, hips, and underarms\n\n**What Happens During a Cortisol Test?**\n\nMost cortisol tests involve collecting a blood sample from a vein in your arm. In some cases, you may be asked to collect saliva samples at home or provide a 24-hour urine sample.\n\nBy understanding cortisol testing and its significance, you'll be better equipped to navigate the world of medical testing and make informed decisions about your health.\n\n---\n\n**Cortisol Test: What to Expect**\n\nAre you considering a cortisol test? Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Types of Tests**\n\nThere are several types of cortisol tests, including:\n\n* **Blood Test**: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm.\n* **Urine Test**: You'll be asked to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period.\n* **Saliva Test**: You'll use a kit to collect a saliva sample at home or in your provider's office.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nBefore your test, you may need to:\n\n* Rest and avoid stress\n* Stop using certain medicines\n* Follow specific instructions for collecting your urine or saliva sample\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was inserted.\n\n**Interpreting Your Results**\n\nA cortisol test alone can't diagnose the cause of abnormal cortisol levels. If your results aren't normal, you'll usually have more tests to determine what's causing the problem.\n\nHigh levels of cortisol may indicate Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by:\n\n* Taking high doses of steroid medicines\n* Tumors that produce excess ACTH or cortisol\n\nLow levels of cortisol may mean you have Addison disease or secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be caused by:\n\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Infections such as TB and HIV\n* Problems with your pituitary gland\n\n**What to Do Next**\n\nIf your cortisol results aren't normal, talk to your provider about what the results mean for you. They'll help you determine the cause of any abnormal levels and develop a plan to address it.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results to make informed decisions about your health.\n\n---\n\n**Cortisol Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 4/4)**\n\nHigh cortisol levels may come and go in some people. This is sometimes called pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, which means false Cushing's syndrome. It's also called \"non-neoplastic hypercortisolism.\"\n\n*   **Causes:** Depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorder, poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, and other health problems.\n*   **Tests:** To find the cause of high cortisol levels may help diagnose non-neoplastic hypercortisolism.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Allina Health.

Cortisol is a steroid (glucocorticoid or corticosteroid) hormone produced by the adrenal gland.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider will likely have you do the test early in the morning. This is important because cortisol level varies throughout the day.\n\nYou may be asked not to do any vigorous exercise the day before the test.\n\nYou may also be told to temporarily stop taking medicines that can affect the test, including:\n\n* Anti-seizure medicines\n* Estrogen\n* Human-made (synthetic) glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone\n* Androgens\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone released from the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is a hormone released from the pituitary gland in the brain.\n\nCortisol affects many different body systems. It plays a role in:\n\n* Bone growth\n* Blood pressure control\n* Immune system function\n* Metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein\n* Nervous system function\n* Stress response\n\nDifferent diseases, such as Cushing syndrome and Addison disease, can lead to either too much or too little production of cortisol. Measuring blood cortisol level can help diagnose these conditions. It is also measured to evaluate how well the pituitary and adrenal glands are working.\n\nThe test is often done before and 1 hour after injection of a medicine called ACTH (cosyntropin). This part of the test is called an ACTH stimulation test. It is an important test that helps check the function of the pituitary and adrenal glands.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values for a blood sample taken at 8 in the morning are 5 to 25 mcg/dL or 140 to 690 nmol/L.\n\nNormal values depend on the time of day and the clinical context. Normal ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher than normal level may indicate:\n\n* Cushing disease, in which the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH because of excess growth of the pituitary gland or a tumor in the pituitary gland\n* Ectopic Cushing syndrome, in which a tumor outside the pituitary or adrenal glands makes too much ACTH\n* Tumor of the adrenal gland that is producing too much cortisol\n* Stress\n* Acute illness\n\nA lower than normal level may indicate:\n\n* Addison disease, in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol\n* Hypopituitarism, in which the pituitary gland does not signal the adrenal gland to produce enough cortisol\n* Suppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines including pills, skin creams, eye drops, inhalers, joint injections, chemotherapy\n\n---\n\n**Cortisol Blood Test**\n\nThe cortisol blood test measures the level of cortisol in the blood.

Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone produced by the adrenal gland.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to collect your urine over 24 hours in a container provided by the laboratory. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\n\nBecause cortisol production by the adrenal gland can vary, the test may need to be done three or more separate times over a few weeks to months to get a more accurate picture of average cortisol production.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to do any vigorous exercise the day before the test.\n\nYou may also be told to temporarily stop taking medicines that can affect the test, including:\n\n* Anti-seizure medicines\n* Estrogen\n* Human-made (synthetic) glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone\n* Androgens\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone released from the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a hormone released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Cortisol affects many different body systems. It plays a role in:\n\n* Bone growth\n* Blood pressure control\n* Immune system function\n* Metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein\n* Nervous system function\n* Stress response\n\nDifferent diseases, such as Cushing syndrome and Addison disease, can lead to either too much or too little production of cortisol. Measuring urine cortisol levels can help diagnose these conditions.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal range is less than 45 mcg/24 hours (124 nmol/24 hours) for women and less than 60 mcg/24 hours (165 nmol/24 hours).\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher than normal level may indicate:\n\n* Cushing disease, in which the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH because of excess growth of the pituitary gland or a tumor in the pituitary gland\n* Ectopic Cushing syndrome, in which a tumor outside the pituitary or adrenal glands makes too much ACTH\n* Severe depression\n* Tumor of the adrenal gland that is producing too much cortisol\n* Severe stress\n* Rare genetic disorders\n\nA lower than normal level may indicate:\n\n* Addison disease in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol\n* Hypopituitarism in which the pituitary gland does not signal the adrenal gland to produce enough cortisol\n* Suppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines including pills, skin creams, eyedrops, inhalers, joint injections, chemotherapy\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with this test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)\n\n**References**\n\nGuber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX.

Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps regulate various bodily functions, such as metabolism and stress response.\n\n**How is it performed?**\nTo perform the test, you will need to collect your urine over 24 hours in a container provided by the laboratory. Your healthcare provider will instruct you on how to do this. Because cortisol production can vary, the test may need to be repeated three or more times over a few weeks to months to get an accurate picture of average cortisol production.\n\n**How should I prepare for the test?**\nBefore the test, you may be asked not to engage in vigorous exercise the day before. You may also be instructed to temporarily stop taking certain medications that can affect the test, including anti-seizure medicines, estrogen, human-made glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone and prednisone), androgens.\n\n**What does the test feel like?**\nThe test involves normal urination and should not cause any discomfort.\n\n**Why is the test performed?**\nThe cortisol urine test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol affects many bodily systems, including bone growth, blood pressure control, immune system function, metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein, nervous system function, and stress response. The test can help diagnose conditions such as Cushing syndrome and Addison disease.\n\n**What are normal results?**\nNormal range is less than 45 mcg/24 hours (124 nmol/24 hours) for women and less than 60 mcg/24 hours (165 nmol/24 hours).\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\nA higher than normal level may indicate conditions such as Cushing disease, ectopic Cushing syndrome, severe depression, tumor of the adrenal gland, or severe stress. A lower than normal level may indicate Addison disease, hypopituitarism, or suppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines.\n\n**Are there any risks?**\nThere are no risks associated with this test.\n\n---\n\n**Cortisol Urine Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a cortisol urine test?**\n\nA cortisol urine test measures the amount of cortisol in your urine over a 24-hour period. This test can help diagnose and monitor conditions such as Cushing's syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and other disorders related to the adrenal gland.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Lower than normal level:** May indicate risks such as adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease.\n* **Normal level:** Indicates no risk of adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease.\n* **Higher than normal level:** May indicate risks such as Cushing's syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**There are no risks with this test.**\n\nThis test is a non-invasive procedure that involves collecting your urine over a 24-hour period.

    "content": "**Cosmetic Ear Surgery**\n\n_Cosmetic ear surgery is a procedure to improve the appearance of the ear. The most common procedure is to move very large or prominent ears closer to the head._\n\n**Description**\n\n_Cosmetic ear surgery may be done in the surgeon's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital. It can be performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the ears. You may also receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy. It can also be done under general anesthesia, in which you are asleep and pain-free. This is the preferred method of anesthesia in children. The procedure usually lasts about 2 hours._\n\n_During the most common method of cosmetic ear surgery, the surgeon makes a cut in the back of the ear and removes the skin to see the ear cartilage. The cartilage is folded to reshape the ear, bringing it closer to the head. Sometimes the surgeon will cut the cartilage before folding it. Sometimes skin is removed from behind the ear. Stitches are used to close the wound._\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\n_The procedure is often done to reduce self-consciousness or embarrassment of the unusual shape of the ears._\n\n_In children, the procedure can be done after they are 5 or 6 years old, when ear growth is almost finished. If the ears are very disfigured (lop ears), the child should have surgery early to avoid possible emotional stress._\n\n**Risks**\n\n_Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:_\n\n_* Reactions to medicines_\n_* Breathing problems_\n_* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection_*\n\n_Risks of cosmetic ear surgery include:_\n\n_* Areas of numbness_\n_* Collection of blood (hematoma)_\n_* Infection_\n_* Increased feeling of cold_\n_* Recurrence of the ear deformity_\n_* Keloids and other scars_\n_* Poor results_*\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n_Tell your surgeon or nurse if:_\n\n_* You are or could be pregnant_\n_* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription_*\n\n_During the week before your surgery:_\n\n_* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners._\n_* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery._*\n\n_On the day of surgery:_\n\n_* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking._\n_* Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water._\n_* Arrive at the hospital on time._\n\n_Be sure to follow any other specific instructions from your surgeon._\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\n_The ears are covered with thick bandages with some moderate pressure after surgery. Typically, you can go home after you are awake from the anesthesia._\n\n_Any tenderness and discomfort can be controlled with medicine. The ear bandages are usually removed after 2 to 4 days, but may stay on longer. A head wrap or headband needs to be worn for 2 to 3 weeks to help the area heal._\n\n_Be sure to contact your surgeon if you have severe ear pain. This can be due to infection of the ear cartilage._\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n_Scars are very light and are hidden in the creases behind the ears._\n\n_A second procedure may be needed if the ear sticks out again._\n\n---\n\n**Cosmetic Ear Surgery**\n\n_Cosmetic ear surgery is a procedure to improve the appearance of the ear. The most common procedure is to move very large or prominent ears closer to the head._\n\n**Description**\n\n_Cosmetic ear surgery may be done in the surgeon's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital. It can be performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the ears. You may also receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy. It can also be done under general anesthesia, in which you are asleep and pain-free. This is the preferred method of anesthesia in children. The procedure usually lasts about 2 hours._\n\n_During the most common method of cosmetic ear surgery, the surgeon makes a cut in the back of the ear and removes the skin to see the ear cartilage. The cartilage is folded to reshape the ear, bringing it closer to the head. Sometimes the surgeon will cut the cartilage before folding it. Sometimes skin is removed from behind the ear. Stitches are used to close the wound._\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\n_The procedure is often done to reduce self-consciousness or embarrassment of the unusual shape of the ears._\n\n_In children, the procedure can be done after they are 5 or 6 years old, when ear growth is almost finished. If the ears are very disfigured (lop ears), the child should have surgery early to avoid possible emotional stress._\n\n**Risks**\n\n_Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:_\n\n_Reactions to medicines_\n_Breathing problems_\n_Bleeding, blood clots, or infection_\n\n_Risks of cosmetic ear surgery include:_\n\n_Areas of numbness_\n_Collection of blood (hematoma)_\n_Infection_\n_Increased feeling of cold_\n_Recurrence of the ear deformity_\n_Keloids and other scars_\n_Poor results_\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n_Tell your surgeon or nurse if:_\n\n_You are or could be pregnant_\n_You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription_\n\n_During the week before your surgery:_\n\n_You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners._\n\n_On the day of surgery:_\n\n_Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking._\n_Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water._\n_Arrive at the hospital on time._\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\n_The ears are covered with thick bandages with some moderate pressure after surgery.

    "content": "**Cosmetics**\n\nAlso called: Makeup\n\nCosmetics are products you apply to your body to clean it, make it more attractive, or change the way it looks. They include:\n\n* Hair dyes\n* Makeup\n* Perfumes\n* Skin-care creams\n\n**What's a Cosmetic?**\n\nCosmetics that treat or prevent diseases are also drugs. Products such as dandruff shampoo, fluoride toothpaste, and antiperspirant deodorant are both cosmetics and drugs. A good way to tell if you're buying a cosmetic that is also a drug is to see if the first ingredient listed is an \"active ingredient.\" The active ingredient is the chemical that makes the product effective. The manufacturer must have proof that it's safe for its intended use.\n\n**Allergic Reactions**\n\nCosmetics can cause allergic reactions. The first sign is often red and irritated skin. Fragrances and preservatives are the most common causes of skin problems.\n\n**Reading Labels**\n\nTo find out all the ingredients in a cosmetic you use, check the container. Manufacturers are required to list them. Labels such as \"natural\" and \"hypoallergenic\" have no official meaning. Companies can use them to mean whatever they want.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Choosing the Best Skin Care Products (American Society for Dermatologic Surgery)\n* Colored and Decorative Contact Lenses: A Prescription Is a Must (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Cosmetics Safety Q&A: Shelf Life (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Eye Cosmetic Safety (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Hair Dyes, Other Hair Products, and Cancer Risk  (National Cancer Institute)\n* Also in Spanish\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Allergens in Cosmetics (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Formaldehyde in Hair Smoothing Products: What You Should Know (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Fragrances in Cosmetics (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Hair Dye and Hair Relaxers  (Food and Drug Administration)\n* Also in Spanish\n* How Safe Are Color Additives?

This condition is called costochondritis. It is a common cause of chest pain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere is often no known cause of costochondritis. But it may be caused by:\n\n* Chest injury\n* Hard exercise or heavy lifting\n* Viral infections, such as respiratory infections\n* Strain from coughing\n* Infections after surgery or from intravenous (IV) drug use\n* Some types of arthritis\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptoms of costochondritis are pain and tenderness in the chest. You may feel:\n\n* Sharp pain at the front of your chest wall, which may move to your back or stomach\n* Increased pain when you take a deep breath or cough\n* Tenderness when you press the area where the rib joins the breastbone\n* Less pain when you stop moving and breathe quietly\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and do a physical exam. The area where the ribs meet the breastbone is checked. If this area is tender and sore, costochondritis is the most likely cause of your chest pain.\n\nA chest x-ray may be done if your symptoms are severe or do not improve with treatment.\n\nYour provider may also order tests to check for other conditions, such as a heart attack.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCostochondritis most often goes away on its own in a few days or weeks. It can also take up to a few months. Treatment focuses on relieving the pain.\n\n* Apply hot or cold compresses.\n* Avoid activities that make the pain worse.\n* Pain medicines, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), may help to ease pain and swelling. You can buy these without a prescription.\n* Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n* Take the dose as advised by the provider. Do not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle. Carefully read the warnings on the label before taking any medicine.\n\nYou may also take acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead, if your provider tells you it is safe to do so. People with liver disease should not take this medicine.\n\nIf your pain is severe, your provider may prescribe stronger pain medicine.\n\nIn some cases, your provider may recommend physical therapy.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCostochondritis pain often goes away in a few days or weeks.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number, or go to your local emergency room right away if you have chest pain. The pain of costochondritis can be similar to the pain of a heart attack.\n\nIf you have already been diagnosed with costochondritis, contact your provider if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* A high fever\n* Any signs of infection such as pus, redness, or swelling around your ribs\n* Pain that continues or gets worse after taking pain medicine\n* Sharp pain with every breath\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause the cause is often unknown, there is no known way to prevent costochondritis.\n\n---\n\n**Costochondritis**\n\nCostochondritis is a common cause of chest pain.

    "content": "**Could You Have Low Testosterone?**\n\nLow testosterone, also known as low-T, can affect a man's sex drive, mood, and physical appearance. Certain health conditions, medicines, or injury can lead to low testosterone. Treatment with testosterone therapy may help reduce symptoms.\n\n**How Testosterone Affects Health**\n\nTestosterone makes a man look and feel like a man. In a man, this hormone helps:\n\n* Keep bones and muscles strong\n* Determine hair growth and where fat is on the body\n* Make sperm\n* Maintain sex drive and erections\n* Make red blood cells\n* Boost energy and mood\n\n**Causes of Low Testosterone**\n\nBeginning around age 30 to 40, testosterone levels may start to slowly decrease. This occurs naturally.\n\nOther causes of low testosterone include:\n\n* Medicine side effects, such as from chemotherapy.\n* Testicle injury or cancer.\n* Problems with glands in the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary) that control hormone production.\n* Low thyroid function.\n* Too much body fat (obesity). Ask your health care provider whether you need a test called free testosterone.\n* Other disorders, chronic diseases, treatments, or infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome men with low testosterone do not have any symptoms. Others may have:\n\n* Low sex drive\n* Problems having an erection\n* Low sperm count\n* Sleep problems such as insomnia\n* Decrease in muscle size and strength\n* Bone loss\n* Increase in body fat\n* Depression\n* Trouble concentrating\n\nSome symptoms may be a normal part of aging. For example, it is normal to feel less interested in sex as you get older. But, it is not usually normal to have no interest in sex.\n\nSymptoms may also be caused by other conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. If any of these symptoms are bothering you, talk with your provider.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nYour provider will likely have you get a blood test to check your testosterone level. You will also be checked for other causes of your symptoms. These include medicine side effects, thyroid problems, or depression.\n\nIf you have low testosterone, hormone therapy may help. The medicine used is man-made testosterone. This treatment is called testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT. TRT can be given as a pill, gel, patch, injection, or implant.\n\nTRT may relieve or improve symptoms in some men. It may help keep bones and muscles strong. TRT seems to be more effective in young men with very low testosterone levels. TRT can also be helpful for older men.\n\n**Risks of TRT**\n\nTRT has risks. These may include:\n\n* Infertility\n* Enlarged prostate leading to difficulty urinating\n* Blood clots\n* Worsening cardiovascular disease\n* Sleep problems\n* Cholesterol problems\n\nAt this time, it is unclear whether TRT increases the risk of prostate cancer or symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Cardiovascular risks are also unclear. However, based on inconclusive data, the FDA does warn of a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTalk with your provider about whether TRT is right for you. If you do not notice any change in symptoms after treatment for 3 months, it is less likely that TRT treatment will benefit you.\n\n---\n\n**Could You Have Low Testosterone?**\n\nTestosterone is a hormone made by the testicles that's important for a man's sex drive and physical appearance.\n\n**Causes of Low Testosterone**\n\nBeginning around age 30 to 40, testosterone levels may start to slowly decrease.

    "title": "Counting carbohydrates: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000321.htm",
    "content": "**Counting Carbohydrates**\n\nMany foods contain carbohydrates (carbs), including:\n\n*   Fruit and fruit juice\n*   Cereal, bread, pasta, and rice\n*   Milk and milk products, soy milk\n*   Beans, legumes, and lentils\n*   Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn\n*   Sweets like cookies, candy, cake, jam and jelly, honey, and other foods that contain added sugar\n*   Snack foods like chips and crackers\n\nYour body quickly turns carbohydrates into a sugar called glucose, which is your body's main source of energy. This raises your blood sugar, or blood glucose level.\n\nMost foods that contain carbohydrates are nutritious and are an important part of a healthy diet. For people with diabetes, the goal is not to avoid carbohydrates in the diet completely, but to make sure that you are not eating too many. Eating a regular amount of carbohydrates throughout the day can help keep your blood sugar level steady.\n\nPeople with diabetes can better control their blood sugar if they count how many carbohydrates they eat. People with diabetes who take insulin can use carb counting to help them determine the exact dose of insulin they need at meals.\n\n**Types of Carbohydrates**\n\nYour body turns all carbohydrates into energy. There are 3 major types of carbohydrates:\n\n*   Sugars\n*   Starches\n*   Fiber\n\nSugars are found naturally in some foods and added to others. Sugar occurs naturally in these nutrient-rich foods:\n\nFruits\nMilk and milk products\n\nMany packaged and refined foods contain added sugar:\n\nCandy\nCookies, cakes, and pastries\nRegular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda\nHeavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit\n\nStarches are found naturally in foods, as well. Your body breaks them down into sugar after you eat them. The following foods have a lot of starch. Many also have fiber. Fiber is the part of food that is not broken down by the body. It slows digestion and helps you feel fuller. Foods containing starch and fiber include:\n\nBread\nCereal\nLegumes, such as beans and chickpeas\nPasta\nRice\nStarchy vegetables, such as potatoes\n\n---\n\n**Counting Carbohydrates**\n\nFor people with diabetes, controlling blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining overall health. One effective way to manage blood sugar is by counting the number of carbohydrates consumed daily. This technique helps individuals with diabetes determine the exact dose of insulin needed at meals.\n\n**Why Count Carbohydrates?**\n\nEating a regular amount of carbohydrates throughout the day can help keep blood sugar levels steady. By monitoring carbohydrate intake, people with diabetes can better control their blood sugar levels. Those who take insulin can use carb counting to determine the precise dose of insulin required for each meal.\n\n**Types of Carbohydrates**\n\nThere are three primary types of carbohydrates:\n\n1. **Sugars**: Found naturally in some foods and added to others. Examples include fruits, milk, and many packaged and refined foods.\n2. **Starches**: Broken down into sugar after consumption. Foods high in starch include bread, cereal, legumes, pasta, rice, and starchy vegetables like potatoes.\n3. **Fiber**: The part of food not broken down by the body, slowing digestion and helping individuals feel fuller. Examples include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n**Counting Your Carbs**\n\nSome foods, such as jelly beans, contain only carbohydrates. Others, like animal proteins (meat, fish, eggs), have no carbohydrates. Most foods, including vegetables, contain some carbohydrates. However, green, non-starchy vegetables are very low in carbs.\n\n**Daily Carbohydrate Goals**\n\nMost adults with diabetes should aim to consume no more than 200 carbohydrate grams per day. Pregnant women require at least 175 grams daily. The American Diabetes Association recommends 135 grams of carbohydrates per day for adults, but individual goals may vary based on personal caloric needs and other factors.\n\n**Using Food Labels**\n\nPackaged foods display labels with carbohydrate content measured in grams. When carb counting, a serving size equals 15 grams of carbohydrate. To calculate total carbs consumed, multiply the label information by the number of servings eaten. For example, if a bag of chips contains 2 servings (11g each), eating the entire bag would be equivalent to 22g of carbohydrates.\n\n**Cooking and Portion Control**\n\nWhen cooking, measure the portion of food after preparation. For instance, cooked long grain rice has 15g of carbohydrate per 1/3 cup. Eating a cup of cooked rice would translate to 45g of carbohydrates or 3 servings.\n\n**Examples of Foods with Approximately 15 Grams of Carbohydrate**\n\n* Half cup (107g) of canned fruit\n* One cup (109g) of melon or berries\n* Two tablespoons (19g) of dried fruit (such as raisins)\n* Half cup (121g) of cooked oatmeal\n* One-third cup of cooked pasta (44g)\n* One-third cup (67g) of cooked long grain rice\n\n**Adding Up Your Carbohydrates**\n\nTrack your daily carbohydrate intake using a log book, paper, or an app. As you become more comfortable with carb counting, estimating your carbohydrates will become easier. Regular check-ins with a dietitian every 6 months can help refine your knowledge and adjust your carbohydrate goals accordingly.\n\nBy understanding the importance of carbohydrate counting and implementing this technique into their daily lives, individuals with diabetes can better manage their blood sugar levels, leading to improved overall health and well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Counting Your Carbs**\n\nSome foods, such as jelly beans, contain only carbohydrates. Other foods, such as animal proteins (all kinds of meat, fish, and eggs), have no carbohydrates.\n\n* Sugars\n\t+ Found naturally in some foods and added to others\n\t+ Occur naturally in nutrient-rich foods:\n\t\t- Fruits\n\t\t- Milk and milk products\n\t+ Added to many packaged and refined foods:\n\t\t- Candy\n\t\t- Cookies, cakes, and pastries\n\t\t- Regular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda\n\t\t- Heavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit\n* Starches\n\t+ Found naturally in foods, broken down into sugar after eating\n\t+ Foods with a lot of starch:\n\t\t- Bread\n\t\t- Cereal\n\t\t- Legumes, such as beans and chickpeas\n\t\t- Pasta\n\t\t- Rice\n\t\t- Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes\n* Fiber\n\t+ Part of food not broken down by the body\n\t+ Slows digestion and helps feel fuller\n\n**Counting Your Carbs**\n\nMost foods, even vegetables, have some carbohydrates. But most green, non-starchy vegetables are very low in carbohydrates.\n\n* Most adults with diabetes should eat no more than 200 carbohydrate grams per day.\n* The daily recommended amount for adults is 135 grams per day, but each person should have their own carbohydrate goal.\n* Pregnant women need at least 175 grams of carbohydrates each day.\n\n**Using Food Labels**\n\nPackaged foods have labels that tell you how many carbohydrates a food has. They are measured in grams. You can use food labels to count the carbohydrates that you eat.\n\n* A serving (sometimes also called a carb) equals an amount of food that contains 15 grams of carbohydrate.\n* The serving size listed on a package is not always the same as 1 serving in carbohydrate counting.\n* If a bag of chips says that it contains 2 servings and you eat the entire bag, then you will need to multiply the label information by 2 to know how much of the nutrients you have eaten.\n\n**Adding Up Your Carbohydrates**\n\nThe total amount of carbohydrates you eat in a day is the sum of the carbohydrates in everything you eat.\n\n* Use a log book, a sheet of paper, or an app to help you track them.\n* As time passes, it will get easier to estimate your carbohydrates.\n* Plan to see a dietitian every 6 months. This will help you refresh your knowledge of carb counting.\n\n---\n\n**Counting Carbohydrates**\n\nWhen counting carbohydrates, you need to include sugar and fiber plus the starch. The grams of starch are not explicitly indicated on the nutrition facts label. Use only the total number to count your carbs.\n\n**Measuring Portion Sizes**\n\nWhen you count carbs in foods that you cook, you will have to measure the portion of food after cooking it. For example, cooked long grain rice has 15 grams of carbohydrate per 1/3 cup. If you eat a cup of cooked long grain rice, you will be eating 45 grams of carbohydrates, or 3 carbohydrate servings.\n\n**Examples of Foods and Servings Sizes**\n\nHere are some examples of foods and servings sizes that have approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate:\n\n* Half cup (107 grams) of canned fruit (without the juice or syrup)\n* One cup (109 grams) of melon or berries\n* Two tablespoons (19 grams) of dried fruit (such as raisins)\n* Half cup (121 grams) of cooked oatmeal\n* One-third cup of cooked pasta (44 grams) (can vary with the shape)\n* One-third cup (67 grams) of cooked long grain rice\n* One-fourth cup (51 grams) of cooked short grain rice\n* Half cup (88 grams) cooked beans, peas, or corn\n* One oz (28 grams) slice of bread\n* Three cups (33 grams) popcorn (popped)\n* One cup (240 milliliters) milk or soy milk\n* Three ounces (84 grams) of baked potato\n\n**Adding Up Your Carbohydrates**\n\nThe total amount of carbohydrates you eat in a day is the sum of the carbohydrates in everything you eat. When you are learning how to count carbs, use a log book, a sheet of paper, or an app to help you track them. As time passes, it will get easier to estimate your carbohydrates.\n\nPlan to see a dietitian every 6 months. This will help you refresh your knowledge of carb counting. A dietitian can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrate servings to eat each day, based on your personal caloric needs and other factors. The dietitian can also recommend how to distribute your daily carbohydrate intake evenly among your meals and snacks.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCarb counting; Carbohydrate-controlled diet; Diabetic diet; Diabetes-counting carbohydrate\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association website.

    "content": "**Cow's Milk and Children**\n\nIf your child is under 1 year old, you should not feed your baby cow's milk, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This is because cow's milk doesn't provide enough of certain nutrients such as vitamin E, iron, and essential fatty acids. Also, it's hard for your baby to digest the protein and fat in cow's milk. It is safe though, to give cow's milk to children after they're 1 year old.\n\n**Whole Milk for Developing Brains**\n\nA child who is 1 or 2 years old should only drink whole milk. This is because the fat in whole milk is needed for your child's developing brain. After 2 years old, children can drink low-fat milk or even skim milk if they are overweight.\n\n**Problems with Cow's Milk**\n\nSome children have problems from drinking cow's milk. For instance, a milk allergy may cause:\n\n* Belly pain or cramping\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n\nA severe allergy can cause bleeding in the intestines that can lead to anemia. But only about 1% to 3% of children under 1 year old have a milk allergy. It is even less common in children who are older than 1 to 3 years.\n\nLactose intolerance occurs when the small intestine does not make enough of the enzyme lactase. A child who is lactose intolerant can't digest lactose. This is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. The condition can cause bloating and diarrhea.\n\n**Alternative Options**\n\nIf your child has one of these problems, your health care provider may recommend soy milk. But many children who are allergic to milk are also allergic to soy.\n\nChildren usually outgrow allergies or intolerances by the time they are 1 year old. But having one food allergy increases the risk for having other types of allergies.\n\nIf your child can't have dairy or soy, talk to your provider about other food options that will help your child get enough protein and calcium.\n\n**Recommended Daily Amounts of Dairy**\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture recommends the following daily amounts of dairy for children and teens:\n\n* Under 2 years old: 1? to 2 cups (c) (400 to 480 milliliters [mL])\n* 2 through 8 years old: 2 to 2½ c (480 to 600 mL)\n* 9 through 18 years old: 3 c (710 mL)\n\n**Equivalents of Dairy**\n\n1 c (240 ml) of dairy equals:\n\n* 1 c (240 mL) of milk\n* 8 ounces (oz) (240 mL) of yogurt\n* 2 oz (56 grams) of processed American cheese\n* 1 c (240 mL) of pudding made with milk\n\n---\n\n**Cow's Milk and Children**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Introduce Cow's Milk**\n\nIt is safe to give cow's milk to children after they are 1 year old.

The condition can cause bloating and diarrhea.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recommendations for Dairy Intake**\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture recommends the following daily amounts of dairy for children and teens:\n\n*   Under 2 years old: 1 to 2 cups (400 to 480 milliliters)\n*   2 through 8 years old: 2 to 2½ cups (480 to 600 milliliters)\n*   9 through 18 years old: 3 cups (710 milliliters)\n\n1 cup of dairy equals:\n\n*   1 cup of milk\n*   8 ounces of yogurt\n*   2 oz of processed American cheese\n*   1 cup of pudding made with milk\n\n---\n\n**Cow's Milk and Children**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Much Dairy Should I Provide for My Child Under the Age of Two?**\n\nWhen it comes to dairy consumption, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two years old consume one to two cups (240-480 ml) of whole cow's milk per day. This amount is sufficient for most toddlers, but it's essential to note that breast milk or formula should still be the primary source of nutrition for infants.\n\n**The Importance of Whole Cow's Milk**\n\nWhole cow's milk contains essential nutrients like protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals that support a child's growth and development. The fatty acids in whole cow's milk also help with brain development and may reduce the risk of allergies.\n\n**Alternatives to Whole Cow's Milk**\n\nIf you're concerned about your child's dairy intake or have trouble introducing cow's milk into their diet, consider these alternatives:\n\n*   Breast milk or formula for infants\n*   Low-fat or skim milk for children over two years old who are accustomed to whole cow's milk\n\nConsult with your pediatrician before making any changes to your child's diet.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Child Nutrition\n*   Toddler Nutrition",

    "content": "**Cowden Syndrome**\n\n_Cowden syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous, tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of developing certain cancers._\n\n* **Hamartomas**: Almost everyone with Cowden syndrome develops hamartomas. These growths are most commonly found on the skin and mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth and nose), but they can also occur in the intestine and other parts of the body.\n* **Cancer Risk**: Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, particularly cancers of the breast, thyroid, and endometrium. Other cancers that have been identified in people with Cowden syndrome include kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* **Macrocephaly**: An enlarged head (macrocephaly) is a common feature of Cowden syndrome.\n* **Lhermitte-Duclos Disease**: A rare, noncancerous brain tumor called Lhermitte-Duclos disease can occur in people with Cowden syndrome.\n* **Delayed Development**: A small percentage of affected individuals have delayed development, intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorder.\n\n**Overlapping Features**\n\n* **Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome**: The features of Cowden syndrome overlap with those of another disorder called Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome.\n* **PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**: Researchers have proposed that Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome represent a spectrum of overlapping features known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Cowden Syndrome**\n\n_Cowden syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous, tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of developing certain cancers._\n\n* **Hamartomas**: Almost everyone with Cowden syndrome develops hamartomas. These growths are most commonly found on the skin and mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth and nose), but they can also occur in the intestine and other parts of the body.\n* **Cancer Risk**: Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, particularly cancers of the breast, thyroid, and endometrium. Other cancers that have been identified in people with Cowden syndrome include kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma.\n\n**Overlapping Features with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome**\n\n_The features of Cowden syndrome overlap with those of another disorder called Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. People with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome also develop hamartomas and other noncancerous tumors._\n\n* **PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**: Based on these similarities, researchers have proposed that Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome represent a spectrum of overlapping features known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (named for the genetic cause of the conditions) instead of two distinct conditions.\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Changes in the PTEN, KLLN, or WWP1 gene are most commonly identified in people with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome._\n\n* **PTEN Gene**: About 25 percent of Cowden syndrome and a small percentage of cases of Cowden-like syndrome result from mutations in the PTEN gene. The protein produced from the PTEN gene is a tumor suppressor, which means that it normally prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n* **KLLN Gene**: Rarely, Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome result from a change involving the KLLN gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called killin. Like the protein produced from the PTEN gene, killin probably acts as a tumor suppressor.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n_Although the exact prevalence of Cowden syndrome is unknown, researchers estimate that it affects about 1 in 200,000 people._\n\n---\n\n**Cowden Syndrome: Understanding the Genetic Cause**\n\nCowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome are rare genetic disorders characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas, an increased risk of cancer, and other features such as macrocephaly and intellectual disability.\n\n**The PTEN Gene: A Tumor Suppressor**\n\nAbout 25 percent of Cowden syndrome cases result from mutations in the PTEN gene. The protein produced from this gene acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the PTEN gene lead to uncontrolled cell division and the formation of hamartomas and cancerous tumors.\n\n**The KLLN Gene: A Rare Cause**\n\nRarely, Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome result from a change involving the KLLN gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called killin, which likely acts as a tumor suppressor. The genetic change that causes these syndromes leads to reduced production of the killin protein, allowing abnormal cells to survive and proliferate inappropriately.\n\n**The WWP1 Gene: A Gain-of-Function Variant**\n\nA small percentage of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome cases are associated with variants in the WWP1 gene. The WWP1 protein is involved in the process that targets other proteins for degradation within cells. In this process, the WWP1 protein attaches to the PTEN protein, impairing its function. WWP1 gene variants are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they enhance the activity of the WWP1 protein, leading to excessive binding and impaired PTEN tumor suppressor activity.\n\n**Other Genes Involved**\n\nMutations in a few other genes, such as AKT1, PIK3CA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SEC23B, are each responsible for a very small percentage of cases of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. In the remaining cases, the genetic cause is unknown.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition and increase the risk of developing cancer. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent; other cases may result from new mutations in the gene.\n\n---\n\n**Cowden Syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What is Cowden Syndrome?**\n\nCowden syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas in various organs and an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that if a parent has the condition, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene.\n\n**Causes of Cowden Syndrome**\n\nThe causes of Cowden syndrome can be attributed to two main factors:\n\n1. **Inheritance**: In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n2. **New Mutations**: Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene, which occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for Cowden Syndrome**\n\n* CD\n* Cowden disease\n* Cowden's disease\n* Cowden's syndrome\n* CS\n* Multiple hamartoma syndrome\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome 4\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome 5\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome 6\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Cowden syndrome 7\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Cowden syndrome\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* COWDEN SYNDROME 1; CWS1\n* COWDEN SYNDROME 4; CWS4\n* COWDEN SYNDROME 5; CWS5\n* COWDEN SYNDROME 6; CWS6\n* COWDEN SYNDROME 7; CWS7\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Cowden Syndrome**\n\n**Predisposition to Cancer**\n\nIndividuals with Cowden syndrome are predisposed to develop certain types of cancer, including breast and thyroid cancer. Research has shown that germline variants in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes can modify the risk of developing these cancers.\n\n*   A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that individuals with Cowden syndrome who had germline SDHx variants were at increased risk of developing breast and thyroid cancer.

[2]\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify individuals with Cowden syndrome who are at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The PTEN genetic test is a commonly used test to detect germline mutations in the PTEN gene, which is associated with Cowden syndrome.\n\n*   A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found that a clinical scoring system could be used to select patients for PTEN mutation testing. [3]\n*   Another study published in the Clinical Cancer Research journal found that lifetime cancer risks were increased in individuals with germline PTEN mutations.

    "content": "**Cranial Mononeuropathy VI**\n\n_Causes_\n\nDamage to the sixth cranial nerve, also known as the abducens nerve, which helps move your eye sideways toward your temple. Disorders of this nerve can occur with:\n\n*   Brain aneurysms\n*   Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)\n*   Gradenigo syndrome (which also causes discharge from the ear and eye pain)\n*   Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (inflammation of the area behind the eye)\n*   Increased or decreased pressure in the skull\n*   Infections (such as meningitis or sinusitis)\n*   Multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Stroke\n*   Trauma (caused by head injury or accidentally during surgery)\n*   Tumors around or behind the eye\n\nWhile rare, it can also be present at birth (congenital). The exact cause of vaccination-related cranial nerve palsy in children is not known. Because there are common nerve pathways through the skull, the same disorder that damages the sixth cranial nerve may affect other cranial nerves (such as the third or fourth cranial nerve).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen the sixth cranial nerve doesn't work properly, you can't turn your eye outward toward your ear. You can still move your eye up, down, and toward the nose, unless other nerves are affected.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Double vision when looking to one side\n*   Headaches\n*   Pain around the eye\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests often show that one eye has trouble looking to the side while the other eye moves normally. An exam shows the eyes do not line up either at rest or when looking in the direction of the weak eye.\n\nYour health care provider will do a complete exam to determine the possible effect on other parts of the nervous system. Depending on the suspected cause, you may need:\n\n*   Blood tests\n*   Head imaging study (such as an MRI or CT scan)\n*   Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)\n\nYou may need to be referred to a doctor who specializes in vision problems related to the nervous system (neuro-ophthalmologist).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf your provider diagnoses swelling or inflammation of, or around the nerve, medicines called corticosteroids may be used.\n\nSometimes, the condition disappears without treatment. If you have diabetes, you'll be advised to keep tight control of your blood sugar level.\n\nYour provider may prescribe an eye patch to relieve the double vision. The patch can be removed after the nerve heals.\n\nSurgery or special glasses (prisms) may be advised if there is no recovery in 6 to 12 months.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreating the cause may improve the condition. Recovery often occurs within 3 months in older adults who have hypertension or diabetes. There is less chance of recovery in case of complete paralysis of the sixth nerve. The chances of recovery are less in children than in adults in case of traumatic injury of the nerve. Recovery is usually complete in cases of benign sixth nerve palsy in childhood.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include permanent vision changes.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have double vision.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no way to prevent this condition. People with diabetes may reduce the risk by controlling their blood sugar.\n\n---\n\n**Cranial Mononeuropathy VI**\n\n_Causes_\n\nDamage to the sixth cranial nerve, also known as the abducens nerve, which helps move your eye sideways toward your temple.\n\nDisorders of this nerve can occur with:\n\n*   Brain aneurysms\n*   Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)\n*   Gradenigo syndrome (which also causes discharge from the ear and eye pain)\n*   Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (inflammation of the area behind the eye)\n*   Increased or decreased pressure in the skull\n*   Infections (such as meningitis or sinusitis)\n*   Multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Stroke\n*   Trauma (caused by head injury or accidentally during surgery)\n*   Tumors around or behind the eye\n\nWhile rare, it can also be present at birth (congenital).\n\nThe exact cause of vaccination-related cranial nerve palsy in children is not known.\n\nBecause there are common nerve pathways through the skull, the same disorder that damages the sixth cranial nerve may affect other cranial nerves (such as the third or fourth cranial nerve).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen the sixth cranial nerve doesn't work properly, you can't turn your eye outward toward your ear.

Sometimes, they are called soft spots. These spaces are a part of normal development. The cranial bones remain separate for about 12 to 18 months. They then grow together as part of normal growth. They stay connected throughout adulthood.\n\nTwo fontanelles usually are present on a newborn's skull:\n\n* On the top of the middle head, just forward of center (anterior fontanelle)\n* In the back of the middle of the head (posterior fontanelle)\n\nThe posterior fontanelle usually closes by age 1 to 2 months. It may already be closed at birth.\n\nThe anterior fontanelle usually closes sometime within 7 to 19 months of age.\n\n**Function and Importance**\n\nThe sutures and fontanelles are needed for the infant's brain growth and development. During childbirth, the flexibility of the sutures allows the bones to overlap so the baby's head can pass through the birth canal without pressing on and damaging their brain.\n\nDuring infancy and childhood, the sutures are flexible. This allows the brain to grow quickly and protects the brain from minor impacts to the head (such as when the infant is learning to hold his head up, roll over, and sit up). Without flexible sutures and fontanelles, the child's brain could not grow enough. The child would develop brain damage.\n\n**Assessment and Diagnosis**\n\nFeeling the cranial sutures and fontanelles is one way that health care providers follow the child's growth and development. They are able to assess the pressure inside the brain by feeling the tension of the fontanelles. The fontanelles should feel flat and firm. Bulging fontanelles may be a sign of increased pressure within the brain. In this case, providers may need to use imaging techniques to see the brain structure, such as CT scan or MRI scan.

    "content": "**Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\n_Craniofacial microsomia is a term used to describe a spectrum of abnormalities that primarily affect the development of the skull (cranium) and face before birth. Microsomia means abnormal smallness of body structures._\n\n_*Facial Characteristics:_*\n\n*   Underdevelopment of one side of the upper or lower jaw (maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia)\n*   Differences in size and shape of facial structures between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry)\n\n_*Ear Abnormalities:_*\n\n*   Growths of skin (skin tags) in front of the ear (preauricular tags)\n*   An underdeveloped or absent external ear (microtia or anotia)\n*   A closed or absent ear canal\n\n_*Eye Problems:_*\n\n*   An unusually small eyeball (microphthalmia)\n*   Other eye abnormalities that result in vision loss\n\n_*Other Abnormalities:_*\n\n*   Malformed bones of the spine (vertebrae)\n*   Abnormally shaped kidneys\n*   Heart defects\n\n---\n\n**Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\n_Craniofacial microsomia is a term used to describe a spectrum of abnormalities that primarily affect the development of the skull (cranium) and face before birth._\n\n*Microsomia means abnormal smallness of body structures.*\n\nMost people with craniofacial microsomia have differences in the size and shape of facial structures between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). In about two-thirds of cases, both sides of the face have abnormalities, which usually differ from one side to the other. Other individuals with craniofacial microsomia are affected on only one side of the face.\n\nThe facial characteristics in craniofacial microsomia typically include underdevelopment of one side of the upper or lower jaw (maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia), which can cause dental problems and difficulties with feeding and speech. In cases of severe mandibular hypoplasia, breathing may also be affected.\n\n**Ear Abnormalities**\n\nPeople with craniofacial microsomia usually have ear abnormalities affecting one or both ears, typically to different degrees. They may have growths of skin (skin tags) in front of the ear (preauricular tags), an underdeveloped or absent external ear (microtia or anotia), or a closed or absent ear canal; these abnormalities may lead to hearing loss.\n\n**Eye Problems**\n\nEye problems are less common in craniofacial microsomia, but some affected individuals have an unusually small eyeball (microphthalmia) or other eye abnormalities that result in vision loss.\n\n**Other Abnormalities**\n\nAbnormalities in other parts of the body, such as malformed bones of the spine (vertebrae), abnormally shaped kidneys, and heart defects, may also occur in people with craniofacial microsomia.\n\n**Many Other Terms Have Been Used for Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\nThese other names generally refer to forms of craniofacial microsomia with specific combinations of signs and symptoms, although sometimes they are used interchangeably. Hemifacial microsomia often refers to craniofacial microsomia with maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia. People with hemifacial microsomia and noncancerous (benign) growths in the eye called epibulbar dermoids may be said to have Goldenhar syndrome or oculoauricular dysplasia.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCraniofacial microsomia has been estimated to occur in between 1 in 5,600 and 1 in 26,550 newborns. However, this range may be an underestimate because not all medical professionals agree on the criteria for diagnosis of this condition, and because mild cases may never come to medical attention. For reasons that are unclear, the disorder occurs about 50 percent more often in males than in females.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIt is unclear what genes are involved in craniofacial microsomia. This condition results from problems in the development of structures in the embryo called the first and second pharyngeal arches (also called branchial or visceral arches). Tissue layers in the six pairs of pharyngeal arches give rise to the muscles, arteries, nerves, and cartilage of the face and neck. Specifically, the first and second pharyngeal arches develop into the lower jaw, the nerves and muscles used for chewing and facial expression, the external ear, and the bones of the middle ear. Interference with the normal development of these structures can result in the abnormalities characteristic of craniofacial microsomia.\n\nThere are several factors that can disrupt the normal development of the first and second pharyngeal arches and lead to craniofacial microsomia. Some individuals with this condition have chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions or duplications of genetic material; these individuals often have additional developmental problems or malformations. Occasionally, craniofacial microsomia occurs in multiple members of a family in a pattern that suggests inheritance of a causative gene mutation, but the gene or genes involved are unknown.\n\nIn other families, individuals seem to inherit a predisposition to the disorder. The risk of craniofacial microsomia can also be increased by environmental factors, such as certain drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy. In most affected individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\n**What is Craniofacial Microsomia?**\n\nCraniofacial microsomia, also known as hemifacial microsomia (HFM), is a congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the face and ears on one side of the body. The condition can vary in severity and may affect different structures of the face and neck.\n\n**Causes of Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\nThe exact cause of craniofacial microsomia is unknown, but it is believed to result from problems in the development of the first and second pharyngeal arches during embryonic development. These structures give rise to the muscles, arteries, nerves, and cartilage of the face and neck.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nCertain disruptions to development can affect the first and second pharyngeal arches, leading to craniofacial microsomia. Some individuals with this condition have chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions or duplications of genetic material; these individuals often have additional developmental problems or malformations.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nCraniofacial microsomia most often occurs in a single individual in a family and is not inherited. In 1 to 2 percent of cases, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCraniofacial microsomia has been referred to by various names, including:\n\n* Asymmetric hypoplasia of facial structures\n* Auriculobranchiogenic dysplasia\n* CFM (craniofacial microsomia)\n* Facioauriculovertebral dysplasia (FAV)\n* First and second branchial arch syndrome\n* First and second pharyngeal arch syndromes\n* Goldenhar syndrome\n* Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome\n* Hemifacial microsomia (HFM)\n* Lateral facial dysplasia\n* OAV complex (oculoauriculovertebral spectrum)\n* OAVS (oculoauriculovertebral syndrome)\n* Oral-mandibular-auricular syndrome\n* Otomandibular dysostosis\n* Unilateral intrauterine facial necrosis\n* Unilateral mandibulofacial dysostosis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on craniofacial microsomia, you may want to consider the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Craniofacial microsomia 1\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CRANIOFACIAL MICROSOMIA 1; CFM1\n\n---\n\n**Craniofacial Microsomia**\n\n**What is Craniofacial Microsomia?**\n\nCraniofacial microsomia, also known as hemifacial microsomia, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the face and ears on one side of the body. It is often associated with other abnormalities such as cleft palate, hearing loss, and skeletal deformities.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of craniofacial microsomia is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations or environmental factors during fetal development.

    "content": "**Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia?**\n\nCraniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare condition characterized by thickening (overgrowth) of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities in a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. The abnormal bone growth continues throughout life. Except in the most severe cases, the lifespan of people with craniometaphyseal dysplasia is normal.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nBone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excess bone formation in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent (non-erupting) teeth. Infants with craniometaphyseal dysplasia may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can pinch (compress) the nerves that extend from the brain to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly long bones in the legs. The ends of these bones are wider and appear less dense than usual in people with this condition.\n\n**Types of Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\nThere are two types of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. They are known as the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive types.\n\n---\n\n**Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia?**\n\nCraniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare condition characterized by thickening (overgrowth) of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities in a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. The abnormal bone growth continues throughout life.\n\n**Types of Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\nThere are two types of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause:\n\n* Autosomal dominant: caused by mutations in the ANKH gene\n* Autosomal recessive: caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nAffected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excess bone formation in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent (non-erupting) teeth. Infants with craniometaphyseal dysplasia may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCraniometaphyseal dysplasia is a very rare disorder; its incidence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ANKH gene cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The ANKH protein plays a role in bone remodeling, and mutations that impair its function can contribute to the bone abnormalities.\n\n* Autosomal dominant: ANKH gene mutations\n* Autosomal recessive: GJA1 gene mutation (unknown genetic cause for many cases)\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nLearn more about the genes associated with Craniometaphyseal dysplasia:\n\n* ANKH\n* GJA1\n\n---\n\n**Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia?**\n\nCraniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of bones and cartilage. It is characterized by abnormal bone growth, leading to deformities of the skull, face, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Causes of Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\nThe causes of CMD are still not fully understood, but research has identified several genes that may be involved in its development. The GJA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin 43, which is involved in the development of many tissues in the body, including bone. Mutations in this gene have been linked to autosomal recessive CMD.\n\nAnother gene, ANKH, has been associated with autosomal dominant CMD. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a crucial role in bone remodeling. Mutations in this gene can lead to abnormal bone growth and deformities.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCMD can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. In the autosomal dominant form, one altered copy of the ANKH gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Individuals with this form typically have a parent who also has the condition. Less often, cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nIn the autosomal recessive form, both copies of the GJA1 gene in each cell are altered. The parents of an individual with this form typically do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder, as they carry only one mutated copy of the gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCMD is also known by several other names, including:\n\n* Autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia\n* Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia\n* CMD (Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia)\n* CMDD (Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia, Jackson type)\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\nGenetic testing is available for CMD. The Genetic Testing Registry lists two tests: one for autosomal dominant CMD and another for autosomal recessive CMD.\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide more information on the genetic causes of CMD:\n\n* Addison WN, Azari F, Sorensen ES, Kaartinen MT, McKee MD.

This can cause the shape of your child's head to be different than normal. Sometimes, it can slow normal brain development.\n\nDuring surgery:\n\n* The surgeon made 2 to 3 small cuts (incisions) on your child's scalp if an instrument called an endoscope was used.\n* One or more larger incisions were made if open surgery was done.\n* Pieces of abnormal bone were removed.\n* The surgeon either reshaped these bone pieces and put them back in or left the pieces out.\n* Metal plates and some small screws may have been put in place to help hold the bones in the right position.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nSwelling and bruising on your child's head will get better after 7 days. But swelling around the eyes may come and go for up to 3 weeks.\n\nYour child's sleeping patterns may be different after getting home from the hospital. Your child may be awake at night and sleep during the day. This should go away as your child gets used to being at home.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nYour child's surgeon may prescribe a special helmet to be worn, starting at some point after the surgery.

The standard surgery is called open repair and includes:\n\n*   A surgical cut made over the top of the head, from just above one ear to just above the other ear.\n*   A flap of skin, tissue, and muscle loosened and raised up so the surgeon can see the bone.\n*   A strip of bone removed where two sutures are fused. This is called a strip craniectomy. Sometimes, wider pieces of bone must also be removed. This is called synostectomy.\n*   The bones around the eyes may be cut and reshaped.\n\n**Surgery Details**\n\nThe surgery usually takes 3 to 7 hours. Your child might need (36 to 70%) to have a blood transfusion during or after surgery to replace blood that is lost during the surgery.\n\nA newer kind of surgery is used for some children. This type is usually done for children younger than 3 to 6 months old. The surgeon makes one or two small cuts in the scalp, and removes portions of bones through the cuts.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nCraniosynostosis is a condition that causes one or more of the baby's sutures to close too early. The suture becomes bone. This can cause the shape of your baby's head to be different than normal. It can sometimes limit how much the brain can grow.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Infection, including in the lungs and urinary tract\n*   Blood loss (children having an open repair may need one or more transfusions)\n*   Reaction to medicines\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n*   Superficial infections\n*   Deep infections in the brain\n*   Bones connect together again, and more surgery is needed\n*   Brain swelling, bleeding, stroke, and seizures\n*   Damage to brain tissue \n*   Cardiac events \n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nIf the surgery is planned, you will need to take the following steps:\n\n*   During the days before the surgery:\n    *   Tell your surgeon what medicines, vitamins, or herbs you are giving your child.\n    *   Ask the surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\n*   On the day of the surgery:\n    *   Give your child a small sip of water with any medicines your surgeon told you to give your child.\n    *   Your child's surgeon will tell you when to arrive for the surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter open (non-endoscopic) surgery, your child will be taken to an intensive care unit (ICU). Your child will be moved to a regular hospital room after a day or two. Your child will stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days.\n\nYour child will have a large bandage wrapped around the head. There will also be a tube going into a vein. This is called an IV.\nThe nurses will watch your child closely.\nTests will be done to see if your child lost too much blood during surgery. A blood transfusion will be given, if needed.\nYour child will have swelling and bruising around the eyes and face. Sometimes, the eyes may be swollen shut. This often gets worse in the first 3 days after surgery. It should be better by day 7.\n\nMost children who have endoscopic surgery can go home after staying in the hospital one night.\n\nFollow the instructions given to you on caring for your child at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, the outcome from craniosynostosis repair is good.\n\n---\n\n**Craniosynostosis Repair**\n\n_Craniosynostosis repair is surgery to correct a problem that causes the bones of a child's skull to grow together (fuse) too early._\n\n**Description**\n\nThis surgery is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. Some or all of the hair will be shaved.\n\nThe standard surgery is called open repair. It includes these steps:\n\n*   The most common place for a surgical cut to be made is over the top of the head, from just above one ear to just above the other ear.\n*   A flap of skin, tissue, and muscle below the skin, and the tissue covering the bone are loosened and raised up so the surgeon can see the bone.\n*   A strip of bone is usually removed where two sutures are fused. This is called a strip craniectomy. Sometimes, wider pieces of bone must also be removed. This is called synostectomy.\n*   Parts of these bones may be changed or reshaped when they are removed. Then, they may be put back in place. Other times, they are not.\n*   Sometimes, bones that are left in place need to be shifted or moved.\n*   Sometimes, the bones around the eyes are cut and reshaped.\n\nBones are fastened using small plates with screws that go into the skull. The plates and screws can be metal or a resorbable material (disappears over time). The plates may expand as the skull grows.\n\nSurgery usually takes 3 to 7 hours. Your child might need (36 to 70%) to have a blood transfusion during or after surgery to replace blood that is lost during the surgery.\n\nA newer kind of surgery is used for some children. This type is usually done for children younger than 3 to 6 months old.\n\nThe surgeon makes one or two small cuts in the scalp. Most times, these cuts are each just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long. These cuts are made above the area where the bone needs to be removed.\n\nA tube (endoscope) is passed through the small cuts. The scope allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on. Special medical devices and a camera are passed through the endoscope. Using these devices, the surgeon removes portions of bones through the cuts.\n\nThis surgery usually takes about 1 to 2 hours. There is much less blood loss and a faster recovery with this kind of surgery.\n\nMost children need to wear a special helmet to protect their head for a period of time after surgery.\n\nChildren do best when they have this surgery when they are 3 months old. The surgery should be done before the child is 6 months old.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA baby's head, or skull, is made up of eight different bones. The connections between these bones are called sutures. When a baby is born, it is normal for these sutures to be open a little. As long as the sutures are open, the baby's skull and brain can grow.\n\nCraniosynostosis is a condition that causes one or more of the baby's sutures to close too early. The suture becomes bone. This can cause the shape of your baby's head to be different than normal. It can sometimes limit how much the brain can grow.\n\nAn x-ray, CT scan, or MRI can be used to diagnose craniosynostosis. Surgery is usually needed to correct it.\n\nSurgery separates the sutures that are fused. It also reshapes the brow, eye sockets, and skull as needed. The goals of surgery are:\n\n*   To relieve pressure on the child's brain\n*   To make sure there is enough room in the skull to allow the brain to properly grow\n*   To improve the appearance of the child's head\n*   To prevent long-term neurocognitive issues\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Infection, including in the lungs and urinary tract\n*   Blood loss (children having an open repair may need one or more transfusions)\n*   Reaction to medicines\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n*   Superficial infections\n*   Deep infections in the brain\n*   Bones connect together again, and more surgery is needed\n*   Brain swelling, bleeding, stroke, and seizures\n*   Damage to brain tissue \n*   Cardiac events \n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nIf the surgery is planned, you will need to take the following steps:\n\nDuring the days before the surgery:\n\n*   Tell your surgeon what medicines, vitamins, or herbs you are giving your child. This includes anything you bought without a prescription. You may be asked to stop giving your child some of these medicines in the days before the surgery.\n*   Ask the surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n*   Give your child a small sip of water with any medicines your surgeon told you to give your child.\n*   Your child's surgeon will tell you when to arrive for the surgery.\n\nAsk your surgeon if your child can eat or drink before surgery. In general:\n\n*   Older children should not eat any food or drink any milk after midnight before the operation. They can have clear juice, water, and breast milk up to 4 hours before surgery.\n*   Infants younger than 12 months can usually eat formula, cereal, or baby food until about 6 hours before surgery. They may have clear fluids and breast milk until 4 hours before surgery.\n\nYour surgeon may ask you to wash your child with a special soap on the morning of the surgery. Rinse your child well.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter open (non-endoscopic) surgery, your child will be taken to an intensive care unit (ICU). Your child will be moved to a regular hospital room after a day or two. Your child will stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days.\n\nYour child will have a large bandage wrapped around the head. There will also be a tube going into a vein. This is called an IV.\nThe nurses will watch your child closely.\nTests will be done to see if your child lost too much blood during surgery. A blood transfusion will be given, if needed.\nYour child will have swelling and bruising around the eyes and face. Sometimes, the eyes may be swollen shut. This often gets worse in the first 3 days after surgery. It should be better by day 7.\nYour child should stay in bed for the first few days. The head of your child's bed will be raised. This helps keep the swelling down.\n\nTalking, singing, playing music, and telling stories may help soothe your child. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used for pain. Your surgeon can prescribe other pain medicines if your child needs them.\n\nMost children who have endoscopic surgery can go home after staying in the hospital one night.\n\nFollow the instructions given to you on caring for your child at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, the outcome from craniosynostosis repair is good.\n\n---\n\n**Craniosynostosis Repair**\n\n_Craniosynostosis repair is surgery to correct a problem that causes the bones of a child's skull to grow together (fuse) too early._\n\n**Description**\n\nThis surgery is done in the operating room under general anesthesia.

    "content": "**Craniosynostosis**\n\n_Craniosynostosis is a birth defect in which one or more sutures on a baby's head closes earlier than usual._\n\nThe skull of an infant or young child is made up of bony plates that are still growing. The borders at which these plates intersect are called sutures or suture lines. The sutures allow for growth of the skull. They normally close (\"fuse\") by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old.\n\nEarly closing of a suture causes the baby to have an abnormally shaped head. This may limit brain growth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of craniosynostosis is not known. Genes may play a role, but there is usually no family history of the condition. It may be caused by external pressure on a baby's head before birth. Abnormal development of the base of the skull and the membranes around the skull bones is believed to affect the movement and position of the bones as they grow.\n\nIn cases when this is passed down through families, it may occur with other health problems, such as seizures, decreased intelligence, and blindness. Genetic disorders commonly linked to craniosynostosis include Crouzon, Apert, Carpenter, Saethre-Chotzen, and Pfeiffer syndromes.\n\nHowever, most children with craniosynostosis are otherwise healthy and have normal intelligence.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms depend on the type of craniosynostosis. They may include:\n\n* No \"soft spot\" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull\n* A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures\n* Unusual head shape\n* Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows\n\n**Types of Craniosynostosis**\n\n* **Sagittal Synostosis (Scaphocephaly)**: The most common type. It affects the main suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.\n* **Frontal Plagiocephaly**: The next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It usually occurs on just one side, causing a flattened forehead, raised eyebrow, and prominent ear on that side. The baby's nose may also appear to be pulled toward that side. This is more common in girls than in boys.\n* **Metopic Synostosis**: A rare form that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, because the top of the head appears triangular, with a narrow or pointed forehead. It may range from mild to severe.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will feel the infant's head and perform a physical exam.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Measuring the circumference of the infant's head\n* X-rays of the skull\n* CT scan of the head\n\n---\n\n**Craniosynostosis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nThe cause of craniosynostosis is not known.

This can cause the head to become misshapen and may lead to complications if left untreated.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of craniosynostosis depend on the type and severity of the condition. They may include:\n\n* A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures\n* Unusual head shape\n* Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows\n\n**Types of Craniosynostosis**\n\nThere are several types of craniosynostosis, including:\n\n* **Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly)**: This is the most common type and affects the main suture on the very top of the head.

The following tests may be done:\n\n* Measuring the circumference of the infant's head\n* X-rays of the skull\n* CT scan of the head\n\nWell-child visits are an important part of your child's health care. They allow the provider to regularly check the growth of your infant's head over time, which will help identify any problems early.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is usually needed to treat craniosynostosis.

Complications may include:\n\n* Increased intracranial pressure\n* Seizures\n* Developmental delay\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if your child has:\n\n* Unusual head shape\n* Problems with growth\n* Unusual raised ridges on the skull\n\n---\n\n**Craniosynostosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Craniosynostosis?**\n\nCraniosynostosis is a condition where the bones of the skull fuse together too early, which can lead to complications such as hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. It is a rare congenital disorder that affects approximately 1 in 2,000 births.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of craniosynostosis is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations. Some studies suggest that environmental factors may also play a role in the development of the condition. There is no known way to prevent craniosynostosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nInfants with craniosynostosis may exhibit symptoms such as:\n\n*   A misshapen skull\n*   Increased intracranial pressure\n*   Hydrocephalus\n*   Delayed development\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a physical examination, imaging tests (such as X-rays or CT scans), and genetic testing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for craniosynostosis usually involves surgery to correct the shape of the skull and relieve any pressure on the brain. The type and timing of surgery may vary depending on the individual case.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis and Outlook**\n\nWith proper treatment, most children with craniosynostosis can lead normal lives with minimal long-term effects. However, some individuals may experience ongoing complications such as hydrocephalus or delayed development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Craniofacial Abnormalities\n*   Hydrocephalus\n*   Increased Intracranial Pressure",
