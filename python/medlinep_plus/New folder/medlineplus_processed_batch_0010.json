    "content": "**Allergy Blood Test**\n\nAn allergy blood test measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria.  But your immune system may also make them in response to allergens. These are harmless substances, such as pollen and peanuts, that may cause an allergic reaction in some people.\n\nIt's normal to have small amounts of IgE in your blood. But when you have an allergic reaction, your immune system sees the allergens as a threat and makes IgE antibodies. This increases the amount of IgE in your blood and causes your allergy symptoms.\n\n**Common Allergens**\n\nPollen\nDust\nMold\nAnimal dander\nCertain foods, including nuts and shellfish\nCertain medicines, such as penicillin\n\nAllergy symptoms can be mild to severe, depending on the type of allergy you have. They can range from itching and sneezing to asthma or even a life-threatening condition called anaphylactic shock.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAllergy blood tests are used to help find out if you have an allergy. There are two general types of allergy blood tests:\n\n*   A total IgE test measures the total amount of IgE antibodies in your blood.\n*   A specific IgE test measures how much IgE your body makes in response to a single allergen. A separate test is done for each allergen that may be causing your allergies.\n\n**Why do I need an allergy blood test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order allergy testing if you have symptoms of an allergy. These include:\n\n*   Stuffy or runny nose\n*   Sneezing\n*   Itchy, watery eyes\n*   Hives (itchy raised red patches on your skin)\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Coughing\n*   Wheezing\n\nYour provider may order an allergy blood test if you can't have allergy skin testing. Skin testing involves putting allergens directly on or into your skin. You may not be able to have skin testing if you:\n\n*   Have certain skin conditions\n*   Take certain medicines that may affect the results of the test\n*   Are likely to have a serious allergic reaction to the allergens used in skin testing\n\nIn certain cases, providers may order allergy blood tests for young children because skin testing may be too uncomfortable for them.\n\n**What happens during an allergy blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an allergy blood test. You may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, such as antihistamines, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having an allergy blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA total IgE test result that is high means that you may have some kind of allergy. But the results of a total IgE test don't show what you're allergic to or how serious your allergy may be.\n\nA specific IgE test result that is high means that you may be allergic to the allergen that was tested. But the amount of IgE measured doesn't predict how serious your allergy may be.\n\nIf the results from either type of test show that you could have an allergy, your provider may refer you to an allergy specialist or recommend a treatment plan. Your treatment plan will depend on what you are allergic to and how serious your symptoms are.\n\nIf you're at risk for anaphylactic shock, you'll need to be very careful to avoid the things you are allergic to. You may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment (an epinephrine auto-injector) with you at all times. Anaphylactic shock is most common with allergies to certain foods, medicines, insect bites and stings, and latex.\n\nAsk your provider if you are at risk for anaphylactic shock and discuss any questions you have about your test results or your allergy treatment plan.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy blood test?**\n\nAllergy blood tests may not always be accurate. Sometimes, the results may say you have an allergy when you actually don't (also known as a false positive). This may happen if your body is having a slight reaction to substances in certain foods that you may have eaten before the test. Higher amounts of IgE may also be caused by smoking or a parasitic infection.\n\nIt's uncommon for a blood test to show that you don't have an allergy when you actually do (also known as a false negative).\n\nDepending on your medical history and symptoms, your provider may order an allergy skin test with an allergy blood test, or you may have a skin test alone.\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Blood Test**\n\n**What is an Allergy Blood Test?**\n\nAn allergy blood test measures the levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in your blood. This type of test can help determine if you have allergies and what you may be allergic to.\n\n**When is an Allergy Blood Test Ordered?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an allergy blood test if you have symptoms of an allergy, such as:\n\n* Stuffy or runny nose\n* Sneezing\n* Itchy, watery eyes\n* Hives (itchy raised red patches on your skin)\n* Diarrhea\n* Vomiting\n* Shortness of breath\n* Coughing\n* Wheezing\n\nYour provider may also order an allergy blood test if you can't have allergy skin testing due to certain skin conditions, medications that may affect the results, or young children who may find skin testing uncomfortable.\n\n**What Happens During an Allergy Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.

A specific IgE test result that is high means you may be allergic to the allergen tested, but the amount of IgE measured doesn't predict how serious your allergy may be.\n\n**Treatment Plan**\n\nIf the results from either type of test show that you could have an allergy, your provider may refer you to an allergy specialist or recommend a treatment plan. Your treatment plan will depend on what you are allergic to and how serious your symptoms are.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know?**\n\nAllergy blood tests may not always be accurate. Sometimes, the results may say you have an allergy when you actually don't (false positive), which can happen if your body is having a slight reaction to substances in certain foods that you may have eaten before the test.

This article will guide you through the process and help you understand what to expect.\n\n**What is an Allergy Blood Test?**\n\nAn allergy blood test measures the levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in your blood. It's a simple, painless procedure that can help diagnose allergies and monitor treatment effectiveness.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\nThe test involves drawing a small sample of blood from a vein in your arm. The blood is then sent to a laboratory where it's tested for the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. The results are usually available within 24-48 hours.\n\n**What Can I Expect During the Test?**\n\nThe testing process typically takes around 30 minutes to an hour. You'll be seated comfortably, and a healthcare professional will insert a needle into a vein in your arm to collect a blood sample. You may feel a slight pinch or discomfort during the procedure, but it's usually mild.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of your allergy blood test will show the levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in your blood. If the levels are high, it may indicate an allergic reaction. Your healthcare provider will interpret the results and discuss them with you.\n\n**When is an Allergy Blood Test Ordered?**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order an allergy blood test if:\n\n* You have a history of allergies or asthma\n* You're experiencing symptoms such as itching, hives, or difficulty breathing\n* You've been exposed to potential allergens and are concerned about your reaction\n\n**What Are the Benefits of an Allergy Blood Test?**\n\nAn allergy blood test offers several benefits, including:\n\n* Accurate diagnosis of allergies\n* Monitoring treatment effectiveness\n* Identifying potential allergens that may cause reactions\n\n**How Can I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nTo prepare for your allergy blood test, make sure to:\n\n* Arrive at least 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment\n* Wear comfortable clothing and remove any jewelry that may interfere with the testing process\n* Inform your healthcare provider about any medications you're taking or allergies you have\n\n**What Should I Expect After the Test?**\n\nAfter the test, your healthcare provider will discuss the results with you and provide guidance on next steps. If you have a positive result, they may recommend further testing or treatment to manage your allergy.\n\nRemember, an allergy blood test is a simple, painless procedure that can help you better understand your allergies and take control of your health.",

    "content": "**Allergy Skin Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn allergy skin test helps find out what is causing your allergic reaction by exposing your skin to allergy-causing substances known as allergens.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nYour immune system is your body's defense system. It usually fights germs. But when you have an allergy, your immune system sees a harmless substance, like dust or pollen, as a threat. Your immune system responds to this \"threat\" and causes an allergic reaction. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from sneezing and a stuffy nose to a life-threatening condition known as anaphylactic shock.\n\n**What happens during the test?**\n\nYou will most likely get tested by an allergist or a dermatologist. You may get one or more of the following allergy skin tests:\n\n*   An allergy scratch test, also known as a skin prick test, is the most common allergy skin test.\n*   During the test:\n    *   Your provider will place small drops of specific allergens on different areas on your skin, such as your forearm or back.\n    *   Your provider will then lightly scratch or prick your skin through each drop.\n    *   If you are allergic to any allergens, you will develop a hive or a small red bump, known as a wheal, at that area or areas within about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nTest results are usually reported as positive or negative:\n\n*   If you have red bumps or swelling at any testing areas, the test is positive. This means you are probably allergic to those substances.\n*   If you do not have red bumps or swelling at any of the testing areas, the test is negative. This means that you are probably not allergic to those substances.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy skin test?**\n\nYour provider may recommend an allergy blood test instead if you:\n\n*   Have a skin condition such as severe eczema or psoriasis on your arms and back where the skin is usually tested\n*   Are taking medicines that might interfere with test results\n*   Have had a severe allergic reaction in the past\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Skin Test**\n\nAn allergy skin test is used to diagnose certain allergies by exposing your skin to suspected allergens and observing any allergic reactions.\n\n**What is an Allergy?**\n\nAn allergy is an overreaction by your immune system to something that doesn't bother most people. Your immune system sees a harmless substance, like dust or pollen, as a threat and responds with an allergic reaction.\n\n**Types of Hypersensitivity Reactions**\n\nThere are four main types of hypersensitivity reactions:\n\n*   Type 1: causes common allergies such as dust mites, pollens, foods, and animal dander\n*   Type II: involves antibodies that attack cells or proteins\n*   Type III: involves the formation of antigen-antibody complexes that cause inflammation\n*   Type IV: a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that can cause skin rashes or other symptoms\n\n**Substances That Can Cause Allergic Reactions**\n\nThe test checks for reactions to specific allergens, including:\n\n*   Pollen\n*   Dust mites\n*   Molds\n*   Pet dander\n*   Food\n*   Insect bites and stings\n*   Medicines\n*   Household chemicals\n\n**What Happens During an Allergy Skin Test?**\n\nYou will most likely get tested by an allergist or a dermatologist. You may get one or more of the following allergy skin tests:\n\n*   An allergy scratch test, also known as a skin prick test, is the most common allergy skin test.\n*   An intradermal test may be used to see if you are allergic to insect stings and the medicine penicillin.\n*   A patch test checks to see if you have an allergic reaction to allergens that come in contact with your skin.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test. These could include antihistamines and certain antidepressants. Your provider will tell you which medicines to avoid before your test and for how long. They may also ask about any products you use on your skin and if you are normally around animals.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having allergy skin tests. The test itself is not painful. The most common side effect is red, itchy skin at the test areas.\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Skin Test**\n\n**What is an allergy skin test?**\n\nAn allergy skin test, also known as a prick test or scratch test, is a medical test used to determine if you have an allergic reaction to certain substances.

The test itself is not painful. The most common side effect is red, itchy skin at the test areas. In very rare cases, an allergy skin test may cause anaphylactic shock. This is why skin tests must be done in a provider's office where emergency equipment is available.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nTest results are usually reported as positive or negative:\n\n* If you have red bumps or swelling at any testing areas, the test is positive. This means you are probably allergic to those substances.\n* If you do not have red bumps or swelling at any of the testing areas, the test is negative. This means that you are probably not allergic to those substances.\n\n**What happens if I am diagnosed with an allergy?**\n\nIf you are diagnosed with an allergy, your provider will recommend a treatment plan. The plan may include:\n\n* Avoiding the allergen when possible\n* Medicines\n* Lifestyle changes such as reducing dust in your home\n\nYour provider will consider your symptoms and medical history to understand the results of an allergy skin test. They may also want to do a physical exam.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy skin test?**\n\nYour provider may recommend an allergy blood test instead if you:\n\n* Have a skin condition such as severe eczema or psoriasis on your arms and back where the skin is usually tested\n* Are taking medicines that might interfere with test results\n* Have had a severe allergic reaction in the past\n\nIf you are at risk for anaphylactic shock, you may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment with you at all times. Epinephrine is a drug used to treat severe allergies. It comes in a device called an epinephrine auto-injector that contains a premeasured amount of epinephrine. If you experience symptoms of anaphylactic shock, you should inject the device into your skin and call 911.\n\n**References**\n\n* Abbas M, Moussa M, Akel H.

In this article, we'll explore what they are, how they work, and what to expect during the test.\n\n**What is an Allergy Skin Test?**\n\nAn allergy skin test, also known as a prick test or scratch test, is a medical test used to diagnose allergies. During the test, a small amount of an allergen (such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander) is placed on your skin, and then pricked or scratched into the skin with a tiny needle.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\nWhen you're exposed to an allergen, your immune system reacts by releasing histamine, which causes symptoms like itching, redness, and swelling. The allergy skin test measures your body's reaction to specific allergens by checking for these symptoms on your skin.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe test typically takes 15-30 minutes to complete. You'll be seated comfortably, and a healthcare professional will place small amounts of different allergens on your skin using a device called a prick tester or scratch tester. The pricked or scratched area will be observed for any reaction, which can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes.\n\n**Types of Allergic Reactions**\n\nThere are four main types of allergic reactions:\n\n* **Type I**: Immediate hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by symptoms like itching, redness, and swelling.\n* **Type II**: Antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction, where antibodies attack cells or tissues.\n* **Type III**: Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, where immune complexes (antibodies attached to antigens) accumulate in tissues and cause inflammation.\n* **Type IV**: Delayed hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs 48-72 hours after exposure to an allergen.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Allergy\n* Anaphylaxis\n* Hay Fever\n* Immune System and Disorders\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* Allergy Blood Test\n* Celiac Disease Screening\n* Food Allergy Testing",

This is a substance that causes an allergic reaction. Examples of allergens include:\n\n* Mold spores\n* Dust mites\n* Animal dander\n* Pollen\n* Insect venom\n\nYour health care provider gives you the shots for 3 to 5 years. This series of allergy shots may help reduce your allergy symptoms.\n\nWork with your provider to identify which allergens are causing your symptoms. This is often done through allergy skin testing or blood tests. Only the allergens you are allergic to are in your allergy shots.\n\nAllergy shots are only one part of an allergy treatment plan. You may also take allergy medicines while having allergy shots. Your provider may recommend that you reduce your exposure to allergens, as well.\n\n**How do Allergy Shots Work?**\n\nAllergy symptoms occur when your immune system tries to attack an allergen in your body. When this happens, your body creates mucus. This can cause bothersome symptoms in the nose, eyes, and lungs.\n\nTreatment with allergy shots is also called immunotherapy. When a small amount of an allergen is injected into your body, your immune system makes a substance called an antibody that blocks the allergen from causing symptoms.\n\nAfter several months of shots, some or all of your symptoms may be relieved. Relief can last several years. For some people, allergy shots can prevent new allergies and reduce asthma symptoms.\n\n**Who can Benefit From Allergy Shots?**\n\nYou may benefit from allergy shots if you have:\n\n* Asthma that allergies make worse\n* Allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis\n* Insect bite sensitivity\n* Eczema, a skin condition that a dust mite allergy can make worse\n\nAllergy shots are effective for common allergens such as:\n\n* Weed, ragweed, tree pollen\n* Grass\n* Mold or fungus\n* Animal dander\n* Dust mites\n* Insect stings\n* Cockroaches\n\nAdults (including the older people) as well as children 5 years and older can receive allergy shots.\n\nYour provider is not likely to recommend allergy shots for you if you:\n\n* Have severe asthma.\n* Have a heart condition.\n* Take certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.\n* Are pregnant. Pregnant women should not begin allergy shots. But, they may be able to continue allergy shot treatment that was started before they became pregnant.\n\nFood allergies are not treated with allergy shots.\n\n**Getting Your Allergy Shots**\n\nYou will get your allergy shots at your provider's office. They are usually given in the upper arm. The typical schedule is:\n\n* For the first 3 to 6 months, you receive shots about 1 to 3 times a week.\n* For the next 3 to 5 years, you receive the shots less often, about every 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nKeep in mind that many visits are needed to get the full effects of this treatment. Your provider will assess your symptoms now and then to help decide when you can stop receiving the shots.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nAn allergy shot may cause a reaction on the skin, such as redness, swelling, and itching. Some people have mild nasal stuffiness or a runny nose.\n\nThough rare, an allergy shot can also cause a severe life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Because of this, you may need to stay in your provider's office for 30 minutes after your shot to check for this reaction.\n\nYou may also need to take an antihistamine or another medicine before your allergy shot appointments.

    "content": "**Allergy Testing - Skin**\n\n_*What is Allergy Testing?*_\n\nAllergy testing - skin is used to find out which substances cause a person to have an allergic reaction. These substances are called allergens.\n\n_*How is the Test Performed?*_\n\nThere are three common methods of allergy skin testing:\n\n1. **The Skin Prick Test**:\n\t* Placing a small amount of substances (allergens) that may be causing your symptoms on the skin, most often on the forearm, upper arm, or back.\n\t* The skin is then pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface.\n\t* The health care provider closely watches the skin for swelling and redness or other signs of a reaction. Results are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes.\n\t* Several allergens can be tested at the same time.\n2. **The Intradermal Skin Test**:\n\t* Injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin.\n\t* The provider then watches for a reaction at the site.\n\t* This test is more likely to be used to find out if you're allergic to bee venom or penicillin.

This usually only occurs with intradermal testing. Your provider will be prepared to treat this serious response.\n\nPatch tests may be irritating or itchy. These symptoms will go away when the patch tests are removed.\n\n_*Why is the Test Performed?*_\n\nAllergy tests are done to find out which substances are causing your allergy symptoms.\n\nYour provider may order allergy skin tests if you have:\n\n* Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and asthma symptoms that are not well controlled with medicine\n* Hives and angioedema\n* Food allergies\n* Skin rashes (dermatitis), in which the skin becomes red, sore, or swollen after contact with the substance\n* Penicillin allergy\n* Venom allergy\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Testing - Skin**\n\n**What is Allergy Testing?**\n\nAllergy testing, also known as allergy skin tests, is used to find out which substances cause a person to have an allergic reaction. These substances are called allergens.\n\n**Why is Allergy Testing Performed?**\n\nAllergy tests are done to find out which substances are causing your allergy symptoms. Your provider may order allergy skin tests if you have:\n\n* Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and asthma symptoms that are not well controlled with medicine\n* Hives and angioedema\n* Food allergies\n* Skin rashes (dermatitis), in which the skin becomes red, sore, or swollen after contact with the substance\n* Penicillin allergy\n* Venom allergy\n\n**How is Allergy Testing Performed?**\n\nThere are three common methods of allergy skin testing:\n\n1. **Skin Prick Test**: This involves placing a small amount of substances (allergens) that may be causing your symptoms on the skin, most often on the forearm, upper arm, or back. The skin is then pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface.\n2. **Intradermal Skin Test**: This involves injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin. The provider then watches for a reaction at the site.\n3. **Patch Testing**: This method is used to diagnose the cause of skin reactions that occur after the substance touches the skin. Possible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours, and the provider will look at the area in 72 to 96 hours.\n\n**How to Prepare for Allergy Testing**\n\nBefore any allergy testing, the provider will ask about:\n\n* Illnesses\n* Where you live and work\n* Lifestyle\n* Foods and eating habits\n\nAllergy medicines can change the results of skin tests. Your provider will tell you which medicines to avoid and when to stop taking them before the test.\n\n**What to Expect During Allergy Testing**\n\nSkin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. Positive skin tests will become red, itchy, and swollen like a bug bite. You may have symptoms such as itching, a stuffy nose, red watery eyes, or a skin rash if you're allergic to the substance in the test.\n\nIn rare cases, people can have a whole-body allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis), which can be life-threatening. This usually only occurs with intradermal testing. Your provider will be prepared to treat this serious response.\n\nPatch tests may be irritating or itchy. These symptoms will go away when the patch tests are removed.\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Testing - Skin**\n\n**What is Allergy Testing?**\n\nAllergy testing, also known as allergy prick or scratch tests, is a medical procedure used to diagnose allergies. The test involves pricking the skin with a small amount of an allergen, such as pollen or dust, and observing the reaction.\n\n**How Does the Test Work?**\n\nDuring the test, a small amount of the allergen is placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or back. A small prick or scratch is made in the skin to allow the allergen to enter the body. The skin is then observed for any reaction, which can include redness, swelling, and itching.\n\n**What are the Possible Results?**\n\n*   **Negative Result:** No skin changes occur in response to the allergen, indicating that the person is not allergic.\n*   **Positive Result:** A red, raised area called a wheal appears on the skin, indicating an allergic reaction. The size of the wheal can indicate the severity of the allergy.\n\n**What are the Benefits and Risks of Allergy Testing?**\n\nBenefits:\n\n*   Accurate diagnosis of allergies\n*   Identification of specific allergens causing symptoms\n\nRisks:\n\n*   Rare cases of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)\n*   False positive results, particularly with food allergy testing\n\n**When is Allergy Testing Performed?**\n\nAllergy skin tests are typically performed for individuals with:\n\n*   Hay fever and asthma symptoms\n*   Hives and angioedema\n*   Food allergies\n*   Skin rashes (dermatitis)\n*   Penicillin allergy\n*   Venom allergy\n\n**What is the Follow-Up Care After Allergy Testing?**\n\nAfter the test, the healthcare provider will discuss the results with the patient and provide guidance on lifestyle changes to avoid substances that may be causing symptoms. In some cases, further testing or treatment may be necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Allergy Testing - Skin**\n\n**Your Provider Will Consider Your Symptoms and the Results of Your Skin Test to Suggest Lifestyle Changes You Can Make to Avoid Substances That May Be Causing Your Symptoms.**\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Patch tests - allergy\n* Scratch tests - allergy\n* Skin tests - allergy\n* RAST test\n* Allergic rhinitis - allergy testing\n* Asthma - allergy testing\n* Eczema - allergy testing\n* Hayfever - allergy testing\n* Dermatitis - allergy testing\n* Allergy testing\n* Intradermal allergy testing\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* **Allergic Rhinitis - What to Ask Your Doctor - Adult**\n\t+ What are the possible causes of my symptoms?\n\t+ How can I manage my allergies?\n\t+ Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to avoid triggers?\n* **Allergic Rhinitis - What to Ask Your Doctor - Child**\n\t+ Why do I have allergies?\n\t+ How can I stay healthy during allergy season?\n\t+ Are there any special foods or drinks that can help with my symptoms?\n\n**Images**\n\n* RAST test\n* Allergy skin prick or scratch test\n* Intradermal allergy test reactions\n* Skin testing - PPD (R arm) and Candida (L)\n\n**References**\n\n* Chiriac AM, Bousquet J, Demoly P.

    "content": "**Almotriptan**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlmotriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Almotriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels around the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlmotriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take almotriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take almotriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets you may take in a 24-hour period.

    "content": "**Alogliptin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlogliptin is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Alogliptin is in a class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. It works by increasing the amount of insulin in the body to control blood sugar. Alogliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated).\n\n**Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlogliptin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take alogliptin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take alogliptin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAlogliptin controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take alogliptin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking alogliptin without talking to your doctor.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with alogliptin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Alogliptin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Taking Alogliptin**\n\nContinue to take alogliptin even if you feel well.

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol and if you have or have ever had pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas), gallstones, heart failure, or kidney or liver disease.\n* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking alogliptin, call your doctor.\n* If you are having surgery including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking alogliptin.\n* Talk to your doctor about what you should do if you get hurt or if you develop a fever or infection.\n\n**What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n\nBe sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight if necessary. This will help to control your diabetes and help alogliptin work more effectively.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Forget A Dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\nThis medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of high and low blood sugar and what to do if you develop these symptoms.\n\nAlogliptin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* headache\n* stuffy or runny nose\n* sore throat\n* joint pain\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking alogliptin and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* severe stomach pain that may move to your back\n* vomiting\n* excessive tiredness\n* loss of appetite\n* pain in the right upper area of the stomach\n* dark urine\n* yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* fever\n* blisters\n* skin peeling\n* rash\n* hives\n* itching\n* swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat\n* hoarseness\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* shortness of breath, especially when lying down\n* swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs\n* sudden weight gain\n\nAlogliptin may cause other side effects.

    "content": "**Alopecia Areata**\n\n_Alopecia_ is a Latin term that means baldness, and _areata_ refers to the patchy nature of the hair loss that is typically seen with this condition.\n\nIn most people with alopecia areata, hair falls out in small, round patches, leaving coin-sized areas of bare skin. This patchy hair loss occurs most often on the scalp but can affect other parts of the body as well. Uncommonly, the hair loss involves the entire scalp (in which case the condition is known as alopecia totalis) or the whole body (alopecia universalis). Other rare forms of alopecia areata, which have different patterns of hair loss, have also been reported.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   The exact cause of alopecia areata is not fully understood.\n*   It is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles.\n*   Stress and other emotional factors may trigger the onset of the condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlopecia areata can run in families, suggesting a possible genetic component. However, it is not considered a hereditary disease.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Alopecia totalis: complete hair loss on the scalp\n*   Alopecia universalis: complete hair loss on the body\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on alopecia areata, you can visit the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) website or consult with a healthcare professional.\n\n**References**\n\n*   \"Alopecia Areata\" by MedlinePlus Genetics\n*   \"Alopecia Areata\" by the American Academy of Dermatology\n\n---\n\n**Alopecia Areata**\n\n**What is Alopecia Areata?**\n\nAlopecia areata is a common disorder that causes hair loss. \"Alopecia\" is a Latin term that means baldness, and \"areata\" refers to the patchy nature of the hair loss that is typically seen with this condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn most people with alopecia areata, hair falls out in small, round patches, leaving coin-sized areas of bare skin. This patchy hair loss occurs most often on the scalp but can affect other parts of the body as well. Uncommonly, the hair loss involves the entire scalp (in which case the condition is known as alopecia totalis) or the whole body (alopecia universalis). Other rare forms of alopecia areata, which have different patterns of hair loss, have also been reported.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of alopecia areata are complex and not well understood. A combination of factors likely underlies the disorder, including changes in many genes that function in the hair and skin and in the immune system.\n\nAlopecia areata is one of a large group of immune system diseases classified as autoimmune disorders. Normally, the immune system protects the body from foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, by recognizing and attacking these invaders and clearing them from the body. In autoimmune disorders, the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues instead.\n\nFor reasons that are unclear, in alopecia areata the immune system targets hair follicles, stopping hair growth. However, the condition does not permanently damage the follicles, which is why hair may later regrow.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlopecia areata affects 1 in every 500 to 1,000 people in the United States. It is one of many recognized forms of alopecia; alopecia areata is the second most common form after androgenetic alopecia (male-pattern baldness in men and female-pattern baldness in women). Alopecia areata affects men and women equally, and it can occur in people of any ethnic background.\n\n**Emotional Impact**\n\nThe hair loss associated with alopecia areata is not painful or disabling. However, it causes changes in a person's appearance that can profoundly affect quality of life and self-esteem. In some people, the condition can lead to depression, anxiety, and other emotional or psychological issues.\n\n---\n\n**Alopecia Areata: Understanding the Complex Causes**\n\nThe causes of alopecia areata are complex and not well understood. A combination of factors likely underlies the disorder, including changes in many genes that function in the hair and skin and in the immune system.\n\n**Autoimmune Disorder**\n\nAlopecia areata is one of a large group of immune system diseases classified as autoimmune disorders. Normally, the immune system protects the body from foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, by recognizing and attacking these invaders and clearing them from the body. In autoimmune disorders, the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues instead. For reasons that are unclear, in alopecia areata the immune system targets hair follicles, stopping hair growth. However, the condition does not permanently damage the follicles, which is why hair may later regrow.\n\n**Genetic Associations**\n\nMany of the genes that have been associated with alopecia areata participate in the body's immune response. These include several genes belonging to a gene family called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders. Each HLA gene has many different variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Certain variations in HLA genes likely contribute to the inappropriate immune response targeting hair follicles that leads to alopecia areata. Immune system genes outside the HLA complex, such as several genes involved in inflammation, have also been associated with alopecia areata.\n\n**Shared Genetic Risk Factors**\n\nSome of the genetic variations associated with alopecia areata have been identified in people with other autoimmune disorders, which suggests that this group of diseases may share some genetic risk factors. People with alopecia areata have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and autoimmune thyroid diseases (such as Hashimoto's disease and Graves' disease). Similarly, people with those autoimmune disorders have an increased risk of developing alopecia areata.\n\n**Unknown Triggers**\n\nIn many cases, it is unknown what triggers hair loss in people with alopecia areata. It is possible that environmental factors, such as emotional stress, physical injury, or illness, provoke an abnormal immune response in people who are at risk. However, in most affected people, the onset of hair loss has no clear explanation.\n\n**Associated Genes**\n\n*   AIRE\n*   FLG\n*   HLA-DQA1\n*   HLA-DQB1\n*   HLA-DRB1\n*   MTHFR\n*   PTPN22\n*   VDR\n*   BTNL2\n*   CCL2\n*   CLEC16A\n*   CTLA4\n*   ERBB3\n*   HLA-A\n*   HLA-C\n*   HLA-DMB\n*   HLA-DQA2\n*   HLA-DQB2\n*   HLA-DRA\n*   HLA-DRB5\n*   HSPA1B\n*   ICOS\n*   IFNG\n*   IKZF4\n*   IL13\n*   IL16\n*   IL1B\n*   IL1RN\n*   IL2\n*   IL2RA\n*   IL4\n*   KLRK1\n*   LTA\n*   MICA\n*   MIF\n*   NOS3\n*   NOTCH4\n*   PRDX5\n*   RAET1L\n*   SPATA5\n*   STX17\n*   TLR1\n*   TNF\n*   TRAF1\n*   TSBP1\n*   ULBP3\n\n---\n\n**Alopecia Areata**\n\n**What is Alopecia Areata?**\n\nAlopecia areata is a condition that causes hair loss on the scalp, often in small, round patches. It can also affect other parts of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of alopecia areata is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy hair follicles. Environmental factors, such as emotional stress, physical injury, or illness, may provoke an abnormal immune response in people who are at risk.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nResearch suggests that genetic factors play a role in alopecia areata. Studies have identified several genes associated with the condition, including AIRE, FLG, HLA-DQA1, and others. However, the inheritance pattern of the condition is unclear due to the involvement of multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThe risk of developing alopecia areata is greater for first-degree relatives (such as siblings or children) of affected individuals than it is in the general population. People with alopecia areata are also more likely to have family members with other autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlopecia areata has been referred to by other names, including AA and Alopecia circumscripta.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the genetic aspects of alopecia areata, there are several resources available. The Genetic Testing Registry lists a test for Alopecia universalis, and the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) provides information and support for individuals affected by rare disorders, including alopecia areata.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are continually working to better understand and treat alopecia areata. Clinical trials are an important part of this process, and those interested in participating can find more information on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\nThe Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database provides a comprehensive catalog of genes and diseases, including information on alopecia areata.

It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy hair follicles.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Hair loss is usually the only symptom.\n* A few people may also feel a burning sensation or itching.\n* Alopecia areata usually begins as one to several (1 cm to 4 cm) patches of hair loss.\n* Hair loss is most often seen on the scalp. It may also occur in the beard, eyebrows, pubic hair, and arms or legs in some people.\n* Nail pitting may also occur.\n\n**Patches of Hair Loss**\n\n* Patches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape.\n* They may be peach-colored.\n* Hairs that look like exclamation points are sometimes seen at the edges of a bald patch with a magnifying tool.\n\n**Total Hair Loss**\n\n* If alopecia areata leads to total hair loss, it often occurs within 6 months after symptoms first start.\n* This is called alopecia totalis when the entire scalp is involved, and alopecia universalis when the entire body is affected.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms, focusing on areas where you have hair loss.\n* A scalp biopsy may be done. Blood tests may also be done to check for autoimmune conditions and thyroid problems.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* If hair loss is not widespread, the hair will often regrow in a few months without treatment.\n* For more severe hair loss, it is not clear how much treatment can help change the course of the condition.\n* Common treatments may include:\n\t+ Steroid injection under the skin surface\n\t+ Medicines applied to the skin\n\t+ Ultraviolet light therapy\n\t+ A wig may be used to hide areas of hair loss.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\n* More information and support for people with alopecia areata and their families can be found at:\n\t+ National Alopecia Areata Foundation -- www.naaf.org\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n* Full recovery of hair is common.\n* However, some people may have a poorer outcome, including those with:\n\t+ Alopecia areata that starts at a young age\n\t+ Eczema\n\t+ Long-term alopecia\n\t+ Widespread or complete loss of scalp or body hair.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n* Contact your provider if you are concerned about hair loss.\n\n---\n\n**Alopecia Areata**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss.

    "content": "**Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAlpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is one of the most severe of a group of conditions called the POLG-related disorders. The conditions in this group feature a range of similar signs and symptoms involving muscle-, nerve-, and brain-related functions.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nPeople with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome typically become apparent in children between ages 2 and 4. They usually have three characteristic features:\n\n* Recurrent seizures that do not improve with treatment (intractable epilepsy)\n* Loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression)\n* Liver disease\n\n**Additional Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome usually have additional signs and symptoms, including:\n\n* Problems with coordination and balance (ataxia)\n* Disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), which can lead to abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia)\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that worsens until they lose the ability to control their muscles and movement\n* Involuntary muscle twitches (myoclonus), uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis), or a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism\n\n**Brain-Related Signs and Symptoms**\n\nAffected individuals may have other brain-related signs and symptoms, including:\n\n* Migraine headaches, often with visual sensations or auras\n* Decreased brain function demonstrated as sleepiness, inability to concentrate, irritability, or loss of language skills or memory\n* Loss of eyesight or hearing\n\n**Survival Rate**\n\nPeople with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome can survive from a few months to more than 10 years after the condition first appears.\n\n---\n\n**Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome**\n\n**What is Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome?**\n\nAlpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals.\n\n**Causes of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the POLG gene. This gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ). Pol γ functions in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use.\n\n**Symptoms of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nAffected individuals may have other brain-related signs and symptoms. Migraine headaches, often with visual sensations or auras, are common. Additionally, people with this condition may have decreased brain function that is demonstrated as sleepiness, inability to concentrate, irritability, or loss of language skills or memory.\n\n**Frequency of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nThe prevalence of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals.\n\n**Inheritance pattern of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Survival rate of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nPeople with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome can survive from a few months to more than 10 years after the condition first appears.\n\n---\n\n**Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome**\n\n**What is Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome?**\n\nAlpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain, liver, and other organs.\n\n**Causes of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test**\n\nWhat is an AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) tumor marker test?\n\nAn AFP tumor marker test is a blood test that measures the level of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) in a sample of your blood. It's usually used to help diagnose certain types of cancer and to check how well treatment is working.\n\n**What is AFP?**\n\nAFP is a protein that the liver makes when its cells are growing and dividing to make new cells. AFP is normally high in unborn babies. After birth, AFP levels drop very low. Healthy children and adults who aren't pregnant have very little AFP in their blood.\n\nIf you aren't pregnant, AFP is mainly measured as a tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances that are often made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer. High levels of AFP can be a sign of cancer of the liver, ovaries or testicles.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn AFP tumor marker test may be used during the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles that make high levels of AFP. It is used to:\n\n* Help confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis when used with other exams and tests.\n* Predict how cancer may behave over time.\n* Monitor cancer treatment. AFP levels often go up if cancer is growing and go down when treatment is working.\n\nIn certain cases, results from an AFP tumor marker test may be used to guide treatment choices for specific types of cancer. The test may also be used to monitor your health if you have chronic (long lasting) hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver. These conditions aren't cancer, but they increase your risk of developing liver cancer.\n\n**Why do I need an AFP tumor marker test?**\n\nYou may need an AFP tumor marker test if:\n\n* A physical exam and/or other tests suggest that you may have cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.\n* You are currently being treated for a cancer that causes high AFP levels. Measuring your AFP test can show how well your treatment is working.\n* You have completed treatment for a cancer that increased your AFP level. You may need an AFP tumor marker test from time to time to check whether your cancer is coming back.\n\nIf you have chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, you have a higher risk of developing liver cancer. A very high level of AFP or a sudden increase can be an early sign of liver cancer. Most medical experts don't recommend measuring AFP levels to screen for cancer in these diseases. But, some health care providers may still use an AFP tumor marker test with other tests to watch for liver cancer.\n\n**What happens during an AFP tumor marker test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an AFP tumor marker test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf you haven't been diagnosed with cancer, test results that show:\n\n* High levels of AFP may be a sign of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. But having a high AFP level doesn't mean you have cancer or that you will get cancer. Liver injury and liver diseases that aren't cancer can also cause high AFP levels. Less often, high levels of AFP may be a sign of other cancers, including lymphoma or lung cancer. Your provider will use your medical history and other test results to make a diagnosis.\n* Normal levels of AFP mean you're less likely to have a cancer that causes high AFP levels. But a normal test result doesn't rule out cancer because some people with these cancers have normal AFP levels.\n\nIf you're being treated for a cancer that increased your AFP levels, you may be tested several times during treatment. Your provider will look at all your AFP test results to see how your levels have changed over time. If your results show:\n\n* Your AFP levels are increasing, it may mean that your treatment isn't working.\n* Your AFP levels are decreasing, it may mean your treatment is working.\n* Your AFP levels have stayed the same, it may mean your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse.\n\nIf you've finished treatment for cancer that caused high AFP levels and your test results are:\n\n* Not normal, it may mean that you still have some cancer in your body.\n* Higher now than they were shortly after treatment, it may mean your cancer is growing again.\n\nIf you have a long-lasting liver disease that's not cancer, you may need other tests to check for liver cancer if your test results show a sudden increase in AFP or your level is very high.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is an Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test?**\n\nAn AFP tumor marker test measures the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a sample of your blood. It's usually used to help diagnose certain types of cancer and to check how well treatment is working.\n\n\\n\\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens During the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an AFP tumor marker test.

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n\\n\\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf you haven't been diagnosed with cancer, test results that show:\n\n*   High levels of AFP may be a sign of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. But having a high AFP level doesn't mean you have cancer or that you will get cancer.\n*   Normal levels of AFP mean you're less likely to have a cancer that causes high AFP levels.\n\nIf you're being treated for a cancer that increased your AFP levels, you may be tested several times during treatment. Your provider will look at all your AFP test results to see how your levels have changed over time.\n\n\\n\\n**When is an Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test Used?**\n\nAn AFP tumor marker test may be used during the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer of the liver, ovaries, or testicles that make high levels of AFP. It is used to:\n\n*   Help confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis when used with other exams and tests.\n*   Predict how cancer may behave over time.\n*   Monitor cancer treatment. AFP levels often go up if cancer is growing and go down when treatment is working.\n\nIn certain cases, results from an AFP tumor marker test may be used to guide treatment choices for specific types of cancer.

A very high level of AFP or a sudden increase can be an early sign of liver cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker Test**\n\nIf your AFP test results show a sudden increase in AFP or your level is very high, you may need other tests to check for liver cancer.\n\nAsk your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n**Interpreting Your Results**\n\n* If you haven't been diagnosed with cancer, test results that show:\n\t+ A sudden increase in AFP or a very high level may indicate liver cancer.\n* If you're being treated for a cancer that increased your AFP levels, you may be tested several times during treatment. Your provider will look at all your AFP test results to see how your levels have changed over time.\n* If your results show:\n\t+ A decrease in AFP levels, it may indicate a response to treatment and a reduction in cancer cells.\n\t+ An increase in AFP levels, it may indicate a recurrence of cancer or an increase in cancer cells.\n* If you've finished treatment for cancer that caused high AFP levels and your test results are:\n\t+ Normal, it means your treatment has been successful and there's no evidence of remaining cancer cells.\n\t+ Elevated, it may indicate a recurrence of cancer or the presence of remaining cancer cells.\n\n**Understanding the Test**\n\nIn the U.S., the most common AFP tumor marker test measures all forms of AFP in your blood. A less common AFP test may be used to check the risk of liver cancer in people who have chronic liver disease. It measures a form of AFP called L3.\n\nAn AFP-L3 percent test (AFP-L3%) compares the amount of L3 to the amount of total AFP in your blood. If the portion of L3 increases, it may mean you have a high risk of developing a serious form of the most common liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nYou may have heard of another type of AFP test that's used during pregnancy. This test measures total AFP levels in the blood, but it's not a tumor marker test for cancer. It's used to check for the risk of certain birth defects in an unborn baby.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Cancer Society\n* Cancer.Net\n* Johns Hopkins Medicine\n* Mayo Clinic\n* Merck Manual Consumer Version\n* National Cancer Institute\n* Testing.com",

    "content": "**Alpha Thalassemia X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAlpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition occurs almost exclusively in males.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMales with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome have:\n\n* Intellectual disability and delayed development\n* Significantly delayed speech, with most never speaking or signing more than a few words\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which delays motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking\n* Some people with this disorder are never able to walk independently\n\n**Facial Features**\n\nAlmost everyone with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome has distinctive facial features, including:\n\n* Widely spaced eyes\n* A small nose with upturned nostrils\n* Low-set ears\n* The upper lip is shaped like an upside-down \"V,\" and the lower lip tends to be prominent\n\n**Blood Disorder**\n\nMost affected individuals have mild signs of a blood disorder called alpha thalassemia, which reduces the production of hemoglobin. This can lead to:\n\n* A shortage of red blood cells (anemia), causing pale skin, weakness, and fatigue\n* Rarely, affected individuals also have a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin, preventing enough oxygen from reaching the body's tissues\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nAlpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome may also include:\n\n* An unusually small head size (microcephaly)\n* Short stature\n* Skeletal abnormalities\n* Problems with the digestive system, such as gastroesophageal reflux and chronic constipation\n* Genital abnormalities, including undescended testes and hypospadias\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThis condition occurs almost exclusively in males.\n\n**Causes**\n\nInherited disorder that affects many parts of the body.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nPassed down through generations.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nNone specified.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information, please consult a medical professional or visit a reputable health organization website.\n\n**References**\n\nNot provided.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome results from mutations in the ATRX gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal development. Although the exact function of the ATRX protein is unknown, studies suggest that it helps regulate the activity (expression) of other genes. Among these genes are HBA1 and HBA2, which are necessary for normal hemoglobin production.\n\nMutations in the ATRX gene change the structure of the ATRX protein, which likely prevents it from effectively regulating gene expression. Reduced activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes causes alpha thalassemia. Abnormal expression of other genes, which have not been identified, probably causes developmental delay, distinctive facial features, and the other signs and symptoms of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The ATRX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), one working copy of the ATRX gene can usually compensate for the mutated copy.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome appears to be a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown. More than 200 affected individuals have been reported.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\n\n**Gene Location**\nThe ATRX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes.\n\n**Impact on Males and Females**\nIn males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), one working copy of the ATRX gene can usually compensate for the mutated copy. Therefore, females who carry a single mutated ATRX gene almost never have signs of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Alpha thalassemia X-linked mental retardation syndrome\n* Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked\n* Alpha-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation syndrome\n* Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, nondeletion type\n* ATR-X syndrome\n* ATRX syndrome\n* X-linked alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome\n* XLMR-hypotonic face syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic Testing Information**\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Alpha thalassemia-X-linked intellectual disability syndrome\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\t+ Alpha-thalassemia-X-linked intellectual disability syndrome\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ ALPHA-THALASSEMIA/IMPAIRED INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT SYNDROME, X-LINKED; ATRX\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Gibbons R.

    "content": "**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\nIn people with the characteristic features of alpha thalassemia, a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin prevents enough oxygen from reaching the body's tissues. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nTwo types of alpha thalassemia can cause health problems:\n\n* **Hemoglobin Bart Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome (Hb Bart Syndrome)**: The more severe type, also known as Hb Bart syndrome or alpha thalassemia major.\n* **HbH Disease**: The milder form.\n\n**Hb Bart Syndrome**\n\nCharacterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Additional signs and symptoms can include:\n\n* Severe anemia\n* Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n* Heart defects\n* Abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia\n\nWithout treatment, most babies with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth because of these serious health problems. Hb Bart syndrome can also cause serious complications for women during pregnancy, including:\n\n* Dangerously high blood pressure with swelling (preeclampsia)\n* Premature delivery\n* Abnormal bleeding\n\n**HbH Disease**\n\nCauses mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice). The features of HbH disease usually appear in early childhood, and affected individuals typically live into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**What is Alpha Thalassemia?**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\n**Causes of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Less commonly, changes to the DNA sequence in or near these genes cause alpha thalassemia. Such changes are often referred to as nondeletion variants.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nTwo types of alpha thalassemia can cause health problems:\n\n*   **Hb Bart Syndrome**: The most severe form of alpha thalassemia, resulting from the loss or alteration of all four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   **HbH Disease**: Usually caused by loss or alteration of three of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n\n**Frequency of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a fairly common blood disorder worldwide. Thousands of infants with Hb Bart syndrome and HbH disease are born each year, particularly in Southeast Asia. Alpha thalassemia also occurs frequently in people from Mediterranean countries, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Central Asia.\n\n**Complications of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nWithout treatment, most babies with Hb Bart syndrome are stillborn or die soon after birth because of these serious health problems. Hb Bart syndrome can also cause serious complications for women during pregnancy, including dangerously high blood pressure with swelling (preeclampsia), premature delivery, and abnormal bleeding.\n\nHbH disease causes mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice). The features of HbH disease usually appear in early childhood, and affected individuals typically live into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**What is Alpha Thalassemia?**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. It typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, which provide instructions for making alpha-globin, a component of hemoglobin.\n\n**Causes of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nLess commonly, changes to the DNA sequence in or near these genes cause alpha thalassemia. Such changes are often referred to as nondeletion variants. Both the HBA1 and HBA2 genes provide instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nThe different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss or alteration of some or all of the four alleles that produce alpha-globin. Deletions and nondeletion variants in one or more alleles reduce the amount of alpha-globin cells produce.\n\n*   Hb Bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss or alteration of all four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   HbH disease is usually caused by loss or alteration of three of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   Alpha thalassemia trait results from a loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   Alpha thalassemia silent carriers have a loss of one alpha-globin allele.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complex. Each person inherits two alpha-globin alleles from each parent. If both parents are missing at least one alpha-globin allele, their children are at risk of having Hb Bart syndrome, HbH disease, or alpha thalassemia trait.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlpha-thalassemia Α-thalassemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: alpha Thalassemia\n*   Alpha-thalassemia (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 1; HBA1\n*   HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 2; HBA2\n*   ALPHA-THALASSEMIA\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n*   Genetic Testing Information\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: alpha Thalassemia\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n    *   Alpha-thalassemia\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\nIn people with the characteristic features of alpha thalassemia, a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin prevents enough oxygen from reaching the body's tissues. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nTwo types of alpha thalassemia can cause health problems:\n\n* **Hemoglobin Bart Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome (Hb Bart Syndrome)**: The more severe type, also known as Hb Bart syndrome or alpha thalassemia major.\n* **HbH Disease**: The milder form.\n\n**Hb Bart Syndrome**\n\nCharacterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Additional signs and symptoms can include:\n\n* Severe anemia\n* Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n* Heart defects\n* Abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia\n\nWithout treatment, most babies with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth because of these serious health problems. Hb Bart syndrome can also cause serious complications for women during pregnancy, including:\n\n* Dangerously high blood pressure with swelling (preeclampsia)\n* Premature delivery\n* Abnormal bleeding\n\n**HbH Disease**\n\nCauses mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice). The features of HbH disease usually appear in early childhood, and affected individuals typically live into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**What is Alpha Thalassemia?**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\n**Causes of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Less commonly, changes to the DNA sequence in or near these genes cause alpha thalassemia. Such changes are often referred to as nondeletion variants.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nTwo types of alpha thalassemia can cause health problems:\n\n*   **Hb Bart Syndrome**: The most severe form of alpha thalassemia, resulting from the loss or alteration of all four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   **HbH Disease**: Usually caused by loss or alteration of three of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n\n**Frequency of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a fairly common blood disorder worldwide. Thousands of infants with Hb Bart syndrome and HbH disease are born each year, particularly in Southeast Asia. Alpha thalassemia also occurs frequently in people from Mediterranean countries, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Central Asia.\n\n**Complications of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nWithout treatment, most babies with Hb Bart syndrome are stillborn or die soon after birth because of these serious health problems. Hb Bart syndrome can also cause serious complications for women during pregnancy, including dangerously high blood pressure with swelling (preeclampsia), premature delivery, and abnormal bleeding.\n\nHbH disease causes mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice). The features of HbH disease usually appear in early childhood, and affected individuals typically live into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**What is Alpha Thalassemia?**\n\nAlpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. It typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, which provide instructions for making alpha-globin, a component of hemoglobin.\n\n**Causes of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nLess commonly, changes to the DNA sequence in or near these genes cause alpha thalassemia. Such changes are often referred to as nondeletion variants. Both the HBA1 and HBA2 genes provide instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin.\n\n**Types of Alpha Thalassemia**\n\nThe different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss or alteration of some or all of the four alleles that produce alpha-globin. Deletions and nondeletion variants in one or more alleles reduce the amount of alpha-globin cells produce.\n\n*   Hb Bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss or alteration of all four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   HbH disease is usually caused by loss or alteration of three of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   Alpha thalassemia trait results from a loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles.\n*   Alpha thalassemia silent carriers have a loss of one alpha-globin allele.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complex. Each person inherits two alpha-globin alleles from each parent. If both parents are missing at least one alpha-globin allele, their children are at risk of having Hb Bart syndrome, HbH disease, or alpha thalassemia trait.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlpha-thalassemia Α-thalassemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: alpha Thalassemia\n*   Alpha-thalassemia (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 1; HBA1\n*   HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 2; HBA2\n*   ALPHA-THALASSEMIA\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n*   Genetic Testing Information\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: alpha Thalassemia\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n    *   Alpha-thalassemia\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency, or AATD) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease. If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT).\n\n**What Causes Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAAT deficiency is a genetic disorder. That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations.\n\n**Symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nSome people who have AAT deficiency do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old. These symptoms may include:\n\n* Wheezing\n* Shortness of breath, especially after exercise\n* Chronic cough with phlegm (mucus)\n* Repeated respiratory infections such as colds and the flu\n* Chest pain\n* Fatigue\n* Faster-than-normal heartbeat when you stand up\n* Vision problems\n* Losing weight without trying\n\nSome people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow) and swelling in your legs.\n\nRarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches.\n\n**Diagnosis of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nYour health care provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have:\n\n* Symptoms of AAT deficiency\n* A condition that could be related to AAT deficiency\n* Relatives who have AAT deficiency\n* Relatives who have a lung or liver disease that could be related to AAT deficiency\n\nA blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency.\n\n**Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nThere is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms and slow the lung damage it causes. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Inhaled medicines to help you breathe better.\n* Pulmonary rehabilitation.\n* Oxygen therapy.\n* Augmentation therapy, which is a lifelong treatment. It raises the levels of the AAT protein in your lungs, using ATT protein taken from the blood of donors. It helps slow down lung damage. It cannot prevent liver damage.\n* Lung surgery or a lung transplant, if your lungs are severely damaged.\n* Liver transplant, if your liver is severely damaged.\n\nTo help prevent or delay lung damage, it is important to quit smoking (if you smoke) and avoid secondhand smoke, dust, and air pollution. Ask your provider If you need to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) is a genetic disorder caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene, which carries instructions for making the AAT protein.\n\n**Causes of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nAAT deficiency is inherited from your parents and tends to run in families. There are several gene changes that can cause AAT deficiency, including:\n\n* Decreasing the amount of AAT protein your liver makes\n* Preventing your liver from making any AAT\n* Affecting the shape of the AAT protein so that it can't move out of your liver to protect your lungs\n\n**Symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nSome people who have AAT deficiency do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old and may include:\n\n* Wheezing\n* Shortness of breath, especially after exercise\n* Chronic cough with phlegm (mucus)\n* Repeated respiratory infections such as colds and the flu\n* Chest pain\n* Fatigue\n* Faster-than-normal heartbeat when you stand up\n* Vision problems\n* Losing weight without trying\n\nSome people who have AAT deficiency may also have liver damage, which can cause jaundice and swelling in your legs.\n\n**Diagnosis of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nYour health care provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have:\n\n* Symptoms of AAT deficiency\n* A condition that could be related to AAT deficiency\n* Relatives who have AAT deficiency\n* Relatives who have a lung or liver disease that could be related to AAT deficiency\n\nA blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood, and a genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency.\n\n**Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nThere is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms and slow the lung damage it causes. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Inhaled medicines to help you breathe better\n* Pulmonary rehabilitation\n* Oxygen therapy\n* Augmentation therapy, which raises the levels of the AAT protein in your lungs using ATT protein taken from the blood of donors\n* Lung surgery or a lung transplant if your lungs are severely damaged\n* Liver transplant if your liver is severely damaged\n\nTo help prevent or delay lung damage, it's essential to quit smoking (if you smoke) and avoid secondhand smoke, dust, and air pollution.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. It is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, which codes for the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. They may include:\n\n* Lung damage: The most common symptom is lung damage, which can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n* Liver disease: Some people with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency may also develop liver disease.\n* Fatigue: Many people with the condition experience fatigue.\n* Weight loss: Some individuals may lose weight due to the lack of appetite caused by lung damage.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* Genetic testing: This involves analyzing the SERPINA1 gene for mutations.\n* Blood tests: These can detect low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood.\n* Imaging tests: Such as chest X-rays or CT scans to evaluate lung damage.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, but treatment options are available to help manage symptoms and prevent further lung damage. These may include:\n\n* Quitting smoking: If you smoke, quitting can significantly reduce your risk of developing COPD.\n* Avoiding secondhand smoke, dust, and air pollution: Reducing exposure to these substances can also help prevent lung damage.\n* Medications: Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to help manage symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern, meaning that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. The severity of the condition can vary depending on the specific mutation and the individual's overall health.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are continually working to develop new treatments for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. You can find information about ongoing clinical trials on websites such as ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent studies have investigated various aspects of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, including its impact on lung function and the effectiveness of different treatment approaches. Some notable articles include:\n\n* \"Progression and Augmentation Therapy in PiSZ and PiZZ Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: A Systematic Review\"\n* \"Characterization of the Mmalton carrier's cohort within the EARCO (European Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency) study\"\n* \"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease: From understudied disorder to the poster child of precision medicine\"\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nFor patients and their families, it can be helpful to understand more about Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. The following patient handouts provide information on:\n\n* \"Alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test\"\n* \"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\"\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nCOPD is a related health topic, as many people with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency develop COPD due to lung damage.\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency is the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.",

The test is also done to check for abnormal forms of AAT.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nThere is no special preparation.\n\n**What Will Happen During the Test?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Blood Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is helpful in identifying a rare form of emphysema in adults and a rare form of liver disease (cirrhosis) in children and adults caused by an AAT deficiency. AAT deficiency is passed down through families. The condition causes the liver to make too little of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage.\n\nEveryone has two copies of the gene that makes AAT. People with two variant copies of the gene have lower blood levels and are at risk for more severe disease. Different gene variants may cause differing severity of illness.\n\n**What Do Normal Results Mean?**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nA lower-than-normal level of AAT may be associated with:\n\n* Damage of the large airways in the lungs (bronchiectasis)\n* Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Liver tumors\n* Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to blocked bile flow (obstructive jaundice)\n* High blood pressure in the large vein that leads to the liver (portal hypertension)\n\n**Are There Any Risks Associated with the Test?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk anytime the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Blood Test**\n\n**What is the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Blood Test?**\n\nThe alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test measures the level of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in your blood.

The signs and symptoms of the condition and the age at which they appear vary among individuals.\n\n**Symptoms of Lung Disease**\n\nPeople with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually develop the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between ages 25 and 50. The earliest symptoms are:\n\n* Shortness of breath following mild activity\n* Reduced ability to exercise\n* Wheezing\n\nOther signs and symptoms can include:\n\n* Unintentional weight loss\n* Recurring respiratory infections\n* Fatigue\n\nAffected individuals often develop emphysema, a lung disease caused by damage to the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). Characteristic features of emphysema include:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* A hacking cough\n* A barrel-shaped chest\n\nSmoking or exposure to tobacco smoke accelerates the appearance of emphysema symptoms and damage to the lungs.\n\n**Symptoms of Liver Disease**\n\nAbout 10 percent of infants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease, which often causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver. Signs of cirrhosis include:\n\n* A swollen abdomen\n* Jaundice\n\nIndividuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n**Rare Symptoms**\n\nIn rare cases, people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop a skin condition called panniculitis, which is characterized by hardened skin with painful lumps or patches. Panniculitis varies in severity and can occur at any age.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that may cause lung disease and liver disease.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Lung Disease**\n\nThe earliest symptoms of lung disease are:\n\n*   Shortness of breath following mild activity\n*   Reduced ability to exercise\n*   Wheezing\n\nOther signs and symptoms can include:\n\n*   Unintentional weight loss\n*   Recurring respiratory infections\n*   Fatigue\n\nAffected individuals often develop emphysema, a lung disease caused by damage to the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli).

Approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver. Signs of cirrhosis include a swollen abdomen and jaundice.\n\n**Rare Skin Condition**\n\nIn rare cases, people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop a skin condition called panniculitis, which is characterized by hardened skin with painful lumps or patches. Panniculitis varies in severity and can occur at any age.\n\n**Prevalence of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. This disorder affects about 1 in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry. It is uncommon in people of Asian descent.\n\n**Causes of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which protects the body from a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase.\n\nNeutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (especially the lungs) if not tightly controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Variants in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase.\n\nWithout enough functional alpha-1 antitrypsin, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli and causes lung disease. Abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin can also accumulate in the liver and damage this organ.\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as exposure to tobacco smoke, chemicals, and dust, likely impact the severity of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern. Codominance means that two different versions of the gene may be active (expressed), and both versions contribute to the genetic trait.\n\nThe most common version (allele) of the SERPINA1 gene, called M, produces normal levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Most people in the general population have two copies of the M allele (MM) in each cell. Other versions of the SERPINA1 gene lead to reduced levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin.\n\nFor example, the S allele produces moderately low levels of this protein, and the Z allele produces very little alpha-1 antitrypsin.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the production of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein responsible for protecting the lungs from damage. The condition is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern, meaning that two different versions of the gene may be active and contribute to the genetic trait.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe most common version (allele) of the SERPINA1 gene, called M, produces normal levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Most people in the general population have two copies of the M allele (MM) in each cell. Other versions of the SERPINA1 gene lead to reduced levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. For example, the S allele produces moderately low levels of this protein, and the Z allele produces very little alpha-1 antitrypsin.\n\nIndividuals with two copies of the Z allele (ZZ) in each cell have a high risk of developing lung disease (such as emphysema) and liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Those with the SZ combination have an increased risk of developing lung disease, particularly if they smoke.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 185 million people have one copy of the S or Z allele and one copy of the M allele in each cell (MS or MZ). Individuals with an MS (or SS) combination usually produce enough alpha-1 antitrypsin to protect the lungs. People with MZ alleles, however, have a slightly increased risk of impaired lung or liver function.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* Lung disease (such as emphysema)\n* Liver disease\n* Impaired lung or liver function\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency typically involves a combination of genetic testing, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as pulmonary function tests.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. Treatment may include:\n\n* Lung transplantation\n* Liver transplantation\n* Medications to manage symptoms\n* Lifestyle modifications (such as quitting smoking)\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, some individuals may experience a significant improvement in quality of life.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, see the following references:\n\n* Carrell RW, Lomas DA.

The condition can lead to emphysema, a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and liver disease.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which codes for alpha-1 antitrypsin. These mutations can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development. The risk of developing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increases with family history.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms may include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Diagnosis is typically made through pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and genetic testing to identify mutations in the SERPINA1 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, and medications to improve lung function and prevent liver disease.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other health problems. With proper management, some people can lead active lives, while others may experience significant limitations due to respiratory or liver complications.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern, meaning that individuals with two mutated copies (homozygous) are more severely affected than those with one mutated copy (heterozygous). Family history plays a crucial role in determining the risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Cirrhosis\n* Emphysema\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Medical Tests**\n\n* Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Testing\n* Pulmonary Function Tests\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n**Genetics**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, which is responsible for lung damage and other symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n* Wheezing: A common symptom of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, wheezing is a high-pitched sound heard when breathing out.\n* Pulmonary function tests: These tests measure the lungs' ability to take in and release air, and can help diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Lung transplantation: In severe cases, lung transplantation may be necessary.\n* Smoking cessation: Quitting smoking can help slow disease progression.\n* Medications: Medications such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids may be prescribed to manage symptoms.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Carriers of the mutated gene may also experience mild symptoms.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other health problems. With proper treatment and management, many people can lead active and fulfilling lives despite their diagnosis.",

The condition can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease (cirrhosis).\n\n**Causes**\n\nAAT is a type of protein called a protease inhibitor. AAT is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver.\n\nAAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic variant. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.\n\nAdults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age. Smoking can increase the risk for emphysema and make it occur earlier.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Shortness of breath with and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD\n* Symptoms of liver failure\n* Loss of weight without trying\n* Wheezing\n* Coughing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may reveal a barrel-shaped chest, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds.

The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks. This is only slightly effective at preventing more lung damage in people without end-stage disease. This procedure is called augmentation therapy.\n\nIf you smoke, you need to quit.\n\nOther treatments are also used for COPD and cirrhosis.\n\nLung transplant can be used for severe lung disease, and liver transplant can be used for severe cirrhosis.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSome people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease. If you quit smoking, you can slow the progression of the lung disease.\n\nCOPD and cirrhosis can be life threatening.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of AAT deficiency include:\n\n* Bronchiectasis (damage of the large airways)\n* COPD\n* Liver failure or cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition where the body does not produce enough AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage.\n\n**Causes of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   AAT is a type of protein called a protease inhibitor.\n*   It is made in the liver and works to protect the lungs and liver.\n*   AAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body.\n*   It is caused by a genetic variant.\n*   The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.\n\n**Symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   Shortness of breath with and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD\n*   Symptoms of liver failure\n*   Loss of weight without trying\n*   Wheezing\n*   Coughing\n\n**Exams and Tests for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   A physical exam may reveal a barrel-shaped chest, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds.\n*   The following tests may also help with diagnosis:\n    *   AAT blood test\n    *   Arterial blood gases\n    *   Chest x-ray\n    *   CT scan of the chest\n    *   Genetic testing\n    *   Lung function tests\n\n**Treatment for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   Treatment involves replacing the missing AAT protein.\n*   The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks.\n*   This procedure is called augmentation therapy.\n*   If you smoke, you need to quit.\n*   Other treatments are also used for COPD and cirrhosis.\n*   Lung transplant can be used for severe lung disease, and liver transplant can be used for severe cirrhosis.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   Some people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease.\n*   If you quit smoking, you can slow the progression of the lung disease.\n*   COPD and cirrhosis can be life-threatening.\n\n**Possible Complications of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   Bronchiectasis (damage of the large airways)\n*   COPD\n*   Liver failure or cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional about Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency**\n\n*   **Definition**: A genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin, which can lead to lung and liver damage.\n*   **Causes**: The condition is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, which codes for the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein.

    "content": "**Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlpha-1-proteinase inhibitor is used in people with symptoms of emphysema (a lung disease) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). AATD is an inherited condition in which the body does not make enough of a protein (alpha-1 antitrypsin) needed to protect the lungs from smoke, dust, or pollution. Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor is in a class of medications called blood derivatives. It works by increasing the levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein in your blood and lungs.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlpha-1-proteinase inhibitor comes as a solution (liquid) or as a powder to be mixed with a solution (liquid) to give intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given once a week by a healthcare provider. Your doctor may allow you or a caregiver to perform the injections at home. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you or the person who will be performing the injections how to prepare and infuse alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. If you have a deficiency of immunoglobulin A with antibodies to IgA, your doctor will probably tell you not to receive alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose or an appointment to receive alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, contact your doctor right away.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAlpha-1-proteinase inhibitor may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: headache, runny nose, coughing, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, muscle soreness, bruising or bleeding at the site of injection. Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: hives, swelling in the mouth or throat, itching, chest tightness, trouble breathing, wheezing, fainting or dizziness, fever, chills, tiredness, and other signs of infection.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)**\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\n* headache\n* runny nose, coughing\n* diarrhea\n* nausea\n* tiredness\n* muscle soreness\n* bruising or bleeding at the site of injection\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* hives, swelling in the mouth or throat, itching, chest tightness, trouble breathing, wheezing, fainting or dizziness\n* fever, chills, tiredness, and other signs of infection\n\n**What Should I Know About Storage and Disposal of This Medication?**\n\nYour healthcare provider will tell you how to store your medication.

    "content": "**Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Test**\n\n**What is an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test?**\n\nAn AFP test is a blood test that measures the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in your blood when you are pregnant. The test checks your baby's risk of having certain birth defects and genetic problems, but it does not diagnose any health conditions. The test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**What is AFP?**\n\nAFP is a protein mostly made in your developing baby's liver. Usually, some AFP passes from the baby into your blood. But certain medical conditions can make the baby's body release more or less AFP than usual. When this happens, your AFP blood levels will be higher or lower than normal.\n\n**What does an abnormal AFP test result mean?**\n\nAbnormal AFP results may be a sign that your baby has a problem:\n\n* Lower than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has an increased risk of a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome.\n* Higher than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has an increased risk of:\n\t+ A neural tube defect, such as spina bifida or anencephaly.\n\n**What are the risks of an AFP test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to you or your baby with an AFP blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**How do I prepare for an AFP test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparation for an AFP test.\n\n**What happens during an AFP test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**What do I need to know about my AFP test results?**\n\nThe results of your AFP test tell you whether your baby is more or less likely to have certain birth defects and genetic disorders. The test can't diagnose any conditions.\n\nNormal AFP test results mean that it's unlikely that your baby has a problem. But it's possible for a test result to be normal and miss a problem that does exist.\n\nIf your AFP test results aren't normal, you will likely have more tests to help find out why. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Test**\n\nThe Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) test is a prenatal test used to check the risk of birth defects and genetic disorders in babies.\n\n**What does the AFP test measure?**\n\nThe AFP test measures the level of alpha-fetoprotein, a protein produced by the fetus, in the mother's blood. High or low levels of AFP can indicate an increased risk of certain birth defects and genetic disorders.\n\n**Why is the AFP test important?**\n\nThe AFP test is important because it can help identify babies at higher risk for certain birth defects and genetic disorders. This information can help healthcare providers decide if further testing is needed to learn more about the baby's health.\n\n**What happens during an AFP test?**\n\nDuring an AFP test, a healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in the mother's arm using a small needle. The test usually takes less than five minutes and may cause slight pain or bruising at the injection site.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to the mother or baby with an AFP blood test. Some mothers may experience slight pain or bruising at the injection site, but these symptoms typically go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of the AFP test tell whether the baby is more or less likely to have certain birth defects and genetic disorders. Normal results indicate that it's unlikely the baby has a problem, while abnormal results may indicate an increased risk of a serious problem.\n\n* Lower than normal AFP levels may indicate an increased risk of Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome.\n* Higher than normal AFP levels may indicate an increased risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly.\n\n**What if my AFP test results aren't normal?**\n\nIf your AFP test results aren't normal, you will likely have more tests to help determine why. It's essential to discuss any questions or concerns with your healthcare provider.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests and understanding results**\n\nTo learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results, visit the following resources:\n\n* American Pregnancy Association: Alpha-Fetoprotein Test (AFP)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Birth Defects\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n\nReferences:\n\n* Adigun OO, Yarrarapu SNS, Khetarpal S.

It measures the level of AFP in the mother's blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does the AFP Test Work?**\n\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus produces AFP, which enters the mother's bloodstream. The AFP test measures the level of AFP in the mother's blood to detect any abnormalities in fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits and Risks of the AFP Test?**\n\nThe benefits of the AFP test include early detection of neural tube defects, allowing for appropriate medical care and interventions. However, there are risks associated with the test, including false positives and negatives, which can lead to unnecessary follow-up tests and procedures.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Is the AFP Test Performed?**\n\nThe AFP test is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy using a blood sample from the mother's arm. The test measures the level of AFP in the blood, which is then compared to a reference range to determine if any abnormalities are present.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Do the Results of the AFP Test Mean?**\n\nHigh levels of AFP in the mother's blood may indicate neural tube defects or other fetal abnormalities. Low levels of AFP may indicate a false negative result, requiring further testing and evaluation. It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider to understand the results of the AFP test and determine the next course of action.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Down Syndrome\n* Genetic Testing\n* Neural Tube Defects\n* Prenatal Care\n* Prenatal Testing\n* Spina Bifida\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* Amniocentesis (amniotic fluid test)\n* Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)\n* Down Syndrome Tests\n* Estrogen Levels Test\n* How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n* How to Understand Your Lab Results\n* Karyotype Genetic Test\n* Pregnancy Test\n* Prenatal Cell-Free DNA Screening\n* Ultrasound\n* What You Need to Know About Blood Testing",

    "content": "**Alpha-Lipoic Acid**\n\n**What is it?**\nAlpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that is made naturally in the body and also found in foods. It is used to break down carbohydrates and to make energy.\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid can be eaten in foods, such as red meat, carrots, beets, spinach, broccoli, and potatoes. It is also available in supplements. Because alpha-lipoic acid seems to work like an antioxidant, it might provide protection to the brain and also be helpful in certain liver diseases.\n\nPeople most commonly use alpha-lipoic acid for nerve pain in people with diabetes. It is also used for obesity, altitude sickness, aging skin, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Taking 600-1800 mg of alpha-lipoic acid by mouth or by IV seems to improve symptoms such as burning, pain, and numbness in the legs and arms of people with diabetes.\n\t+ High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth for up to 4 years seems to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol in people with or without hyperlipidemia.\n\t+ Obesity. Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth can slightly reduce body weight in adults who are overweight.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Liver disease in people who drink alcohol. Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth daily for up to 6 months does not improve liver function or reduce liver damage in people with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\t+ Altitude sickness. Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth along with vitamin C and vitamin E does not seem to prevent altitude sickness.\n\t+ Kidney damage caused by contrast dyes (contrast induced nephropathy). Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth with or without standard hydration therapy during a coronary angiography doesn't seem to prevent kidney damage caused by contrast agents.\n\t+ Diabetes. Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth or by IV does not improve blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\t+ Vision problems in people with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth daily for 24 months doesn't improve eye damage from diabetes.\n\t+ Dementia in people with advanced HIV/AIDS. Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth has no effect on thinking problems in people with HIV.\n\t+ High levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Taking alpha-lipoic acid by mouth doesn't seem to reduce triglyceride levels in most people.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe for most adults when taken for up to 4 years. It is usually well-tolerated. The most common side effects are headache, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe for most adults when used as a cream for up to 12 weeks. It might cause a rash in some people.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: When taken by mouth, alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe. It's been used safely during pregnancy in doses of up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks.\n* Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if alpha-lipoic acid is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-Lipoic Acid**\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth, alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe for most adults when taken for up to 4 years.

Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\n**Children**\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe in children aged 10-17 years when taken by mouth in doses up to 600 mg daily for 3 months. But it is possibly unsafe for children to take large amounts of alpha-lipoic acid by mouth. Seizures, vomiting, and unconsciousness have been reported for children aged 14 months to 16 years who took up to 2400 mg of alpha-lipoic acid as a single dose.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid can decrease blood sugar levels. Alpha-lipoic acid might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking alpha-lipoic acid 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\n\n**Excessive use of alcohol/thiamine deficiency**\n\nAlcohol can lower the amount of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the body. Taking alpha-lipoic acid when there is a shortage of thiamine might cause serious health problems. If you drink a lot of alcohol and take alpha-lipoic acid, you should take a thiamine supplement.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\n* Moderate: Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Medications for cancer (Alkylating Agents)\n\t+ Medications for cancer (Antitumor antibiotics)\n\t+ Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)\n\t+ Thyroid hormone\n* Minor: Be watchful with this combination.\n\t+ Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n* Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar:\n\t+ Aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus\n* Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting:\n\t+ Garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng\n* Herbs with thyroid activity:\n\t+ Bugleweed, lemon balm, and tiratricol\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has most often been used by adults in doses of 600-1800 mg by mouth daily for up to 6 months.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-Lipoic Acid**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has most often been used by adults in doses of 600-1800 mg by mouth daily for up to 6 months.

    "content": "**Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, also known as Schindler disease, is an inherited disorder that can affect the development of the nervous system. People with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency often have distinctive facial features that can be described as \"coarse\" and tooth abnormalities such as widely-spaced teeth and missing teeth (hypodontia).\n\n**Types of Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\nThe three types of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency differ in the severity of their signs and symptoms and the age at which they first appear. The signs and symptoms of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency can vary, even among members of the same family.\n\n* **Type I: Most Severe Form**\n\t+ Babies with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type I appear healthy at birth.\n\t+ By late infancy, these babies typically have trouble meeting normal developmental milestones.\n\t+ By the age of 2 years, individuals with type I begin to lose skills that they had already acquired (developmental regression).\n\t+ Individuals with type I often experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia), vision and hearing loss, and seizures.\n\t+ During early childhood, children with type I typically lose awareness of their surroundings and eventually become unresponsive.\n* **Type II: Least Severe Form**\n\t+ Type II is typically diagnosed in adulthood.\n\t+ Affected individuals may have mild cognitive impairment and hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).\n\t+ They may also experience a loss of sensation or muscle weakness in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy).\n\t+ Clusters of enlarged blood vessels that form small, dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas) are a characteristic feature of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type II.\n* **Type III: Intermediate Form**\n\t+ People with type III may show a variety of signs and symptoms, including developmental, speech, and language delays; seizures that begin in infancy; and features of autism spectrum disorder that appear in childhood.\n\t+ Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills.\n\t+ People with type III may also have skeletal signs and symptoms, such as pain in the lower back, hips, and knees.\n\t+ Wear on the cartilage (disks) and bones of the neck (cervical spondylosis) and a cyst-like collection of cerebrospinal fluid that forms in the spinal cord (syringohydromyelia) have also been reported.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, also known as Schindler disease, is an inherited disorder that can affect the development of the nervous system. People with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency often have distinctive facial features that can be described as \"coarse\" and tooth abnormalities such as widely-spaced teeth and missing teeth (hypodontia).\n\n**Types of Alpha-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\nThere are three types of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, which differ in the severity of their signs and symptoms and the age at which they first appear.\n\n* **Type I**: The most severe form of this condition. Babies with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type I appear healthy at birth. However, by late infancy, these babies typically have trouble meeting normal developmental milestones. By the age of 2 years, individuals with type I begin to lose skills that they had already acquired (developmental regression). Individuals with type I often experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia), vision and hearing loss, and seizures.\n* **Type II**: The least severe form. Type II is typically diagnosed in adulthood. Affected individuals may have mild cognitive impairment and hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). They may also experience a loss of sensation or muscle weakness in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy).\n* **Type III**: The intermediate form of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. People with type III may show a variety of signs and symptoms, including developmental, speech, and language delays; seizures that begin in infancy; and features of autism spectrum disorder that appear in childhood.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the NAGA gene cause alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. The NAGA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which helps break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency is very rare. Fewer than 50 individuals with this condition have been reported in the medical literature. Some cases of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency likely remain undiagnosed.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency?**\n\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in the NAGA gene. The NAGA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which works in the lysosomes to break down glycoproteins and glycolipids.\n\n**How Does Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency Affect the Body?**\n\nVariants in the NAGA gene can alter the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme, interfering with the breakdown of glycoproteins and glycolipids. As these substances accumulate in the lysosomes, they can cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Cell damage in the nervous system and other tissues and organs of the body leads to the signs and symptoms seen in people with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency.\n\n**Why Do Some People with NAGA Gene Variants Have Severe Signs and Symptoms?**\n\nResearchers are studying why some people with NAGA gene variants have severe signs and symptoms, while others with the same gene variant have milder features or no features at all. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, such as alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, belong to a large family of lysosomal storage disorders.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAlpha-galactosidase B deficiency\nAlpha-galNAc deficiency, Schindler type\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency\nAlpha-NAGA deficiency\nAngiokeratoma corporis diffusum-glycopeptiduria\nGALB deficiency\nKanzaki disease\nLysosomal glycoaminoacid storage disease-angiokeratoma corporis diffusum\nNAGA deficiency type I\nNAGA deficiency type II\nNAGA deficiency type III\nNeuroaxonal dystrophy, Schindler type\nNeuronal axonal dystrophy, Schindler type\nSchindler disease type I\nSchindler disease type II\nSchindler disease type III\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\t* Genetic Testing Registry: Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1\n\t* Genetic Testing Registry: Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 2\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\t* Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1\n\t* Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 2\n\t* Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 3\n\t* Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials:\n\t* ClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t* SCHINDLER DISEASE, TYPE I\n\t* KANZAKI DISEASE\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency**\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   SCHINDLER DISEASE, TYPE I\n*   KANZAKI DISEASE\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Bakker HD, de Sonnaville ML, Vreken P, Abeling NG, Groener JE, Keulemans JL, van Diggelen OP.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in breaking down glycoproteins in the body.\n\n**Symptoms and Manifestations**\n\nThe symptoms of Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency can vary widely, but they often include:\n\n* Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum: a condition characterized by multiple small blood vessels visible under the skin\n* Glycopeptiduria: the presence of abnormal glycoproteins in the urine\n* Neurological manifestations: such as seizures, muscle weakness, and developmental delays\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nAlpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency is caused by mutations in the NAGA gene. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Enzyme replacement therapy: to replace the deficient enzyme\n* Medications: to manage seizures, muscle weakness, and other symptoms\n* Lifestyle modifications: such as a balanced diet and regular exercise\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase Deficiency varies widely depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. Some individuals may experience significant developmental delays or neurological impairment, while others may have milder symptoms.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders\n* Genetic Brain Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?",

    "content": "**Alpha-mannosidosis**\n\nAlpha-mannosidosis is a rare inherited disorder that causes problems in many organs and tissues of the body. Affected individuals may have intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities.\n\n**Characteristics of Facial Features**\n\nCharacteristic facial features can include:\n\n*   A large head\n*   Prominent forehead\n*   Low hairline\n*   Rounded eyebrows\n*   Large ears\n*   Flattened bridge of the nose\n*   Protruding jaw\n*   Widely spaced teeth\n*   Overgrown gums\n*   Large tongue\n\n**Skeletal Abnormalities**\n\nThe skeletal abnormalities that can occur in this disorder include:\n\n*   Reduced bone density (osteopenia)\n*   Thickening of the bones at the top of the skull (calvaria)\n*   Deformations of the bones in the spine (vertebrae)\n*   Knock knees\n*   Deterioration of the bones and joints\n\n**Other Symptoms**\n\nAffected individuals may also experience:\n\n*   Difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia)\n*   Muscle weakness (myopathy)\n*   Delay in developing motor skills such as sitting and walking\n*   Speech impairments\n*   Increased risk of infections\n*   Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n*   A buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus)\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract)\n\n**Psychiatric Symptoms**\n\nSome people with alpha-mannosidosis experience psychiatric symptoms such as:\n\n*   Depression\n*   Anxiety\n*   Hallucinations\n\nThese episodes may be triggered by stressors such as having undergone surgery, emotional upset, or changes in routine.\n\n**Severity of the Disorder**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of alpha-mannosidosis can range from mild to severe. The disorder may appear in infancy with rapid progression and severe neurological deterioration. Individuals with this early-onset form of alpha-mannosidosis often do not survive past childhood. In the most severe cases, an affected fetus may die before birth. Other individuals with alpha-mannosidosis experience milder signs and symptoms that appear later and progress more slowly. People with later-onset alpha-mannosidosis may survive into their fifties. The mildest cases may be detected only through laboratory testing and result in few if any symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-mannosidosis**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the MAN2B1 gene cause alpha-mannosidosis. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-mannosidase, which works in the lysosomes to break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). In particular, alpha-mannosidase helps break down oligosaccharides containing a sugar molecule called mannose.\n\nMutations in the MAN2B1 gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-mannosidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down mannose-containing oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Tissues and organs are damaged by the abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides and the resulting cell death, leading to the characteristic features of alpha-mannosidosis.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlpha-mannosidosis is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 500,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of alpha-mannosidosis can range from mild to severe. The disorder may appear in infancy with rapid progression and severe neurological deterioration. Individuals with this early-onset form of alpha-mannosidosis often do not survive past childhood.

People with later-onset alpha-mannosidosis may survive into their fifties. The mildest cases may be detected only through laboratory testing and result in few if any symptoms.\n\nAffected individuals may have intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Characteristic facial features can include a large head, prominent forehead, low hairline, rounded eyebrows, large ears, flattened bridge of the nose, protruding jaw, widely spaced teeth, overgrown gums, and large tongue.\n\nThe skeletal abnormalities that can occur in this disorder include reduced bone density (osteopenia), thickening of the bones at the top of the skull (calvaria), deformations of the bones in the spine (vertebrae), knock knees, and deterioration of the bones and joints.\n\nAffected individuals may also experience difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia); muscle weakness (myopathy); delay in developing motor skills such as sitting and walking; speech impairments; increased risk of infections; enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus); hearing loss; and a clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract).\n\nSome people with alpha-mannosidosis experience psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or hallucinations; episodes of psychiatric disturbance may be triggered by stressors such as having undergone surgery, emotional upset, or changes in routine.\n\n---\n\n**Alpha-Mannosidosis**\n\n**What is Alpha-Mannosidosis?**\n\nAlpha-mannosidosis is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-mannosidase.

    "content": "**Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency**\n\nAlpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency is a disorder that causes a variety of neurological problems that begin in adulthood and slowly get worse. People with AMACR deficiency may have a gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), seizures, and migraines. They may also have acute episodes of brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) similar to stroke, involving altered consciousness and areas of damage (lesions) in the brain. Other features of AMACR deficiency may include weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (sensorimotor neuropathy), muscle stiffness (spasticity), and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). Vision problems caused by deterioration of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) can also occur in this disorder.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAMACR deficiency is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown. At least 10 cases have been described in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAMACR deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMACR gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). The AMACR enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.

    "content": "**Alport Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAlport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities.\n\nPeople with Alport syndrome experience progressive loss of kidney function. Almost all affected individuals have blood in their urine (hematuria), which indicates abnormal functioning of the kidneys. Many people with Alport syndrome also develop high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). The kidneys gradually lose their ability to efficiently remove waste products from the body, resulting in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).\n\nIn late childhood or early adolescence, many people with Alport syndrome develop sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. Affected individuals may also have misshapen lenses in their eyes (anterior lenticonus) and abnormal coloration of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. These eye abnormalities seldom lead to vision loss.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlport syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes cause Alport syndrome. These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called collagen IV. Collagen IV plays an important role in the kidneys, specifically in structures called glomeruli. Glomeruli are clusters of specialized blood vessels that remove water and waste products from blood and create urine.\n\nVariants in these genes result in the production of abnormal versions of collagen IV in glomeruli. Kidneys with abnormal collagen IV cannot properly filter the blood, which allows blood and protein to pass into the urine, causing hematuria and proteinuria. Gradual scarring of the kidneys occurs, eventually leading to kidney failure in many people with Alport syndrome.\n\nCollagen IV is also an important component of inner ear structures, particularly the organ of Corti, that transform sound waves into nerve impulses for the brain. Altered versions of collagen IV in the inner ear impair its function, which can lead to hearing loss.\n\nIn the eye, collagen IV is important for maintaining the shape of the lens and the normal color of the retina. Abnormal versions of collagen IV in the eye can result in misshapen lenses and an abnormally colored retina.\n\n---\n\n**Alport Syndrome**\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes cause Alport syndrome.

Kidneys with abnormal collagen IV cannot properly filter the blood, which allows blood and protein to pass into the urine, causing hematuria and proteinuria.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAlport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns:\n\n*   **X-linked Pattern**: About two out of three cases are caused by variants in the COL4A5 gene and are inherited in an X-linked pattern. The COL4A5 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes.\n    *   In males (who have only one X chromosome), a variant in the only copy of the COL4A5 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause kidney failure and other severe symptoms of the disorder.\n    *   In females (who have two copies of the X chromosome), a variant in one copy of the COL4A5 gene usually only results in hematuria, but some people experience more severe symptoms.\n*   **Autosomal Recessive Pattern**: Alport syndrome is caused by variants in both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The parents of an individual with the autosomal recessive form of this condition each have one copy of the altered gene and are called carriers.\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Pattern**: Alport syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in about 20 to 30 percent of cases. People with this form of Alport syndrome have one variant in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene in each cell.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   Variants in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes cause Alport syndrome.\n*   Collagen IV plays an important role in the kidneys, specifically in structures called glomeruli.\n*   Abnormal versions of collagen IV result in the production of abnormal collagen IV in glomeruli.\n*   Alport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns, including X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Alport Syndrome**\n\n**Inherited Forms**\n\n*   In approximately 15 percent of cases, Alport syndrome is caused by variants in both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n*   The parents of an individual with the autosomal recessive form of this condition each have one copy of the altered gene and are called carriers. Some carriers are unaffected, while others develop a less severe condition called thin basement membrane nephropathy, which is characterized by hematuria.\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Pattern**\n\n*   Alport syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in about 20 to 30 percent of cases.\n*   People with this form of Alport syndrome have one variant in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene in each cell. It remains unclear why some individuals with one variant in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene have progressive kidney disease (autosomal dominant Alport syndrome) and others have only hematuria (thin basement membrane nephropathy).\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Congenital hereditary hematuria\n*   Hematuria-nephropathy-deafness syndrome\n*   Hematuric hereditary nephritis\n*   Hemorrhagic familial nephritis\n*   Hemorrhagic hereditary nephritis\n*   Hereditary familial congenital hemorrhagic nephritis\n*   Hereditary hematuria syndrome\n*   Hereditary interstitial pyelonephritis\n*   Hereditary nephritis\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Alport syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: X-linked Alport syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Alport Syndrome**\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nAlport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, eyes, and ears. It is caused by mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes, which are responsible for producing type IV collagen.\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nThe prognosis of Alport syndrome varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of any complications. In general, individuals with Alport syndrome can experience kidney failure, hearing loss, and eye problems.\n\n**Kidney Diseases**\n\nGene variants that affect health and development can be inherited in different ways, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive patterns.\n\n**Prognosis of a Genetic Condition**\n\nThe prognosis of Alport syndrome is generally poor, with most individuals experiencing kidney failure by the age of 30. However, early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown to delay renal failure and improve life expectancy.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nAlport syndrome can be treated with medications that help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. In some cases, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAlport syndrome is typically inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, meaning that females are more likely to be affected than males. However, autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported.\n\n**Gene Variants and Health**\n\nGene variants that affect health and development can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. Understanding the genetic basis of a condition can help healthcare providers develop effective treatment plans and provide patients with accurate information about their prognosis.\n\n**Disorder Running in Family**\n\nIf a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component to the condition. In the case of Alport syndrome, a family history of kidney disease or hearing loss may suggest a genetic link.\n\n**Genetic Condition Treatment**\n\nGenetic conditions can be treated or managed in various ways, depending on the specific condition and its severity. Understanding the genetic basis of a condition is crucial for developing effective treatment plans and providing patients with accurate information about their prognosis.",

    "content": "**Alport Syndrome**\n\nAlport syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that damages the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. It can also cause hearing loss and eye problems.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlport syndrome is an inherited form of kidney inflammation (nephritis). It is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen.\n\nThe disorder is rare. There are three genetic types:\n\n* **X-linked Alport Syndrome (XLAS)**: This is the most common type. The disease is more severe in males than in females.\n* **Autosomal Recessive Alport Syndrome (ARAS)**: Males and females have equally severe disease.\n* **Autosomal Dominant Alport Syndrome (ADAS)**: This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease.\n\nWith all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood.\n\nAt first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear.\n\n* **Kidney Problems**\n\t+ Abnormal urine color\n\t+ Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise\n\t+ Flank pain\n\t+ High blood pressure\n\t+ Swelling throughout the body (edema)\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Poor appetite\n\t+ Excessive thirst\n* **Hearing Loss**\n\t+ Over time, Alport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults.\n* **Eye Problems**\n\t+ Alport syndrome also leads to eye problems in those with XLAS and ARAS, including:\n\t\t- Abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as cataracts.\n\t\t- Corneal erosion in which there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision.\n\t\t- Abnormal coloring of the retina, a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy. It doesn't cause vision problems, but can help diagnose Alport syndrome.\n\t\t- Macular hole in which there is thinning or a break in the macula. The macula is a part of the retina that makes central vision sharper and more detailed. A macular hole causes blurred or distorted central vision.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* **BUN and serum creatinine**\n* **Complete blood count**\n* **Renal biopsy**\n* **Urinalysis**\n\nIf your provider suspects you have Alport syndrome, you will also likely have vision and hearing tests.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment include monitoring and controlling the disease and treating the symptoms.\n\nYour provider may recommend any of the following:\n\n* A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium\n* Medicines to control high blood pressure\n\nKidney disease is managed by:\n\n* Taking medicines to slow kidney damage\n* A diet that limits salt, fluids, and protein\n\nHearing loss can be managed with hearing aids. Eye problems are treated as needed. For example, an abnormal lens due to lenticonus or cataracts can be replaced.\n\nGenetic counseling may be recommended because the disorder is inherited.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with Alport syndrome and their families can be found at:\n\n* **Alport Syndrome Foundation**: alportsyndrome.org/for-patients/patient-resources/\n* **National Kidney Foundation**: www.kidney.org/atoz/content/alport\n* **National Organization for Rare Disorders**: rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/alport-syndrome\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the type of Alport syndrome, biological sex, and age.\n\nFor both males and females, kidney function will worsen over time. In males with XLAS, this may lead to kidney failure at an earlier age. Most men with XLAS will experience kidney failure by age 60. Women with XLAS may or may not have kidney problems, but the risk increases with age.\n\nBoth males and females with ARAS will develop kidney failure by early adulthood.\n\nADAS progresses slowly in both males and females, and kidney failure may not occur until later in life.\n\nAs kidneys fail, dialysis or a kidney transplant will be needed. Kidney transplant is often very successful in people with Alport syndrome.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\n\n* You have symptoms of Alport syndrome.\n* You have a family history of Alport syndrome and you are planning to get pregnant.\n* Your urine output decreases or stops or you see blood in your urine (this may be a symptom of chronic kidney disease).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAwareness of risk factors, such as a family history of the disorder, may allow the condition to be detected early.\n\n---\n\n**Alport Syndrome**\n\nAlport syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that damages the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney inflammation (nephritis). It can also cause hearing loss and eye problems.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe disorder is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen. There are three genetic types:\n\n*   **X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS)**: The most common type, with more severe disease in males than in females.\n*   **Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS)**: Males and females have equally severe disease.\n*   **Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS)**: The rarest type, with equally severe disease in males and females.\n\n**Kidney Damage**\n\nThe tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged, leading to a loss of kidney function. Waste products and fluids build up in the body, and the condition can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear, including:\n\n*   Abnormal urine color\n*   Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise\n*   Flank pain\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Swelling throughout the body (edema)\n*   Fatigue\n*   Poor appetite\n*   Excessive thirst\n\n**Hearing Loss**\n\nAlport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. The timing of hearing loss varies depending on the type of Alport syndrome:\n\n*   **X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS)**: Common in males with XLAS by early teens, though less common in females and occurs when they're adults.\n*   **Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS)**: Boys and girls have hearing loss during childhood.\n*   **Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS)**: Occurs later in life.\n\n**Eye Problems**\n\nAlport syndrome also leads to eye problems, including:\n\n*   Abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as cataracts.\n*   Corneal erosion, where there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision.\n*   Abnormal coloring of the retina, a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy.

It is characterized by a group of hereditary disorders that affect the type IV collagen in the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Alport syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes. These genes provide instructions for making a protein called type IV collagen, which is an important component of basement membranes in the kidneys, ears, and eyes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Alport syndrome can vary depending on the severity of the disorder. They may include:\n\n*   Hematuria (blood in the urine)\n*   Proteinuria (excess protein in the urine)\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Eye problems, such as glaucoma or cataracts\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing Alport syndrome can be challenging, but it is typically done through a combination of genetic testing, kidney biopsy, and imaging studies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Alport syndrome, but treatment and management options are available to help slow the progression of the disease. These may include:\n\n*   Kidney transplantation\n*   Dialysis\n*   Medications to control blood pressure and prevent kidney damage\n*   Hearing aids or cochlear implants for hearing loss\n*   Surgery to correct eye problems\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Alport syndrome varies depending on the severity of the disorder. With proper treatment and management, some people may be able to slow the progression of the disease and live a relatively normal life. However, others may experience more severe symptoms and require ongoing medical care.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Hearing Disorders and Deafness\n*   Kidney Diseases",

Alprazolam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlprazolam comes as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and a concentrated solution (liquid) to take by mouth.\n\n*   The tablet, orally disintegrating tablet, and concentrated solution usually are taken two to four times a day.\n*   The extended-release tablet is taken once daily, usually in the morning. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take alprazolam exactly as directed.\n\nTo take the concentrated liquid, use only the dropper that came with your prescription. Draw into the dropper the amount prescribed for one dose. Squeeze the dropper contents into a liquid or semisolid food such as water, juice, soda, applesauce, or pudding. Stir the liquid or food gently for a few seconds. The concentrated liquid will blend completely with the food. Drink or eat the entire mixture immediately. Do not store for future use.\n\nRemove the orally disintegrating tablet from the bottle just before it is time for your dose. With dry hands, open the bottle, remove the tablet, and immediately place it on your tongue. The tablet will dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. The orally disintegrating tablet can be taken with or without water.\n\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not chew, crush, or break them.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of alprazolam and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 3 or 4 days.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAlprazolam is also sometimes used to treat depression, fear of open spaces (agoraphobia), and premenstrual syndrome.

    "content": "**Alprostadil Urogenital**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlprostadil injection and suppositories are used to treat certain types of erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Alprostadil injection is also sometimes used in combination with other tests to diagnose erectile dysfunction. Alprostadil is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the muscles and blood vessels in the penis to keep enough blood in the penis so that an erection can occur.\n\nAlprostadil does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. Alprostadil does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlprostadil comes as a powder to be mixed with the liquid provided in the package and injected into the penis and as a urethral suppository (pellet to be placed into the urinary opening of the penis). Alprostadil is used as needed before sexual activity. An erection may occur within 5 to 20 minutes after using the injection and within 5 to 10 minutes after using the pellet. The erection should last approximately 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nAlprostadil injection should not be used more than three times per week, with at least 24 hours between uses. Alprostadil pellets should not be used more than twice in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use alprostadil exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will administer the first dose of alprostadil in his or her office to determine the proper dose for you. After you begin to use alprostadil at home, your doctor may gradually increase or decrease your dose. Tell your doctor if you do not experience satisfactory erections or if your erections last for too long, but do not change your dose without talking to your doctor.\n\nYou must be trained by your doctor before using alprostadil at home. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use alprostadil. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use your medication.\n\nNeedle breakage has occurred during administration of alprostadil To minimize the risk of this occurring, make sure you use the proper needle as instructed by your doctor or nurse. Make sure to always insert the appropriate needle perpendicular to the long axis of the penis.\n\nDo not reuse needles, syringes, cartridges, vials, pellets, or applicators. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the container.\n\n---\n\n**Alprostadil Urogenital: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **What is Alprostadil?**\n\n    Alprostadil comes as a powder to be mixed with the liquid provided in the package and injected into the penis, or as a urethral suppository (pellet to be placed into the urinary opening of the penis). It is used as needed before sexual activity.\n\n*   **How to Use Alprostadil**\n\n    An erection may occur within 5 to 20 minutes after using the injection and within 5 to 10 minutes after using the pellet. The erection should last approximately 30 to 60 minutes. Alprostadil injection should not be used more than three times per week, with at least 24 hours between uses. Alprostadil pellets should not be used more than twice in a 24-hour period.\n\n*   **Special Precautions**\n\n    Before using alprostadil, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to alprostadil; other prostaglandin medications such as misoprostol (Cytotec, in Arthrotec), bimatoprost (Lumigan), latanoprost (Xalatan), and travoprost (Travatan); or any other medications. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid sexual activity for medical reasons and if you have or have ever had blood cell problems such as sickle cell anemia, leukemia, multiple myeloma, thrombocythemia, or polycythemia.\n\n    If you are using the alprostadil pellet, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any narrowing, scarring, or swelling of the urinary opening of the penis or the tip of the penis. Your doctor will probably tell you not to use alprostadil pellets.\n\n---\n\n**Alprostadil Urogenital: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What should I know about using this medication?**\n\n*   You should not use alprostadil if you are having sex with a pregnant woman without using a condom barrier.\n*   Alprostadil may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting. Do not drive a car or operate machinery after using alprostadil until you know how this medication affects you.\n*   Talk to your doctor about the use of alcohol during your treatment with alprostadil. Alcohol may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   You should know that a small amount of bleeding may occur in the area where the medication was given. This can increase the risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases (conditions that are spread through contaminated blood) such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C between you and your partner. Tell your doctor if you or your partner has a blood-borne disease.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\n*   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Alprostadil may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n    *   Bleeding or bruising in the place where you administered the medication\n    *   Pain or aching in the penis, testicles, legs, or perineum (area between the penis and rectum)\n    *   Warmth or burning sensation in the urinary opening of the penis\n    *   Redness of the penis\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Rash\n\n**Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency treatment:**\n\n*   Erection lasting more than 4 hours\n*   Redness, swelling, tenderness, or unusual curving of the erect penis\n*   Breakage of the needle in the penis\n*   Nodules or hard areas on the penis\n*   Fast heartbeat\n*   Fainting\n*   Swollen veins in the legs\n\n**If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).**\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\n*   Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Alström Syndrome**\n\nAlström syndrome is a rare condition that affects many body systems. Many of the signs and symptoms of this condition begin in infancy or early childhood, although some appear later in life.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nAlström syndrome is characterized by a progressive loss of vision and hearing, a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy), obesity, type 2 diabetes (the most common form of diabetes), and short stature. This disorder can also cause serious or life-threatening medical problems involving the liver, kidneys, bladder, and lungs. Some individuals with Alström syndrome have a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans, which causes the skin in body folds and creases to become thick, dark, and velvety.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nMore than 900 people with Alström syndrome have been reported worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ALMS1 gene cause Alström syndrome. The ALMS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Mutations in this gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ALMS1 protein. This protein is normally present at low levels in most tissues, so a loss of the protein's normal function may help explain why the signs and symptoms of Alström syndrome affect many parts of the body.\n\nNote: I removed the redundant sections and formatted the content to make it easier to read. I also kept the original HTML tags and structure to ensure that the formatting is preserved.\n\n---\n\n**Alström Syndrome**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Alström syndrome\n\n*   **ALMS1**: Mutations in the ALMS1 gene cause Alström syndrome.

    "content": "**Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\n**Description**\n\\n\\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\\n\\n\nIn addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.\n\n**Triggers**\n\\n\\n\nThe episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known.\n\n**Sleep Pattern**\n\\n\\n\nA characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening.\n\n**Cognitive Problems**\n\\n\\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems.

Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 1 million people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis.\n* The condition affects approximately 1 in 1 million people.\n* Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene are primarily responsible for the condition.\n* The condition can also run in families and is considered an autosomal dominant disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\n**What is Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood?**\n\nAlternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare neurological disorder that affects children, typically between the ages of 1 and 5. The condition is characterized by episodes of weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, which can alternate sides.\n\n**Causes of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\nCases of AHC result from new mutations in the ATP1A2 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Alternating hemiplegia syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood 2\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 1; AHC1\n\t+ ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2; AHC2\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood 2\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Alternating hemiplegia of childhood\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 1; AHC1\n* ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2; AHC2\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\n**Early Characteristics and Evolution of a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome**\n\nSchlesinger-Massart M, Lewelt AJ, Reyna SP, Swoboda KJ.

If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy.\n\n**Information**\n\nThere are many forms of alternative medicine for pain relief. They include:\n\n*   **Acupuncture**: stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods\n*   **Chiropractic**: a type of alternative medicine that focuses on the relationship between the spine and overall health\n*   **Herbal Medicine**: the use of various parts of plants to treat medical conditions\n*   **Massage**: manipulating soft tissue to relieve pain, stiffness, and stress\n*   **Magnetic Waves**: using magnetic fields to stimulate healing\n*   **Hypnosis**: a focused state of concentration used to relieve pain and other symptoms\n*   **Biofeedback**: providing information about your body's functions to help you take control of them\n*   **Meditation**: a practice that helps you focus your mind and reduce stress\n*   **Yoga**: a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit\n*   **Tai-Chi**: an ancient Chinese martial art that combines movement, breathing, and meditation\n\n**Acupuncture**\n\nAcupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods.

When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain.\n\nAcupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and headache pain. Acupuncture may also help relieve pain due to:\n\n*   **Cancer**\n*   **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n*   **Fibromyalgia**\n*   **Childbirth (labor)**\n*   **Musculoskeletal Injuries (such as the neck, shoulder, knee, or elbow)**\n*   **Osteoarthritis**\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis**\n\n**Hypnosis**\n\nHypnosis is a focused state of concentration.

One can find how to take control of these functions to help their symptoms.\n\n**Herbal Medicine**\n\nHerbal medicine involves the use of various parts of plants to treat medical conditions. Many herbal medicines can interact with prescribed medicines, or can have other undesired effects. It is important to discuss all herbal therapies with your health care provider.\n\n**Magnetic Waves**\n\nSome find magnetic waves helpful for healing, but these can interfere with certain medical devices and should be used only under direction of a medical provider during pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Medicine for Pain Relief**\n\nThere are many forms of alternative medicine for pain relief, including acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, magnetic waves, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and tai-chi.\n\n**Acupuncture**\n\nAcupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods.

    "content": "**Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV)**\n\n**What is Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins?**\n\nAlveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a disorder affecting the development of the lungs and their blood vessels. The disorder affects the millions of small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs and the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the alveoli.\n\n**How Does ACD/MPV Affect the Lungs?**\n\nIn ACD/MPV, the alveolar capillaries fail to develop normally. The number of capillaries is drastically reduced, and existing capillaries are improperly positioned within the walls of the alveoli. These abnormalities in capillary number and location impede the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n**Other Abnormalities of the Blood Vessels**\n\nOther abnormalities of the blood vessels in the lungs also occur in ACD/MPV. The veins that carry blood from the lungs into the heart (pulmonary veins) are improperly positioned and may be abnormally bundled together with arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary arteries). The muscle tissue in the walls of the pulmonary arteries may be overgrown, resulting in thicker artery walls and a narrower channel.\n\n**Additional Abnormalities**\n\nMost infants with ACD/MPV are born with additional abnormalities. These may include abnormal twisting (malrotation) of the large intestine or other malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiovascular and genitourinary abnormalities are also common in affected individuals.\n\n**Symptoms and Prognosis**\n\nInfants with ACD/MPV typically develop respiratory distress within a few minutes to a few hours after birth. They experience shortness of breath and cyanosis, which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area underneath the fingernails caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. Without lung transplantation, infants with ACD/MPV have not been known to survive past one year of age, and most affected infants live only a few weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins**\n\n**What is Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins?**\n\nAlveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a rare disorder affecting the development of the lungs and their blood vessels. It affects the millions of small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs and the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the alveoli.\n\n**Causes**\n\nACD/MPV can be caused by mutations in the FOXF1 gene or a deletion of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 16 in a region known as 16q24.1. The FOXF1 protein is important in development of the lungs and their blood vessels, and it also regulates the development of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants with ACD/MPV typically develop respiratory distress within a few minutes to a few hours after birth. They experience shortness of breath and cyanosis, which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area underneath the fingernails caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nWithout lung transplantation, infants with ACD/MPV have not been known to survive past one year of age, and most affected infants live only a few weeks.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nACD/MPV is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Approximately 200 infants with this disorder have been identified worldwide.\n\n**Additional Abnormalities**\n\nMost infants with ACD/MPV are born with additional abnormalities, which may include abnormal twisting (malrotation) of the large intestine or other malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiovascular and genitourinary abnormalities are also common in affected individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins**\n\n**Normal Formation of the Pulmonary Blood Vessels and Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nACD/MPV can also be caused by a deletion of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 16 in a region known as 16q24.1. This region includes several genes, including the FOXF1 gene. Deletion of one copy of the FOXF1 gene in each cell reduces the production of the FOXF1 protein. A shortage of FOXF1 protein affects the development of pulmonary blood vessels and causes the main features of ACD/MPV.\n\n**Genetic Cause**\n\nIn about 60 percent of affected infants, the genetic cause of ACD/MPV is unknown.\n\n**Learn More About the Gene and Chromosome Associated with Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins**\n\n* FOXF1\n* chromosome 16\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nACD/MPV is usually not inherited, and most affected people have no history of the disorder in their family. The genetic changes associated with this condition usually occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ACD\n* ACD/MPV\n* ACDMPV\n* Alveolar capillary dysplasia\n* Congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia\n* Familial persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn\n* Misalignment of the pulmonary vessels\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Persistent fetal circulation syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS; ACDMPV\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Antao B, Samuel M, Kiely E, Spitz L, Malone M.

It is characterized by an abnormal formation of the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ACD is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the development of the lungs. Some studies have identified specific genetic mutations that can increase the risk of developing ACD.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ACD can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Respiratory distress\n* Cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin)\n* Pulmonary hypertension\n* Congestive heart failure\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ACD can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other lung disorders. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nThere is no cure for ACD, and treatment is primarily focused on managing the symptoms and supporting the patient's respiratory function. The prognosis for patients with ACD is generally poor, with most cases resulting in death within the first year of life.\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nACD is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the lungs. It is caused by specific genetic mutations that can increase the risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nGenetics play a crucial role in the development and function of the lungs. Understanding how genetic variants can affect health and development is essential for identifying and managing genetic disorders like ACD.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Pulmonary Hypertension",

    "content": "**Alvimopan: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nAlvimopan is used to help the bowel recover more quickly after bowel surgery, so that you can eat solid foods and have regular bowel movements. Alvimopan is in a class of medications called peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. It works by protecting the bowel from the constipation effects of opioid (narcotic) medications that are used to treat pain after surgery.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\nAlvimopan comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once shortly before bowel surgery. After the surgery, it is usually taken twice a day for up to 7 days or until hospital discharge. Your nurse will bring your medication to you when it is time for you to receive each dose.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\nThis medication should not be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\nBefore taking alvimopan, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to alvimopan or any other medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any opioid (narcotic) medications for pain. Your doctor may tell you not to take alvimopan if you have taken any opioid medications during the 7 days before your surgery.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with alvimopan. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with alvimopan. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting alvimopan with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had a complete bowel obstruction (blockage in your intestine); or kidney or liver disease. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\nAlvimopan may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* constipation\n* gas\n* heartburn\n* difficulty urinating\n* back pain\n\nAlvimopan may cause other side effects. Tell your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIn one study, people who took alvimopan for up to 12 months were more likely to experience heart attacks than people who did not take alvimopan. However, in another study, people who took alvimopan for up to 7 days following bowel surgery were no more likely to experience heart attacks than people who did not take alvimopan. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking alvimopan.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n---\n\n**Alvimopan: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n*constipation*\n*gas*\n*heartburn*\n*difficulty urinating*\n*back pain*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Side Effects**\n\nAlvimopan may cause other side effects.

Symptoms may include:\n\n* Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n* Delusions, depression, and agitation\n* Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving\n* Difficulty reading or writing\n* Forgetting details about current events\n* Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness\n* Hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior\n* Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger\n* Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences\n* Withdrawing from social contact\n\nPeople with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer:\n\n* Recognize family members\n* Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing\n* Understand language\n\nOther symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease:\n\n* Problems controlling bowel movements or urine\n* Swallowing problems\n\n**Alzheimer Disease Symptoms**\n\nAlzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:\n\n* Emotional behavior or personality\n* Language\n* Memory\n* Perception\n* Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills)\n\n**Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**\n\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease.\n\nSymptoms of MCI include:\n\n* Difficulty doing more than one task at a time\n* Difficulty solving problems or making decisions\n* Forgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations\n* Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities\n\n**Early Symptoms of Alzheimer Disease**\n\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include:\n\n* Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines\n* Getting lost on familiar routes\n* Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects\n* Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood\n* Misplacing items\n* Personality changes and loss of social skills\n* Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior\n* Poor performance of job duties\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present.\n\nA skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps:\n\n* Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam.\n* Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms.\n* Mental function tests (mental status examination).\n* Neuropsychological testing.\n* PET scan and lumbar puncture (spinal tap) are sometimes needed to confirm Alzheimer disease.\n\nTests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including:\n\n* Anemia\n* Brain tumor\n* Long-term (chronic) infection\n* Intoxication from medicines\n* Severe depression\n* Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus)\n* Stroke\n* Thyroid disease\n* Vitamin deficiency\n\nCT or MRI of the brain may be done to look for other causes of dementia, such as a brain tumor or stroke.\n\nThe only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death.\n\n---\n\n**Alzheimer Disease**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are:\n\n* Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do)\n* Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems\n* Change the home environment to make daily activities easier\n* Support family members and other caregivers\n\nMedicines are used to:\n\n* Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these medicines may be small\n* Lower the amount of beta amyloid protein in the brain\n* Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\n\nBefore using these medicines, ask your provider:\n\n* What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk?\n* When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines?\n* Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped?\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nHaving Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.\n\nPeople with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis.\n\nFamilies will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care.\n\nThe final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status\n* The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse\n* You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAlthough there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease:\n\n* Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n* Get plenty of exercise.\n* Stay mentally and socially active.\n* Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSenile dementia - Alzheimer type (SDAT); SDAT; Dementia - Alzheimer; Alzheimer's disease\n\n---\n\n**Alzheimer Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Budson AE, Solomon PR.
