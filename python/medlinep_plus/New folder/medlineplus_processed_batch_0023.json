    "content": "**Beriberi**\n\nBeriberi is a disease in which the body does not have enough thiamine (vitamin B1).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are two major types of beriberi:\n\n* **Wet Beriberi**: Affects the cardiovascular system.\n* **Dry Beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome**: Affects the nervous system.\n\nBeriberi is rare in the United States. This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1.\n\nIn rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics.\n\nBeriberi can occur in infants when they are:\n\n* **Breastfed and the mother's body is lacking in thiamine**\n* **Fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine**\n\nSome medical treatments that can raise your risk of beriberi are:\n\n* **Getting dialysis**\n* **Taking high doses of diuretics (water pills)**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of dry beriberi include:\n\n* **Difficulty walking**\n* **Loss of feeling (sensation) in hands and feet**\n* **Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs**\n* **Mental confusion**\n* **Pain**\n* **Speech difficulties**\n* **Strange eye movements (nystagmus)**\n* **Tingling**\n* **Vomiting**\n\nSymptoms of wet beriberi include:\n\n* **Awakening at night short of breath**\n* **Increased heart rate**\n* **Shortness of breath with activity**\n* **Swelling of the lower legs**\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical examination may show signs of congestive heart failure, including:\n\n* **Difficulty breathing, with neck veins that stick out**\n* **Enlarged heart**\n* **Fluid in the lungs**\n* **Rapid heartbeat**\n* **Swelling in both lower legs**\n\nA person with late-stage beriberi may be confused or have memory loss and delusions. The person may be less able to sense vibrations.\n\nA neurological exam may show signs of:\n\n* **Changes in walking**\n* **Coordination problems**\n* **Decreased reflexes**\n* **Drooping of the eyelids**\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* **Blood tests to measure the amount of thiamine in the blood**\n* **Urine tests to see if thiamine is passing through the urine**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to replace the thiamine your body is lacking. This is done with thiamine supplements. Thiamine supplements are given through a shot (injection) or taken by mouth.\n\nYour provider may also suggest other types of vitamins.\n\nBlood tests may be repeated after the treatment is started. These tests will show how well you are responding to the medicine.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nUntreated, beriberi can be fatal. With treatment, symptoms usually improve quickly.\n\nHeart damage is usually reversible. A full recovery is expected in these cases. However, if acute heart failure has already occurred, the outlook is poor.\n\nNervous system damage is also reversible, if caught early. If it is not caught early, some symptoms (such as memory loss or confusion) may remain, even with treatment.\n\nIf a person with Wernicke encephalopathy receives thiamine replacement, language problems, unusual eye movements, and walking difficulties may go away. However, Korsakoff syndrome (or Korsakoff psychosis) may develop as Wernicke symptoms go away.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* **Coma**\n* **Congestive heart failure**\n* **Death**\n* **Psychosis**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nBeriberi is extremely rare in the United States. However, contact your provider if:\n\n* **You feel your family's diet is inadequate or poorly balanced**\n* **You or your children have any symptoms of beriberi**\n\n**Prevention**\n\nEating a proper diet that is rich in vitamins will prevent beriberi. Nursing mothers should make sure that their diet contains all vitamins. If your infant is not breastfed, make sure that the infant formula contains thiamine.\n\nIf you drink heavily, try to cut down or quit. Also, take B vitamins to help your body get enough thiamine.\n\n---\n\n**Beriberi**\n\nBeriberi is a disease caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are two major types of beriberi:\n\n*   **Wet Beriberi**: Affects the cardiovascular system.\n*   **Dry Beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome**: Affects the nervous system.\n\nBeriberi is rare in the United States due to many foods being vitamin enriched.

    "content": "**Bernard-Soulier Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is a bleeding disorder associated with abnormal platelets, which are blood cells involved in blood clotting. In affected individuals, platelets are unusually large and fewer in number than usual (a combination known as macrothrombocytopenia). People with Bernard-Soulier syndrome tend to bruise easily and have an increased risk of nosebleeds (epistaxis). They may also experience abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding following minor injury or surgery or even without trauma (spontaneous bleeding). Rarely, bleeding under the skin causes tiny red or purple spots on the skin called petechiae. Women with Bernard-Soulier syndrome often have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is estimated to occur in 1 in 1 million individuals; however, some doctors think the condition is underdiagnosed and may be more common.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is caused by mutations in one of three genes: GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9. The proteins produced from these genes are pieces (subunits) of a protein complex called glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V. This complex is found on the surface of platelets and plays an important role in blood clotting.\n\nThe GPIb-IX-V complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury. Binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.\n\nMost mutations in GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9 prevent the formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. Other mutations impair the complex's interaction with von Willebrand factor. All of these mutations impair clot formation, which leads to the excessive bleeding characteristic of Bernard-Soulier syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Bernard-Soulier Syndrome**\n\n**Causes of the Condition**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is caused by mutations in one of three genes: GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9. The proteins produced from these genes are pieces (subunits) of a protein complex called glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V.\n\n**The Role of the GPIb-IX-V Complex**\n\nThis complex is found on the surface of platelets and plays an important role in blood clotting. The GPIb-IX-V complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury.\n\n**How Platelets Form Clots**\n\nBinding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.\n\n**The Effect of Mutations on Clot Formation**\n\nMost mutations in GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9 prevent the formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. Other mutations impair the complex's interaction with von Willebrand factor. All of these mutations impair clot formation, which leads to the excessive bleeding characteristic of Bernard-Soulier syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of Bernard-Soulier syndrome are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9 gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\n**Rare Cases of Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**\n\nRare cases of Bernard-Soulier syndrome caused by mutations in the GP1BA or GP1BB gene are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. These individuals inherit the condition from an affected parent.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* BDPLT1\n* Bleeding disorder, platelet-type, 1\n* BSS (Deficiency of platelet glycoprotein 1b)\n* Giant platelet syndrome\n* Glycoprotein Ib, platelet, deficiency\n* Hemorrhagioparous thrombocytic dystrophy\n* Macrothrombocytopenia, familial Bernard-Soulier type\n* Platelet glycoprotein Ib deficiency\n* Von Willebrand factor receptor deficiency\n\n---\n\n**Bernard-Soulier Syndrome**\n\n**What is Bernard-Soulier syndrome?**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by prolonged bleeding due to the inability of platelets to aggregate and form blood clots. It is caused by mutations in the GPIX gene, which codes for a subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome include:\n\n* Prolonged bleeding from cuts or injuries\n* Easy bruising\n* Heavy menstrual bleeding\n* Postpartum hemorrhage\n* Bleeding gums and teeth\n\n**Causes**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is caused by mutations in the GPIX gene, which codes for a subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. These mutations lead to the production of abnormal glycoproteins that are unable to bind to von Willebrand factor, a protein necessary for blood clotting.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for Bernard-Soulier syndrome, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent bleeding episodes. Treatment may include:\n\n* Platelet transfusions\n* Antifibrinolytic therapy to reduce bleeding risk\n* Avoidance of aspirin and other antiplatelet medications\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Bernard-Soulier syndrome is generally good, especially if treatment is started early and consistently. With proper management, most people with this condition can lead normal lives.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nBernard-Soulier syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. The GPIX gene is located on chromosome 3q21 and codes for a subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex.\n\n**References**\n\n* Andrews RK, Berndt MC. Bernard-Soulier syndrome: an update.

It is most often done with other tests to measure esophageal function.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done in a gastroenterology laboratory. A nasogastric (NG) tube is passed through one side of your nose and into your esophagus. Mild hydrochloric acid will be sent down the tube, followed by salt water (saline) solution. This process may be repeated several times.\n\nYou will be asked to tell the health care team about any pain or discomfort you have during the test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will be asked not to eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may have a gagging feeling and some discomfort when the tube is put in place. The acid may cause symptoms of heartburn.

    "content": "**Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M) Tumor Marker Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?**\n\nA beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test measures the amount of a protein called beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in your body fluids. The test usually uses a sample of your blood. It may also be done using urine (pee) or in rare cases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n**What is B2M used for?**\n\nA beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test is most often used if you have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the bone marrow or blood. Testing your B2M levels can help:\n\n* Find out how much cancer is in your body\n* Predict how your cancer will develop\n* Pick your treatment and check whether it's working\n* Check whether cancer has spread to your brain and/or spinal cord (This is done only if you have symptoms.)\n\n**Why do I need a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?**\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or certain types of lymphoma, you may need a B2M test to find out how serious your disease is. B2M testing can help monitor your cancer and check whether your treatment is working.\n\n**What happens during a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?**\n\nA beta-2 microglobulin test usually uses a sample of your blood. In certain cases, you may need to provide a 24-hour urine sample, which means collecting all your urine for a full day. If your provider suspects that cancer has spread to your brain or spine, you may have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.\n\nFor a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a 24-hour urine sample, you will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps:\n\n* To begin, urinate (pee) in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine.\n* For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container.\n* During the collection period, store the urine container in the refrigerator or in a cooler with ice.\n* 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test.\n* Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.\n\nFor a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, a provider will do a procedure called a spinal tap (also known as a lumbar puncture). A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. A provider numbs your skin with medicine and uses a thin, hollow needle to remove some fluid from between the bones in your lower spine. You usually go home the same day.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFor blood and urine tests, there are no special preparations.\n\nFor a CSF analysis (spinal tap), you may be asked to empty your bladder (pee) and bowels (poop) before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nWith a blood test, there is very little risk. After the test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWith a urine test, there is no known risk.\n\nWith a CSF analysis, there is very little risk from a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back or have some bleeding where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache. The headache may last for several hours or up to a week or more. Your provider may suggest treatment to relieve the pain.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your B2M levels were measured to learn about your cancer:\n\n* The higher your B2M levels, the more cancer you have in your body. Higher levels are linked to cancers that tend to grow faster.\n* If you have multiple myeloma, higher levels of B2M are linked with kidney problems.\n\nIf your B2M levels were measured to check how well your treatment is working, your provider may look at several test results over time to look for a trend:\n\n* Increasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is not working.\n* Decreasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is working.\n* B2M levels that don't change may mean that your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse.\n\nIf you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M) Tumor Marker Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test measures the amount of a protein called beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in your body fluids.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/beta-thalassemia",
    "content": "**Beta Thalassemia**\n\nBeta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\nIn people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin reduce oxygen levels in the body. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. People with beta thalassemia are at an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots.\n\n**Classification**\n\nBeta thalassemia is classified into two types depending on the severity of symptoms: **Thalassemia Major (Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia or Cooley's Anemia)** and **Thalassemia Intermedia (Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia)**. Of the two types, thalassemia major is more severe.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Thalassemia Major**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of thalassemia major appear within the first 2 years of life. Children develop life-threatening anemia. They do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and may develop yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Affected individuals may have an enlarged spleen, liver, and heart, and their bones may be misshapen. Puberty is delayed in some adolescents with thalassemia major.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Thalassemia Intermedia**\n\nThalassemia intermedia is milder than thalassemia major. The signs and symptoms of thalassemia intermedia appear in early childhood or later in life. Affected individuals have mild to moderate anemia and may also have slow growth, bone abnormalities, and an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMany people with thalassemia major have such severe symptoms that they need frequent blood transfusions to replenish their red blood cell supply. Over time, an influx of iron-containing hemoglobin from chronic blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the body, resulting in liver, heart, and hormone problems.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Beta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin.\n* Low levels of hemoglobin reduce oxygen levels in the body and cause anemia.\n* Thalassemia major is more severe than thalassemia intermedia.\n* Symptoms of thalassemia major appear within the first 2 years of life, while symptoms of thalassemia intermedia appear in early childhood or later in life.\n\n---\n\n**Beta Thalassemia**\n\n**What is Beta Thalassemia?**\n\nBeta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.\n\n**Causes of Beta Thalassemia**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the HBB gene cause beta thalassemia. The HBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-globin, which is a component of hemoglobin. Some variants in the HBB gene prevent the production of any beta-globin, while others allow some beta-globin to be produced but in reduced amounts.\n\n**Types of Beta Thalassemia**\n\nBeta thalassemia is classified into two types depending on the severity of symptoms: thalassemia major (also known as transfusion-dependent thalassemia or Cooley's anemia) and thalassemia intermedia. Thalassemia major is more severe than thalassemia intermedia.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Beta Thalassemia**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of beta thalassemia include:\n\n*   Pale skin\n*   Weakness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Anemia (a shortage of red blood cells)\n*   Slow growth\n*   Bone abnormalities\n*   Increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Beta Thalassemia**\n\nThalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the HBB gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Frequency of Beta Thalassemia**\n\nBeta thalassemia is a fairly common blood disorder worldwide, occurring most frequently in people from Mediterranean countries, North Africa, the Middle East, India, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Thousands of infants with beta thalassemia are born each year.\n\n---\n\n**Beta Thalassemia**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\n*   Beta thalassemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the HBB gene in each cell have variants.\n*   The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n*   Sometimes, however, people with only one HBB gene variant in each cell develop mild anemia.

    "content": "**Beta-Carotene**\n\n**What is it?**\nBeta-carotene belongs to a group of colored pigments called carotenoids. It's converted to vitamin A in the body and found in many fruits and vegetables.\n\nBeta-carotene and other red, orange, and yellow pigments called carotenoids are considered antioxidants. They provide about 50% of the vitamin A needed in the diet. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects help to protect cells from damage.\n\nPeople use beta-carotene for an inherited disorder marked by sensitivity to light. It is also used to prevent certain cancers, heart disease, cataracts, aging skin, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\nMany global health authorities recommend getting beta-carotene and other antioxidants from food instead of supplements.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* **Effective for:**\n\t+ An inherited disorder marked by sensitivity to light (erythropoietic protoporphyria or EPP). Taking beta-carotene by mouth can reduce sensitivity to the sun in people with this condition.\n* **Possibly effective for:**\n\t+ Breast cancer. Eating more beta-carotene in the diet is linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in high-risk, pre-menopausal females. In people with breast cancer, eating more beta-carotene in the diet is linked to an increased chance of survival.\n\t+ Complications after childbirth. Taking beta-carotene by mouth before, during, and after pregnancy might decrease the risk of diarrhea and fever after childbirth. It also seems to reduce the risk of pregnancy-related death.\n\t+ Sunburn. Taking beta-carotene by mouth might decrease sunburn risk in people sensitive to the sun.\n* **Possibly ineffective for:**\n\t+ Ballooning of a blood vessel wall (aneurysm). Taking beta-carotene by mouth doesn't reduce the risk for an aneurysm in the stomach in male smokers.\n\t+ Alzheimer disease. Eating a diet high in beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease.\n\t+ Cataracts.

The recommended dose varies depending on the specific use and individual needs. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider before taking beta-carotene supplements.\n\n**Other names**\nBeta-carotene is also known as pro-vitamin A, carotenoid, and orange pigment.\n\n**Methodology**\nThe effectiveness ratings for beta-carotene are based on scientific evidence from various studies and sources, including the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database.\n\n---\n\n**Beta-Carotene: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Effective for...**\n\n* An inherited disorder marked by sensitivity to light (erythropoietic protoporphyria or EPP). Taking beta-carotene by mouth can reduce sensitivity to the sun in people with this condition.\n\n**Possibly effective for...**\n\n* Breast cancer. Eating more beta-carotene in the diet is linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in high-risk, pre-menopausal females. In people with breast cancer, eating more beta-carotene in the diet is linked to an increased chance of survival.\n* Complications after childbirth. Taking beta-carotene by mouth before, during, and after pregnancy might decrease the risk of diarrhea and fever after childbirth. It also seems to reduce the risk of pregnancy-related death.\n* Sunburn. Taking beta-carotene by mouth might decrease sunburn risk in people sensitive to the sun.\n\n**Possibly ineffective for...**\n\n* Ballooning of a blood vessel wall (aneurysm). Taking beta-carotene by mouth doesn't reduce the risk for an aneurysm in the stomach in male smokers.\n* Alzheimer disease. Eating a diet high in beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease.\n* Cataracts. Taking beta-carotene by mouth, alone or together with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc, doesn't seem to reduce the risk or progression of cataracts.\n* Cystic fibrosis. Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis.\n* Diabetes. Taking beta-carotene by mouth doesn't reduce the risk of developing diabetes or diabetes-related complications.\n* Non-cancerous moles (dysplastic nevi). Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not reduce the development of new moles.\n* Cancer of the esophagus.

Taking beta-carotene by mouth, alone or with vitamin E, does not prevent liver cancer in male smokers.\n* Liver disease. Taking beta-carotene by mouth, alone or with vitamin E, does not prevent death due to liver disease in male smokers.\n* Death from any cause. Taking beta-carotene by mouth doesn't seem to reduce the risk of death from any cause.\n* Stroke. Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not reduce the risk of stroke in male smokers. It might actually increase the risk in people who drink alcohol.\n\n**Likely ineffective for...**\n\n* Cancer. Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not reduce the risk for most types of cancer.\n* Heart disease. Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not reduce the risk for heart disease. It might actually increase the risk for heart disease-related death in some people.\n* Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Taking beta-carotene by mouth does not decrease the risk of these growths. In people who smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, taking beta-carotene supplements might actually increase the risk for these growths.\n* Lung cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements by mouth seems to increase the risk of lung cancer in some people. Beta-carotene from food does not seem to have this effect.\n* Prostate cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements by mouth does not prevent prostate cancer in most people. In fact, taking beta-carotene supplements might actually increase the risk of prostate cancer in some people.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken in appropriate amounts for certain medical conditions. But beta-carotene supplements are not recommended for general use.\n\nBeta-carotene supplements are possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in high doses, especially when taken long-term. High doses of beta-carotene can turn skin yellow or orange. Taking high doses of beta-carotene supplements might also increase the chance of death from all causes, increase the risk of certain cancers, and possibly cause other serious side effects. Beta-carotene from food does not seem to have these effects.\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if high doses of beta-carotene are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts.\n* History of asbestos exposure: In people who have been exposed to asbestos, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you have been exposed to asbestos.\n* Smoking: In people who smoke, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of colon, lung, and prostate cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you smoke.\n\n---\n\n**Beta-Carotene: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Asbestos Exposure:**\nIn people who have been exposed to asbestos, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you have been exposed to asbestos.\n\n**Smoking:**\nIn people who smoke, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of colon, lung, and prostate cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you smoke.\n\n*\\*Interactions with Medications\\*\\*\n\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nNiacin\nNiacin can increase good cholesterol levels. Taking beta-carotene along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium can decrease the effects of niacin on good cholesterol levels. It is not known if beta-carotene alone decreases the effects of niacin on good cholesterol levels.\n\n*\\*Interactions with Herbs and Supplements\\*\\*\n\nLutein\nTaking beta-carotene supplements might lower levels of lutein in the body.\n\n*\\*Interactions with Foods\\*\\*\n\nDrinking excessive amounts of alcohol and eating products that contain olestra, a fat substitute, can reduce beta-carotene levels in the body.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nBeta-carotene is found in many fruits and vegetables. Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables daily provides 6-8 mg of beta-carotene. Many global health authorities recommend getting beta-carotene and other antioxidants from food instead of supplements. Regularly taking beta-carotene supplements for general use isn't recommended. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nA-Beta-Carotene, A-Bêta-Carotène, Beta Carotene, Bêta-Carotène, Bêta-Carotène Tout Trans, Beta-Caroteno, Carotenes, Carotènes, Carotenoids, Caroténoïdes, Caroténoïdes Mélangés, Mixed Carotenoids, Provitamin A, Provitamine A.\n\n*\\*Methodology\\*\\*\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n*\\*References\\*\\*\n\nTanner M.

This disorder also impairs the body's ability to process ketones, which are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of beta-ketothiolase deficiency typically appear between the ages of 6 months and 24 months. Affected children experience episodes of vomiting, dehydration, difficulty breathing, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and, occasionally, seizures. These episodes, which are called ketoacidotic attacks, sometimes lead to coma. Ketoacidotic attacks are frequently triggered by infections or periods without food (fasting), and increased intake of protein-rich foods can also play a role.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBeta-ketothiolase deficiency appears to be very rare. Fewer than 250 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ACAT1 gene cause beta-ketothiolase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energy-producing centers within cells (mitochondria). This enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, the ACAT1 enzyme helps process isoleucine, which is a building block of many proteins, and ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats.\n\nMutations in the ACAT1 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the ACAT1 enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme prevents the body from processing proteins and fats properly. As a result, related compounds can build up to toxic levels in the blood. These substances may cause the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis) and can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly in the nervous system.\n\n---\n\n**Beta-ketothiolase deficiency**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Beta-ketothiolase deficiency\n\n*   **ACAT1**: Mutations in the ACAT1 gene cause beta-ketothiolase deficiency.

    "content": "**Betaine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBetaine is used to treat homocystinuria (an inherited condition in which the body cannot break down a certain protein, causing build-up of homocysteine in the blood). Increased amounts of homocysteine in the body can cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, seizures, dislocation of the lens of the eye, abnormal bone structure, osteoporosis (weak bones), blood clots, or decreased weight or rate of weight gain and slowed development in children. Betaine is in a class of medications called nutrients. It works by decreasing the amount of homocysteine in the blood.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBetaine comes as a powder to be mixed with food or drink and taken by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take betaine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betaine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of betaine and gradually increase your dose based on your body's response to the medication.\n\nYour doctor may tell you to take other medications such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cobalamin), and folic acid together with betaine.\n\nBetaine controls homocystinuria but does not cure it. Continue to take betaine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betaine without talking to your doctor.\n\nTo use betaine powder, follow these steps:\n\n*   Shake the bottle gently before removing the cap.\n*   Using the measuring scoop provided, measure the number of scoops your doctor has prescribed. One level scoop of powder is equal to 1 gram of betaine.\n*   Mix the measured amount of powder with 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 milliliters) of water, juice, milk, or formula until the powder is completely dissolved. Betaine powder may also be mixed with food.\n*   Drink or eat the mixture immediately.\n*   Replace the cap tightly on the bottle after using.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking betaine,\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to betaine or any other medications.\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\ntell your doctor if you have or have ever had any medical condition.\n\ntell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking betaine, call your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Betaine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n*   **Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**What should I know before taking this medication?**\n\nBe sure to follow all dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBetaine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if this symptom is severe or does not go away:\n\n*   nausea\n*   Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n    *   confusion\n    *   drowsiness\n    *   behavior changes\n    *   headache\n    *   vomiting\n    *   seizures\n    *   loss of consciousness\n\nBetaine may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Betibeglogene Autotemcel Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Betibeglogene Autotemcel Injection?**\n\nBetibeglogene autotemcel injection is a medication used to treat anemia in people with beta thalassemia who require regular blood transfusions. It is a type of autologous gene therapy, meaning it is prepared using cells from the patient's own blood stem cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should I Use Betibeglogene Autotemcel Injection?**\n\nBetibeglogene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. It is given as a one-time dose administered over up to 2 hours.\n\nBefore receiving your betibeglogene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for the treatment. A sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated.\n\nThe sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of betibeglogene autotemcel injection. It will take about 70–90 days from the time that your blood stem cells are collected before they are ready to be given to you. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you.\n\nYou will have to stay in the hospital for about 3–6 weeks after receiving your betibeglogene autotemcel dose to monitor you for any side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for mobilization and apheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBetibeglogene autotemcel injection may cause infusion reactions, which may occur within 24 hours of receiving your dose. Tell your doctor or nurse if you experience any of the following symptoms: fast or irregular heartbeat or stomach pain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\nAs with any medication, there are potential side effects to be aware of.

It is usually taken with food once a day for 35 to 42 days. Take betrixaban at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betrixaban exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nContinue to take betrixaban even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betrixaban without talking to your doctor.

Bexagliflozin is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by lowering blood sugar by causing the kidneys to get rid of more glucose in the urine. Bexagliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).\n\n**Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking bexagliflozin, making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBexagliflozin comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Bexarotene: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBexarotene is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, a type of lymphoma [cancer] that attacks the skin) in people whose disease could not be treated successfully with at least one other medication. Bexarotene is in a class of medications called retinoids. It works by stopping the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBexarotene comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with food. Take bexarotene at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bexarotene exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not chew the capsules or dissolve them in liquid or in your mouth. If you are unable to swallow the capsules whole, talk to your doctor.\n\nBexarotene may be harmful if it gets on the skin. Do not touch the capsules or powder from the capsules if they are broken or leaking. If the powder from a broken capsule gets on your skin, wash the area with soap and water immediately and call your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will start you on an average dose of bexarotene and may decrease your dose if you experience side effects or increase your dose if your condition does not improve.\n\nIt may take several months or longer before you notice the full benefit of bexarotene. Do not stop taking bexarotene without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBexarotene must not be taken by patients who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. There is a high risk that bexarotene will cause the baby to be born with birth defects (problems that are present at birth).\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking bexarotene.\n\nFor female patients:\n\nIf you can become pregnant, you will need to avoid becoming pregnant during your treatment with bexarotene. You must use two acceptable forms of birth control for 1 month before you begin to take bexarotene, at all times during your treatment, and for 1 month after your treatment. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable. Bexarotene may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections), so it is especially important to use a second form of birth control along with this type of contraceptive.\n\nYou will begin to take bexarotene on the second or third day of your menstrual period. You must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of the start of your treatment and every month during your treatment. After each negative pregnancy test, you will be given only 1 month's supply of bexarotene.\n\nStop taking bexarotene and call your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant, you miss a menstrual period, or you have sex without using two forms of birth control.\n\nFor male patients:\n\nYou must use a condom every time you have sexual contact with a female who is pregnant or able to become pregnant while you are taking bexarotene and for 1 month after your treatment. Call your doctor if your partner becomes pregnant during this time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take a dose of bexarotene, take it as soon as you remember. If it is close to the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at once.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBexarotene may cause the following side effects:\n\n*   Dry skin\n*   Itching\n*   Rash\n*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Dizziness\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\nLess common side effects include:\n\n*   Increased risk of bleeding or bruising\n*   Decreased appetite\n*   Weight loss\n*   Hair loss\n*   Muscle weakness\n\nIf you experience any side effects, talk to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore bexarotene capsules at room temperature in a tightly closed container. Keep the capsules away from children and pets.\n\nDo not dispose of bexarotene capsules by flushing them down the toilet or draining them into a sewer. Instead, throw them away safely when they are no longer needed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much bexarotene, call your doctor right away. If you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention immediately:\n\n*   Severe dizziness or fainting\n*   Seizures\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Confusion\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBexarotene is a prescription medication that comes in capsule form. It is usually taken once a day with food.\n\nDo not touch the capsules or powder from the capsules if they are broken or leaking, as bexarotene may be harmful if it gets on the skin.\n\nYour doctor will start you on an average dose of bexarotene and may decrease your dose if you experience side effects or increase your dose if your condition does not improve.\n\n---\n\n**Bexarotene: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n **How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBexarotene comes as a capsule to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Bezoar**\n\nA bezoar is a ball of swallowed foreign material most often composed of hair or fiber. It collects in the stomach and fails to pass through the intestines.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChewing on or eating hair or fuzzy materials (or indigestible materials such as plastic bags) can lead to the formation of a bezoar. The rate is very low. The risk is greater among people with intellectual disability or emotionally disturbed children. Generally, bezoars are mostly seen in females aged 10 to 19 years.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Indigestion\n* Stomach upset or distress\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Pain\n* Gastric ulcers\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe child may have a lump in the abdomen that can be felt by the health care provider. A barium swallow x-ray will show the mass in the stomach. Sometimes, a scope is used (endoscopy) to directly view the bezoar in the stomach.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe bezoar may need to be surgically removed, especially if it is large. In some cases, small bezoars may be removed through a scope placed through the mouth into the stomach. This is similar to an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) procedure.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFull recovery is expected.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPersistent vomiting can lead to dehydration.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you suspect your child has a bezoar.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf your child has had a hair bezoar in the past, trim the child's hair short so they cannot put the ends in the mouth. Keep indigestible materials away from a child who has a tendency to put items in the mouth. Be sure to remove the child's access to fuzzy or fiber-filled materials.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nTrichobezoar; Hairball\n\n---\n\n**Bezoar**\n\nA bezoar is a mass of material that accumulates in the stomach and can cause blockages. It is usually composed of hair, fibers, or other indigestible substances.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a bezoar may include:\n\n*   Persistent vomiting\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Weight loss\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA bezoar can be diagnosed through various methods, including:\n\n*   Endoscopy: A scope is inserted through the mouth into the stomach to directly view the bezoar.\n*   Barium swallow x-ray: A barium solution is swallowed, and an x-ray is taken to show the mass in the stomach.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for a bezoar depends on its size and location. In some cases, small bezoars may be removed through a scope placed through the mouth into the stomach. Larger bezoars may need to be surgically removed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFull recovery is expected after treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPersistent vomiting can lead to dehydration.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you suspect your child has a bezoar.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf your child has had a hair bezoar in the past, trim the child's hair short so they cannot put the ends in the mouth.

    "content": "**Bictegravir, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in certain adults and children weighing at least 55 pounds (25 kg) who have not received antiretroviral treatment in the past or who have been stable on other antiretroviral treatment(s). Bictegravir is in a class of medications called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Emtricitabine and tenofovir AF are in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the body. Although bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily with or without food. Take bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf unable to swallow the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF tablet whole, you can cut the tablet in half and swallow each half separately as long as they are both swallowed within 10 minutes of each other.\n\nContinue to take bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF even for a short time, or skip doses, the virus may become resistant to medications and may be harder to treat.\n\n**Important Warning:**\n\nBictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (AF) should not be used to treat hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. If you have HBV and you take bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests before, during, and regularly for several months after you stop taking bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir to see if your HBV has worsened.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.\n\n---\n\n**Bictegravir, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir AF comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

The aortic valve regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta, which is the major blood vessel that brings oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBAV is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart is developing. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common congenital heart defect. BAV often runs in families.\n\nA BAV may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This leakage is called aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up. This is called aortic stenosis, which causes the heart to pump harder than usual to get blood through the valve. The aorta may become enlarged with this condition.\n\nBAV is more common among males than females.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Baby or child tires easily\n* Chest pain\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Rapid and irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\n* Loss of consciousness (fainting)\n* Pale skin (pallor)\n\nIf a baby has other congenital heart problems, they may cause symptoms that will lead to the discovery of a BAV.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring an exam, your health care provider may find signs of a BAV including:\n\n* Enlarged heart\n* Heart murmur\n* Weak pulse in the wrists and ankles\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* MRI, which provides a detailed image of the heart\n* Echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound that views the heart structures and blood flow inside the heart\n\nIf your provider suspects complications or additional heart defects, other tests may include:\n\n* Chest x-ray, which produces an image of the heart and large arteries\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart\n* Cardiac catheterization, a procedure in which a thin tube (catheter) is placed into the heart to see blood flow and take accurate measurements of blood pressure and oxygen levels\n* MRA, an MRI that uses a dye to view the blood vessels of the heart\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour infant or child may need surgery to repair or replace a leaky or narrowed valve, if complications are severe.\n\nA narrowed valve can also be opened through cardiac catheterization. A fine tube (catheter) is directed to the heart and into the narrow opening of the aortic valve.

    "content": "**Bicycle Safety**\n\nMany cities and states have bike lanes and laws that protect bicycle riders. But riders are still at risk of being hit by cars. Therefore, you need to ride carefully, obey the laws, and watch for other vehicles. Always be prepared to stop or take evasive action.\n\n**While Riding Your Bicycle:**\n\n*   Watch for opening car doors, potholes, children, and animals that may run in front of you.\n*   Do not wear headphones or talk on your cellphone.\n*   Be predictable and ride defensively. Ride where drivers can see you. Bicycles are frequently hit because drivers did not know the bikes were there.\n*   Wear brightly colored clothing so that drivers can easily see you.\n\n**Obey the Rules of the Road:**\n\n*   Ride in the same direction as the flow of traffic.\n*   At intersections, stop at stop signs and obey traffic lights as cars do.\n*   Check for traffic before turning.\n*   Use correct hand or arm signals.\n*   Stop first before riding out into a street.\n*   Know the law in your city about riding on the sidewalk. In most cities, bicyclists older than 10 must ride in the street. If you must be on the sidewalk, walk your bike.\n\n**Bike Helmets**\n\nThe brain is fragile and easily injured. Even a simple fall can cause brain damage that may leave you with lifelong problems.\n\nWhen riding a bike, everyone, including adults, should wear helmets. Wear your helmet correctly:\n\n*   Straps should be snug underneath your chin so the helmet will not twist around your head. A helmet that flies off will not protect you or your child.\n*   The helmet should cover your forehead and point straight ahead.\n*   Do not wear hats underneath your helmet.\n\nYour local sporting goods store, sports facility, or bike shop can help make sure your helmet fits properly. You can also contact the American League of Bicyclists.\n\nThrowing around bicycle helmets can damage them. If this happens, they will not protect you as well. Be aware that older helmets, passed down from others, may not still offer protection.\n\n**Make Sure You Can be Seen at Night**\n\nIf you ride at night, try to stay on roads that are familiar and brightly lit.\n\nThe following equipment, required in some states, will keep you safer:\n\n*   A front lamp that shines a white light and can be seen from a distance of 300 feet (ft) (91 meters [m])\n*   A red reflector that can be seen from the rear at a distance of 500 ft (152 m)\n*   Reflectors on each pedal, or on the shoes or ankles of the bicyclist, that can be seen from 200 ft (61 m)\n*   Reflective clothing, tape, or patches\n\n**Riding With Infants**\n\nHaving infants in bike seats makes the bike more difficult to manage and harder to stop. Accidents that occur at any speed can injure a young child.\n\nFollowing some simple rules can help keep you and your child safe:\n\n*   Ride on bike paths, sidewalks, and quiet streets without much traffic.\n*   Do not carry infants younger than 12 months on a bike.\n*   Older children should not carry infants on a bike.\n\n---\n\n**Bicycle Safety**\n\nAs a cyclist, it's essential to be aware of the risks involved in riding a bike. Even with proper precautions, accidents can still happen. In this article, we'll discuss various aspects of bicycle safety, from wearing helmets and following traffic rules to being visible at night.\n\n**Wear Your Helmet Correctly**\n\nThe brain is fragile and easily injured. Even a simple fall can cause brain damage that may leave you with lifelong problems. When riding a bike, everyone, including adults, should wear helmets. Wear your helmet correctly:\n\n*   Straps should be snug underneath your chin so the helmet will not twist around your head.\n*   The helmet should cover your forehead and point straight ahead.\n*   Do not wear hats underneath your helmet.\n\nYour local sporting goods store, sports facility, or bike shop can help make sure your helmet fits properly.

Here are some tips to help you keep your child safe while riding a bike:\n\n**Riding With Infants**\n\n*   Ride on bike paths, sidewalks, and quiet streets without much traffic.\n*   Do not carry infants younger than 12 months on a bike.\n*   Older children should not carry infants on a bike.\n\n**To Be Able to Ride in a Rear Mounted Bike Seat or Child Trailer**\n\n*   A child must be able to sit without support while wearing a lightweight helmet.\n*   Rear-mounted seats must be securely attached, have spoke guards, and have a high back. A shoulder harness and a lap belt are also needed.\n\n**Safety Tips for Children**\n\n*   Young children should use bikes with coaster brakes. These are the kind that brake when pedaled backward. With hand brakes, a child's hands should be large enough and strong enough to squeeze the levers.\n*   Make sure bikes are the right size, rather than a size \"your child can grow into.\" Your child should be able to straddle a bike with both feet on the ground. Children cannot handle oversize bikes and are at risk of falling and other accidents.\n*   Even when riding on sidewalks, children need to learn to watch for cars pulling out from driveways and alleys. Also, teach children to watch for wet leaves, gravel, and curves.\n*   Make sure your child is careful about keeping loose pants legs, straps, or shoelaces from getting caught in the spokes of the wheel or bicycle chain. Teach your child never to ride barefoot, or while wearing sandals or flip-flops.\n\nBy following these simple rules, you can help keep yourself and your child safe while riding a bike.",

    "content": "**Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) is a type of probiotic (\"good\" bacteria) that lives in the intestines. It produces lactic and acetic acid.\n\n\"Good\" bacteria such as B. lactis can help break down food, absorb nutrients, and fight off \"bad\" organisms that might cause diseases. B. lactis is a subspecies of B. animalis. It's found in the human gut and used in probiotic supplements.\n\nPeople use B. lactis for excessive crying in infants (colic), constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and respiratory tract infections. It is also used for dental cavities, hay fever, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using B. lactis for COVID-19.\n\nBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis is sometimes listed as Bifidobacterium lactis (or B. lactis) on product labels. Don't confuse B. lactis with other probiotics, or with fermented food products such as fermented milk, kefir, or yogurt. These are not the same.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BIFIDOBACTERIUM ANIMALIS SUBSP. LACTIS are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Excessive crying in infants (colic). Giving infants B. lactis by mouth seems to help reduce crying from colic.\n\t+ Constipation. Taking B. lactis by mouth seems to help relieve constipation.\n\t+ A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Taking B. lactis by mouth seems to help relieve symptoms of IBS. But it's not clear if taking it together with other probiotics helps.\n\t+ Infection of the airways. Taking B. lactis by mouth might help prevent airway infections such as the common cold in otherwise healthy people. But it might not help people who have other serious health issues.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Cavities. Taking B. lactis by mouth doesn't seem to prevent cavities in young children.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: B. lactis is likely safe. It's been used safely alone and together with other probiotics for up to one month. Some people might experience gas and bloating from probiotics, but B. lactis seems to be well-tolerated.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if B. lactis is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: B. lactis likely safe for most children when taken by mouth for up to 8 months. It might cause diarrhea in some children. However, there isn't enough reliable information to know if B. lactis is safe for very small premature infants.\n* Weakened immune system: Some probiotics have caused blood infections in a small number of people with weakened immune systems. If you have a weakened immune system, talk with your healthcare provider before taking B. lactis.\n\n---\n\n**Bifidobacterium Animalis Subsp. Lactis**\n\n**Safety and Side Effects**\n\n* B. lactis is generally considered safe for healthy adults when taken by mouth in doses of up to 12.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 6 weeks.\n* In children, B. lactis has been taken by mouth alone or together with other probiotics without significant side effects, except for diarrhea in some children.\n* However, there isn't enough reliable information to know if B. lactis is safe for very small premature infants.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n* **Antibiotic Drugs**: Taking antibiotics along with B. lactis might reduce the effects of B. lactis. To avoid this interaction, take B. lactis products at least two hours before or after antibiotics.\n* There are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n* There are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n* In adults, B. lactis has most often been taken by mouth alone or together with other probiotics in doses of up to 12.5 billion CFUs daily for up to 6 weeks.\n* In children, B. lactis has most often been taken by mouth alone or together with other probiotics.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* B.

It is characterized by a sudden loss of consciousness, muscle stiffness, and convulsions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure is often unknown, but it can be triggered by various factors such as:\n\n*   **Head injury**: A severe head injury can increase the risk of developing epilepsy, including bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.\n*   **Infections**: Certain infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can cause seizures.\n*   **Medications**: Some medications, such as antidepressants or antihistamines, can lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures.\n*   **Genetics**: A family history of epilepsy or seizures can increase the risk of developing bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n*   **Sudden loss of consciousness**: The person may suddenly become unresponsive and fall to the ground.\n*   **Muscle stiffness**: The muscles in the body may become stiff and rigid.\n*   **Convulsions**: The person may experience convulsions or muscle spasms, which can cause them to thrash about or make loud noises.\n*   **Tongue biting**: In some cases, the person may bite their tongue during the seizure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for bilateral tonic-clonic seizures depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Antiepileptic medications can help control seizures and prevent future episodes.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Making lifestyle changes, such as getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, can also help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nAbou-Khalil BW, Gallagher MJ, Macdonald RL.

    "content": "**Bile Duct Diseases**\n\n**Basics**\n\nYour liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDifferent diseases can block the bile ducts and cause a problem with the flow of bile:\n\n* Gallstones, which can increase pressure in the gallbladder and cause a gallbladder attack.\n* Cancer\n* Infections\n* Birth defects, such as biliary atresia. It is the most common reason for liver transplants in children in the United States.\n* Inflammation, which can cause scarring. Over time, this can lead to liver failure.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Alkaline Phosphatase\n* Bilirubin Blood Test\n* Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n* Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Test\n* HIDA Scan\n* MRCP (MR Cholangiopancreatography)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n* Biliary obstruction\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Biliary Tract Disorders, Gallbladder Disorders, and Gallstone Pancreatitis\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Bile Reflux\n* Cholestasis\n* Primary Biliary Cholangitis\n* Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis\n* Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* Alagille Syndrome\n* Primary sclerosing cholangitis: MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis: MedlinePlus Genetics\n\n---\n\n**Bile Duct Diseases**\n\n**What are bile duct diseases?**\n\nBile duct diseases are conditions that affect the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine.

It occurs when the bile ducts are blocked or damaged, causing a buildup of bile in the liver.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an abnormal immune response. Some risk factors include:\n\n*   **Genetic predisposition**: Babies born to parents who have a family history of biliary atresia are more likely to develop the disease.\n*   **Infection**: Certain infections during pregnancy may increase the risk of biliary atresia in newborns.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of biliary atresia can vary depending on the severity of the disease. Common signs include:\n\n*   **Jaundice**: Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to a buildup of bile in the liver.\n*   **Fever**: High fever, often accompanied by other symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea.\n*   **Abdominal pain**: Pain or tenderness in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing biliary atresia can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other conditions. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam to check for signs of jaundice and abdominal tenderness.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Blood tests may be ordered to check for liver function and bile levels.\n*   **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound or other imaging tests may be used to visualize the bile ducts and liver.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to restore bile flow and prevent further damage to the liver. Treatment options include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: A surgical procedure called a Kasai procedure may be performed to create a new pathway for bile to flow out of the liver.\n*   **Medications**: Antibiotics and other medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for babies with biliary atresia depends on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. With prompt medical attention, many babies can recover fully, while others may experience ongoing liver damage and related health issues.",

Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the test. Your health care provider may instruct you to stop taking medicines that affect the test.\n\nMany drugs may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left in the blood after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.\n\nA level of bilirubin in the blood of 2.0 mg/dL can create jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.\n\nJaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level. The test will likely be ordered when:\n\n* The provider is concerned about a newborn's jaundice (most newborns have some jaundice)\n* Jaundice develops in older infants, children, and adults\n\nA bilirubin test is also ordered when the provider suspects a person has liver or gallbladder problems.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIt is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. A normal level is:\n\n* Direct (also called conjugated) bilirubin: less than 0.3 mg/dL (less than 5.1 µmol/L)\n* Total bilirubin: 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL (1.71 to 20.5 µmol/L)\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIn newborns, bilirubin level is higher for the first few days of life. Your child's provider must consider the following when deciding whether your baby's bilirubin level is too high:\n\n* How fast the level has been rising\n* Whether the baby was born early\n* The baby's age\n\nJaundice can also occur when more red blood cells than normal are broken down. This can be caused by:\n\n* A blood disorder called erythroblastosis fetalis\n* A red blood cell disorder called hemolytic anemia\n* Transfusion reaction in which red blood cells that were given in a transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system\n\nThe following liver problems may also cause jaundice or a high bilirubin level:\n\n* Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n* Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)\n* Other liver disease\n* Disorder in which bilirubin is not processed normally by the liver (for example, Gilbert disease)\n\nThe following problems with gallbladder or bile ducts may cause higher bilirubin levels:\n\n* Abnormal narrowing of the common bile duct (biliary stricture)\n* Cancer of the pancreas or gallbladder\n* Gallstones\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Bilirubin Blood Test**\n\nThe bilirubin blood test measures the level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver.\n\n**What is Bilirubin?**\n\nBilirubin can also be measured with a urine test.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed to measure the level of bilirubin in the blood.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nYou should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the test. Your health care provider may instruct you to stop taking medicines that affect the test.\n\nMany drugs may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left in the blood after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.\n\nA level of bilirubin in the blood of 2.0 mg/dL can create jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.\n\nJaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level.

    "content": "**Bilirubin Encephalopathy**\n\n**What is Bilirubin Encephalopathy?**\n\nBilirubin encephalopathy (BE) is a rare neurological condition that occurs in some newborns with severe jaundice.\n\n**Causes of Bilirubin Encephalopathy**\n\nBE is caused by very high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment created as the body gets rid of old red blood cells. High levels of bilirubin can cause the skin to look yellow (jaundice). If the level of bilirubin is very high or a baby is very ill, the substance will move out of the blood and collect in the brain tissue if it is not bound to albumin (protein) in the blood.\n\n**Symptoms of Bilirubin Encephalopathy**\n\nThe symptoms depend on the stage of BE. Not all babies with kernicterus on autopsy have had definite symptoms.\n\n* **Early Stage:**\n\t+ Extreme jaundice\n\t+ Absent startle reflex\n\t+ Poor feeding or sucking\n\t+ Extreme sleepiness (lethargy) and low muscle tone (hypotonia)\n* **Middle Stage:**\n\t+ High-pitched cry\n\t+ Irritability\n\t+ May have arched back with neck hyperextended backwards, high muscle tone (hypertonia)\n\t+ Poor feeding\n* **Late Stage:**\n\t+ Stupor or coma\n\t+ No feeding\n\t+ Shrill cry\n\t+ Muscle rigidity, markedly arched back with neck hyperextended backwards\n\t+ Seizures\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA blood test will show a high bilirubin level (greater than 20 to 25 mg/dL). However, there is not a direct link between bilirubin level and degree of injury.\n\n**Treatment of Bilirubin Encephalopathy**\n\nTreatment depends on how old the baby is (in hours) and whether the baby has any risk factors (such as prematurity). It may include:\n\n* Light therapy (phototherapy)\n* Exchange transfusions (removing the child's blood and replacing it with fresh donor blood or plasma)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBE is a serious condition. Many infants with late-stage nervous system complications die.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Permanent brain damage\n* Hearing loss\n* Death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGet medical help right away if your baby has signs of this condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTreating jaundice or conditions that may lead to it can help prevent this problem. Infants with the first signs of jaundice have bilirubin level measured within 24 hours. If the level is high, the infant should be screened for diseases that involve the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).\n\nAll newborns have a follow-up appointment within 2 to 3 days after leaving the hospital.

    "content": "**Bilirubin in Urine**\n\nA bilirubin in urine test measures the levels of bilirubin in your urine. Normally, bilirubin isn't found in urine. If there is bilirubin in your urine (called bilirubinuria), it may be an early sign of a liver condition.\n\n**What is Bilirubin?**\n\nBilirubin is a yellow substance your body makes during the normal process of breaking down red blood cells. Your liver uses bilirubin to make bile, a fluid that helps you digest food in your intestines. Some bile flows through bile ducts (small tubes) from your liver directly into your intestines. The rest is stored in your gallbladder for when you need it.\n\n**A Healthy Liver Removes Most of the Bilirubin**\n\nA healthy liver removes most of the bilirubin from your body. But if there is a problem with your liver or bile ducts, bilirubin can build up in your blood and get into your urine.\n\n**Other Names:**\n\n* Urine test\n* Urine analysis (UA)\n* Chemical urinalysis\n* Direct bilirubin\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA bilirubin in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, which may include a visual check of your urine (pee) sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells. A urinalysis is often used to check your general health, including the health of your urinary tract (which includes your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra). It can also help diagnose liver problems and many other medical conditions.\n\n**Why do I need a bilirubin in urine test?**\n\nYour health care provider may have ordered a bilirubin in urine test as part of your routine checkup. The test may also be ordered if you have symptoms of a liver condition, gallbladder disease, or a problem with your bile ducts. These symptoms may include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\n**What happens during a bilirubin in urine test?**\n\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a bilirubin in urine test. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a bilirubin in urine test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf bilirubin is found in your urine, it may be a sign that you have:\n\n* A liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis\n* A blockage in your bile ducts, the small tubes that carry bile out of your liver\n\nTo learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I should know about a bilirubin in urine test?**\n\nA bilirubin in urine test is only one measure of your liver health. If your test results aren't normal, your provider may order other tests, including a liver panel. A liver panel is a group of blood tests that measures many different enzymes, proteins, and other substances in the liver. It is often used to help find and diagnose liver disease.\n\nSome at-home urine tests that you buy without a prescription may measure bilirubin in urine. These tests usually involve dipping a test strip in a cup of urine or placing a few drops of urine on the strip. If you do an at-home bilirubin in urine test, talk with your provider about your results.\n\n---\n\n**Bilirubin in Urine Test**\n\n**What is a Bilirubin in Urine Test?**\n\nA bilirubin in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, which may include a visual check of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells.

It may even show up before you have symptoms. So, your provider may order a bilirubin in urine test if you have a high risk for liver damage or disease. Reasons for an increased risk may include:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n**What Happens During a Bilirubin in Urine Test?**\n\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n* Open the container without touching the inside.\n* Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n\t+ For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n\t+ For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n* Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n* Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n* Finish urinating into the toilet.\n* Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\n\nIf you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a bilirubin in urine test. If your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\nCertain medicines and supplements may affect your results, so let your provider know what you are taking. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a bilirubin in urine test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf bilirubin is found in your urine, it may be a sign that you have:\n\n* A liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis\n* A blockage in your bile ducts, the small tubes that carry bile out of your liver\n\nTo learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests**\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Should Know About a Bilirubin in Urine Test?**\n\nA bilirubin in urine test is only one measure of your liver health.

    "content": "**Bimatoprost Ophthalmic**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBimatoprost ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye). Bimatoprost is in a class of medications called prostaglandin analogs. It lowers pressure in the eye by increasing the flow of natural eye fluids out of the eye.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBimatoprost ophthalmic comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye. It is usually instilled in the affected eye(s) once a day in the evening. Try to use the medication at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bimatoprost exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nBimatoprost controls glaucoma and ocular hypertension but does not cure them. Continue to use bimatoprost eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using bimatoprost eye drops without talking to your doctor.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n2. Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n3. Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n4. While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n5. Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n7. While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n8. Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n9. Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n10. Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n11. If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n12. Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n13. Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nBimatoprost ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye). Bimatoprost is in a class of medications called prostaglandin analogs.

Wait for the next scheduled dose and continue as usual.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of bimatoprost ophthalmic include:\n\n*   Redness or swelling in the eye\n*   Itching or burning sensation in the eye\n*   Increased tearing\n*   Dryness in the eye\n\nLess common but more serious side effects may include:\n\n*   Eye pain\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Double vision\n\nIf you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor immediately.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore bimatoprost ophthalmic in an upright position at room temperature (68°F to 77°F). Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. Do not freeze or refrigerate the medication. Dispose of any unused medication responsibly.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBimatoprost ophthalmic is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. If you have any questions or concerns about using this medication, consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n---\n\n**Bimatoprost Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using bimatoprost eye drops, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bimatoprost or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. If you are using another topical eye medication, instill it at least 5 minutes before or after you instill bimatoprost eye drops.
