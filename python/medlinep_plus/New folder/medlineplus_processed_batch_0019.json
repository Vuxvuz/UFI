The condition is characterized by abnormalities in the shape and function of the lower jaw, as well as other features such as prominent cheeks, an unusually small mouth, and differences in the size and shape of facial structures between the right and left sides of the face.\n\n**Features of Auriculo-Condylar Syndrome**\n\n* Malformed outer ears, often with a distinctive \"question-mark\" shape\n* Cupped ears or ears with fewer folds and grooves than usual (described as \"simple\")\n* Narrow ear canals or small skin tags in front of or behind the ears\n* Ears that are rotated backward\n* Hearing loss\n* Abnormalities of the mandible, including an unusually small chin (micrognathia) and malfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\n* Prominent cheeks\n* An unusually small mouth (microstomia)\n* Differences in the size and shape of facial structures between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry)\n* Cleft palate\n\n**Causes of Auriculo-Condylar Syndrome**\n\nAuriculo-condylar syndrome can be caused by mutations in either the GNAI3 or PLCB4 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in chemical signaling within cells, which helps transmit information from outside the cell to inside the cell, instructing the cell to grow, divide, or take on specialized functions.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent, while other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAuriculo-condylar syndrome appears to be a rare disorder, with more than two dozen affected individuals described in the medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**Auriculo-condylar Syndrome**\n\n**What is Auriculo-Condylar Syndrome?**\n\nAuriculo-condylar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the ear and jaw.\n\n**Causes of Auriculo-Condylar Syndrome**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the GNAI3 or PLCB4 gene. Some people who have one altered copy of the GNAI3 or PLCB4 gene have no features related to auriculo-condylar syndrome, a situation known as reduced penetrance.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.

    "content": "**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in a person's brain. It affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.\n\n**Why is ASD Screening Important?**\n\nEarly treatment for ASD can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen children for ASD before age two.\n\n**What Happens During an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nFor children: Screening may have one or more parts, including questionnaires, observation, and interactive screening tests. These tests check your child's communication skills, social behavior, and other abilities.\n\nFor adults, screening tools for ASD are still being developed and tested. Your primary care provider may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for this screening.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of an ASD screening may be given as a score. The score may be described as low, medium, or high risk for ASD. If screening results do not find signs of ASD, but you have concerns, discuss them with your provider.\n\nIf the screening shows signs of ASD, it may mean that more testing is needed to confirm whether they are caused by ASD.\n\n**Who Can Diagnose ASD?**\n\nSeveral types of specialists may be trained to diagnose ASD, including developmental pediatricians, child neurologists, child psychologists or psychiatrists.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in a person's brain. ASD affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. It can be diagnosed at any age, but symptoms usually show up in the first two years of life and can be life-long.\n\n**Why is Early Screening Important?**\n\nEarly treatment for ASD can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen children for ASD before age two. Older children and adults may also be screened if they have symptoms of ASD but have never been diagnosed with the disorder.\n\n**How is Autism Spectrum Disorder Screened?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder screening is mainly used for young children. It helps find out whether a child has any early signs that could be ASD. But screening cannot diagnose ASD. If a screening shows that a child may have the disorder, more testing will be needed to find out for sure.\n\n**What are the Signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nSome common ASD symptoms in children and teens include:\n\n*   Problems with communication and social behavior\n*   Rarely sharing their interests with others\n*   Trouble having conversations\n*   Talking a lot about a favorite subject without noticing others aren't interested\n*   Having an unusual tone of voice that's robot-like or sing-song\n*   Having trouble making friends\n*   Not understanding humor or sarcasm\n*   Having unusual behaviors and/or narrow interests, called \"restrictive/repetitive behaviors.\"\n*   Repeating words or phrases (called echolalia), or hand flapping and/or body rocking\n*   Showing unusual attachment to toys, objects\n*   Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty changing from one activity to another\n*   Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input\n\n**Who May Need Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends ASD screening for all children at their 18-month and 24-month well-child checkups. More ASD screening may be needed if your child has a higher risk for ASD, such as:\n\n*   Having a sibling or other family member who has ASD\n*   Having older parents\n*   Having certain genetic disorders or chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome, Fragile X, Rett syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis\n*   Had problems during childbirth and/or were born with a low birth weight\n\n**What Happens After an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nIf your child's screening shows that they may have ASD, more testing will be needed to find out for sure. This may include detailed questionnaires and/or interviews with parents, teachers, or caregivers, watching the child's behavior, tests to evaluate the child's thinking, learning, and language abilities, and exams to check for other conditions that can cause behavior and/or communication problems.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nYes. If you're concerned about your child or teen, talk with your child's provider even if your child had a normal ASD screening in the past. Adults may need ASD screening if they have problems that could be signs of autism, but they were never diagnosed with ASD. Usually, their symptoms are mild, which is why they were not diagnosed earlier. Their challenges may include:\n\n*   Problems with communication and social behavior\n*   Rarely sharing their interests with others\n*   Trouble having conversations\n*   Talking a lot about a favorite subject without noticing others aren't interested\n*   Having an unusual tone of voice that's robot-like or sing-song\n*   Having trouble making friends\n*   Not understanding humor or sarcasm\n*   Having unusual behaviors and/or narrow interests, called \"restrictive/repetitive behaviors.\"\n*   Repeating words or phrases (called echolalia), or hand flapping and/or body rocking\n*   Showing unusual attachment to toys, objects\n*   Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty changing from one activity to another\n*   Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What are the signs of autism?**\n\nAdults who have problems that could be signs of autism but were never diagnosed with ASD usually have mild symptoms. Their challenges may include:\n\n*   **Problems communicating and interacting with others**, such as having trouble understanding other people's emotions\n*   **Restricted interests and/or repetitive behaviors**\n*   **Trouble understanding what behavior is expected** in school, work, or other areas of life\n\nAdults with ASD may also have difficulty keeping a schedule and setting long-term goals. They often have other conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n**Who needs to be screened?**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends ASD screening for all children at their 18-month and 24-month well-child checkups.\n\nMore ASD screening may be needed if your child has a higher risk for ASD. The risk for ASD is higher for children who:\n\n*   Have a family history of autism\n*   Have other developmental delays or disabilities\n\nYour child may need ASD screening at any age if you, a teacher, or other caregiver notices possible autism symptoms.\n\n**What happens during an autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nFor children: Screening for ASD is usually done by your child's pediatrician (a doctor who specializes in treating children) or nurse. Screening may also be done in school by trained professionals.\n\nThe screening may have one or more parts, including:\n\n*   **Questionnaires**: You'll usually complete one or more questionnaires. The questions ask about your child's development and behavior, including speech, movement, thinking, and emotions.\n*   **Observation**: The provider will watch how your child plays and interacts with you and/or others.\n*   **Interactive screening tests**: These tests are play activities, such as playing make-believe with dolls or other toys.\n\nFor adults, screening tools for ASD are still being developed and tested. Your primary care provider may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nThe specialist may:\n\n*   Talk with you about the challenges you face in your day-to-day life\n*   Ask you to complete a questionnaire about your symptoms\n*   Ask to talk with family members who remember what you were like as a young child\n*   Do screening tests for depression, ADHD, and/or anxiety, which are common in people who have ASD\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for an autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for this screening.\n\n**Are there any risks to screening?**\n\nThere is no risk to having autism spectrum disorder screening.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of an ASD screening may be given as a score. The score may be described as low, medium, or high risk for ASD.\n\nIf screening results do not find signs of ASD, but you have concerns, discuss them with your provider.\n\nIf the screening shows signs of ASD, it may mean that more testing is needed to confirm whether they are caused by ASD.\n\nChildren who show signs of ASD often need to see a specialist for more testing. Several types of specialists may be trained to diagnose ASD, including:\n\n*   **Developmental pediatricians**, doctors who have training in child development and treating children with special needs\n*   **Child neurologists**, doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions involving the brain, spine, and nerves\n*   **Child psychologists or psychiatrists**, providers who diagnose and treat children who have mental health, behavioral and/or developmental conditions. Psychologists usually have doctoral degrees (PhDs), and psychiatrists are medical doctors (MDs).\n\nThere is no one test that can diagnose ASD. So, a specialist will use a combination of methods, including:\n\n*   **Detailed questionnaires and/or interviews** with parents, teachers, or caregivers\n*   **Watching the child's behavior**\n*   **Tests to evaluate the child's thinking, learning, and language abilities**\n*   **Exams to check for other conditions that can cause behavior and/or communication problems**\n\nIf your child is diagnosed with ASD, get treatment as soon as possible. ASD treatment involves a variety of services and support depending on your child's needs.\n\nAdults who show signs of ASD may see a psychologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, or other specialist with experience diagnosing ASD in adults. But it can be difficult to find a specialist with this experience. That's because adult testing to diagnose ASD is fairly new. If you would like to find out if you have ASD, ask your primary care provider to help you find a specialist. You might also try contacting an organization in your community that supports people with ASD.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nYes, it's essential to remember that there is no one test that can diagnose ASD.

    "content": "**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in a person's brain. It affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.\n\n**Why is ASD Screening Important?**\n\nEarly treatment for ASD can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen children for ASD before age two.\n\n**What Happens During an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nFor children: Screening may have one or more parts, including questionnaires, observation, and interactive screening tests. These tests check your child's communication skills, social behavior, and other abilities.\n\nFor adults, screening tools for ASD are still being developed and tested. Your primary care provider may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for this screening.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of an ASD screening may be given as a score. The score may be described as low, medium, or high risk for ASD. If screening results do not find signs of ASD, but you have concerns, discuss them with your provider.\n\nIf the screening shows signs of ASD, it may mean that more testing is needed to confirm whether they are caused by ASD.\n\n**Who Can Diagnose ASD?**\n\nSeveral types of specialists may be trained to diagnose ASD, including developmental pediatricians, child neurologists, child psychologists or psychiatrists.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in a person's brain. ASD affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. It can be diagnosed at any age, but symptoms usually show up in the first two years of life and can be life-long.\n\n**Why is Early Screening Important?**\n\nEarly treatment for ASD can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen children for ASD before age two. Older children and adults may also be screened if they have symptoms of ASD but have never been diagnosed with the disorder.\n\n**How is Autism Spectrum Disorder Screened?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder screening is mainly used for young children. It helps find out whether a child has any early signs that could be ASD. But screening cannot diagnose ASD. If a screening shows that a child may have the disorder, more testing will be needed to find out for sure.\n\n**What are the Signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nSome common ASD symptoms in children and teens include:\n\n*   Problems with communication and social behavior\n*   Rarely sharing their interests with others\n*   Trouble having conversations\n*   Talking a lot about a favorite subject without noticing others aren't interested\n*   Having an unusual tone of voice that's robot-like or sing-song\n*   Having trouble making friends\n*   Not understanding humor or sarcasm\n*   Having unusual behaviors and/or narrow interests, called \"restrictive/repetitive behaviors.\"\n*   Repeating words or phrases (called echolalia), or hand flapping and/or body rocking\n*   Showing unusual attachment to toys, objects\n*   Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty changing from one activity to another\n*   Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input\n\n**Who May Need Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends ASD screening for all children at their 18-month and 24-month well-child checkups. More ASD screening may be needed if your child has a higher risk for ASD, such as:\n\n*   Having a sibling or other family member who has ASD\n*   Having older parents\n*   Having certain genetic disorders or chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome, Fragile X, Rett syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis\n*   Had problems during childbirth and/or were born with a low birth weight\n\n**What Happens After an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nIf your child's screening shows that they may have ASD, more testing will be needed to find out for sure. This may include detailed questionnaires and/or interviews with parents, teachers, or caregivers, watching the child's behavior, tests to evaluate the child's thinking, learning, and language abilities, and exams to check for other conditions that can cause behavior and/or communication problems.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening?**\n\nYes. If you're concerned about your child or teen, talk with your child's provider even if your child had a normal ASD screening in the past. Adults may need ASD screening if they have problems that could be signs of autism, but they were never diagnosed with ASD. Usually, their symptoms are mild, which is why they were not diagnosed earlier. Their challenges may include:\n\n*   Problems with communication and social behavior\n*   Rarely sharing their interests with others\n*   Trouble having conversations\n*   Talking a lot about a favorite subject without noticing others aren't interested\n*   Having an unusual tone of voice that's robot-like or sing-song\n*   Having trouble making friends\n*   Not understanding humor or sarcasm\n*   Having unusual behaviors and/or narrow interests, called \"restrictive/repetitive behaviors.\"\n*   Repeating words or phrases (called echolalia), or hand flapping and/or body rocking\n*   Showing unusual attachment to toys, objects\n*   Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty changing from one activity to another\n*   Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\n**What are the signs of autism?**\n\nAdults who have problems that could be signs of autism but were never diagnosed with ASD usually have mild symptoms. Their challenges may include:\n\n*   **Problems communicating and interacting with others**, such as having trouble understanding other people's emotions\n*   **Restricted interests and/or repetitive behaviors**\n*   **Trouble understanding what behavior is expected** in school, work, or other areas of life\n\nAdults with ASD may also have difficulty keeping a schedule and setting long-term goals. They often have other conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n**Who needs to be screened?**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends ASD screening for all children at their 18-month and 24-month well-child checkups.\n\nMore ASD screening may be needed if your child has a higher risk for ASD. The risk for ASD is higher for children who:\n\n*   Have a family history of autism\n*   Have other developmental delays or disabilities\n\nYour child may need ASD screening at any age if you, a teacher, or other caregiver notices possible autism symptoms.\n\n**What happens during an autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nFor children: Screening for ASD is usually done by your child's pediatrician (a doctor who specializes in treating children) or nurse. Screening may also be done in school by trained professionals.\n\nThe screening may have one or more parts, including:\n\n*   **Questionnaires**: You'll usually complete one or more questionnaires. The questions ask about your child's development and behavior, including speech, movement, thinking, and emotions.\n*   **Observation**: The provider will watch how your child plays and interacts with you and/or others.\n*   **Interactive screening tests**: These tests are play activities, such as playing make-believe with dolls or other toys.\n\nFor adults, screening tools for ASD are still being developed and tested. Your primary care provider may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nThe specialist may:\n\n*   Talk with you about the challenges you face in your day-to-day life\n*   Ask you to complete a questionnaire about your symptoms\n*   Ask to talk with family members who remember what you were like as a young child\n*   Do screening tests for depression, ADHD, and/or anxiety, which are common in people who have ASD\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for an autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for this screening.\n\n**Are there any risks to screening?**\n\nThere is no risk to having autism spectrum disorder screening.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of an ASD screening may be given as a score. The score may be described as low, medium, or high risk for ASD.\n\nIf screening results do not find signs of ASD, but you have concerns, discuss them with your provider.\n\nIf the screening shows signs of ASD, it may mean that more testing is needed to confirm whether they are caused by ASD.\n\nChildren who show signs of ASD often need to see a specialist for more testing. Several types of specialists may be trained to diagnose ASD, including:\n\n*   **Developmental pediatricians**, doctors who have training in child development and treating children with special needs\n*   **Child neurologists**, doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions involving the brain, spine, and nerves\n*   **Child psychologists or psychiatrists**, providers who diagnose and treat children who have mental health, behavioral and/or developmental conditions. Psychologists usually have doctoral degrees (PhDs), and psychiatrists are medical doctors (MDs).\n\nThere is no one test that can diagnose ASD. So, a specialist will use a combination of methods, including:\n\n*   **Detailed questionnaires and/or interviews** with parents, teachers, or caregivers\n*   **Watching the child's behavior**\n*   **Tests to evaluate the child's thinking, learning, and language abilities**\n*   **Exams to check for other conditions that can cause behavior and/or communication problems**\n\nIf your child is diagnosed with ASD, get treatment as soon as possible. ASD treatment involves a variety of services and support depending on your child's needs.\n\nAdults who show signs of ASD may see a psychologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, or other specialist with experience diagnosing ASD in adults. But it can be difficult to find a specialist with this experience. That's because adult testing to diagnose ASD is fairly new. If you would like to find out if you have ASD, ask your primary care provider to help you find a specialist. You might also try contacting an organization in your community that supports people with ASD.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about autism spectrum disorder screening?**\n\nYes, it's essential to remember that there is no one test that can diagnose ASD. A specialist will use a combination of methods to determine the presence of ASD. Additionally, finding a specialist with experience diagnosing ASD in adults can be challenging due to the relatively new nature of adult testing for ASD.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening**\n\nIn early childhood, pediatricians do routine developmental and behavioral screening tests designed to catch other types of developmental problems.

    "content": "**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that appears very early in childhood development, varies in severity, and is characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive actions. These difficulties can interfere with affected individuals' ability to function in social, academic, and employment settings. People with ASD also have an increased risk of psychiatric problems such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.\n\n**Early Signs**\n\nFrom as early as 1 to 2 years of age, people with ASD have an impaired ability to interact with other people; they are often more comfortable dealing with objects. Affected individuals have difficulty understanding and using non-verbal social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Inability to recognize and use these cues makes it hard for affected individuals to understand the feelings of others or communicate their own feelings appropriately. Signs of ASD, such as reduced eye contact and social interaction, can sometimes be detected before age 2. However, the condition is usually diagnosed between ages 2 and 4, when more advanced communication and social skills, such as learning to play with others, typically begin to develop.\n\n**Repetitive Actions**\n\nRepetitive actions in ASD can include simple actions such as rocking, hand-flapping, or repetition of words or noises (echolalia). Affected individuals often dwell on or repeatedly express particular thoughts; this trait is called perseveration. People with ASD tend to be rigid about their established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in schedule. They may also have difficulty tolerating sensory stimuli such as loud noises or bright lights.\n\n**Intellectual Abilities**\n\nWhile social and communication difficulties and unusual actions define ASD, affected individuals can have a wide range of intellectual abilities and language skills. A majority of people with ASD have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while others have average to above-average intelligence. Some have particular cognitive abilities that greatly surpass their overall level of functioning, often in areas such as music, mathematics, or memory.\n\n**Language Skills**\n\nSome people with ASD do not speak at all, while others use language fluently. However, fluent speakers with ASD often have problems associated with verbal communication. They might speak in a monotone voice, have unusual vocal mannerisms, or choose unusual topics of conversation.\n\n**Diagnoses**\n\nSeveral diagnoses that used to be classified as separate conditions are now grouped together under the diagnosis of ASD. For example, autistic disorder was a term that was used when affected individuals had limited or absent verbal communication, often in combination with intellectual disability. By contrast, Asperger syndrome was a diagnosis formerly applied to affected individuals of average or above-average intelligence who were not delayed in their language development. The broader diagnosis of ASD was established because many affected individuals fall outside of the strict definitions of the narrower diagnoses, and their intellectual and communication abilities may change over time. However, some individuals who were previously diagnosed with one of the subtypes now do not meet all the criteria of the new umbrella diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that appears very early in childhood development, varies in severity, and is characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive actions.\n\n**Social Difficulties**\n\nFrom as early as 1 to 2 years of age, people with ASD have an impaired ability to interact with other people; they are often more comfortable dealing with objects. Affected individuals have difficulty understanding and using non-verbal social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language.\n\n**Communication Problems**\n\nSome people with ASD do not speak at all, while others use language fluently. However, fluent speakers with ASD often have problems associated with verbal communication. They might speak in a monotone voice, have unusual vocal mannerisms, or choose unusual topics of conversation.\n\n**Repetitive Actions**\n\nRepetitive actions in ASD can include simple actions such as rocking, hand-flapping, or repetition of words or noises (echolalia). Affected individuals often dwell on or repeatedly express particular thoughts; this trait is called perseveration. People with ASD tend to be rigid about their established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in schedule.\n\n**Intellectual Abilities**\n\nWhile social and communication difficulties and unusual actions define ASD, affected individuals can have a wide range of intellectual abilities and language skills. A majority of people with ASD have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while others have average to above-average intelligence. Some have particular cognitive abilities that greatly surpass their overall level of functioning, often in areas such as music, mathematics, or memory.\n\n**Increased Risk of Psychiatric Problems**\n\nPeople with ASD also have an increased risk of psychiatric problems such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex condition that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior. It is characterized by difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors.\n\n**Symptoms of ASD**\n\nPeople with ASD may exhibit the following symptoms:\n\n*   **Communication difficulties**: People with ASD may have trouble understanding and using language, including verbal and nonverbal communication.\n*   **Social interaction difficulties**: Individuals with ASD may struggle with initiating or maintaining conversations, understanding social cues, and developing and maintaining relationships.\n*   **Repetitive behaviors**: People with ASD may exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand flapping or body rocking, or have a strong interest in specific topics or activities.\n\n**Types of ASD**\n\nASD is a spectrum disorder, meaning that individuals can exhibit a range of symptoms and severity. Some common types of ASD include:\n\n*   **Autistic Disorder**: A severe form of ASD characterized by significant communication and social interaction difficulties.\n*   **Asperger Syndrome**: A mild form of ASD characterized by difficulty with social interactions and repetitive behaviors, but without significant communication difficulties.\n\n**Causes of ASD**\n\nResearch suggests that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of ASD. Some possible causes include:\n\n*   **Genetic mutations**: Changes in over 1,000 genes have been associated with ASD, although many of these associations have not been confirmed.\n*   **Environmental risk factors**: Parental age, birth complications, and other factors may increase the risk of developing ASD.\n\n**Prevalence of ASD**\n\nASD is a common condition, affecting approximately 1 in 44 children in the United States. The disorder is more than four times as common in boys than it is in girls.\n\n**Treatment for ASD**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ASD, various treatments can help individuals manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. These may include:\n\n*   **Behavioral therapies**: Such as applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, which focuses on developing social and communication skills.\n*   **Medications**: To address associated conditions, such as anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n*   **Occupational therapy**: To help individuals develop daily living skills and adapt to their environment.\n\nEarly diagnosis and intervention are critical in helping individuals with ASD reach their full potential. If you suspect that your child may have ASD, consult with a qualified healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nChanges in over 1,000 genes have been reported to be associated with ASD, but a large number of these associations have not been confirmed. Many common gene variations are thought to affect the risk of developing ASD, but not all people with one or more of these gene variations will be affected. Individually, most of the gene variations have only a small effect. Genetic factors are estimated to contribute 40 to 80 percent of ASD risk.\n\n**Rare Gene Mutations**\n\nThe risk from gene variants combined with environmental risk factors, such as parental age, birth complications, and others that have not been identified, determine an individual's risk of developing this complex condition.\n\nBy contrast, in about 2 to 4 percent of people with ASD, rare gene mutations or chromosome abnormalities are thought to be the cause of the condition, often as a feature of syndromes that also involve additional signs and symptoms affecting various parts of the body. For example, mutations in the ADNP gene cause a disorder called ADNP syndrome. In addition to ASD and intellectual disability, this condition involves distinctive facial features and a wide variety of other signs and symptoms.\n\n**Genes Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n*   **ADNP**\n*   **ANK2**\n*   **ARID1B**\n*   **ASH1L**\n*   **CHD2**\n*   **CHD8**\n*   **CTNND2**\n*   **DYRK1A**\n*   **GRIN2B**\n*   **KCNQ3**\n*   **MECP2**\n*   **POGZ**\n*   **PTEN**\n*   **RELN**\n*   **SHANK3**\n*   **SYNGAP1**\n*   **UBE3A**\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\n*   **ASXL3**\n*   **CACNA1H**\n*   **CNTN4**\n*   **CNTNAP2**\n*   **DSCAM**\n*   **EIF4E**\n*   **GABRB3**\n*   **KATNAL2**\n*   **KCNQ5**\n*   **KDM5A**\n*   **KDM5B**\n*   **MYT1L**\n*   **NLGN1**\n*   **NLGN3**\n*   **NRXN1**\n*   **PTCHD1**\n*   **RPL10**\n*   **SCN2A**\n*   **SHANK2**\n*   **SYN1**\n*   **SYN2**\n*   **TBR1**\n*   **TMLHE**\n\n**Brain Development and Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nMany of the genes associated with ASD are involved in the development of the brain. The proteins produced from these genes affect multiple aspects of brain development, including production, growth, and organization of nerve cells (neurons). Some affect the number of neurons that are produced, while others are involved in the development or function of the connections between neurons (synapses) where cell-to-cell communication takes place, or of the cell projections (dendrites) that carry signals received at the synapses to  the neuron. Many other genes associated with ASD  affect development by controlling (regulating) the activity of other genes or proteins.\n\nThe specific ways that changes in these and other genes relate to the development of ASD are unknown. However, studies indicate that during brain development, some people with ASD have more neurons than normal and overgrowth in parts of the outer surface of the brain (the cortex). In addition, there are often patchy areas where the normal structure of  the cortex is disturbed. Normally the cortex has six layers, which are established during development before birth, and each layer has specialized neurons and different patterns of neural connection. The neuron and brain abnormalities occur in the frontal and temporal lobes of the cortex, which are involved in emotions, social behavior, and language.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in social behavior, communication, and cognitive functioning. Research suggests that ASD may be caused by genetic mutations that affect the development and function of neurons and brain connections.\n\n**Genetic Basis of Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nStudies have identified several genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, including ADNP, ANK2, ARID1B, ASH1L, CHD2, CHD8, CTNND2, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, KCNQ3, MECP2, POGZ, PTEN, RELN, SHANK3, SYNGAP1, and UBE3A. Additional genes associated with autism spectrum disorder include ASXL3, CACNA1H, CNTN4, CNTNAP2, DSCAM, EIF4E, GABRB3, KATNAL2, KCNQ5, KDM5A, KDM5B, MYT1L, NLGN1, NLGN3, NRXN1, PTCHD1, RPL10, SCN2A, SHANK2, SYN1, SYN2, TBR1, and TMLHE.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder has a tendency to run in families, but the inheritance pattern is usually unknown. People with gene changes associated with autism spectrum disorder generally inherit an increased risk of developing the condition, rather than the condition itself. When autism spectrum disorder is a feature of another genetic syndrome, it can be passed on according to the inheritance pattern of that syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is also known as autistic continuum and pervasive developmental disorder.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autism spectrum disorder\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   AUTISM\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The exact causes of ASD are still not fully understood, but research suggests that it involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nStudies have shown that individuals with autism tend to have more de novo protein-truncating variants in their genomes compared to the general population. This suggests that genetic mutations play a significant role in the development of ASD.\n\n**Environmental Risk Factors**\n\nResearch has also identified several environmental risk factors that may contribute to the development of ASD, including prenatal exposure to air pollution and maternal infection during pregnancy.\n\n**Neurobiological Aspects**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the neurobiological aspects of autism, including alterations in brain structure and function. For example, one study found that children with autism had fewer neurons in the prefrontal cortex compared to typically developing children.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ASD, various treatment options are available to help individuals with autism manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. These include behavioral therapies, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), and pharmacological interventions.\n\n**Historical Perspective**\n\nThe understanding of autism has evolved significantly over the years. In the past, autism was viewed as a rare disorder affecting only a few children. However, with advances in research and diagnosis, it is now recognized as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide.\n\n**References**\n\n* Liu X, Takumi T.

A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should include a thorough medical and developmental history, physical examination, and standardized behavioral assessments.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals worldwide. While the exact causes of ASD are still not fully understood, research has made significant progress in identifying genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as neurobiological aspects of the disorder. Effective diagnosis and management of ASD require a comprehensive approach that incorporates behavioral therapies, pharmacological interventions, and supportive care.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n**Genetics**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex condition that has been linked to genetic mutations and variations.

    "content": "**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that often appears in the first 2 to 3 years of life. It affects the brain's ability to develop normal social and communication skills.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of ASD isn't known, but it's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child.\n\nOther suspected causes include damage to a part of the brain called the amygdala and whether a virus may trigger symptoms. However, studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD, despite some parents hearing that vaccines may cause ASD.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old. Children with ASD often have problems with:\n\n*   Pretend play\n*   Social interactions\n*   Verbal and nonverbal communication\n\nSome children seem normal before age 1 or 2, then suddenly lose language or social skills they already had.\n\n**Symptoms Can Vary**\n\nSymptoms can vary from moderate to severe. A person with ASD may:\n\n*   Be very sensitive to sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste\n*   Be very upset when routines are changed\n*   Repeat body movements over and over\n*   Be unusually attached to things\n\nCommunication problems may include:\n\n*   Can't start or maintain a conversation\n*   Uses gestures instead of words\n*   Develops language slowly or not at all\n*   Doesn't adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at\n*   Doesn't refer to self the right way (for example, says \"you want water\" when the child means \"I want water\")\n*   Doesn't point to show other people objects (normally occurs in the first 14 months of life)\n*   Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials\n\nSocial interaction problems may include:\n\n*   Doesn't make friends\n*   Doesn't play interactive games\n*   Is withdrawn\n*   May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact\n*   May treat others as objects\n*   Prefers to be alone rather than with others\n*   Isn't able to show empathy\n\nResponse to sensory information problems may include:\n\n*   Doesn't startle at loud noises\n*   Has very high or very low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste\n*   May find normal noises painful and hold their hands over their ears\n*   May withdraw from physical contact because it's too stimulating or overwhelming\n*   Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects\n*   May have a very high or very low response to pain\n\nProblems with play may include:\n\n*   Doesn't imitate the actions of others\n*   Prefers solitary or ritualistic play\n*   Shows little pretend or imaginative play\n\nBehaviors may include:\n\n*   Acts out with intense tantrums\n*   Gets stuck on a single topic or task\n*   Has a short attention span\n*   Has very narrow interests\n*   Is overactive or very passive\n*   Is aggressive toward others or self\n*   Shows a strong need for things being the same\n*   Repeats body movements\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAll children should have routine exams done by their health care provider. More tests may be needed if the provider or parents are concerned. This is true if a child doesn't meet any one of these language milestones:\n\n*   Babbling by 12 months\n*   Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months\n*   Saying single words by 16 months\n*   Saying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing)\n*   Losing any language or social skills at any age\n\nThese children might need a hearing test, blood lead test, and screening test for ASD.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA provider experienced in diagnosing and treating ASD should see the child to make the actual diagnosis. Because there isn't a definitive test for ASD, diagnosis is often based on guidelines from a medical book titled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).\n\nAn evaluation for ASD often includes a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) exam. Tests may be done to see if there is a problem with genes or the body's metabolism.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAt this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities.\n\nTreatment plans may combine techniques, including:\n\n*   Applied behavior analysis (ABA)\n*   Medicines, if needed\n*   Occupational therapy\n*   Physical therapy\n*   Speech-language therapy\n\n**Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)**\n\nThis program is for younger children. It helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age.\n\nAn ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities.\n\n**TEACCH**\n\nAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These help children work on their own and organize and structure their environments.\n\nThough TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nThere is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with ASD may have. These include:\n\n*   Aggression\n*   Anxiety\n*   Attention problems\n*   Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop\n*   Hyperactivity\n*   Impulsiveness\n*   Irritability\n*   Mood swings\n*   Outbursts\n*   Sleep difficulty\n*   Tantrums\n\nThe drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants.\n\n**Diet**\n\nSome children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference. And not all studies have shown positive results.\n\nIf you're thinking about these or other diet changes, talk to both a provider and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients.\n\n**Other Approaches**\n\nBeware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMany organizations provide additional information and help on ASD.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nASD can be linked with other brain disorders, such as:\n\n*   Fragile X syndrome\n*   Intellectual disability\n*   Tuberous sclerosis\n\nSome people with autism develop seizures.\n\nThe stress of dealing with autism can lead to social and emotional problems for families and caregivers, and for the person with autism.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nParents usually suspect that there is a developmental problem long before a diagnosis is made. Call your provider if you think that your child is not developing normally.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAutism; Autistic disorder; Asperger syndrome; Childhood disintegrative disorder; Pervasive developmental disorder\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child.\n\nOther causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms.\n\nSome parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD.\n\nThe increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD. Autism spectrum disorder now includes syndromes that used to be regarded as separate disorders:\n\n* Autistic disorder\n* Asperger syndrome\n* Childhood disintegrative disorder\n* Pervasive developmental disorder\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nThe increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD.

It's best to have a team of specialists to evaluate the child. They might evaluate:\n\n* Communication\n* Language\n* Motor skills\n* Speech\n* Success at school\n* Thinking abilities\n\nSome parents don't want to have their child diagnosed because they're afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, their child may not get the needed treatment and services.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAll children should have routine exams done by their health care provider.

They might evaluate:\n\n* Communication\n* Language\n* Motor skills\n* Speech\n* Success at school\n* Thinking abilities\n\nSome parents don't want to have their child diagnosed because they're afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, their child may not get the needed treatment and services.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAt this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities.\n\nTreatment plans may combine techniques, including:\n\n* Applied behavior analysis (ABA)\n* Medicines, if needed\n* Occupational therapy\n* Physical therapy\n* Speech-language therapy\n\n**Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)**\n\nThis program is for younger children. It helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age.\n\nAn ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities.\n\n**TEACCH**\n\nAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These help children work on their own and organize and structure their environments.\n\nThough TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nThere is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with ASD may have. These include:\n\n* Aggression\n* Anxiety\n* Attention problems\n* Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop\n* Hyperactivity\n* Impulsiveness\n* Irritability\n* Mood swings\n* Outbursts\n* Sleep difficulty\n* Tantrums\n\nThe drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants.\n\n**Diet**\n\nSome children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference. And not all studies have shown positive results.\n\nIf you're thinking about these or other diet changes, talk to both a provider and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients.\n\n**Other Approaches**\n\nBeware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing.\n\n---\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n**What is Autism?**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that affects communication and behavior.\n\n**Causes of Autism**\n\nThe exact cause of autism is still unknown, but research suggests that it may be related to genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Symptoms of Autism**\n\nSymptoms of autism include:\n\n*   Delayed or absent language development\n*   Difficulty with social interactions and relationships\n*   Repetitive behaviors or interests\n*   Sensory processing difficulties\n\n**Diagnosing Autism**\n\nAutism can be diagnosed in children as young as 18 months, but it is often diagnosed later in childhood. Diagnosis typically involves a comprehensive evaluation of the child's behavior, development, and medical history.\n\n**Treatment for Autism**\n\nThere is no cure for autism, but early intervention and treatment can significantly improve outcomes. Treatment may include:\n\n*   Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy\n*   Occupational therapy\n*   Speech therapy\n*   Medications to manage related symptoms such as anxiety or hyperactivity\n\n**Living with Autism**\n\nWith the right support and accommodations, individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives. Many people with autism have successful careers, form meaningful relationships, and contribute positively to their communities.\n\n**Support for Families**\n\nFamilies of children with autism often face unique challenges and stressors. Seeking support from healthcare providers, therapists, and support groups can help families navigate these challenges and provide the best possible care for their child.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bridgemohan CF.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD affects 1 in 54 children in the United States.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile the exact causes of ASD are still not fully understood, research suggests that it is a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Some studies have identified potential risk factors, including advanced parental age, multiple births, and exposure to certain chemicals during pregnancy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of ASD can vary widely in severity and impact, but often include difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. A diagnosis of ASD is typically made through a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, and developmental pediatricians.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ASD, early intervention and treatment can significantly improve outcomes. Treatment may include behavioral therapies, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), medication to manage associated symptoms like anxiety or hyperactivity, and accommodations in educational settings.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis and Quality of Life**\n\nWith proper support and interventions, individuals with ASD can lead fulfilling lives. However, the prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of the disorder and access to quality care.

    "content": "**Autoimmune Addison Disease**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Addison Disease?**\n\nAutoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include:\n\n* Extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n* Nausea\n* Decreased appetite\n* Weight loss\n* Low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly\n* Muscle cramps\n* A craving for salty foods\n* Abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases\n* The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark\n* Women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair\n\nOther signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia)\n* High levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood\n* A shortage of red blood cells (anemia)\n* An increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia)\n\n**Complications**\n\nAutoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by:\n\n* Vomiting\n* Abdominal pain\n* Back or leg cramps\n* Severe hypotension leading to shock\n\nThe adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.\n\n**Co-Occurring Conditions**\n\nIndividuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members can have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly:\n\n* Autoimmune thyroid disease\n* Type 1 diabetes\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Addison Disease**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Addison Disease?**\n\nAutoimmune Addison disease is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks the adrenal glands, disrupting hormone production. This leads to symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, low blood pressure, and skin hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* Extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n* Nausea\n* Decreased appetite\n* Weight loss\n* Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n* Muscle cramps\n* Abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction\n* Loss of underarm and pubic hair in women due to hormonal imbalance\n* Low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood\n* Anemia and lymphocytosis, particularly eosinophilia\n\n**Life-Threatening Adrenal Crisis**\n\nAutoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. This is often triggered by stressors such as surgery, trauma, or infection.\n\n**Association with Other Autoimmune Disorders**\n\nIndividuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members can have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAddison disease affects approximately 11 to 14 in 100,000 people of European descent. The autoimmune form of the disorder is the most common form in developed countries, accounting for up to 90 percent of cases.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nThe genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nNormally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands, preventing hormone production.\n\n**Rare Causes**\n\nAddison disease can also be caused by infections such as tuberculosis or tumors in the adrenal glands. It can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Addison Disease**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Addison Disease?**\n\nAutoimmune Addison disease is a rare disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the adrenal glands, leading to a shortage of essential hormones. This condition can be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nThe genes associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.

A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Symptoms of Autoimmune Addison Disease**\n\nA shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to:\n\n*   Hypoglycemia\n*   Hyponatremia\n*   Hypotension\n*   Muscle cramps\n*   Skin hyperpigmentation\n\n**Other Causes of Addison Disease**\n\nRarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nA predisposition to develop autoimmune Addison disease is passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Autoimmune Addison's disease\n*   Autoimmune adrenalitis\n*   Classic Addison disease\n*   Primary Addison disease\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Addison Disease**\n\n**Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   **Addison Disease**: A rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, leading to fatigue, weight loss, and skin discoloration.\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n    *   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**: A non-profit organization providing support and resources for individuals with rare disorders.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Gombos Z, Hermann R, Kiviniemi M, Nejentsev S, Reimand K, Fadeyev V, Peterson P, Uibo R, Ilonen J.

If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.\n\n**What are Autoimmune Diseases?**\n\nThere are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas. And in rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes.\n\n**What Causes Autoimmune Diseases?**\n\nNo one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen.

There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.\n\nWhen you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens.

Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.\n\nWhen you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens.

    "content": "**Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome?**\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder where the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). This leads to the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes, causing enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\n* Lymphoproliferation\n* Enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen\n* Autoimmune disorders, such as:\n\t+ Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (attack on red blood cells)\n\t+ Autoimmune neutropenia (attack on white blood cells)\n\t+ Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (attack on platelets)\n\t+ Glomerulonephritis (kidney damage)\n\t+ Autoimmune hepatitis (liver damage)\n\t+ Uveitis (eye damage)\n\t+ Guillain-Barre syndrome (nerve damage)\n\t+ Skin problems, such as rashes or hives\n\n**Patterns of Signs and Symptoms**\n\nALPS can have varying patterns of signs and symptoms. Most commonly, lymphoproliferation becomes apparent during childhood. Enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen frequently occur in affected individuals. Autoimmune disorders typically develop several years later, most frequently as a combination of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, also called Evans syndrome.\n\n**Classic Form of ALPS**\n\nPeople with this classic form of ALPS generally have a near-normal lifespan, but have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells (lymphoma) compared with the general population.\n\n**Non-Classic Forms of ALPS**\n\nSome people have signs and symptoms that resemble those of ALPS, including lymphoproliferation, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and low blood counts, but the specific pattern of these signs and symptoms or the genetic cause may be different. Researchers disagree whether individuals with these non-classic forms should be considered to have ALPS or a separate condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)**\n\n**What is ALPS?**\n\nALPS is an inherited disorder characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). It is caused by mutations in the FAS gene, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in cell signaling that results in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of ALPS can vary, but most commonly include:\n\n* Lymphoproliferation: an abnormal increase in lymphocytes\n* Enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) and spleen (splenomegaly)\n* Autoimmune disorders: the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs\n\n**Autoimmune Disorders**\n\nCommon autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS include:\n\n* Hemolytic anemia: the immune system attacks red blood cells\n* Thrombocytopenia: the immune system attacks platelets\n* Uveitis: inflammation of the eyes\n* Glomerulonephritis: inflammation of the kidneys\n* Autoimmune hepatitis: inflammation of the liver\n\n**Frequency**\n\nALPS is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the FAS gene cause ALPS in approximately 75 percent of affected individuals. Non-classic forms of ALPS may be caused by mutations in additional genes, some of which have not been identified.\n\n**Genetic Cause**\n\nThe FAS gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in cell signaling that results in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). When the immune system is turned on to fight an infection, large numbers of lymphocytes are produced. Normally, these lymphocytes undergo apoptosis when they are no longer required. FAS gene mutations lead to an abnormal protein that interferes with apoptosis, resulting in excess lymphocytes accumulating in the body's tissues and organs.\n\n**Risk of Cancer**\n\nPeople with this classic form of ALPS generally have a near-normal lifespan, but have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells (lymphoma) compared with the general population.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome?**\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an abnormal protein that interferes with apoptosis, leading to excess lymphocytes accumulating in the body's tissues and organs. This can result in autoimmune disorders and an increased risk of developing lymphomas.\n\n**Causes of ALPS**\n\nNon-classic forms of ALPS may be caused by mutations in additional genes, some of which have not been identified. The condition is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In these cases, an affected person usually inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\n*   Autosomal Dominant: This is the most common inheritance pattern, where a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n*   Autosomal Recessive: In this rare pattern, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n*   Somatic Mutation: This type of mutation occurs during an individual's lifetime and is not inherited.\n\n**Other Names for ALPS**\n\nALPS Canale-Smith syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Information:\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME; ALPS\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome?**\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. It is characterized by an overproduction of lymphocytes, which can lead to autoimmune symptoms such as arthritis, skin rashes, and organ damage.\n\n**Causes of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\nALPS is caused by mutations in several genes, including FAS, TNFRSF6, and NRAS. These mutations disrupt the normal functioning of the immune system, leading to an overactive response to self-antigens.\n\n**Symptoms of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of ALPS can vary widely depending on the individual and the severity of the disease. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Recurring infections\n* Arthritis or joint pain\n* Skin rashes or lesions\n* Organ damage (e.g., liver, spleen, or pancreas)\n* Abnormal lymph node enlargement\n\n**Diagnosis of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\nDiagnosing ALPS can be challenging due to its rarity and variability in symptoms. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* Family history\n* Physical examination\n* Laboratory tests (e.g., complete blood count, liver function tests)\n* Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or CT scans)\n\n**Treatment of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**\n\nThere is no cure for ALPS, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Medications to suppress the immune system\n* Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation\n* Immunosuppressive therapy to control autoimmune responses\n\n**References**\n\n1.

When the FAS gene is mutated, it can lead to an overactive immune response, resulting in the symptoms associated with ALPS.\n\n**What Does It Mean If a Disorder Seems to Run in My Family?**\n\nALPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated FAS gene is enough to cause the condition. This means that if one parent has ALPS, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene.\n\n**What Are the Different Ways a Genetic Condition Can Be Inherited?**\n\nALPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated FAS gene is enough to cause the condition.

It is one of many autoimmune diseases, which are disorders that occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs by mistake.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nIn most cases, the signs and symptoms of APECED begin in childhood or adolescence. This condition commonly involves three characteristic features: chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal gland insufficiency. Affected individuals typically have at least two of these features, and many have all three.\n\n* **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC)**: a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities caused by a type of fungus called Candida. These infections are chronic, meaning they recur and can last a long time.\n* **Hypoparathyroidism**: a malfunction of the parathyroid glands, which secrete a hormone that regulates the body's use of calcium and phosphorus. Damage to the parathyroid glands leads to reduced parathyroid hormone production (hypoparathyroidism), causing symptoms such as tingling sensation in the lips, fingers, and toes; muscle pain and cramping; weakness; and fatigue.\n* **Adrenal Gland Insufficiency**: damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands) results in reduced hormone production by the adrenal glands, leading to signs and symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and changes in skin coloring.\n\n**Other Features**\n\nIn addition to these three characteristic features, people with APECED may experience other endocrine problems, including:\n\n* **Type 1 Diabetes**: impaired production of the hormone insulin.\n* **Short Stature**: a shortage of growth hormone leading to short stature.\n* **Infertility**: problems affecting the internal reproductive organs (ovaries or testes) that can cause inability to conceive children.\n* **Thyroid Dysfunction**: dysfunction of the thyroid gland, which can result in many symptoms including weight gain and fatigue.\n\n**Additional Signs and Symptoms**\n\nAutoimmune problems affecting non-endocrine tissues can lead to a variety of additional signs and symptoms in people with APECED, including:\n\n* **Rashes**: resembling hives (urticarial eruptions) that are common and often occur in infancy and early childhood.\n* **Enamel Hypoplasia**: thin enamel on the teeth.\n* **Chronic Diarrhea or Constipation**: associated with difficulty in absorbing nutrients from food.\n* **Stomach Irritation**: gastritis.\n* **Liver Inflammation**: hepatitis.\n* **Lung Irritation**: pneumonitis.\n* **Dry Mouth and Dry Eyes**: Sjogren-like syndrome.\n* **Inflammation of the Eyes**: keratitis.\n* **Kidney Problems**: nephritis.\n* **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**.\n* **Hair Loss**: alopecia.\n* **Loss of Skin Color in Blotches**: vitiligo.\n* **High Blood Pressure**: hypertension.\n* **Small or Absent Spleen**: asplenia.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAPECED is a rare condition, and its exact frequency is unknown. However, it is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 200,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAPECED is an inherited condition, meaning that it is caused by a genetic mutation that is passed down from parents to their children. The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAPECED is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAPECED is also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy or autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on APECED, please visit the following resources:\n\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n* American Autoimmune Association\n* Genetic Alliance\n\n**References**\n\nFor a list of references used in this article, please see below:\n\n* [List of references]\n\nNote: The references provided are for informational purposes only and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy**\n\n**What is APECED?**\n\nAPECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs.

Some of the additional signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Rashes that resemble hives (urticarial eruptions)\n* Thin enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia)\n* Chronic diarrhea or constipation associated with difficulty in absorbing nutrients from food\n* Stomach irritation (gastritis)\n* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)\n* Lung irritation (pneumonitis)\n* Dry mouth and dry eyes (Sjogren-like syndrome)\n* Inflammation of the eyes (keratitis)\n* Kidney problems (nephritis)\n* Vitamin B12 deficiency\n* Hair loss (alopecia)\n* Loss of skin color in blotches (vitiligo)\n* High blood pressure (hypertension)\n* A small (atrophic) or absent spleen (asplenia)\n\n**Description**\n\nAutoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. It is one of many autoimmune diseases, which are disorders that occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs by mistake.\n\nIn most cases, the signs and symptoms of APECED begin in childhood or adolescence. This condition commonly involves three characteristic features: chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal gland insufficiency. Affected individuals typically have at least two of these features, and many have all three.\n\nCMC is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities caused by a type of fungus called Candida. These infections, which are commonly known as yeast infections, are chronic, which means they recur and can last a long time. CMC is usually the first of the three characteristic features of APECED to become apparent in people with this disorder.\n\nOther features of APECED result from the body's immune system attacking the network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system). The second characteristic feature of the disorder is hypoparathyroidism, which is a malfunction of the parathyroid glands. These glands secrete a hormone that regulates the body's use of calcium and phosphorus.\n\nDamage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands) results in a third major feature of APECED, adrenal gland insufficiency (autoimmune Addison disease). Reduced hormone production by the adrenal glands leads to signs and symptoms that can include fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and changes in skin coloring.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for APECED, but various treatments can help manage its symptoms. These may include medications to suppress the immune system, hormone replacement therapy, and other supportive care measures. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications and improve quality of life for individuals with this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED)**\n\n_A rare inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs_\n\n**What is APECED?**\n\nAPECED, also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, is a rare inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. It is one of many autoimmune diseases, which are disorders that occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs by mistake.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of APECED typically begin in childhood or adolescence and commonly involve three characteristic features:\n\n* **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC)**: a tendency to develop infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes caused by a type of fungus called Candida.\n* **Hypoparathyroidism**: a malfunction of the parathyroid glands that regulates the body's use of calcium and phosphorus. This can cause tingling sensations, muscle pain and cramping, weakness, and fatigue.\n* **Adrenal Gland Insufficiency (Autoimmune Addison Disease)**: damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney, leading to reduced hormone production and signs such as fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and changes in skin coloring.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nAutoimmune problems affecting non-endocrine tissues can lead to a variety of additional signs and symptoms in people with APECED.

This condition occurs more frequently in certain populations, affecting about 1 in 9,000 to 25,000 people among Iranian Jews, Sardinians, and Finns.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AIRE gene cause APECED. The AIRE gene provides instructions for making a protein called the autoimmune regulator, which plays a critical role in regulating certain aspects of immune system function. Without enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and it may attack the body's own organs.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAPECED is an inherited condition, meaning that it is passed down from parents to children through genes. The AIRE gene is responsible for the development of APECED, and mutations in this gene can lead to the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy**\n\n**What is Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy?**\n\nAutoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. In this condition, the body's immune response is impaired, and it may attack its own organs.\n\n**How Does APECED Affect the Body?**\n\nThe immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired in APECED. This can lead to autoimmune damage to various organs, including the adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, and other tissues.\n\n**What Causes APECED?**\n\nMutations in the AIRE gene are responsible for APECED. The AIRE gene provides instructions for making a protein called the autoimmune regulator, which plays a critical role in regulating certain aspects of immune system function.\n\n**How Do AIRE Gene Mutations Affect the Body?**\n\nAIRE gene mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the autoimmune regulator protein. Without enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, leading to inflammation and potential damage to healthy cells and tissues.\n\n**What Role Does the IL-17 Pathway Play in APECED?**\n\nStudies suggest that AIRE gene mutations also result in immune substances (antibodies) mistakenly attacking proteins involved in the IL-17 pathway. This pathway creates inflammation, sends additional cytokines and white blood cells to fight foreign invaders, and promotes tissue repair.\n\n**How Does APECED Affect Populations?**\n\nResearchers believe that differences in the effects of specific AIRE gene mutations as well as variations in other genes may help explain why the signs and symptoms of APECED can vary among affected individuals and populations.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of APECED**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition, but they may carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\n**Rare Cases of APECED**\n\nIn rare cases, people with one copy of certain AIRE gene mutations in each cell may have some features of APECED, such as CMC, hypoparathyroidism, or vitamin B12 deficiency, but do not have the full pattern of signs and symptoms. These individuals usually have one similarly-affected parent.\n\n---\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AIRE deficiency\n* APECED\n* APS type 1\n* APS1\n* Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1\n* Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy\n* Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1\n* PGA I\n* Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, type 1\n* Polyglandular type I autoimmune syndrome\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, with reversible metaphyseal dysplasia\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, type 1\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINE SYNDROME, TYPE I, WITH OR WITHOUT REVERSIBLE METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA; APS1\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Constantine GM, Lionakis MS.

A breathing tube (ventilator) would then be needed.\n*   Blood transfusion if severe blood loss has occurred.\n*   Chest x-ray.\n*   ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).\n*   Fluids through a vein (IV).\n*   Endoscopy -- a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.\n*   Medicines (laxatives) to move the poison quickly through the body.\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage). This is rare.\n*   Medicines to treat symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, or those of an allergic reaction, such as swelling of the face or mouth or wheezing (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, or steroids).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost cases of swallowing dishwasher soap are not that harmful. How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage can continue to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the product is swallowed. Death may occur up to a month after the poisoning.\n\n---\n\n**Automatic Dishwasher Soap Poisoning**\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms May Occur Up To A Month After The Poisoning.**\n\nCrinion S. Toxicology.

    "content": "**Autonomic Testing**\n\n**What is Autonomic Testing?**\n\nAutonomic testing helps find out if your autonomic nervous system (ANS) is working as well as it should. Your ANS controls body functions that happen automatically (without you thinking about them). These functions include your breathing, heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. If there are problems with the function of your ANS, it's known as autonomic neuropathy.\n\n**What is Autonomic Neuropathy?**\n\nAutonomic neuropathy damages the nerves that control your internal organs. This can lead to problems with your:\n\n* Heart rate and blood pressure\n* Digestive system\n* Bladder\n* Sex organs\n* Sweat glands\n* Eyes\n* Blood glucose\n\nThe most common causes of autonomic neuropathy include diabetes, autoimmune diseases, some types of medicines, and certain infections, such as HIV.\n\n**What is Autonomic Testing Used For?**\n\nAutonomic testing is used to check for problems with your autonomic nervous system (ANS).\n\n**Why Do I Need Autonomic Testing?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, sometimes referred to as dysautonomia. Symptoms will vary depending on which part of your nervous system is affected.\n\n* Stomach and gastrointestinal symptoms can include:\n\t+ Constipation\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Nausea and vomiting\n* Bladder and urinary symptoms can include:\n\t+ Difficulty urinating\n\t+ Leaking urine\n\t+ Urinating more often than usual\n* Heart and lung symptoms can include:\n\t+ Rapid heart rate\n\t+ Shortness of breath with activity or exercise\n\t+ Dizziness\n\t+ Fainting\n\t+ Weakness\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\n* Too much or not enough sweating\n* Sexual problems; such as erectile dysfunction in men and vaginal dryness in women\n* The pupils of your eyes being slow to adjust to changes in light and darkness\n* Getting low blood glucose and not knowing it (since you may not have the symptoms)\n\n**What Happens During Autonomic Testing?**\n\nThere are different types of autonomic tests. Depending on your symptoms, your provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n\n* **Deep Breathing Test and Valsalva Maneuver**: These tests measure your heart rate and blood pressure while doing certain types of breathing.\n* **Tilt Table Test**: This test measures your blood pressure and heart rate as you change your posture and position to find why you have had lightheadedness or fainted.\n* **Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART)**: This test measures the function of the nerves that control sweating.\n* **Thermoregulatory Sweat Test (TST)**: This test measures how well your body sweats in a warm environment.\n* **Bladder Ultrasound**: This test is used to check for problems with your bladder, which is controlled by autonomic nerves.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour provider will give you specific instructions on how to prepare, but many autonomic tests require the following preparations:\n\n* Don't eat or drink anything with caffeine for eight hours before your test.\n* Keep well hydrated with noncaffeinated beverages the day before your test.\n* Don't drink alcohol for 12 hours before your test.\n* Don't smoke or use tobacco products for four hours before your test.\n\nCheck with your provider about how to prepare for your test. They will also let you know if you need to stop taking any medicines before your test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nSome people faint during a tilt table test. If that happens, you will immediately be tilted back to a normal position. During and after a tilt table test, you may experience nausea, vomiting, or weakness. Weakness may last a few hours, but other symptoms usually go away quickly.\n\nThere are no known risks to having an ultrasound.\n\nYou may have some skin irritation from the electrodes used in a sweat test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf any of your autonomic test results were not normal, it likely means that there is a problem with your ANS. To make a diagnosis, your provider will also consider your medical history, symptoms, and results from your physical exam. Sometimes they will order more tests, especially if the cause of your ANS problem is unknown.\n\nIf another disease is causing your ANS problems, treating that disease may help. Otherwise, treatment focuses on helping with your symptoms. This could include medicines and/or lifestyle changes.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Autonomic Testing**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Autonomic Testing?**\n\nAutonomic testing helps find out if your autonomic nervous system (ANS) is working as well as it should.

Depending on your symptoms, your provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n\n* **Deep Breathing Test and Valsalva Maneuver**: These tests measure your heart rate and blood pressure while doing certain types of breathing.\n\t+ For both tests, your provider will place electrodes on your chest and a small blood pressure cuff on your finger.\n\t+ For a deep breathing test, you will take slow, deep breaths for one minute.\n\t+ For the Valsalva maneuver, you will breathe out forcefully through a mouthpiece while your nose is pinched shut.\n* **Tilt Table Test**: This test measures your blood pressure and heart rate as you change your posture and position to find why you have had lightheadedness or fainted. During the first part of the test:\n\t+ You will lie flat on a motorized table that has a footrest.\n\t+ Soft safety straps will be placed across your body.\n\t+ Your provider will put electrodes on your chest and blood pressure cuffs on one of your arms and a finger. An intravenous (IV) line may also be placed in your arm or hand to inject medicine or fluids if needed.\n\t+ You will remain flat on the table for about 15 minutes.\n\t+ Your provider will tilt the table to 30 degrees for two to three minutes, then 45 degrees for two to three minutes, and then to an almost standing position for up to 45 minutes.\n* **Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART)**: This test measures the function of the nerves that control sweating. During the test:\n\t+ You will remove your shoes and socks.\n\t+ You will sit or lie flat on an exam table.\n\t+ Your provider will clean and dry your skin and then place electrodes on the part of the body where are doing the test. This is usually on your foot, wrist, and leg. The electrodes will contain a substance that stimulates sweating.\n* **Thermoregulatory Sweat Test (TST)**: This test measures how well your body sweats in a warm environment. During the test:\n\t+ A special powder will be applied to your skin.\n\t+ You will lie in a special room that is slowly heated up to stimulate sweating. The heat and humidity may be a little uncomfortable.\n* **Bladder Ultrasound**: This test is used to check for problems with your bladder, which is controlled by autonomic nerves. The ultrasound is done after you urinate to see how much urine is left in the bladder.\n\nNote: The tests mentioned above are not exhaustive and may vary depending on the specific needs of the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Autonomic Testing**\n\n**What is Autonomic Testing?**\n\nAutonomic testing is a series of tests used to check for problems with your autonomic nervous system (ANS).

This reaction may include:\n\n*   Change in heart rate\n*   Excessive sweating\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Muscle spasms\n*   Skin color changes (paleness, redness, blue-gray skin color)\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of AD is spinal cord injury, most often due to spine trauma. The nervous system of people with AD over-responds to the types of stimulation that do not bother healthy people.\n\nOther conditions may cause autonomic dysfunction (not dysreflexia) which has similar symptoms, including:\n\n*   Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the nervous system)\n*   Side effects of some medicines\n*   Severe head trauma and other brain injuries\n*   Subarachnoid hemorrhage (a form of brain bleeding)\n*   Use of illegal stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can include any of the following:\n\n*   Anxiety or worry\n*   Bladder or bowel problems\n*   Blurry vision, widened (dilated) pupils\n*   Lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting\n*   Fever\n*   Goosebumps, flushed (red) skin above the level of the spinal cord injury\n*   Heavy sweating\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Irregular heartbeat, slow or fast pulse\n*   Muscle spasms, especially in the jaw\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Throbbing headache\n\nSometimes there are no symptoms, even with a dangerous rise in blood pressure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do a complete nervous system and medical exam. Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking now and that you took in the past. This helps determine which tests you need.\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   CT or MRI scan\n*   ECG (measurement of the heart's electrical activity)\n*   Lumbar puncture\n*   Tilt-table testing (testing of blood pressure as the body position changes)\n*   Toxicology screening (tests for any medicines, including illegal drugs, in your bloodstream)\n*   X-rays\n\nOther conditions share many symptoms with AD, but have a different cause. The exam and testing help your provider rule out these other conditions, including:\n\n*   Carcinoid syndrome (tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs)\n*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a condition caused by some medicines that leads to muscle stiffness, high fever, and drowsiness)\n*   Pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal gland)\n*   Serotonin syndrome (reaction to a medicine that causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by nerve cells)\n*   Thyroid storm (life-threatening condition from an overactive thyroid)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAD is life threatening, so it is important to quickly find and treat the problem.\n\nA person with symptoms of AD should:\n\n*   Sit up and raise their head\n*   Remove tight clothing\n\nProper treatment depends on the cause. If medicines or illegal drugs are worsening the symptoms, they must be stopped. Any illness needs to be treated. For example, the provider will check for a blocked urinary catheter and signs of constipation which may cause AD in someone with a spinal cord injury. The person should be checked for injuries, sores, or other irritants that may be triggering the symptoms.\n\nIf a slowing of the heart rate is causing AD, medicines called anticholinergics (such as atropine) may be used.\n\nVery high blood pressure needs to be treated quickly but carefully, because the blood pressure can drop suddenly.\n\nA pacemaker may be needed for an unstable heart rhythm.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nOutlook depends on the cause.\n\nPeople with autonomic dysfunction due to a medicine usually recover when that medicine is stopped. When AD is aggravated by other factors, recovery depends on how well the disease can be treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may occur due to side effects of medicines used to treat the condition. A sudden severe increase in blood pressure can cause a stroke or bleeding into the brain. Long-term, severe high blood pressure may cause seizures, bleeding in the eyes, stroke, or death.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have symptoms of AD.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIn people with spinal cord injury, the following may help lessen AD symptoms:\n\n*   Avoid medicines that make AD symptoms worse\n*   Do not let the bladder become too full\n*   Pain should be controlled\n*   Practice proper bowel care to avoid stool impaction\n*   Practice proper skin care to avoid bedsores and skin infections\n*   Prevent bladder infections\n\n---\n\n**Autonomic Dysreflexia**\n\n**What is Autonomic Dysreflexia?**\n\nAutonomic dysreflexia (AD) is an abnormal, overreaction of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system to stimulation.

Most have excessive daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy). Narcolepsy is typically accompanied by cataplexy, which is a sudden brief loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (such as excitement, surprise, or anger). These episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump over or fall, which occasionally leads to injury. These characteristic signs and symptoms of ADCADN typically begin in a person's thirties.\n\nEventually, people with ADCADN also experience a decline of intellectual function (dementia). The cognitive problems often begin with impairment of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. Other features that can occur as the condition worsens include degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy); clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts); numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs; an inability to control the bowels or the flow of urine (incontinence); depression; uncontrollable crying or laughing (pseudobulbar signs); or a distorted view of reality (psychosis). Affected individuals usually survive into their forties or fifties.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia, Deafness, and Narcolepsy**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia, Deafness, and Narcolepsy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCADN) is a nervous system disorder with signs and symptoms that usually begin in mid-adulthood and gradually get worse.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with ADCADN have difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and mild to moderate hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural deafness).

Affected individuals usually survive into their forties or fifties.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of ADCADN is unknown. At least 24 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nADCADN is caused by mutations in the DNMT1 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase 1. This enzyme is involved in DNA methylation, which is the addition of methyl groups to DNA molecules. In particular, the enzyme helps add methyl groups to DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called cytosines.\n\nDNA methyltransferase 1 is active in the adult nervous system. Although its specific role in the nervous system is not well understood, the enzyme may help regulate nerve cell (neuron) maturation and specialization (differentiation), the ability of neurons to move (migrate) where needed and connect with each other, and neuron survival.\n\nDNMT1 gene mutations that cause ADCADN affect a region of the DNA methyltransferase 1 enzyme that helps target the methylation process to the correct segments of DNA. As a result of these mutations, methylation is abnormal, which affects the expression of multiple genes. Maintenance of the neurons that make up the nervous system is disrupted, leading to the signs and symptoms of ADCADN.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia, Deafness, and Narcolepsy**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\n* In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n* Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ADCA-DN syndrome\n* ADCADN\n* Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-deafness-narcolepsy syndrome\n* Cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy, autosomal dominant\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness and narcolepsy\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-deafness-narcolepsy syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, DEAFNESS, AND NARCOLEPSY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; ADCADN\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Baets J, Duan X, Wu Y, Smith G, Seeley WW, Mademan I, McGrath NM, Beadell NC, Khoury J, Botuyan MV, Mer G, Worrell GA, Hojo K, DeLeon J, Laura M, Liu YT, Senderek J, Weis J, Van den Bergh P, Merrill SL, Reilly MM, Houlden H, Grossman M, Scherer SS, De Jonghe P, Dyck PJ, Klein CJ.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Congenital Stationary Night Blindness**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they are not able to identify road signs at night and some people cannot see stars in the night sky. Affected individuals have normal daytime vision and typically do not have other vision problems related to this disorder.\n\nThe night blindness associated with this condition is congenital, which means it is present from birth. This vision impairment tends to remain stable (stationary); it does not worsen over time.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAutosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the RHO, GNAT1, or PDE6B gene cause autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness. The proteins produced from these genes are necessary for normal vision, particularly in low-light conditions. These proteins are found in specialized light receptor cells in the retina called rods. Rods transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain when light is dim.\n\nThe RHO gene provides instructions for making a protein called rhodopsin, which is turned on (activated) by light entering the eye. Rhodopsin then attaches (binds) to and activates the protein produced from the GNAT1 gene, alpha (Î±)-transducin. The Î±-transducin protein then triggers the activation of a protein called cGMP-PDE, which is made up of multiple parts (subunits) including a subunit produced from the PDE6B gene. Activated cGMP-PDE triggers a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals. These signals are transmitted from rod cells to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision.\n\nMutations in the RHO, GNAT1, or PDE6B gene disrupt the normal signaling that occurs within rod cells. As a result, the rods cannot effectively transmit signals to the brain, leading to a lack of visual perception in low light.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Congenital Stationary Night Blindness**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Congenital Stationary Night Blindness?**\n\nAutosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the vision of individuals. It is characterized by impaired vision in low-light conditions, particularly at night.\n\n**Causes of CSNB**\n\nMutations in three genes - RHO, GNAT1, and PDE6B - have been identified as the cause of autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness. These genes provide instructions for making proteins necessary for normal vision, particularly in low-light conditions.\n\n*   The RHO gene provides instructions for making a protein called rhodopsin, which is turned on (activated) by light entering the eye.\n*   The GNAT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-transducin, which is activated by rhodopsin and triggers a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals.\n*   The PDE6B gene provides instructions for making a subunit of a protein called cGMP-PDE, which is necessary for the transmission of visual signals from rod cells to the brain.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This means that if one parent has the condition, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAdCSNB\nCSNBAD\nNight blindness, congenital stationary, autosomal dominant\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital stationary night blindness\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2; CSNBAD2\n    *   NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 3; CSNBAD3\n    *   NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1; CSNBAD1\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on the genetics and treatment of autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness:\n\n*   Gal A, Orth U, Baehr W, Schwinger E, Rosenberg T.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features?**\n\nAutosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) is an uncommon form of epilepsy that runs in families. People with this condition typically hear sounds (auditory features), such as buzzing, humming, or ringing, during seizures.\n\n**Symptoms of ADEAF**\n\nSome people hear more complex sounds, like specific voices or music, or changes in the volume of sounds. Some people with ADEAF suddenly become unable to understand language before losing consciousness during a seizure. This inability to understand speech is known as receptive aphasia. Less commonly, seizures may cause visual hallucinations, a disturbance in the sense of smell, a feeling of dizziness or spinning (vertigo), or other symptoms that affect the senses.\n\n**How Does ADEAF Differ from Other Forms of Epilepsy?**\n\nADEAF is called a focal epilepsy because the seizures start in one part of the brain, rather than involving the entire brain from the beginning. Most people with ADEAF have focal aware seizures, which do not cause a loss of consciousness. These seizures are thought to begin in a part of the brain called the lateral temporal lobe.\n\n**When Do Seizures Typically Begin?**\n\nSeizures associated with ADEAF usually begin in adolescence or young adulthood. They may be triggered by specific sounds, such as a ringing telephone or speech, but in most cases the seizures do not have any recognized triggers. In most affected people, seizures are infrequent and effectively controlled with medication.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF)\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References are not provided in this cleaned output as they were not included in the original content.)\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features?**\n\nAutosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) is a rare form of epilepsy that runs in families.

Variants in other genes have been identified in small numbers of affected families, and the genetic cause in many families is unknown.\n\n**LGI1 Gene**\n\nThe LGI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Lgi1 or epitempin, which is found primarily in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Although the precise role of epitempin remains uncertain, researchers suggest it may play a role at the junction of neurons (synapses) where cell-to-cell communication takes place.\n\n**RELN Gene**\n\nThe RELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called reelin. Reelin is produced in the brain both during brain development and after birth. It appears to play several roles at synapses, including controlling communication between neurons.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of ADEAF**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to raise the risk of developing epilepsy. About two-thirds of people who inherit an LGI gene variant will develop seizures. Some people who have the altered gene never develop the condition, which is known as reduced penetrance. The likelihood of developing seizures in people with a variant in RELN or other associated genes is unknown. Most people with ADEAF have one affected parent and other relatives with the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features?**\n\nAutosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain's ability to control seizures. It is characterized by seizures that often involve abnormal sensations, such as hearing voices or music, and can also include other symptoms like memory problems.\n\n**How is ADEAF Inherited?**\n\nADEAF is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to raise the risk of developing epilepsy.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), formerly known as Job syndrome, is a condition that affects several body systems, particularly the immune system. Recurrent infections are common in people with this condition. Affected individuals tend to have frequent bouts of pneumonia, which are caused by certain kinds of bacteria that infect the lungs and cause inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). However, excessive inflammation can damage body tissues. Recurring pneumonia often results in the formation of air-filled cysts (pneumatoceles) in the lungs. Frequent skin infections and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema are also very common in AD-HIES. These skin problems cause rashes, blisters, accumulations of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling.\n\nFor unknown reasons, people with AD-HIES have abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. IgE normally triggers an immune response against foreign invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and is involved in allergies. However, IgE is not needed for these roles in people with AD-HIES, and it is unclear why affected individuals have such high levels of the protein without having allergies.\n\nAD-HIES also affects other parts of the body, including the bones and teeth. Many people with AD-HIES have skeletal abnormalities such as an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced bone density (osteopenia), and a tendency for bones to fracture easily. A common dental abnormality in this condition is that the primary (baby) teeth do not fall out at the usual time during childhood but are retained as the adult teeth grow in. Other signs and symptoms of AD-HIES can include abnormalities of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries), distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities of the brain, which do not affect a person's intelligence.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n*   Common in people with this condition\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Unknown reasons\n*   Abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n*   Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Job syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n**References**\n\n*   MedlinePlus Genetics\n*   PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome?**\n\nAutosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), formerly known as Job syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects several body systems, particularly the immune system. It is characterized by recurrent infections, particularly of the lungs and skin, and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema.\n\n**Causes of AD-HIES**\n\nMutations in the STAT3 gene cause most cases of AD-HIES. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays important roles in several body systems. To carry out its roles, the STAT3 protein attaches to DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. In the immune system, the STAT3 protein regulates genes that are involved in the maturation of immune system cells, especially certain types of T cells.\n\n**Symptoms of AD-HIES**\n\nPeople with AD-HIES have frequent bouts of pneumonia, which are caused by certain kinds of bacteria that infect the lungs and cause inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). However, excessive inflammation can damage body tissues. Recurring pneumonia often results in the formation of air-filled cysts (pneumatoceles) in the lungs.\n\nFrequent skin infections and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema are also very common in AD-HIES. These skin problems cause rashes, blisters, accumulations of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling.\n\n**Other Signs and Symptoms**\n\nAD-HIES also affects other parts of the body, including the bones and teeth. Many people with AD-HIES have skeletal abnormalities such as an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced bone density (osteopenia), and a tendency for bones to fracture easily.\n\nA common dental abnormality in this condition is that the primary (baby) teeth do not fall out at the usual time during childhood but are retained as the adult teeth grow in. Other signs and symptoms of AD-HIES can include abnormalities of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries), distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities of the brain, which do not affect a person's intelligence.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAD-HIES is rare, affecting fewer than 1 per million people worldwide.\n\n**Genetic Link**\n\nMutations in the STAT3 gene cause most cases of AD-HIES. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays important roles in several body systems. To carry out its roles, the STAT3 protein attaches to DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. In the immune system, the STAT3 protein regulates genes that are involved in the maturation of immune system cells, especially certain types of T cells.\n\nChanges in the STAT3 gene alter the structure and function of the STAT3 protein, impairing its ability to control the activity of other genes. A shortage of functional STAT3 blocks the maturation of T cells (specifically a subset known as Th17 cells) and other immune cells. The resulting immune system abnormalities make people with AD-HIES highly susceptible to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections of the lungs and skin.\n\n**Other Genes Involved**\n\nMutations in the ZNF341 gene cause a disorder similar to AD-HIES but with a different pattern of inheritance. When the STAT3 gene is involved, one altered copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder (which is known as autosomal dominant inheritance). In contrast, when the ZNF341 gene is involved, both copies of the gene are altered (which is known as autosomal recessive inheritance).\n\nThe ZNF341 gene provides instructions for making a protein that appears to control the activity of the STAT3 gene. ZNF341 gene mutations, which prevent production of functional ZNF341 protein, result in a shortage of STAT3 protein, leading to immune system problems similar to those caused by STAT3 gene mutations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAD-HIES is a rare genetic disorder that affects several body systems, particularly the immune system. It is characterized by recurrent infections, particularly of the lungs and skin, and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema. Mutations in the STAT3 gene cause most cases of AD-HIES, while mutations in the ZNF341 gene cause a similar disorder with a different pattern of inheritance.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome**\n\n**Causes of the Condition**\n\nMutations in the STAT3 gene cause most cases of AD-HIES.

In about half of cases caused by STAT3 gene mutations, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other half result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Similar Condition Caused by Mutations in the ZNF341 Gene**\n\nA similar condition caused by mutations in the ZNF341 gene has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   AD-HIES\n*   Autosomal dominant HIES\n*   Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome\n*   Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E recurrent infection syndrome\n*   Autosomal dominant Job syndrome\n*   Buckley syndrome\n*   Job syndrome\n*   Job's syndrome\n*   Job-Buckley syndrome\n*   STAT3 deficiency\n*   STAT3-deficient hyper IgE syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome?**\n\nAutosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent skin and lung infections, elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), and other systemic features.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of HIES is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to mutations in the STAT3 gene. These mutations can lead to impaired signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in an overactive immune response.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nPatients with HIES often present with recurrent skin infections, such as abscesses or cellulitis, particularly on the face, extremities, and buttocks. They may also experience respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and sinusitis. Other symptoms may include eczema-like skin lesions, dental problems, and an increased risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests (e.g., IgE levels), and genetic analysis to identify mutations in the STAT3 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for HIES, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing infections. This may include antibiotics, antifungal medications, and other supportive care measures. In some cases, patients may require surgical interventions or other procedures to address specific complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with HIES varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many patients can lead relatively normal lives, although they may experience ongoing health issues.\n\n**References**\n\n* Beziat V, Li J, Lin JX, Ma CS, Li P, Bousfiha A, Pellier I, Zoghi S, Baris S, Keles S, Gray P, Du N, Wang Y, Zerbib Y, Levy R, Leclercq T, About F, Lim AI, Rao G, Payne K, Pelham SJ, Avery DT, Deenick EK, Pillay B, Chou J, Guery R, Belkadi A, Guerin A, Migaud M, Rattina V, Ailal F, Benhsaien I, Bouaziz M, Habib T, Chaussabel D, Marr N, El-Benna J, Grimbacher B, Wargon O, Bustamante J, Boisson B, Muller-Fleckenstein I, Fleckenstein B, Chandesris MO, Titeux M, Fraitag S, Alyanakian MA, Leruez-Ville M, Picard C, Meyts I, Di Santo JP, Hovnanian A, Somer A, Ozen A, Rezaei N, Chatila TA, Abel L, Leonard WJ, Tangye SG, Puel A, Casanova JL.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant hypocalcemia is characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Affected individuals can have an imbalance of other molecules in the blood as well, including too much phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) or too little magnesium (hypomagnesemia). Some people with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia also have low levels of a hormone called parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism). This hormone is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the blood. Abnormal levels of calcium and other molecules in the body can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, although about half of affected individuals have no associated health problems.\n\n**Features**\n\nThe most common features of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia include:\n\n* Muscle spasms in the hands and feet (carpopedal spasms)\n* Muscle cramping, prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), or twitching of the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular irritability) in various parts of the body\n* Seizures, usually in infancy or childhood\n\nSome people with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia have high levels of calcium in their urine (hypercalciuria), which can lead to deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) or the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). These conditions can damage the kidneys and impair their function. Sometimes, abnormal deposits of calcium form in the brain, typically in structures called basal ganglia, which help control movement.\n\n**Bartter Syndrome**\n\nA small percentage of severely affected individuals have features of a kidney disorder called Bartter syndrome in addition to hypocalcemia. These features can include:\n\n* A shortage of potassium (hypokalemia) and magnesium\n* A buildup of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism) in the blood\n* Metabolic alkalosis\n\nThe combination of features of these two conditions is sometimes referred to as autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with Bartter syndrome or Bartter syndrome type V.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are two types of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia distinguished by their genetic cause. The signs and symptoms of the two types are generally the same.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia?**\n\nAutosomal dominant hypocalcemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood. It is caused by mutations in the CASR or GNA11 gene, which regulate the amount of calcium in the blood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common features of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia include:\n\n* Muscle spasms in the hands and feet (carpopedal spasms)\n* Muscle cramping, prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), or twitching of the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular irritability) in various parts of the body\n* Seizures, usually in infancy or childhood\n* High levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), which can lead to deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) or the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)\n* Abnormal deposits of calcium in the brain\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are two types of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia distinguished by their genetic cause:\n\n* Type 1: caused by mutations in the CASR gene\n* Type 2: caused by mutations in the GNA11 gene\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe condition is primarily caused by mutations in the CASR or GNA11 gene, which regulate the amount of calcium in the blood.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe prevalence of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is unknown. The condition is likely underdiagnosed because it often causes no signs or symptoms.\n\n**Genetic Cause**\n\nMutations in the CASR or GNA11 gene lead to overactivity of the respective protein, resulting in low levels of calcium in the blood.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia?**\n\nAutosomal dominant hypocalcemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Causes of Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\nThe condition is primarily caused by mutations in the CASR gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcium molecules attach to the CaSR protein, allowing it to monitor and regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. The altered CaSR protein is more sensitive to calcium, leading to overactivity and an inability to properly regulate calcium levels.\n\nA small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in the GNA11 gene, which produces a signaling protein that works in conjunction with CaSR. The altered GÎ±11 protein continues to send signals to prevent calcium increases, even when levels in the blood are very low.\n\n**Symptoms of Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\nThe symptoms of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Cramping or twitching of the muscles\n* Impaired regulation of other molecules, such as phosphate and magnesium\n\nStudies show that the lower the amount of calcium in the blood, the more severe the symptoms of the condition are.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. A small number of cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAutosomal dominant hypocalcemia has several other names, including:\n\n* Autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism\n* Familial hypercalciuric hypocalcemia\n* Familial hypocalcemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1; HYPOC1 and HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2; HYPOC2\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia?**\n\nAutosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by low calcium levels in the blood. It is caused by mutations in the CASR gene, which codes for the calcium-sensing receptor.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of ADH can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* **Seizures**: Severe seizures are a hallmark symptom of ADH.\n* **Hand or foot spasms**: Patients with ADH often experience spasms in their hands or feet.\n* **Hypoparathyroidism**: The parathyroid glands are underactive, leading to low calcium levels.\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify the CASR gene mutation.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ADH, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease (ADLD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies are characterized by abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates and protects nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with ADLD develop signs and symptoms of the condition in adulthood, typically in their forties or fifties. The first signs of the condition often involve problems with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. These problems include:\n\n* Difficulty with bowel and bladder function\n* A sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension)\n* Erectile dysfunction in men\n* Rarely, an inability to sweat (anhidrosis), which can lead to a dangerously high body temperature\n\nIn ADLD, movement difficulties often develop after the autonomic nervous system problems. Affected individuals can have:\n\n* Muscle stiffness (spasticity) or weakness\n* Involuntary rhythmic shaking, called intention tremor because it worsens during movement\n* Difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), including:\n\t+ Movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria)\n\t+ Rapidly alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesis)\n\nThese movement problems usually first affect the legs, but as the condition worsens, the arms and eventually the face become involved. In some people with ADLD, the symptoms worsen during episodes of fever, infection, or exposure to heat.\n\n**Progression and Survival**\n\nADLD worsens slowly, and affected individuals usually survive 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. Intelligence is usually unaffected; however, people who have had ADLD for a long time may have a decline in intellectual function (dementia). Due to difficulty walking and an unsteady gait, many affected individuals need a cane, walker, or wheelchair for assistance.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease?**\n\nADLD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is one of a group of disorders called leukodystrophies, which are characterized by abnormalities of the white matter in the brain.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe first signs of ADLD often involve problems with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as:\n\n* Difficulty with bowel and bladder function\n* Sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension)\n* Erectile dysfunction in men\n* Rarely, an inability to sweat (anhidrosis), which can lead to a dangerously high body temperature\n\nMovement difficulties often develop after the autonomic nervous system problems.

This gene provides instructions for making the lamin B1 protein, which plays an essential role in determining the shape of the nucleus within cells. Nearly all cases of ADLD result from an abnormal extra copy (duplication) of the LMNB1 gene.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe exact prevalence of ADLD is unknown. At least 70 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature, although this condition is likely to be underdiagnosed.\n\n**Survival Rate**\n\nADLD worsens slowly, and affected individuals usually survive 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. Intelligence is usually unaffected; however, people who have had ADLD for a long time may have a decline in intellectual function (dementia).\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease?**\n\nAutosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease (ADLD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by progressive demyelination, which is the loss of myelin, a fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers.\n\n**Causes of ADLD**\n\nADLD is caused by mutations in the LMNB1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the lamin B1 protein, which plays an essential role in determining the shape of the nucleus within cells and in the copying (replication) of DNA in preparation for cell division.\n\n**Symptoms of ADLD**\n\nThe symptoms of ADLD typically begin in adulthood and may include:\n\n*   Problems with bladder control\n*   Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up)\n*   Movement problems, such as difficulty walking or maintaining balance\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nADLD is also known by other names, including:\n\n*   Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic symptoms\n*   Autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy\n*   LMNB1-related adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy with Autonomic Disease**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the LMNB1 gene, which codes for lamin B1 protein. The disease is characterized by progressive demyelination of the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as weakness, paralysis, and cognitive decline.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. The risk of inheriting the disease is 50% for each child of an affected parent.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of ADLD can vary depending on the individual and the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Weakness or paralysis of the limbs\n* Difficulty with coordination and balance\n* Cognitive decline, including memory loss and difficulty with concentration\n* Autonomic dysfunction, including problems with heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the LMNB1 gene. Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans may also be used to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is currently no cure for ADLD, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and slowing disease progression. This may include:\n\n* Physical therapy to maintain mobility and strength\n* Occupational therapy to improve coordination and balance\n* Speech therapy to address cognitive decline\n* Medications to manage autonomic dysfunction and other symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ADLD is generally poor, with most people experiencing significant disability and a reduced life expectancy. However, the rate of disease progression can vary widely depending on the individual and the stage of the disease.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Bartoletti-Stella A, Gasparini L, Giacomini C, et al.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is an uncommon form of epilepsy that runs in families. This disorder causes seizures that usually occur at night (nocturnally) while an affected person is sleeping. Some people with ADNFLE also have seizures during the day.\n\n**Symptoms of ADNFLE**\n\nThe seizures characteristic of ADNFLE tend to occur in clusters, with each one lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes. Some people have mild seizures that simply cause them to wake up from sleep. Others have more severe episodes that can include sudden, repetitive movements such as flinging or throwing motions of the arms and bicycling movements of the legs. The person may get out of bed and wander around, which can be mistaken for sleepwalking. The person may also cry out or make moaning, gasping, or grunting sounds. These episodes are sometimes misdiagnosed as nightmares, night terrors, or panic attacks.\n\n**Aura in ADNFLE**\n\nIn some types of epilepsy, including ADNFLE, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura often precedes a seizure. The most common symptoms associated with an aura in people with ADNFLE are tingling, shivering, a sense of fear, dizziness (vertigo), and a feeling of falling or being pushed. Some affected people have also reported a feeling of breathlessness, overly fast breathing (hyperventilation), or choking.\n\n**Causes and Triggers of Seizures in ADNFLE**\n\nIt is unclear what brings on seizures in people with ADNFLE. Episodes may be triggered by stress or fatigue, but in most cases the seizures do not have any recognized triggers.\n\n**Age of Onset and Course of the Disease**\n\nThe seizures associated with ADNFLE can begin anytime from infancy to mid-adulthood, but most begin in childhood. The episodes tend to become milder and less frequent with age. In most affected people, the seizures can be effectively controlled with medication.\n\n**Intellectual Function and Associated Features**\n\nMost people with ADNFLE are intellectually normal, and there are no problems with their brain function between seizures. However, some people with ADNFLE have experienced psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia), behavioral problems, or intellectual disability. It is unclear whether these additional features are directly related to epilepsy in these individuals.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE)**\n\n**What is ADNFLE?**\n\nADNFLE is an uncommon form of epilepsy that runs in families.

However, some people with ADNFLE have experienced psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia), behavioral problems, or intellectual disability. It is unclear whether these additional features are directly related to epilepsy in these individuals.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nADNFLE appears to be an uncommon form of epilepsy; its prevalence is unknown. This condition has been reported in more than 100 families worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CHRNA2, CHRNA4, and CHRNB2 genes can cause ADNFLE. These genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of a larger molecule called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). This receptor plays an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.\n\nCommunication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. Researchers believe that mutations in the CHRNA2, CHRNA4, and CHRNB2 genes affect the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\nThe resulting changes in signaling between neurons likely trigger the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. The seizures associated with ADNFLE begin in areas of the brain called the frontal lobes. These regions of the brain are involved in many critical functions, including reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving.\n\nIt is unclear why mutations in the CHRNA2, CHRNA4, and CHRNB2 genes cause seizures in the frontal lobes rather than elsewhere in the brain. Researchers are also working to determine why these seizures occur most often during sleep.\n\nThe genetic cause of ADNFLE has been identified in only a small percentage of affected families. In some cases, a gene other than those that make up the nAChR are involved. In the remaining families, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are searching for other genetic changes, including mutations in other subunits of nAChR, that may underlie the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by seizures that occur predominantly during sleep. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to raise the risk of developing epilepsy.\n\n**Genetic Cause of ADNFLE**\n\nMutations in the CHRNA2, CHRNA4, and CHRNB2 genes can cause ADNFLE.

About 70 percent of people who inherit a mutation in the CHRNA2, CHRNA4, or CHRNB2 gene will develop seizures.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nADNFLE\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 1\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 2\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 3\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 4\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 1; ENFL1, EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 2; ENFL2, EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 3; ENFL3, EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 4; ENFL4\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep and seizures. It is characterized by seizures that occur during sleep, often accompanied by abnormal movements such as twitching or thrashing.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nADNFLE is caused by mutations in specific genes that affect the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. These receptors play a crucial role in regulating sleep and seizure activity. The disorder can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ADNFLE typically begin during childhood or adolescence and may include:\n\n* Seizures that occur during sleep\n* Abnormal movements such as twitching or thrashing\n* Confusion and disorientation after a seizure\n* Memory loss and difficulty concentrating\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ADNFLE can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other sleep disorders or epilepsy syndromes. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* Medical history and physical examination\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect abnormal brain wave activity\n* Genetic testing to identify mutations in the affected genes\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ADNFLE, but treatment options may include:\n\n* Antiepileptic medications to control seizures\n* Sleep aids to improve sleep quality\n* Behavioral therapies to manage seizure triggers and reduce stress\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ADNFLE varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with ADNFLE can lead normal lives, although they may experience occasional seizures.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Combi R, Dalpra L, Tenchini ML, Ferini-Strambi L.

The protein produced from this gene is made in cells and tissues throughout the body and plays a role in the organization of the shape and structure of mitochondria and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Mutations in the OPA3 gene lead to abnormal mitochondrial function, which contributes to impaired vision and other symptoms.\n\n**How Does the Mutation Affect the Body?**\n\nThe mutation affects the body by leading to abnormal mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria seem to be more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, affected cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, are likely to die prematurely. This leads to impaired vision and other symptoms.\n\n**What is the Relationship Between OPA3 Gene Mutations and Cataracts?**\n\nIt is unclear how OPA3 gene mutations lead to cataracts and other eye problems that can occur in autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract. However, it is thought that the mutation affects the organization of the shape and structure of mitochondria, which contributes to impaired vision and other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy and Cataract**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy and Cataract?**\n\nAutosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes and vision. It is caused by mutations in a gene called OPA3, which plays a role in the organization of mitochondria and controlled cell death (apoptosis).\n\n**How Does the OPA3 Gene Work?**\n\nThe protein produced from the OPA3 gene is made in cells and tissues throughout the body and is found within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. While the exact function of the protein is unknown, it is thought to play a role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in controlled cell death (apoptosis).\n\n**What Happens When There are Mutations in the OPA3 Gene?**\n\nMutations in the OPA3 gene lead to abnormal mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized, and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria seem to be more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, affected cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, are likely to die prematurely.\n\n**How Does This Affect Vision?**\n\nWhen retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. Together, these effects reduce vision in affected individuals.\n\n**Is There a Connection Between OPA3 Gene Mutations and Cataracts?**\n\nIt is unclear how OPA3 gene mutations lead to cataracts and other eye problems that can occur in autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract.\n\n**How Is This Condition Inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAutosomal dominant optic atrophy type 3\nOPA3\nOptic atrophy and cataract, autosomal dominant\nOptic atrophy type 3\nOptic atrophy, cataract, and neurologic disorder\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Optic atrophy 3\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: OPTIC ATROPHY 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; OPA3\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nBagli E, Zikou AK, Agnantis N, Kitsos G.

It is caused by mutations in the OPA3 gene, which codes for a protein involved in mitochondrial function.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Optic atrophy: degeneration of the optic nerve, leading to vision loss\n* Cataract: clouding of the lens in the eye, affecting vision\n* Other systemic features: such as muscle weakness, hearing loss, and developmental delays\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract is a mutation in the OPA3 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called OPA3, which plays a crucial role in the function of mitochondria.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAutosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can be used to diagnose autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract. The test involves analyzing a sample of blood or tissue for mutations in the OPA3 gene.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract, but treatment may help manage the symptoms. This may include:\n\n* Cataract removal surgery\n* Vision therapy to improve vision\n* Other supportive care measures to manage related systemic features\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other systemic features. With proper treatment and management, some individuals may experience a stabilization or improvement in their symptoms over time.\n\n**References**\n\n* lack GC, Votruba M.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease-UMOD**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD (ADTKD-UMOD) is part of a group of disorders that cause a slow loss of kidney function. In people with ADTKD-UMOD, the signs and symptoms of kidney disease often begin in adolescence or early adulthood. Over time, the kidneys become less able to filter fluids and waste products from the body. People with ADTKD-UMOD eventually develop kidney failure, which requires either dialysis to remove waste from the blood or a kidney transplant. The age at which people with ADTKD-UMOD develop kidney failure can vary, though the average age is approximately 45 years.\n\nPeople with ADTKD-UMOD typically develop high levels of a waste product called uric acid in their blood. Normally, the kidneys transfer uric acid from the blood into urine, which then removes it from the body. People with ADTKD-UMOD are unable to remove uric acid from the blood effectively. In about 50 percent of people with ADTKD-UMOD, uric acid builds up in the joints and causes a form of arthritis called gout, typically in late adolescence or early adulthood. Gout is characterized by a sudden onset of severe joint pain and redness, often starting in the big toe. Untreated episodes of gout typically worsen over time.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nADTKD-UMOD is believed to account for fewer than 1 percent of all cases of kidney failure. Researchers aren't sure how common ADTKD-UMOD actually is, but it is considered to be one of the most common forms of kidney disease that is caused by changes in a single gene.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Changes in a single gene\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* None specified\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n* American Kidney Fund\n* United States Renal Data System (USRDS)\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of references]\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease-UMOD**\n\nConsidered to be one of the most common forms of kidney disease that is caused by changes in a single gene.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the UMOD gene cause ADTKD-UMOD. This gene provides instructions for making the uromodulin protein. This protein is produced by the kidneys and then released from the body in urine. Uromodulin is the most common protein found in the urine of healthy individuals. It is thought to play a role in the transport of minerals such as sodium and potassium.\n\nMost variants in the UMOD gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the uromodulin protein. These variants typically alter the structure of the protein, though some variants have more severe effects on protein function than others. People with UMOD variants that have a greater effect on protein function generally have severe kidney disease, and these individuals experience signs and symptoms of kidney disease at a younger age.\n\nTypically, UMOD gene variants prevent kidney cells from releasing the uromodulin protein. The buildup of uromodulin may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells in the kidneys, leading to kidney disease and eventual kidney failure.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ADMCKD2\n* ADTKD-UMOD\n* ADTKD1\n* Autosomal dominant medullary cystic kidney disease 2\n* Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease 1\n* Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to UMOD mutation\n* Familial juvenile gouty nephropathy\n* Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy 1\n* FJHN\n* Glomerulocystic kidney disease with hyperuricemia and isosthenuria\n* HNFJ1\n* MCKD2\n* Medullary cystic kidney disease type 2\n* UAKD\n* UMOD kidney disease\n* UMOD-related ADTKD\n* UMOD-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease\n* Uromodulin-associated kidney disease\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease - UMOD**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease - UMOD?**\n\nAutosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene and is characterized by the progressive loss of kidney function.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Kidney failure\n* Hyperuricemia (elevated levels of uric acid in the blood)\n* Gout\n* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD is a mutation in the UMOD gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called uromodulin, which plays a role in maintaining healthy kidneys.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD typically involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the UMOD gene. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Kidney function tests\n* Imaging studies of the kidneys\n* Urine tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment may include:\n\n* Dialysis or kidney transplantation\n* Medications to control hyperuricemia and gout\n* Lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of kidney damage\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-UMOD is generally poor, as the disease can lead to end-stage renal disease. However, with proper treatment and management, some people may be able to slow the progression of the disease.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bleyer AJ, Hart TC.

These gene problems are passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Often, many family members have the disease.\n\nThe abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are:\n\n* UMOD gene -- causes ADTKD-UMOD, or uromodulin kidney disease\n* MUC1 gene -- causes ADTKD-MUC1, or mucin-1 kidney disease\n* REN gene -- causes ADTKD-REN, or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2)\n* HNF1B gene -- causes ADTKD-HNF1B, or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5)\n\nWhen the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly in the disease, depending on the form of ADTKD, symptoms may include:\n\n* Excessive urination (polyuria)\n* Gout\n* Salt cravings\n* Urination at night (nocturia)\n* Weakness\n\nAs the disease worsens, symptoms of kidney failure may develop, which include:\n\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Fatigue, weakness\n* Frequent hiccups\n* Headache\n* Increased skin color (skin may appear yellow or brown)\n* Itching\n* Malaise (general ill feeling)\n* Muscle twitching or cramps\n* Nausea\n* Pale skin\n* Reduced sensation in the hands, feet, or other areas\n* Vomiting blood or blood in the stool\n* Weight loss\n* Seizures\n* Confusion, decreased alertness, coma\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. You'll likely be asked if other family members have ADTKD or kidney disease.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* 24-hour urine volume and electrolytes\n* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Creatinine blood test\n* Creatinine clearance -- blood and urine\n* Uric acid blood test\n* Urine specific gravity (will be low)\n\nThe following tests can help diagnose this condition:\n\n* Abdominal CT scan\n* Abdominal ultrasound\n* Kidney biopsy\n* Kidney ultrasound\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for ADTKD. At first, treatment focuses on controlling symptoms, reducing complications, and slowing the progression of the disease. Because so much water and salt may be lost, you may need to follow instructions on drinking plenty of fluids and taking salt supplements to avoid dehydration.\n\nAs the disease progresses, kidney failure develops. Treatment may involve taking medicines and diet changes, limiting foods containing phosphorus and potassium. You may need dialysis and a kidney transplant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe age at which people with ADTKD reach end-stage kidney disease varies, depending on the form of the disease. It can be as young as in the teens or in older adulthood. Lifelong treatment may control the symptoms of chronic kidney disease.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nKidney damage due to ADTKD may lead to the following health problems:\n\n* Anemia\n* Bone weakening and fractures\n* Cardiac tamponade\n* Changes in glucose metabolism\n* Congestive heart failure\n* End-stage kidney disease\n* High blood pressure\n* Hyponatremia (low blood sodium level)\n* Hyperkalemia (too much potassium in the blood), especially with end-stage kidney disease\n* Hypokalemia (too little potassium in the blood)\n* Infertility\n* Menstrual problems\n* Miscarriage\n* Pericarditis\n* Peripheral neuropathy\n* Platelet dysfunction with easy bruising\n* Skin color changes\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease**\n\n**Causes**\n\nADTKD is caused by mutations in certain genes, which are passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease.\n\nWith all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged. These are the structures in the kidneys that allow most fluid in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood.\n\nThe abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are:\n\n* UMOD gene -- causes ADTKD-UMOD, or uromodulin kidney disease\n* MUC1 gene -- causes ADTKD-MUC1, or mucin-1 kidney disease\n* REN gene -- causes ADTKD-REN, or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2)\n* HNF1B gene -- causes ADTKD-HNF1B, or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5)\n\nWhen the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly in the disease, depending on the form of ADTKD, symptoms may include:\n\n* Excessive urination (polyuria)\n* Gout\n* Salt cravings\n* Urination at night (nocturia)\n* Weakness\n\nAs the disease worsens, symptoms of kidney failure may develop, which include:\n\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Fatigue, weakness\n* Frequent hiccups\n* Headache\n* Increased skin color (skin may appear yellow or brown)\n* Itching\n* Malaise (general ill feeling)\n* Muscle twitching or cramps\n* Nausea\n* Pale skin\n* Reduced sensation in the hands, feet, or other areas\n* Vomiting blood or blood in the stool\n* Weight loss\n* Seizures\n* Confusion, decreased alertness, coma\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.

It is characterized by the progressive loss of kidney function, leading to chronic kidney disease and potentially end-stage renal disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ADTKD can vary depending on the individual and the stage of the disease. They may include:\n\n* **Polyuria**: Excessive urine production\n* **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst\n* **Weight loss**: Due to increased urine production and potential dehydration\n* **Fatigue**: As a result of chronic kidney disease\n* **Swelling**: In the legs, ankles, or feet due to fluid buildup\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of ADTKD is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* **Family history**: A family history of ADTKD or other kidney diseases can increase the likelihood of diagnosis.\n* **Physical examination**: A healthcare provider may perform a physical examination to look for signs of kidney disease, such as swelling in the legs or ankles.\n* **Imaging tests**: Imaging tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans, may be used to evaluate the kidneys and detect any abnormalities.\n* **Blood tests**: Blood tests can help diagnose ADTKD by detecting abnormal levels of certain proteins or electrolytes.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for ADTKD. Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms, reducing complications, and slowing the progression of the disease. This may include:\n\n* **Fluid management**: Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and taking salt supplements to avoid dehydration.\n* **Medications**: Taking medications to control blood pressure, reduce proteinuria, or slow the progression of kidney disease.\n* **Dietary changes**: Making dietary changes to limit foods containing phosphorus and potassium.\n* **Dialysis**: Receiving dialysis treatment to remove waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function.\n* **Kidney transplant**: In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ADTKD varies depending on the stage of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Some people may experience a slow decline in kidney function over many years, while others may progress to end-stage renal disease more rapidly. Lifelong treatment may help control the symptoms of chronic kidney disease.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nKidney damage due to ADTKD can lead to various health problems, including:\n\n* **Anemia**: A decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin.\n* **Bone weakening and fractures**: Weakened bones that are prone to fractures.\n* **Cardiac tamponade**: A condition where fluid accumulates in the sac surrounding the heart.\n* **Changes in glucose metabolism**: Abnormalities in how the body processes sugar.\n* **Congestive heart failure**: A condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n* **End-stage kidney disease**: A stage of kidney disease where the kidneys are no longer able to function.\n* **High blood pressure**: Elevated blood pressure that can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n* **Hyponatremia**: Low sodium levels in the blood.\n* **Hyperkalemia**: High potassium levels in the blood.\n* **Hypokalemia**: Low potassium levels in the blood.\n* **Infertility**: Difficulty conceiving due to kidney damage.\n* **Menstrual problems**: Abnormalities in menstrual cycles or fertility.\n* **Miscarriage**: A pregnancy that ends in miscarriage.\n* **Pericarditis**: Inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart.\n* **Peripheral neuropathy**: Damage to the nerves outside the central nervous system.\n* **Platelet dysfunction with easy bruising**: Abnormalities in blood clotting and increased risk of bleeding.\n* **Skin color changes**: Changes in skin pigmentation.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of urinary or kidney problems, contact your healthcare provider for guidance and support.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAutosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is an inherited disorder, and it may not be preventable. However, early detection and treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and improve outcomes.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nADTKD; Medullary cystic kidney disease; Renin associated kidney disease; Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy; Uromodulin associated kidney disease\n\n**References**\n\nEckardt KU, Alper SL, Antignac C, et al.

    "content": "**Autosomal Dominant Vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC)**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) is a disorder that affects several parts of the eyes, including the clear gel that fills the eye (the vitreous), the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), and the network of blood vessels within the retina (the choroid). The eye abnormalities in ADVIRC can lead to varying degrees of vision impairment, from mild reduction to complete loss, although some people with the condition have normal vision.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of ADVIRC vary, even among members of the same family. Many affected individuals have microcornea, in which the clear front covering of the eye (cornea) is small and abnormally curved. The area behind the cornea can also be abnormally small, which is described as a shallow anterior chamber. Individuals with ADVIRC can develop increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) or clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract). In addition, some people have breakdown (degeneration) of the vitreous or the choroid.\n\nA characteristic feature of ADVIRC, visible with a special eye exam, is a circular band of excess coloring (hyperpigmentation) in the retina. This feature can help physicians diagnose the disorder. Affected individuals may also have white spots on the retina.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nADVIRC is considered a rare disease. Its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nADVIRC is caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene. The protein produced from this gene, called bestrophin-1, is thought to play a critical role in normal vision. Bestrophin-1 is found in a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium. This cell layer supports and nourishes the retina and is involved in growth and development of the eye, maintenance of the retina, and the normal function of specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and color. In the retinal pigment epithelium, bestrophin-1 functions as a channel that transports charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) across the cell membrane.\n\nMutations in the BEST1 gene alter how the gene's instructions are used to make bestrophin-1, which leads to production of versions of the protein that are missing certain segments or have extra segments.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Vitreoretinochoroidopathy**\n\n**What is Autosomal Dominant Vitreoretinochoroidopathy?**\n\nAutosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes.

It is not clear how these versions of bestrophin affect chloride ion transport or lead to the eye abnormalities characteristic of ADVIRC.\n\n**Symptoms of ADVIRC**\n\nThe symptoms of ADVIRC can vary, but they often include:\n\n*   Microcornea: a small cornea\n*   Glaucoma: increased pressure in the eye that can damage the optic nerve\n*   Cataract: a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nADVIRC is also known as:\n\n*   Vitreoretinochoroidopathy\n*   Dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy\n*   Vitreoretinochoroidopathy with microcornea, glaucoma, and cataract\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on ADVIRC, you can visit the following resources:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: VITREORETINOCHOROIDOPATHY; VRCP\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: ADVIRC is caused by distinct mutations in BEST1 that alter pre-mRNA splicing.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Vitreoretinochoroidopathy**\n\n\\n\\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n*   What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n*   How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n**Disclaimers**\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive Axonal Neuropathy with Neuromyotonia**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia is a disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound.\n\nAxonal neuropathy, a characteristic feature of this condition, is caused by damage to a particular part of peripheral nerves called axons, which are the extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses. In people with autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia, the damage primarily causes progressive weakness and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands. Muscle weakness may be especially apparent during exercise (exercise intolerance) and can lead to an unusual walking style (gait), frequent falls, and joint deformities (contractures) in the hands and feet. In some affected individuals, axonal neuropathy also causes decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, or cold, particularly in the lower arms or legs.\n\nAnother feature of this condition is neuromyotonia (also known as Isaac syndrome). Neuromyotonia results from overactivation (hyperexcitability) of peripheral nerves, which leads to delayed relaxation of muscles after voluntary tensing (contraction), muscle cramps, and involuntary rippling movement of the muscles (myokymia).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAutosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia is a rare form of inherited peripheral neuropathy. This group of conditions affects an estimated 1 in 2,500 people. The prevalence of autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia is unknown.\n\nNote: I removed the repetitive sections and formatted the content to make it easier to read.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the function of the nervous system. Laboratory studies show that the HINT1 protein has the ability to carry out a chemical reaction called hydrolysis that breaks down certain molecules. However, it is not known what effects this reaction has in the body.\n\nHINT1 gene mutations lead to the production of a HINT1 protein with little or no function. Sometimes the abnormal protein is broken down prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how loss of functional HINT1 protein affects the peripheral nerves and leads to the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ARAN-NM\n* Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 with neuromyotonia\n* Autosomal recessive neuromyotonia and axonal neuropathy\n* Gamstorp-Wohlfart syndrome\n* Myokymia, myotonia, and muscle wasting\n* NMAN\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: NEUROMYOTONIA AND AXONAL NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; NMAN\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Caetano JS, Costa C, Baets J, Zimon Phd M, Venancio Phd M, Saraiva Phd J, Negrao L, Fineza I.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia Type 1**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA1) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement due to a loss (atrophy) of nerve cells in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum). Signs and symptoms of the disorder first appear in early to mid-adulthood. People with this condition initially experience impaired speech (dysarthria), problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), or both. They may also have difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria). Other features of ARCA1 include abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and problems following the movements of objects with the eyes. The movement problems are slowly progressive, often resulting in the need for a cane, walker, or wheelchair.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nMore than 100 people have been diagnosed with ARCA1. This condition was first discovered in individuals from the Beauce and Bas-Saint-Laurent regions of Quebec, Canada, but it has since been found in populations worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the SYNE1 gene cause ARCA1. The SYNE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Syne-1 that is found in many tissues, but it seems to be especially critical in the brain. Within the brain, the Syne-1 protein appears to play a role in the maintenance of the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. The Syne-1 protein is active (expressed) in Purkinje cells, which are located in the cerebellum and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons).\n\nSYNE1 gene mutations that cause ARCA1 result in an abnormally short, dysfunctional version of the Syne-1 protein. The defective protein is thought to impair Purkinje cell function and disrupt signaling between neurons in the cerebellum. The loss of brain cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of ARCA1, but it is unclear how this cell loss is related to impaired Purkinje cell function.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia Type 1**\n\n**What is Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia Type 1?**\n\nAutosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA1) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is an inherited condition that mainly affects the function of red blood cells. Specifically, it alters a molecule within these cells called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the body. In people with autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia, some of the normal hemoglobin is replaced by an abnormal form called methemoglobin, which is unable to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. As a result, tissues in the body become oxygen deprived, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin, lips, and nails (cyanosis).\n\n**Forms of the Condition**\n\nThere are two forms of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia: types I and II.\n\n* **Type I**: People with type I have cyanosis from birth and may experience weakness or shortness of breath related to the shortage of oxygen in their tissues. They typically have a normal life expectancy.\n* **Type II**: People with type II have cyanosis as well as severe neurological problems. After a few months of apparently normal development, children with type II develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), and involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis); also, the size of their head remains small and does not grow in proportion with their body (microcephaly). People with type II have severe intellectual disability; they can recognize faces and usually babble but speak no words. They can sit unassisted and grip objects but have impaired motor skills that leave them unable to walk. In type II, growth is often slowed. Abnormal facial muscle movements can interfere with swallowing, which can lead to feeding difficulties and further slow growth.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* **Type I**: Normal life expectancy\n* **Type II**: Often do not survive past early adulthood\n\n**Causes**\n\nInherited condition that affects the function of red blood cells.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nNone specified.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information, please refer to the references provided.\n\n**References**\n\nList of references cited in this article.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\n**What is Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia?**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is an inherited condition that mainly affects the function of red blood cells. It alters a molecule within these cells called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the body.\n\n**Forms of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\nThere are two forms of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia: types I and II.\n\n* **Type I:** People with type I have cyanosis from birth and may experience weakness or shortness of breath related to the shortage of oxygen in their tissues.\n* **Type II:** People with type II have severe neurological problems, including brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), and involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis). They also have impaired motor skills that leave them unable to walk.\n\n**Causes of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is caused by mutations in the CYB5R3 gene. This gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3, which is involved in transferring electrons from one molecule to another.\n\n**Effects of Mutations on Enzyme Activity**\n\nMutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I typically reduce enzyme activity or stability. As a result, the enzyme cannot efficiently change ferric iron to ferrous iron, leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells.\n\nMutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II usually result in a complete loss of enzyme activity. Cells cannot compensate for a complete loss of this enzyme, which results in a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nPeople with autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I have a normal life expectancy, but people with type II often do not survive past early adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\n**What is Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia?**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to convert ferric iron to ferrous iron in hemoglobin, leading to an increase in methemoglobin and a corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin.\n\n**Causes of the Condition**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the CYB5R3 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3. This enzyme is involved in transferring electrons from one molecule to another.\n\n**Types of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Methemoglobinemia**\n\nThere are two types of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia:\n\n*   Type I: Mutations that cause this type typically reduce enzyme activity or stability, leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells.\n*   Type II: Mutations that cause this type usually result in a complete loss of enzyme activity, leading to a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells.\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\nThe symptoms and features of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II include:\n\n*   Cyanosis\n*   Encephalopathy\n*   Movement disorders\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive Congenital Stationary Night Blindness**\n\n**Description**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).\n\nThe vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells.\n\nMutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light.\n\nThe cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Congenital Stationary Night Blindness**\n\n**What is Autosomal Recessive Congenital Stationary Night Blindness?**\n\nAutosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a rare genetic disorder that affects the retina and causes difficulty seeing in low light.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis**\n\n_Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis is a condition that affects hair growth._\n\nPeople with this condition have sparse hair (hypotrichosis) on the scalp beginning in infancy. This hair is usually coarse, dry, and tightly curled (often described as woolly hair). Scalp hair may also be lighter in color than expected and is fragile and easily broken. Affected individuals often cannot grow hair longer than a few inches. The eyebrows, eyelashes, and other body hair may be sparse as well. Over time, the hair problems can remain stable or progress to complete scalp hair loss (alopecia) and a decrease in body hair.\n\nRarely, people with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis have skin problems affecting areas with sparse hair, such as redness (erythema), itchiness (pruritus), or missing patches of skin (erosions) on the scalp. In areas of poor hair growth, they may also develop bumps called hyperkeratotic follicular papules that develop around hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe worldwide prevalence of autosomal recessive hypotrichosis is unknown. In Japan, the condition is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000 individuals.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAutosomal recessive hypotrichosis can be caused by mutations in the LIPH, LPAR6, or DSG4 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells within hair follicles.\n\nMutations in the LIPH, LPAR6, or DSG4 gene result in the production of abnormal proteins that cannot aid in the development of hair follicles. As a result, hair follicles are structurally abnormal and often underdeveloped. Irregular hair follicles alter the structure and growth of hair shafts, leading to woolly, fragile hair that is easily broken.\n\nA lack of these proteins in the epidermis likely contributes to the skin problems sometimes seen in affected individuals. In some areas of the body, other proteins can compensate for the function of the missing protein, so not all areas with hair are affected and not all individuals have skin problems.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis**\n\n**What is Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis?**\n\nAutosomal recessive hypotrichosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sparse or absent hair on the body, particularly on the scalp, eyebrows, and limbs. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Causes of Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis**\n\nThe condition can be caused by mutations in three genes: LIPH, LPAR6, or DSG4. These genes provide instructions for making proteins involved in the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells within hair follicles.\n\n**Symptoms of Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis**\n\nThe symptoms of autosomal recessive hypotrichosis include:\n\n* Sparse or absent hair on the body, particularly on the scalp, eyebrows, and limbs\n* Woolly, fragile hair that is easily broken\n* Skin problems, such as dryness and irritation, in some individuals\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nThe condition is also known by other names, including:\n\n* AH: Autosomal recessive localized hypotrichosis\n* Autosomal recessive woolly hair with or without hypotrichosis\n* HTL: Hypotrichoses\n* LAH: Localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\nGenetic testing is available for this condition. The Genetic Testing Registry lists the following tests:\n\n* Wooly hair, autosomal recessive 1, with or without hypotrichosis\n* Hypotrichosis 6\n* Hypotrichosis 7\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\nThe National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) provides support and advocacy resources for individuals and families affected by this condition.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\nSeveral scientific articles have been published on this condition, including:\n\n* Azeem Z et al. Novel mutations in G protein-coupled receptor gene (P2RY5) in families with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH3). Hum Genet. 2008 Jun;123(5):515-9.\n* Horev L et al.

This condition is characterized by hair loss, particularly on the scalp, and can be associated with other symptoms such as woolly hair.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nResearch has identified several genes associated with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, including:\n\n*   **Desmoglein 4**: Mutations in this gene have been linked to localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis with monilethrix hairs and congenital scalp erosions.\n*   **Lipase H (LIPH)**: Mutations in the LIPH gene have been associated with autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis.\n*   **P2RY5**: Mutations in the P2RY5 gene have been identified in families with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis.\n*   **LPAR6**: Mutations in the LPAR6 gene have been linked to woolly hair and/or hypotrichosis.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nFounder mutations in the LIPH gene are prevalent in certain populations, leading to a loss of P2Y5 activation ability of PA-PLA1alpha in autosomal recessive hypotrichosis.",

The term \"microcephaly\" comes from the Greek words for \"small head.\"\n\n**Description**\n\nInfants with MCPH have an unusually small head circumference compared to other infants of the same sex and age. Head circumference is the distance around the widest part of the head, measured by placing a measuring tape above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head. Affected infants' brain volume is also smaller than usual, although they usually do not have any major abnormalities in the structure of the brain. The head and brain grow throughout childhood and adolescence, but they continue to be much smaller than normal.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMCPH causes intellectual disability, which is typically mild to moderate and does not become more severe with age. Most affected individuals have delayed speech and language skills. Motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking, may also be mildly delayed.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nPeople with MCPH usually have few or no other features associated with the condition. Some have a narrow, sloping forehead; mild seizures; problems with attention or behavior; or short stature compared to others in their family. The condition typically does not affect any other major organ systems or cause other health problems.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* MCPH (microcephaly primary hereditary)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* For more information, see the MedlinePlus Genetics entry on autosomal recessive primary microcephaly.\n* References:\n\t+ National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Head circumference is the distance around the widest part of the head, measured by placing a measuring tape above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head.\n\n*   Intellectual disability, typically mild to moderate and does not become more severe with age\n*   Delayed speech and language skills\n*   Motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking, may also be mildly delayed\n\n**Other Features Associated with MCPH**\n\nSome individuals with MCPH may have:\n\n*   A narrow, sloping forehead\n*   Mild seizures\n*   Problems with attention or behavior\n*   Short stature compared to others in their family\n\n**Frequency of MCPH**\n\nThe prevalence of all forms of microcephaly that are present from birth (primary microcephaly) ranges from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 250,000 newborns worldwide. About 200 families with MCPH have been reported in the medical literature.\n\nThis condition is more common in several specific populations, such as in northern Pakistan, where it affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 newborns.\n\n**Causes of MCPH**\n\nMCPH can result from mutations in at least seven genes. Mutations in the ASPM gene are the most common cause of the disorder, accounting for about half of all cases.\n\nThe genes associated with MCPH play important roles in early brain development, particularly in determining brain size. Studies suggest that the proteins produced from many of these genes help regulate cell division in the developing brain.\n\nMutations in any of the genes associated with MCPH impair early brain development. As a result, affected infants have fewer nerve cells (neurons) than normal and are born with an unusually small brain.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of MCPH**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* MCPH Microcephaly primary hereditary\n* Primary autosomal recessive microcephaly\n* True microcephaly\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 1, primary, autosomal recessive\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 2, primary, autosomal recessive, with or without cortical malformations\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 3, primary, autosomal recessive\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 4, primary, autosomal recessive\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 5, primary, autosomal recessive\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 6, primary, autosomal recessive\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Microcephaly 7, primary, autosomal recessive\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH1\n* MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH OR WITHOUT CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS; MCPH2\n* MICROCEPHALY 4, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH4\n* MICROCEPHALY 3, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH3\n* MICROCEPHALY 6, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH6\n* MICROCEPHALY 5, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH5\n* MICROCEPHALY 7, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; MCPH7\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Cox J, Jackson AP, Bond J, Woods CG.

It is caused by mutations in specific genes that are essential for brain development and growth.\n\n**Clinical Features**\n\nIndividuals with MCPH often have a head circumference that is more than two standard deviations below the mean for their age and sex. They may also experience developmental delays, intellectual disability, and seizures.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nMCPH is caused by mutations in genes such as CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, and BUB1B. These genes play critical roles in cell cycle regulation, chromosome segregation, and brain development.\n\n**Prognosis and Treatment**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with MCPH varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the presence of other associated medical conditions. While there is no cure for MCPH, early intervention and supportive care can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMCPH is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that individuals must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder. Carriers of the mutation may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the mutation on to their offspring.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Brain Malformations\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?",

The SACS gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sacsin, which plays a role in organizing proteins into bundles called intermediate filaments.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of ARSACS**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Frequency of ARSACS**\n\nThe incidence of ARSACS in the Charlevoix-Saguenay region is estimated to be 1 in 1,500 to 2,000 individuals.

    "content": "**Autosomal Recessive**\n\nOne of several ways that a genetic trait, disorder, or disease can be passed down through families.\n\n**What is an Autosomal Recessive Disorder?**\n\nAn autosomal recessive disorder means two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease or trait to develop.\n\n**Information**\n\nInheriting a specific disease, condition, or trait depends on the type of chromosome that is affected. The two types are autosomal chromosomes and sex chromosomes. It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nA variation in a gene on one of the first 22 nonsex chromosomes can lead to an autosomal disorder.\n\nGenes come in pairs. One gene in each pair comes from the egg, and the other gene comes from the sperm. Recessive inheritance means both genes in a pair must be abnormal to cause disease. People with only one variant gene in the pair are called carriers. These people are most often not affected with the condition. However, they can pass the variant gene to their children.\n\n**Chances of Inheriting a Trait**\n\nIf you are born to parents who both carry the same autosomal recessive gene, you have a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting the variant gene from both parents and developing the disease. You have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting one variant gene. This would make you a carrier.\n\nIn other words, for a child born to a couple who both carry the variant gene (but do not have signs of disease), the expected outcome for each pregnancy is:\n\n* A 25% chance that the child is born with two normal genes (healthy)\n* A 50% chance that the child is born with one normal and one variant gene (carrier, without disease)\n* A 25% chance that the child is born with two variant genes (at risk for the disease)\n\nNote: These outcomes do not mean that the children will definitely be carriers or be severely affected.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGenetics - autosomal recessive; Inheritance - autosomal recessive\n\n**References**\n\nGregg AR, Kuller JA.
