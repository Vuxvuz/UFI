    "content": "**Eating Habits and Behaviors**\n\nFood gives our bodies the energy we need to function. Food is also a part of traditions and culture. This can mean that eating has an emotional component as well. For many people, changing eating habits is very hard.\n\nYou may have had certain eating habits for so long that you do not realize they are unhealthy. Or, your habits have become part of your daily life, so you do not think much about them.\n\n**Keep a Journal**\n\nA food journal is a good tool to help you learn about your eating habits. Keep a food journal for 1 week.\n\n* Write down what you eat, how much, and what times of the day you are eating.\n* Include notes about what else you were doing and how you were feeling, such as being hungry, stressed, tired, or bored.\n* At the end of the week, review your journal and look at your eating patterns. Decide which habits you want to change.\n\n**Small Steps Lead to Success**\n\nRemember, small steps lead to more success in making long-term changes. Try not to overwhelm yourself with too many goals. It is a good idea to limit your focus to no more than 2 or 3 goals at one time.\n\nAlso, take a look at the healthy habits you have and be proud of yourself about them. Try not to judge your behaviors too harshly. It is easy to focus only on your poor habits. This can make you feel stressed or give you doubts about trying to change.\n\n**Taking On New Habits**\n\nTaking on new, healthier habits may mean that you:\n\n* Drink skim or low-fat (1%) milk instead of 2% or whole milk.\n* Drink more water throughout the day.\n* Eat fruit for dessert instead of cookies.\n* Plan and prepare healthy meals and snacks to increase your chance of success.\n* Keep healthy snacks at work. Pack healthy lunches that you make at home.\n\n**Reflecting on Your Habits**\n\nThink about what triggers or prompts may be causing some of your eating habits.\n\n* Is there something around you that makes you eat when you are not hungry or leads you to choose unhealthy snacks?\n* Does the way you feel make you want to eat?\n\nLook at your journal and circle any regular or repetitive triggers. Some of these might be:\n\n* Seeing your favorite snack in the pantry or vending machine\n* Watching television\n* Feeling stressed by something at work or in another area of your life\n* Having no plan for dinner after a long day\n* Attending events where food is served\n* Stopping at fast-food restaurants and choosing high fat, high calorie foods\n* Feeling the need for a pick-me-up toward the end of your workday\n\n**Replacing Old Habits with New Ones**\n\nFind healthy choices for snacks and plan ahead:\n\n* If you are in the habit of eating candy at the end of the day for energy, try having a cup (240 milliliters) of herbal tea and a small handful of almonds. Or take a quick walk when you are feeling an energy low.\n* Eat fruit and yogurt in the mid-afternoon about 3 or 4 hours after lunch.\n\nControl your portion sizes. It is hard to eat only a few chips or other tempting foods when there is a lot in front of you. Take only a small portion and put the rest away. Eat on a plate or in a bowl instead of straight out of a bag.\n\nEat slowly:\n\n* Put down your fork between bites.\n* Wait until you have swallowed your mouthful of food before taking the next bite.\n\nEating too quickly leads to overeating when the food you have eaten has not yet reached your stomach and told your brain you are full. You will know you are eating too quickly if you feel stuffed about 20 minutes after you stop eating.\n\nEat only when you are hungry:\n\n* Eating when you feel worried, tense, or bored also leads to overeating. Instead, call a friend or go for a walk to help you feel better.\n* Give your body and your brain time to relax from the stress of daily life. Take a mental or physical break to help you feel better without turning to food as a reward.\n\nMake healthier, nutrient-rich choices:\n\n* Replace your candy dish with a bowl of fruit or nuts.\n* When you do have unhealthy foods in your house, put them in a place that is hard for you to reach rather than out on the counter.\n\nPlan your meals:\n\n* Know what you will eat ahead of time so you can avoid buying unhealthy foods (impulse buying) or eating at fast-food restaurants.\n* Plan your dinners at the beginning of the week so you can prepare healthy, well-balanced meals each evening.\n* Prepare some dinner components ahead of time (such as chopping vegetables). This will allow you to put together a healthy meal more quickly at the end of the day.\n\nBreakfast sets the tone for the day. A hearty, healthy breakfast will give your body the energy it needs to get you to lunch. If you are not hungry when you wake up, you could try a glass of milk or a small fruit and dairy-based smoothie.\n\nPlan a good lunch that will satisfy you, and a healthy afternoon snack that will keep you from becoming too hungry before dinner time.\n\nAvoid skipping meals. Missing a regular meal or snack often leads to overeating or making unhealthy choices later.\n\nOnce you have changed 1 or 2 old unhealthy habits, try changing 1 or 2 more.\n\n**Practice Helps**\n\nIt may take a while before you can turn your unhealthy habits into new, healthy ones. Remember, it took you a while to form your current habits. And it may take just as long to change them. Do not give up.\n\nIf you start an old habit again, think about why you went back to it. Try again to replace it with a new habit. One slip does not mean you are a failure.

Keep one for a week and write down what you eat, how much, and when. Also, note down how you're feeling and what else you're doing at the time.

Learn the difference between physical hunger and habitual eating or eating as a response to stress or boredom.\n\n**Now Reflect**\n\nThink about what triggers or prompts may be causing some of your eating habits.

    "content": "**Eating Out: Healthy Choices for a Balanced Diet**\n\nAs part of our busy modern lives, eating out has become a necessary evil. However, it's possible to enjoy yourself while maintaining a healthy diet. Here are some tips to help you make informed choices when dining out:\n\n**Basic Ground Rules for Eating Out**\n\n*   Look for and choose:\n    *   Salads with dressing on the side\n    *   Vegetable side dishes\n    *   Foods that are broiled, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, or baked\n    *   Chicken, turkey, seafood, or lean meats\n*   Treat yourself only once in a while to:\n    *   Anything creamy, fried, crispy, breaded, battered, or cheesy\n    *   Sauces or soups with lots of butter, cream, or cheese\n    *   Thick or creamy salad dressings\n    *   Most casserole dishes\n\n**Healthy Eating at All Types of Restaurants**\n\n*   **Fast Food**: Choose a place that broils or grills hamburgers, fish, and chicken for their sandwiches. Order your sandwich without cheese, mayo, or \"special sauce.\" Limit ketchup, barbeque sauce, and other condiments.\n*   **Pizza**: Limit yourself to only one or two slices. Choose vegetable toppings such as peppers or spinach instead of sausage or pepperoni. Add a salad to your meal.\n*   **Sandwich Restaurants or Deli Counters**:\n    *   Choose low-fat turkey, chicken, or ham. Most cold cuts are high in sodium.\n    *   Be mindful of tuna and chicken salads which are often made with lots of high-calorie mayonnaise.\n    *   Replace extra meat and cheese with vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach.\n*   **Chinese Restaurants**:\n    *   Most deep-fried options are high in calories. Instead, choose dishes that are steamed without added oil or sugar.\n    *   Limit dishes made with sweet and sour, hoisin, gravy, or other heavy sauces, which are often high in calories.\n    *   Choose low-fat dishes that are lightly stir-fried, such as brown rice and Chinese vegetables with seafood, chicken, or bean curd (tofu).\n*   **Indian Restaurants**:\n    *   Select foods that have chickpeas or lentils, vegetables, lean protein, and sauces made from yogurt.\n    *   Good choices include mulligatawny soup, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, kebabs, whole-wheat naan bread, and lassi.\n*   **Italian Restaurants**:\n    *   Pasta dishes with a red or marinara sauce are lower in calories and saturated fat than sauces made with cream, butter, cheese, or pesto.\n    *   Look for the word primavera, which means that the menu item contains vegetables and will not include creamy sauce. Order dishes with seafood, grilled meat, fish, chicken, or vegetables.\n*   **Mexican or Southwestern Restaurants**:\n    *   Choose foods that are not fried and have only a small amount of cheese.\n    *   Guacamole is a healthier choice than sour cream, but be careful to not eat too large of a portion.\n    *   Good choices include gazpacho, chicken with brown rice, rice and black beans, and items that are baked or grilled.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make informed choices when dining out and maintain a healthy diet.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Out: Healthy Choices**\n\nIn today's busy world, eating out is a part of our lives. Even though you need to be careful not to overeat, it is possible to go out and enjoy yourself while having a healthy diet.\n\n**Be Aware of Portion Sizes**\n\nThe portion sizes at many restaurants are very large. Stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets. The temptation for overeating can be hard to resist at these places. Think and plan ahead.\n\n**Plan Ahead**\n\nIf you know you are going out, check out the menu online so you can make healthy choices ahead of time.\nAvoid eating out when you are overly hungry. Eat a small healthy snack, such as carrots or a small apple, shortly before going out.\n\n**Basic Ground Rules for Eating Out**\n\nLook for and choose:\n\n*   Salads with dressing on the side\n*   Vegetable side dishes\n*   Foods that are broiled, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, or baked\n*   Chicken, turkey, seafood, or lean meats\n\nTreat yourself only once in a while to:\n\n*   Anything creamy, fried, crispy, breaded, battered, or cheesy\n*   Sauces or soups with lots of butter, cream, or cheese\n*   Thick or creamy salad dressings\n*   Most casserole dishes\n\n**Easy Tips to Keep the Calorie Count Down**\n\nIf you were serving yourself a healthy meal at home, half of your plate would be covered in non-starchy vegetables; if your entrée does not come with a vegetable, order one on the side so you can still make a healthy plate.\nAvoid mindlessly eating foods such as chips, rolls, and bread just because they are on the table. You can ask the server to take these foods off the table.\nSplit a meal with someone, or ask for a take-out box and take half of your meal home.\nOrder the \"lunch size\" of any food rather than the \"dinner size.\"\nOrder healthy appetizers rather than an entree.\nStart with a small salad or broth-based soup as an appetizer.\nOrder the dressing for your salad on the side so you can control how much of it you use.\nDrink water, unsweetened tea, diet drinks, or low-fat milk. Limit fluids that have empty calories, such as sodas.\nLimit how much alcohol you have with meals. Wine is lower in calories than frozen drinks or mixed cocktails that have juice in them.\nSkip your dessert or share it with another person.\n\n**Fast Food**\n\nTry these tips to limit calories when eating in fast food restaurants:\n\n*   Choose a place that broils or grills hamburgers, fish, and chicken for their sandwiches.\n*   Order your sandwich without cheese, mayo or \"special sauce.\"\n*   Order only a sandwich. Avoid ordering the value or combo meal unless the restaurant offers healthy sides such as apple slices or a side salad.\n*   Whether it is a sandwich, milkshake, or French fries, stay away from large sizes.\n*   Order a salad instead of French fries.\n*   Limit ketchup, barbeque sauce, and other condiments, as they often contain hidden sugars.\n\n**Pizza**\n\nPizza is OK but limit yourself to only one or two slices. Choose vegetable toppings such as peppers or spinach instead of sausage or pepperoni. Add a salad to your meal.\n\n**Healthy Eating at All Types of Restaurants**\n\n*   **Sandwich restaurants or deli counters**\n    *   Choose low-fat turkey, chicken, or ham. Most cold cuts are high in sodium.\n    *   Be mindful of tuna and chicken salads which are often made with lots of high calorie mayonnaise.\n    *   Replace extra meat and cheese with vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach.\n    *   Ask for an open-faced sandwich.

Accessed September 23, 2024.\n\n**Review Date**\n\n7/24/2024\n\n---\n\n**Eating Out**\n\nEating out is a part of our busy modern lives. Even though you need to be careful not to overeat, it is possible to go out and enjoy yourself while having a healthy diet.\n\n**Be Aware of Portion Sizes**\n\nBe aware that the portion sizes at many restaurants are very large. Stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets. The temptation for overeating can be hard to resist at these places. Think and plan ahead.\n\n**Make Healthy Choices Ahead of Time**\n\nIf you know you are going out, check out the menu online so you can make healthy choices ahead of time.\n\n**Avoid Eating Out When You're Overly Hungry**\n\nAvoid eating out when you are overly hungry. Eat a small healthy snack, such as carrots or a small apple, shortly before going out.\n\n**Order Healthy Options**\n\nWhen ordering, do not be afraid to ask to have something cooked in a healthier manner such as baked or steamed instead of fried. You can also ask to have sauces served on the side.\n\n**Basic Ground Rules for Eating Out**\n\n* Look for and choose:\n\t+ Salads with dressing on the side\n\t+ Vegetable side dishes\n\t+ Foods that are broiled, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, or baked\n\t+ Chicken, turkey, seafood, or lean meats\n* Treat yourself only once in a while to:\n\t+ Anything creamy, fried, crispy, breaded, battered, or cheesy\n\t+ Sauces or soups with lots of butter, cream, or cheese\n\t+ Thick or creamy salad dressings\n\t+ Most casserole dishes\n\n**A Few Easy Tips to Keep the Calorie Count Down**\n\n* If you were serving yourself a healthy meal at home, half of your plate would be covered in non-starchy vegetables; if your entrée does not come with a vegetable, order one on the side so you can still make a healthy plate.\n* Avoid mindlessly eating foods such as chips, rolls, and bread just because they are on the table. You can ask the server to take these foods off the table.\n* Split a meal with someone, or ask for a take-out box and take half of your meal home.\n* Order the \"lunch size\" of any food rather than the \"dinner size.\"\n* Order healthy appetizers rather than an entree.\n* Start with a small salad or broth-based soup as an appetizer.\n* Order the dressing for your salad on the side so you can control how much of it you use.\n\n**Fast Food**\n\nTry these tips to limit calories when eating in fast food restaurants:\n\n* Choose a place that broils or grills hamburgers, fish, and chicken for their sandwiches.\n* Order your sandwich without cheese, mayo or \"special sauce.\"\n* Order only a sandwich. Avoid ordering the value or combo meal unless the restaurant offers healthy sides such as apple slices or a side salad.\n* Whether it is a sandwich, milkshake, or French fries, stay away from large sizes.\n* Order a salad instead of French fries.\n* Limit ketchup, barbeque sauce, and other condiments, as they often contain hidden sugars.\n\n**Pizza**\n\nPizza is OK but limit yourself to only one or two slices. Choose vegetable toppings such as peppers or spinach instead of sausage or pepperoni. Add a salad to your meal.\n\n**Healthy Eating at All Types of Restaurants**\n\n* Sandwich restaurants or deli counters allow you to better manage what you eat:\n\t+ Choose low-fat turkey, chicken, or ham.\n\t+ Be mindful of tuna and chicken salads which are often made with lots of high calorie mayonnaise.\n\t+ Replace extra meat and cheese with vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach.\n\t+ Ask for an open-faced sandwich. Ask for whole-grain bread rather than white bread.\n\t+ Replace high-calorie condiments like mayonnaise or creamy salad dressings with mustard or a small amount of olive oil and vinegar.\n* Chinese restaurants offer healthy choices:\n\t+ Most deep-fried options are high in calories. Instead, choose dishes that are steamed without added oil or sugar.\n\t+ Limit dishes made with sweet and sour, hoisin, gravy, or other heavy sauces, which are often high in calories.\n\t+ Choose low-fat dishes that are lightly stir-fried, such as brown rice and Chinese vegetables with seafood, chicken, or bean curd (tofu).\n\t+ Order a side of steamed vegetables to pair with your noodle or rice dish.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Out: A Guide to Healthy Choices**\n\nAs we discussed in our previous articles on weight loss and healthy eating, dining out can be a challenge for those looking to maintain a balanced diet. However, with some knowledge and planning, you can make healthier choices even when eating out.\n\n**Chinese Restaurants**\n\nWhen dining at Chinese restaurants, opt for dishes that are steamed without added oil or sugar. Limit deep-fried options, which are high in calories. Choose low-fat dishes that are lightly stir-fried, such as brown rice and Chinese vegetables with seafood, chicken, or bean curd (tofu). Order a side of steamed vegetables to pair with your noodle or rice dish.\n\nSome healthy choices include:\n\n* Wonton soup\n* Chicken skewer\n* Moo goo gai pan\n\n**Indian Restaurants**\n\nAt Indian restaurants, select foods that have chickpeas or lentils, vegetables, lean protein, and sauces made from yogurt. Good choices include:\n\n* Mulligatawny soup\n* Tandoori chicken\n* Chicken tikka\n* Kebabs\n* Whole-wheat naan bread\n* Lassi\n\nLimit fried foods, creamy curry sauces, cream sauces such as Korma or Makhani, and foods made with coconut milk or a clarified butter called ghee.\n\n**Italian Restaurants**\n\nWhen dining at Italian restaurants, pasta dishes with a red or marinara sauce are lower in calories and saturated fat than sauces made with cream, butter, cheese, or pesto. Look for the word \"primavera,\" which means that the menu item contains vegetables and will not include creamy sauce. Order dishes with seafood, grilled meat, fish, chicken, or vegetables.\n\nLimit lasagna, antipasto, alfredo sauce, and garlic bread. Limit fried or breaded dishes like chicken and eggplant parmesan or parmigiana. Watch out for large servings of pasta. Pair your pasta with a side salad so your meal is more balanced.\n\n**Mexican or Southwestern Restaurants**\n\nAt Mexican or Southwestern restaurants, choose foods that are not fried and have only a small amount of cheese. Guacamole is a healthier choice than sour cream, but be careful not to eat too large of a portion. Good choices include:\n\n* Gazpacho\n* Chicken with brown rice\n* Rice and black beans\n* Items that are baked or grilled\n\nLimit nachos, chips, and quesadillas.\n\n**Family Restaurants and Pub Food**\n\nWhen dining at family restaurants and pub food establishments, stick with grilled chicken and meats, or a pot roast or meatloaf. Limit foods, even vegetables, that are fried, breaded, au gratin (cheesy), or creamy. Order a small or medium-sized baked potato with a touch of butter or low-fat sour cream rather than French fries or mashed potatoes.\n\nSalads are a great idea, but avoid creamy dressings, along with toppings such as cheese or bacon. Ask for your dressing on the side so you can control how much you eat. Clear broth soups are most often lower in calories. Avoid thicker soups with cream or cheese in them.\n\n**Sandwich Restaurants or Deli Counters**\n\nAt sandwich restaurants or deli counters, choose low-fat turkey, chicken, or ham. Most cold cuts are high in sodium. Be mindful of tuna and chicken salads, which are often made with lots of high-calorie mayonnaise. Replace extra meat and cheese with vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach.\n\nAsk for an open-faced sandwich. Ask for whole-grain bread rather than white bread. Replace high-calorie condiments like mayonnaise or creamy salad dressings with mustard or a small amount of olive oil and vinegar. Ask that your bread be grilled or toasted without added butter.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Heart Association website.

    "content": "**Eating Right During Pregnancy**\n\nMaking a baby is hard work for a woman's body. Eating right is one of the best things you can do to help your baby grow and develop normally.\n\n**Benefits of a Balanced Diet**\n\nEating a balanced, healthy diet can help prevent:\n\n* Too much weight gain\n* Gestational diabetes\n* The chance of needing a C-section\n* Anemia and infections in the mother\n* Poor healing\n* An early birth of the baby\n* A low birth-weight baby\n\n**Weight Gain Guidelines**\n\nThe amount of healthy weight gain in pregnancy varies. These are general guidelines:\n\n* Normal total weight gain for a healthy woman is 25 to 35 pounds (11 to 16 kilograms).\n* Overweight women should gain only 10 to 20 pounds (4 to 9 kilograms) during pregnancy.\n* Underweight women should gain more (28 to 40 pounds or 13 to 18 kilograms) during pregnancy.\n* Women with multiples (twins or more) should gain 37 to 54 pounds (16.5 to 24.5 kilograms) during pregnancy.\n\nAsk your health care provider how much weight you should gain.\n\n**Eating for Two**\n\nEating for two does not mean eating twice as much food. Pregnant women need about 300 extra calories a day. But, where these calories come from matters.\n\nIf you eat sweets or junk food, the extra calories do not provide the nutrients your baby needs.\nAs a result, your growing baby will get the vitamins and minerals it needs from your own body. Your health could suffer.\n\nInstead of junk food, choose foods that are:\n\n* High in protein\n* Rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fats and lower in trans fats and saturated fats\n* Low in sugar (sugar provides only empty calories) or refined carbohydrates high in fiber\n\n**Essential Nutrients for Baby's Growth**\n\nOther nutrients your baby needs are:\n\n* Calcium, for healthy growth.\n* Iron, for the baby's blood supply. It also prevents anemia in the mother.\n* Folic acid, for reducing the risk for spina bifida (incomplete closing of the spinal column), anencephaly (defect of the brain), and other birth defects.\n\n**Recommended Daily Intake**\n\nFor most normal-weight pregnant women, the right amount of calories is:\n\n* About 1,800 calories per day during the first trimester\n* About 2,200 calories per day during the second trimester\n* About 2,400 calories per day during the third trimester\n\n**Food Groups and Servings**\n\nEat the following food groups daily:\n\n* Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta: 9 to 11 servings a day\n* Vegetables: 4 to 5 servings a day (at least 2 from green, leafy vegetables)\n* Fruit: 3 to 4 servings a day\n* Milk, yogurt, and cheese: 3 servings a day\n* Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts: 3 servings a day\n\n**Fats and Oils**\n\nYou need moderate amounts of fat in your diet for you and your growing baby. Fats provide long-term energy for growth and are needed for brain development.\n\n**Fluids and Vitamins**\n\nPregnant women should also drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinks with caffeine and sugar. Ask your provider how much fluid you should get each day.\n\nTake a prenatal vitamin that has folic acid, iron, and the other vitamins and minerals that all women need. Your provider may give you a prescription for vitamins. You can also get prenatal vitamins over-the-counter.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Right During Pregnancy**\n\nAs a pregnant woman, eating a balanced diet is one of the best things you can do to help your baby grow and develop normally. A healthy diet can prevent various complications during pregnancy, including too much weight gain, gestational diabetes, anemia, infections, poor healing, early birth, and low birth-weight babies.\n\n**Caloric Needs**\n\nPregnant women need about 300 extra calories a day. However, it's not about eating twice as much food; rather, it's about choosing the right foods that provide essential nutrients for your baby's growth. Focus on high-protein foods, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fats and lower in trans fats and saturated fats. Limit sugar and refined carbohydrates, opting for fiber-rich alternatives instead.\n\n**Essential Nutrients**\n\nEnsure you're getting enough of these vital nutrients:\n\n*   Calcium: crucial for healthy growth\n*   Iron: necessary for the baby's blood supply and prevents anemia in the mother\n*   Folic acid: reduces the risk for spina bifida, anencephaly, and other birth defects\n\n**Food Groups**\n\nIncorporate a variety of foods from each group into your diet:\n\n1.  **Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta**: Aim for 9 to 11 servings daily, choosing whole-grain and fortified products that contain folic acid and iron.\n2.  **Vegetables**: Consume 4 to 5 servings daily, with at least two from green, leafy vegetables.\n3.  **Fruit**: Enjoy 3 to 4 servings daily, selecting fresh fruits and juices over frozen or canned options.\n4.  **Milk, yogurt, and cheese**: Have 3 servings daily, opting for nonfat dairy products if calorie and cholesterol concerns arise.\n5.  **Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts**: Eat 3 servings daily, focusing on foods rich in B vitamins, protein, iron, and zinc.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n*   Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, avoiding sugary drinks with caffeine.\n*   Consult your healthcare provider about the ideal weight gain for your specific pregnancy.\n*   Consider taking a prenatal vitamin that includes folic acid, iron, and other essential vitamins and minerals.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Right During Pregnancy**\n\nPregnancy is a time of great change in a woman's body. As her belly grows, so do her nutritional needs. A well-balanced diet is crucial for both mother and baby.\n\n**Key Nutrients**\n\n*   Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats\n*   Low in sugar or refined carbohydrates high in fiber\n*   Calcium for healthy growth\n*   Iron for the baby's blood supply and to prevent anemia in the mother\n*   Folic acid to reduce the risk of spina bifida, anencephaly, and other birth defects\n\n**Caloric Needs**\n\nFor most normal-weight pregnant women, the right amount of calories is:\n\n*   About 1,800 calories per day during the first trimester\n*   About 2,200 calories per day during the second trimester\n*   About 2,400 calories per day during the third trimester\n\n**Food Groups**\n\n*   **Bread, Cereal, Rice, and Pasta**: Eat 9 to 11 servings a day. These foods give you carbohydrates, which turn into energy for your body and your baby's growth.\n*   **Vegetables**: Eat 4 to 5 servings a day. Vegetables are a good source of vitamins A and C, folic acid, iron, and magnesium. Try to get at least 2 of your daily servings from green, leafy vegetables.\n*   **Fruit**: Eat 3 to 4 servings a day. Fruit gives you vitamins A and C, potassium, and fiber. Choose fresh fruits and juices. They are better for you than frozen or canned fruits.\n*   **Milk, Yogurt, and Cheese**: Eat 3 servings a day. Dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus. If you need to limit calories and cholesterol, choose nonfat dairy products.\n*   **Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts**: Eat 3 servings a day. Foods from this group are good sources of B vitamins, protein, iron, and zinc.\n\n**Fats and Oils**\n\nYou need moderate amounts of fat in your diet for you and your growing baby. Fats provide long-term energy for growth and are needed for brain development. Women with special diet needs should plan their meals carefully to make sure they get the nutrition they need. Talk to your provider or a dietitian if you have a special diet, such as vegetarian or vegan, lactose intolerant, or gluten-free.\n\n**Fluids and Vitamins**\n\nPregnant women should also drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinks with caffeine and sugar. Ask your provider how much fluid you should get each day.\n\nYou should also take a prenatal vitamin that has folic acid, iron, and the other vitamins and minerals that all women need. Your provider may give you a prescription for vitamins. You can also get prenatal vitamins over-the-counter.\n\n**Food Cravings**\n\nThough no one knows why, many pregnant women have cravings for certain foods. It may be because of hormone changes. These cravings will often pass after the first 3 months.\n\nAs long as you are getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby, it is fine to have some of the foods you crave every now and then.\n\nSometimes, pregnant women will get strange cravings for things that are not food, such as dirt, clay, laundry detergent, or ice chips. This is called pica, and it may be caused by too little iron in the blood, which leads to anemia. Let your provider know if you have these cravings.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Right During Pregnancy**\n\nAs long as you are getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby, it is fine to have some of the foods you crave every now and then.\n\nStrange cravings for things that are not food, such as dirt, clay, laundry detergent, or ice chips, may be caused by too little iron in the blood, which leads to anemia.

    "content": "**Ebola Virus Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Ebola?**\n\nEbola is a severe and often deadly disease caused by a virus. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding, and often, death.\n\n**Where does Ebola occur?**\n\nEbola can occur in humans and other primates (gorillas, monkeys, and chimpanzees). The Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in March 2014 was the largest hemorrhagic viral epidemic in history. Of the people who developed Ebola in this outbreak, 71% died.\n\n**How common is Ebola?**\n\nThe virus poses a very low risk to people in the United States.\n\n**For more information:**\n\nVisit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website at www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola for the most up-to-date information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Causes**\n\t+ WHERE EBOLA OCCURS\n\t\t- Ebola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\t\t- Since then, several small outbreaks have occurred in Africa. The 2014 outbreak was the largest.\n\t\t- The countries most affected in this outbreak included Equitorial Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.\n\t+ HOW EBOLA CAN SPREAD\n\t\t- Ebola does not spread as easily as more common illnesses such as colds, the flu, or measles.\n\t\t- There is no evidence that the virus that causes Ebola is spread through the air or water.\n\t\t- A person who has Ebola can't spread the disease until symptoms appear.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Symptoms**\n\t+ The time between exposure and when symptoms occur (incubation period) is 2 to 21 days. On average, symptoms develop in 8 to 10 days.\n\t+ Early symptoms of Ebola include fever greater than or equal to 100.4°F (38.0°C), severe headache, sore throat, joint pain, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, rash, abdominal (stomach) pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and red eyes.\n\t+ Late symptoms include bleeding from the mouth and rectum, bleeding from eyes, ears, and nose, and organ failure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Treatment**\n\t+ There is no known cure for Ebola. Experimental treatments have been used, but none have been fully tested to see if they work well and are safe.\n\t+ People with Ebola must be treated in a hospital. There, they can be isolated so the disease cannot spread. Health care providers will treat the symptoms of the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Prevention**\n\t+ A vaccine (Ervebo) is available to prevent Ebola virus disease in people who live in the most at-risk countries during an outbreak.\n\t+ If you plan to travel to one of the countries where Ebola is present, the CDC recommends taking the following steps to prevent illness:\n\t\t- Practice careful hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid contact with blood and body fluids.\n\t\t- Avoid contact with people who have a fever, are vomiting, or appear ill.\n\t\t- Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.

The countries most affected in this outbreak included:\n\n* Equitorial Guinea\n* Liberia\n* Sierra Leone\n\nEbola has been previously reported in:\n\n* Nigeria\n* Senegal\n* Spain\n* United States\n* Mali\n* United Kingdom\n* Italy\n\nFor the latest information on Ebola worldwide, visit the World Health Organization website at www.who.int/health-topics/ebola#tab=tab_1.\n\n**How Ebola Can Spread**\n\nEbola does not spread as easily as more common illnesses such as colds, the flu, or measles. There is no evidence that the virus that causes Ebola is spread through the air or water. A person who has Ebola can't spread the disease until symptoms appear.\n\nEbola can only spread between humans by direct contact with infected body fluids including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen. The virus can enter the body through a break in the skin or through mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nEbola can also spread by contact with any surfaces, objects, or materials that have been in contact with body fluids from a sick person, such as:\n\n* Bedclothes and bedding\n* Clothing\n* Bandages\n* Needles and syringes\n* Medical equipment\n\nIn Africa, Ebola may also be spread by:\n\n* Handling infected wild animals hunted for food (bushmeat)\n* Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals\n* Contact with infected bats\n\nEbola does not spread through:\n\n* Air\n* Water\n* Food\n* Insects (mosquitoes)\n\nHealth care workers and people caring for sick relatives are at high risk for developing Ebola because they are more likely to come in to direct contact with body fluids. The proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) greatly reduces this risk.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe time between exposure and when symptoms occur (incubation period) is 2 to 21 days. On average, symptoms develop in 8 to 10 days.\n\nEarly symptoms of Ebola include:\n\n* Fever greater than or equal to 100.4°F (38.0°C)\n* Severe headache\n* Sore throat\n* Joint pain\n* Muscle pain\n* Weakness\n* Fatigue\n* Loss of appetite\n* Rash\n* Abdominal (stomach) pain\n* Diarrhea\n* Vomiting\n* Red eyes\n* Hiccups\n\nLate symptoms include:\n\n* Bleeding from the mouth and rectum\n* Bleeding from eyes, ears, and nose\n* Organ failure\n\nA person who does not have symptoms 21 days after being exposed to Ebola will not develop the disease.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known cure for Ebola. Experimental treatments have been used, but none have been fully tested to see if they work well and are safe.\n\nPeople with Ebola must be treated in a hospital. There, they can be isolated so the disease cannot spread. Health care providers will treat the symptoms of the disease.\n\nTreatment for Ebola is supportive and includes:\n\n* Fluids given through a vein (IV)\n* Oxygen\n* Blood pressure management\n* Treatment for other infections\n* Blood transfusions\n\nSurvival depends on how a person's immune system responds to the virus. A person also may be more likely to survive if they receive good medical care.\n\nPeople who survive Ebola are immune from the virus for 10 years or more. They can no longer spread Ebola. It is not known whether they can be infected with a different species of Ebola. However, men who survive can carry the Ebola virus in their sperm for as long as 3 months. They should abstain from sex or use condoms until their semen has tested negative for the virus.\n\nLong-term complications can include joint and vision problems.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have traveled to West Africa and:\n\n* Know you have been exposed to Ebola\n* You develop symptoms of the disorder, including fever\n\nGetting treatment right away may improve the chances of survival.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nA vaccine (Ervebo) is available to prevent Ebola virus disease in people who live in the most at-risk countries during an outbreak. If you plan to travel to one of the countries where Ebola is present, the CDC recommends taking the following steps to prevent illness:\n\n* Practice careful hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid contact with blood and body fluids.\n* Avoid contact with people who have a fever, are vomiting, or appear ill.\n* Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids. This includes clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment.\n* Avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who has died from Ebola.\n* Avoid contact with bats and nonhuman primates or blood, fluids, and raw meat prepared from these animals.\n* Avoid hospitals in West Africa where Ebola patients are being treated. If you need medical care, the United States embassy or consulate is often able to provide advice about facilities.\n* After you return, pay attention to your health for 21 days. Seek medical care right away if you develop symptoms of Ebola, such as a fever. Tell your provider that you have been to a country where Ebola is present.\n\nHealth care workers who may be exposed to people with Ebola should follow these steps:\n\n* Wear PPE, including protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, and eye protection.\n* Practice proper infection control and sterilization measures.\n* Isolate patients with Ebola from other patients.\n* Avoid direct contact with the bodies of people who have died from Ebola.\n* Notify health officials if you have had direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola.\n\n---\n\n**Ebola Virus Disease**\n\n**WHERE EBOLA OCCURS**\n\nEbola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It can be spread from an infected animal to a human, and then from human to human through direct contact with:\n\n* Blood and body fluids of people who are sick\n* Semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen\n* Items that could be contaminated with blood or body fluids from someone who has Ebola\n* Bats, forest antelopes, and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), including their blood, fluids, or meat\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The average is about 8 to 10 days. The symptoms usually include:\n\n* Fever\n* Diarrhea\n* Vomiting\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Loss of appetite\n* Unexplained bleeding or bruising\n\nOther symptoms may include a rash, red eyes, and hiccups.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other more common diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. If a person has the symptoms of Ebola and may have been exposed to the virus, the health care provider can do a blood test for Ebola. It can take a few days after the symptoms start before Ebola shows up in the blood test.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn the United States, there are two approved medicines to treat Ebola that is caused by one specific type of virus (Zaire ebolavirus). These medicines have not been evaluated to treat Ebola caused by other types of Ebola viruses. The medicines are monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins that are created in the lab.\n\nWhether or not there are medicines to treat a case of Ebola, there is supportive care. This type of care can improve the chances of survival, especially when given early. Supportive care includes:\n\n* Giving fluids and electrolytes\n* Giving medicines to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain\n* Giving oxygen\n* Treating any other complications or infections\n\nPeople who recover may still have side effects afterwards, such as fatigue, muscle aches, eye and vision problems, and stomach pain.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIn the United States, there is one vaccine that has been approved to prevent Ebola caused by one specific type of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus). It may be given to health care providers who will be or may be treating Ebola patients and people who work with live Ebola virus in labs.\n\nIf you live in or plan to travel to a region where Ebola virus may be present, you can help protect yourself by avoiding contact with:\n\n* Blood and body fluids of people who are sick\n* Semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen\n* Items that could be contaminated with blood or body fluids from someone who has Ebola\n* Bats, forest antelopes, and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), including their blood, fluids, or meat\n\n---\n\n**Ebola**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Ebola?**\n\nEbola virus disease, also known as Ebola, is a rare and deadly viral illness caused by the Ebola virus.

    "content": "**Ebstein Anomaly**\n\n**What is Ebstein anomaly?**\n\nEbstein anomaly is a rare heart defect in which parts of the tricuspid valve are abnormal. The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium). In people with Ebstein anomaly, the positioning of the tricuspid valve and how it functions to separate the two chambers is abnormal.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe tricuspid valve is normally made of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. The leaflets open to allow blood to move from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. They close to prevent blood from moving from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.\n\nIn people with Ebstein anomaly, the leaflets are placed deeper into the right ventricle instead of the normal position. The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way. Instead of flowing out to the lungs, the blood flows back into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve).\n\nIn many cases, people also have a hole in the wall separating the heart's two upper chambers (atrial septal defect) and blood flow across this hole may cause oxygen-poor blood to go to the body. This can cause cyanosis, a blue tint to the skin caused by oxygen-poor blood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe abnormality can be slight or very severe. Therefore, the symptoms can also range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can develop soon after birth, and can include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels. In severe cases, the baby appears very sick and has trouble breathing. In mild cases, the affected person may be asymptomatic for many years, sometimes even permanently.\n\nSymptoms in older children may include:\n\n* Cough\n* Failure to grow\n* Fatigue\n* Rapid breathing\n* Shortness of breath\n* Very fast heartbeat\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider may hear abnormal heart sounds, such as a murmur, when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.\n\nTests that can help diagnose this condition include:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart\n* Measurement of the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram or ECG)\n* Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the severity of the defect and the specific symptoms. Medical care may include:\n\n* Medicines to help with heart failure, such as diuretics.\n* Oxygen and other breathing support.\n* Surgery to correct the valve.\n* Replacement of the tricuspid valve.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn general, the earlier symptoms develop, the more severe the disease.\n\nSome people may have either no symptoms or very mild symptoms. Others may worsen over time, developing blue coloring (cyanosis), heart failure, heart block, or dangerous heart rhythms.\n\nPossible Complications:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n* Blood clots from the heart to other parts of the body\n* Brain abscess\n\n---\n\n**Ebstein Anomaly**\n\n_Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart defect in which parts of the tricuspid valve are abnormal._\n\n**What is Ebstein Anomaly?**\n\nEbstein anomaly is a congenital heart defect where the positioning and functioning of the tricuspid valve, separating the right lower heart chamber (right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium), is abnormal.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of Ebstein anomaly is unknown. However, certain drugs used during pregnancy, such as lithium or benzodiazepines, may play a role in its development.

The infection is also called hydatid disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Echinococcosis**\n\nHumans become infected when they swallow the tapeworm eggs in contaminated food. The eggs then form cysts inside the body. A cyst is a closed pocket or pouch. The cysts keep growing, which leads to symptoms.\n\n*   **E granulosus**: An infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs and livestock such as sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. These tapeworms are around 2 to 7 mm long. The infection is called cystic echinococcosis (CE). It leads to growth of cysts mainly in the lungs and liver. Cysts can also be found in the heart, bones, and brain.\n*   **E multilocularis**: An infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs, cats, rodents, and foxes. These tapeworms are around 1 to 4 mm long. The infection is called alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is a life-threatening condition because tumor-like growths form in the liver. Other organs, such as the lungs and brain can be affected.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risk Factors for Echinococcosis**\n\nChildren or young adults are more prone to get the infection.\n\nEchinococcosis is common in:\n\n*   Africa\n*   Central Asia\n*   Southern South America\n*   The Mediterranean\n*   The Middle East\n\nIn rare cases, the infection is seen in the United States. It has been reported in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n\nRisk factors include being exposed to:\n\n*   Cattle\n*   Deer\n*   Feces of dogs, foxes, wolves, or coyotes\n*   Pigs\n*   Sheep\n*   Camels\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Echinococcosis**\n\nCysts may produce no symptoms for 10 years or more.\n\nAs the disease advances and the cysts get larger, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Pain in the upper right part of the abdomen (liver cyst)\n*   Increase in size of the abdomen due to swelling (liver cyst)\n*   Bloody sputum (lung cyst)\n*   Chest pain (lung cyst)\n*   Cough (lung cyst)\n*   Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) when cysts break open\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests for Echinococcosis**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\n\nIf the provider suspects CE or AE, tests that may be done to find the cysts include:\n\n*   X-ray, echocardiogram, CT scan, PET scan, or ultrasound to view the cysts\n*   Blood tests, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), liver function tests\n*   Fine needle aspiration biopsy\n\nMost often, echinococcosis cysts do not cause symptoms and are found when an imaging test is done for another reason.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Echinococcosis**\n\nMany people can be treated with anti-worm medicines.\n\nA procedure that involves inserting a needle through the skin into the cyst may be tried. The contents of the cyst are removed (aspirated) through the needle. Then medicine is sent through the needle to kill the tapeworm. This treatment is not for cysts in the lungs.\n\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for cysts that are large, infected, or located in organs such as the heart and brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Echinococcosis**\n\nIf the cysts respond to oral medicines, the likely outcome is good.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional about Echinococcosis**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Echinococcosis**\n\nMeasures to prevent CE and AE include:\n\n*   Staying away from wild animals including foxes, wolves, and coyotes\n*   Avoiding contact with stray dogs\n*   Washing hands well after touching pet dogs or cats, and before handling food\n\n---\n\n**Echinococcosis**\n\nEchinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is an infection caused by either the Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis tapeworm.\n\n**Causes**\n\nHumans become infected when they swallow the tapeworm eggs in contaminated food.

An echocardiogram does not expose you to radiation.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are two types of echocardiograms: Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE).\n\n*   **TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TTE)**\n\n    TTE is the type of echocardiogram that most people will have.\n\n    A specially trained technician called a sonographer performs the test. A heart doctor (cardiologist) interprets the results.\n\n    An instrument called a transducer is placed on various locations on your chest and upper abdomen and directed toward the heart. This device releases high-frequency sound waves.\n\n    The transducer picks up the echoes of sound waves and transmits them as electrical impulses. The echocardiography machine converts these impulses into moving pictures of the heart. Still pictures are also taken.\n\n    Images can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional. The type of image will depend on the part of the heart being evaluated and the type of machine.\n\n    A Doppler echocardiogram evaluates the motion of blood through the heart.\n\n    An echocardiogram shows the heart while it is beating. It also shows the heart valves and other structures.\n\n    In some cases, your lungs, ribs, air, or body tissue may prevent the sound waves and echoes from providing a clear picture of heart function. If this is a problem, the health care provider may inject a small amount of liquid (contrast) through an IV to better see the inside of the heart.\n\n    Rarely, more invasive testing using special echocardiography probes may be needed.\n\n*   **TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TEE)**\n\n    For a TEE, the back of your throat is numbed and a long flexible but firm tube (called a \"probe\") which has a small ultrasound transducer at the end is inserted down your throat.\n\n    A heart doctor with special training will guide the scope down the esophagus and into the stomach. This method is used to get clearer echocardiographic images of your heart. The doctor may use this test to look for signs of infection (endocarditis) blood clots (thrombi), or other abnormal structures or connections.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special steps are needed before a TTE test. If you are having a TEE, you will not be able to eat or drink for several hours before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nDuring the test:\n\nYou will need to take off your clothes from the waist up and lie on an exam table on your back.\n\nElectrodes will be placed on your chest to monitor your heart beat.\n\nA small amount of gel is spread on your chest and the transducer will be moved over your skin. You will feel a slight pressure on your chest from the transducer.\n\nYou may be asked to breathe in a certain way or to roll over onto your left side. Sometimes, a special bed is used to help you stay in the proper position.\n\nIf you are having a TEE, you will receive some sedating (relaxing) medicines prior to having the probe inserted and a numbing fluid may be sprayed in the back of your throat.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to evaluate the valves and chambers of your heart and the sac around your heart (pericardium) from the outside of your body. The echocardiogram can help detect:\n\nAbnormal heart valves\n\nCongenital heart disease (abnormalities present at birth)\n\nDamage to the heart muscle from a heart attack\n\nHeart murmurs\n\nInflammation (pericarditis) or fluid in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion)\n\nInfection on or around the heart valves (infectious endocarditis)\n\nPulmonary hypertension\n\nAbility of the heart to pump (for people with heart failure)\n\nYour provider may recommend a TEE if:\n\nThe images from a TTE are unclear. Unclear results may be due to the shape of your chest, lung disease, or excess body fat.\n\nAn area of the heart needs to be looked at in more detail.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal echocardiogram reveals normal heart valves and chambers and normal heart wall movement.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal echocardiogram can mean many things. Some abnormalities are very minor and do not pose major risks. Other abnormalities are signs of serious heart disease. You will need more tests by a specialist in this case. It is very important to talk about the results of your echocardiogram with your provider.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no known risks from an external TTE test.\n\nTEE is an invasive procedure. There is some risk associated with the test. These may include:\n\nReaction to the sedating medicines.\n\nDamage to the esophagus. This is more common if you already have a problem with your esophagus.\n\nTalk with your provider about the risks associated with this test.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAbnormal results may indicate:\n\nHeart valve disease\n\nCardiomyopathy\n\nPericardial effusion\n\nOther heart abnormalities\n\nThis test is used to evaluate and monitor many different heart conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Echocardiogram**\n\nAn echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart.

If this is a problem, the health care provider may inject a small amount of liquid (contrast) through an IV to better see the inside of the heart.\n\nRarely, more invasive testing using special echocardiography probes may be needed.\n\n*\\*TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TEE)\\***\n\nFor a TEE, the back of your throat is numbed and a long flexible but firm tube (called a \"probe\") which has a small ultrasound transducer at the end is inserted down your throat.\n\n---\n\n**Echocardiogram**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Echocardiogram?**\n\nAn echocardiogram is a medical test that uses sound waves to create images of your heart. It can help detect problems with your heart valves, chambers, and sac (pericardium).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Echocardiograms**\n\n* **Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE)**: A TEE is a more invasive test that uses a probe inserted down the throat to get clearer images of your heart.\n* **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)**: A TTE is the most common type of echocardiogram, where a probe is placed on your chest to create images of your heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\n* For a TTE test, no special steps are needed before the test.\n* If you're having a TEE, you won't be able to eat or drink for several hours before the test.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nDuring the test:\n\n* You'll need to take off your clothes from the waist up and lie on an exam table on your back.\n* Electrodes will be placed on your chest to monitor your heartbeat.\n* A small amount of gel will be spread on your chest, and the transducer will be moved over your skin. You may feel a slight pressure on your chest from the transducer.\n* If you're having a TEE, you'll receive sedating medicines prior to having the probe inserted, and a numbing fluid may be sprayed in the back of your throat.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to evaluate the valves and chambers of your heart and the sac around your heart (pericardium) from the outside of your body. The echocardiogram can help detect:\n\n* Abnormal heart valves\n* Congenital heart disease (abnormalities present at birth)\n* Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack\n* Heart murmurs\n* Inflammation (pericarditis) or fluid in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion)\n* Infection on or around the heart valves (infectious endocarditis)\n* Pulmonary hypertension\n* Ability of the heart to pump (for people with heart failure)\n* Source of a blood clot after a stroke or TIA\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal echocardiogram reveals normal heart valves and chambers and normal heart wall movement.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn abnormal echocardiogram can mean many things. Some abnormalities are very minor and do not pose major risks. Other abnormalities are signs of serious heart disease. You will need more tests by a specialist in this case. It is very important to talk about the results of your echocardiogram with your provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no known risks from an external TTE test.\n\nTEE is an invasive procedure. There is some risk associated with the test. These may include:\n\n* Reaction to the sedating medicines.\n* Damage to the esophagus. This is more common if you already have a problem with your esophagus.\n\nTalk with your provider about the risks associated with this test.\n\n---\n\n**Echocardiogram**\n\nAn echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It's used to evaluate and monitor various heart conditions.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThere is some risk associated with the test, including:\n\n*   Invasive procedure\n*   Some risk associated with the test\n\nTalk with your provider about the risks associated with this test.\n\n**Abnormal Results May Indicate:**\n\nHeart valve disease\nCardiomyopathy\nPericardial effusion\nOther heart abnormalities\n\nThis test is used to evaluate and monitor many different heart conditions.\n\n**Alternative Names:**\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE); Echocardiogram - transthoracic; Doppler ultrasound of the heart; Surface echo\n\n**Images:**\n\n*Circulatory system*\n\n**References:**\n\nOtto CM.

    "content": "**Ectopic Cushing Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nCushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One of the causes is if there is too much of the hormone ACTH in the blood. ACTH is usually made by the pituitary in small amounts and then signals the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Sometimes other cells outside the pituitary can make large amounts of ACTH. This is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. Ectopic means that something is occurring in an abnormal place in the body.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nEctopic Cushing syndrome can cause a lot of different symptoms. Some people have many symptoms while others have only a few.

Your provider will instruct you about signs to watch for until your next visit.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nEctopic pregnancy may be life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term). Effective treatment requires either medical treatment to end the pregnancy or surgical removal of the pregnancy.\n\nIf the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include:\n\n*   Surgery\n*   Medicine that ends the pregnancy, along with close monitoring by your provider\n\nYou will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock. Treatment for shock may include:\n\n*   Blood transfusion\n*   Fluids given through a vein\n*   Keeping warm\n*   Oxygen\n*   Raising the legs\n\nIf there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the surgeon may have to remove the fallopian tube.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf diagnosed early, treatment is very effective. It's important to seek early care whenever you believe you may be pregnant so your provider may determine the location of the pregnancy.\n\nOne out of three women who have had one ectopic pregnancy can have a baby in the future.

It most often affects the lower eyelid.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Ectropion is very often caused by the aging process. The connective (supporting) tissue of the eyelid becomes weak.\n*   A defect that occurs before birth (for example, in children with Down syndrome)\n*   Facial muscle weakness\n*   Scar tissue from burns or injuries\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Dry, painful eyes\n*   Excess tearing of the eye (epiphora)\n*   Eyelid turns outward (downward)\n*   Long-term (chronic) conjunctivitis\n*   Keratitis\n*   Redness of the lid and white part of the eye\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will make a diagnosis by doing an exam of the eyes and eyelids. Special tests are not needed most of the time.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nArtificial tears (a lubricant) may ease dryness and keep the cornea moist. Ointment may be helpful when the eye can't close all of the way, such as when you are asleep.\n\nSurgery is very often effective. When ectropion is related to aging or paralysis, the surgeon can tighten the muscles that hold the eyelids in place. If the condition is due to scarring of the skin, a skin graft or laser treatment may be used. The surgery is most often done in the office or at an outpatient surgery center. A medicine is used to numb the area (local anesthesia) before the surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome is very often good with treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCorneal dryness and irritation may lead to:\n\n*   Corneal abrasions\n*   Corneal ulcers\n*   Eye infections\n\nCorneal ulcers can cause vision loss.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nMake an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ectropion.\n\nIf you have ectropion, get emergency medical help if you have:\n\n*   Vision that is getting worse\n*   Pain\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Eye redness that is getting worse quickly\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost cases cannot be prevented.

    "content": "**Edaravone Oral**\n\n*pronounced as (e dar' a vone)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEdaravone is used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; a condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken). Edaravone is in a class of medications called antioxidants. It may work to slow the nerve damage associated with the worsening of ALS symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEdaravone comes as a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth or through a feeding tube. It is usually taken in the morning on an empty stomach. If you have eaten a high-fat meal (800-1000 calories, 50% fat) the night before, you should wait at least 8 hours after eating to take edavarone. If you have eaten a low-fat meal (400-500 calories, 25% fat), you should wait at least 4 hours after eating to take edavarone. If you have eaten a meal supplement such as a protein drink (250 calories), you should wait at least 2 hours before taking edavarone.\n\nTake edaravone at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take edaravone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nInitially, it is usually given once a day for the first 14 days of a 28-day cycle. After the first cycle, it is given once a day for the first 10 days of a 28-day cycle. Your doctor will decide how often you are to receive edaravone based on your body's response to this medication.\n\nBefore opening the bottle, turn edaravone upside down and shake vigorously for at least 30 seconds. The dose of edaravone should only be measured with the oral syringe that comes with it. Edaravone oral suspension can also be placed in nasogastric (NG) or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes made of silicone or PVC. After administering edaravone through a feeding tube, the feeding tube should be flushed with at least 1 ounce (30 mL) of water using a catheter-tip syringe.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Edaravone Oral: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving edaravone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to edaravone, any other medications, sodium bisulfite, or any of the ingredients in edaravone suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements, you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while receiving edaravone, call your doctor.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nEdaravone may cause side effects.

Efavirenz is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Lamivudine and tenofovir are in a class of medications called nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the body. Although efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nContinue to take efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir even if you feel well.

    "content": "**Ehrlichiosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nEhrlichiosis is caused by bacteria that belong to the family called rickettsiae. Rickettsial bacteria cause a number of serious diseases worldwide, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus. All of these diseases are spread to humans by a tick, flea, or mite bite.\n\nScientists first described ehrlichiosis in 1990. There are two types of the disease in the United States:\n\n*   Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the rickettsial bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis.\n*   Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). It is caused by the rickettsial bacteria called Anaplasma phagocytophilum.\n\nEhrlichia bacteria can be carried by the:\n\n*   American dog tick\n*   Deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which can also cause Lyme disease\n*   Lone Star tick\n\nIn the United States, HME is found mainly in the southern central states and the Southeast. HGE is found mainly in the Northeast and upper Midwest.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nLiving near an area with a lot of ticks, owning a pet that may bring a tick home, or walking or playing in high grasses are all risk factors for ehrlichiosis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe incubation period between the tick bite and when symptoms occur is about 7 to 14 days. Symptoms may seem like the flu (influenza), and may include:\n\n*   Fever and chills\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Nausea\n\nOther possible symptoms are diarrhea, fine pinhead-sized areas of bleeding into the skin (petechial rash), flat red rash (maculopapular rash), which is uncommon, and general ill feeling (malaise).\n\nA rash appears in fewer than one third of cases. Sometimes, the disease may be mistaken for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if the rash is present. The symptoms are often mild, but people are sometimes sick enough to see a health care provider.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will do a physical exam and check your vital signs, including:\n\n*   Blood pressure\n*   Heart rate\n*   Temperature\n\nOther tests include:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Granulocyte stain\n*   Indirect fluorescent antibody test\n*   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood sample\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics (tetracycline or doxycycline) are used to treat the disease. Children should not take tetracycline by mouth until after all their permanent teeth have grown in, because it can permanently change the color of growing teeth. Doxycycline that is used for 2 weeks or less usually does not discolor a child's permanent teeth. Rifampin has also been used in people who cannot tolerate doxycycline.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEhrlichiosis is rarely deadly. With antibiotics, people usually improve within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery may take up to 3 weeks.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nUntreated, this infection may lead to:\n\n*   Coma\n*   Death (rare)\n*   Kidney damage\n*   Lung damage\n*   Other organ damage\n*   Seizure\n\nIn rare cases, a tick bite can lead to more than one infection (co-infection). This is because ticks can carry more than one type of organism. Two such co-infections are:\n\n*   Lyme disease\n*   Babesiosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria\n\n---\n\n**Ehrlichiosis**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nEhrlichiosis is caused by bacteria that belong to the family called rickettsiae.

Sometimes, the disease may be mistaken for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if the rash is present.\n\n**Incubation Period**\n\nThe incubation period between the tick bite and when symptoms occur is about 7 to 14 days.\n\n**Symptoms Similar to Flu**\n\nSymptoms may seem like the flu (influenza), and may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Nausea\n* Diarrhea\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will do a physical exam and check your vital signs, including:\n\n* Blood pressure\n* Heart rate\n* Temperature\n\nOther tests include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Granulocyte stain\n* Indirect fluorescent antibody test\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood sample\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics (tetracycline or doxycycline) are used to treat the disease. Children should not take tetracycline by mouth until after all their permanent teeth have grown in, because it can permanently change the color of growing teeth.\n\nDoxycycline that is used for 2 weeks or less usually does not discolor a child's permanent teeth. Rifampin has also been used in people who cannot tolerate doxycycline.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEhrlichiosis is rarely deadly. With antibiotics, people usually improve within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery may take up to 3 weeks.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nUntreated, this infection may lead to:\n\n* Coma\n* Death (rare)\n* Kidney damage\n* Lung damage\n* Other organ damage\n* Seizure\n\nIn rare cases, a tick bite can lead to more than one infection (co-infection). This is because ticks can carry more than one type of organism. Two such co-infections are:\n\n* Lyme disease\n* Babesiosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you become sick after a recent tick bite or if you have been in areas where ticks are common. Be sure to tell your provider about the tick exposure.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nEhrlichiosis is spread by tick bites. Measures should be taken to prevent tick bites, including:\n\n* Wear long pants and long sleeves when walking through heavy brush, tall grass, and thickly wooded areas.\n* Pull your socks over the outside of pants to prevent ticks from crawling up your leg.\n* Keep your shirt tucked into your pants.\n* Wear light-colored clothes so that ticks can be spotted easily.\n* Spray your clothes with insect repellent.\n* Check your clothes and skin often while in the woods.\n\nAfter returning home:\n\n* Remove your clothes. Look closely at all skin surfaces, including scalp. Ticks can quickly climb up the length of your body.\n* Some ticks are large and easy to locate. Other ticks can be quite small, so carefully look at all black or brown spots on your skin.\n* If possible, ask someone to help you examine your body for ticks.\n* An adult should examine children carefully.\n\nStudies suggest that a tick must be attached to your body for at least 24 hours to cause disease. Early removal may prevent infection.\n\nIf you are bitten by a tick, write down the date and time the bite happened. Bring this information, along with the tick (if possible), to your provider if you become sick.\n\n---\n\n**Ehrlichiosis**\n\nIf you are bitten by a tick, write down the date and time the bite happened.

    "content": "**Eight Ways to Cut Your Health Care Costs**\n\nThe cost of health care continues to rise. That's why it helps to learn how to take steps to limit your out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nLearn how to save money and still receive the care you need. Start by looking at your health insurance plan information so you know what services are available. Try the tips below to help you get the most from your benefits and save money on your care.\n\n**1. Save Money on Medicines**\n\nThere are a few ways to cut costs on your medicines:\n\n* Ask your health care provider if you can switch to generic medicines. They have the same active ingredient, but cost less than brand name medicines.\n* Ask your provider if there is a less expensive medicine that treats the same condition.\n* See if you can order your medicine through the mail.\n* Take all of your medicines as directed. Not taking your medicine or not taking enough medicine may lead to further health problems.\n\n**2. Use Your Benefits**\n\nGet routine health screenings. These tests can catch health problems early, when they may be more easily treated. And you often do not have to pay a copay or coinsurance for health screenings, vaccines, and annual wellness visits.\n\n* Get prenatal care if you are pregnant. This is the best way to ensure you and your baby will be healthy.\n* Some health plans offer health advocates or case managers. A health advocate can help you get the most of your benefits. A case manager can help you to manage complex health problems such as diabetes or asthma.\n* Use free and discounted services. Many health plans offer discounts on things like gym memberships or eyewear.\n\n**3. Plan Ahead for Urgent and Emergency Care**\n\nWhen an illness or injury occurs, you need to decide how serious it is and how soon to get medical care. This will help you choose whether to call your provider, go to an urgent care clinic, or get emergency care.\n\n* You can decide where to get care by thinking about how quickly you need care.\n* If a person or fetus could die or have permanent harm, it is an emergency. Examples include chest pain, trouble breathing, or severe pain or bleeding.\n* If you need care that cannot wait until the next day to see your provider, you need urgent care. Examples of urgent care include strep throat or a dog bite.\n\nYou will save both time and money if you use an urgent care center or see your provider rather than going to the emergency department. Plan ahead by knowing which urgent care center is near you. Also, learn how to recognize an emergency in adults and in children.\n\n**4. Ask About Outpatient Facilities**\n\nIf you need a procedure or surgery, ask your provider if you can have it done at an outpatient clinic. Often, getting care at a clinic is cheaper than having the same procedure in a hospital.\n\n**5. Choose In-Network Health Care Providers**\n\nDepending on your health coverage, you may have the choice to see providers who are in-network or out-of-network. You pay less to see providers who are in-network because they have a contract with your health plan. This means they charge lower rates.\n\n**6. Take Care of Your Health**\n\nA simple way to save money on health care is to stay healthy. Of course, that's sometimes easier said than done. But staying at a healthy weight, getting regular exercise, and not smoking or using alcohol excessively lowers your risk for health problems. Staying healthy helps you avoid costly tests and treatments for ongoing conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.\n\n**7. Choose a Health Plan That is Right for You**\n\nWhen choosing a plan, think about the health needs of you and your family. If you pick a plan with higher premiums, more of your health costs will be covered. This may be a good idea if you have a health problem, such as diabetes, and need regular care. If you rarely need medical care, then you may want to choose a plan with a higher deductible. You will pay lower monthly premiums and likely save money overall. Also compare prescription medicine coverage.\n\n**8. Use a Health Care Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA)**\n\nMany employers offer an HSA or FSA. These are savings accounts that allow you to set aside pre-tax money for health care expenses. This can help you save several hundred dollars per year. HSAs are owned by you, earn interest, and can be transferred to a new employer. FSAs are owned by your employer, do not earn interest, and must be used within the calendar year.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Board of Internal Medicine (AMBI) Foundation website.

During the exam, the provider may find:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\n* Enlarged ends of the fingers or toes (clubbing)\n* Heart murmur (an extra sound when listening to the heart)\n\nThe provider will diagnose Eisenmenger syndrome by looking at the person's history of heart problems. Tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity in the heart\n* MRI scan of the heart\n* Putting a thin tube in an artery to view the heart and blood vessels and measure pressures (cardiac catheterization)\n* Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSurgery as early as possible to correct the heart defect can prevent Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the affected person does depends on whether another medical condition is present, and the age at which high blood pressure develops in the lungs.

It's usually caused by a congenital heart defect, such as a hole in the heart or an abnormality of the heart valves.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n* Fatigue\n* Blue lips and fingers (cyanosis)\n* Clubbing of the fingers and toes\n* Heart murmur\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe provider will diagnose Eisenmenger syndrome by looking at the person's history of heart problems. Tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity in the heart\n* MRI scan of the heart\n* Putting a thin tube in an artery to view the heart and blood vessels and measure pressures (cardiac catheterization)\n* Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAffected people may receive oxygen, although it is unclear if it helps to prevent the disease from getting worse. In addition, medicines that work to relax and open the blood vessels may be given. People with very severe symptoms may eventually need a heart-lung transplant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the affected person does depends on whether another medical condition is present, and the age at which high blood pressure develops in the lungs. People with this condition can live 20 to 50 years.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain\n* Congestive heart failure\n* Gout\n* Heart attack\n* Hyperviscosity (sludging of the blood because it is too thick with blood cells)\n* Infection (abscess) in the brain\n* Kidney failure\n* Poor blood flow to the brain\n* Stroke\n* Sudden death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nSurgery as early as possible to correct the heart defect can prevent Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Eisenmenger Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nEisenmenger syndrome, also known as complex cyanotic congenital heart disease, is a condition where the body \"steals\" oxygen from other parts of the body to supply the lungs. This occurs due to a congenital heart defect that leads to pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n*   Pale skin\n*   Clubbing (enlargement) of the fingers and toes\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Eisenmenger syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n*   Medications to reduce pulmonary hypertension\n*   Oxygen therapy\n*   Surgery to correct the underlying heart defect (in some cases)\n*   Lifestyle modifications to prevent fatigue and shortness of breath\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Eisenmenger syndrome is generally poor, with a median survival rate of 5 years after diagnosis. However, with proper management and treatment, some individuals may live longer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects\n*   Pulmonary Hypertension",

    "content": "**Elagolix: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nElagolix is used to manage pain due to endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body and causes infertility, pain before and during menstrual periods, pain during and after sexual activity, and heavy or irregular bleeding). Elagolix is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nElagolix comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once daily for up to 24 months or twice daily for up to 6 months. Take elagolix at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take elagolix exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe or recommend a calcium and vitamin D supplement to take during your treatment. You should take these supplements as directed by your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking elagolix, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to elagolix, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in elagolix tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune) or gemfibrozil (Lopid). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take elagolix if you are taking one of these medications.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with elagolix. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with elagolix. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting elagolix with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\nTell your doctor if you have osteoporosis (condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily), or if you have or have ever had liver disease. Your doctor may tell you not to take elagolix.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had broken bones, depression, anxiety, unusual changes in behavior or mood, or thoughts about or attempted suicide.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Do not take elagolix if you are pregnant or think you are pregnant. Your doctor will perform a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment or tell you to begin your treatment within 7 days after you start your menstrual period to be sure that you are not pregnant when you taking elagolix.\n\nElagolix may interfere with the action of certain hormonal contraceptives, so you should not use these as your only method of birth control during your treatment. You will need to use a reliable non-hormonal method of birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment and for 1 week after your final dose. Ask your doctor to help you choose a method of birth control that will work for you.\n\nIf you become pregnant while taking elagolix, call your doctor immediately. Elagolix may harm the fetus.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking elagolix. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n---\n\n**Elagolix: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Interactions with Other Medications**\n\n*   Take elagolix if you are taking one of these medications.\n*   Some medications should not be taken with elagolix.

    "title": "Elastography: MedlinePlus Medical Test",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/elastography/",
    "content": "**Elastography**\n\nElastography is a type of imaging test that checks your organs to see if they are stiffer than normal. Stiff areas in your organs may be a sign of disease. Elastography is mainly used to check the liver for stiffness. Stiff areas in the liver are a sign of scar tissue (fibrosis) caused by liver disease.\n\n**Liver Fibrosis**\n\nLiver fibrosis happens when certain diseases damage the liver over time. When the liver tries to heal, it forms more scar tissue. Many conditions that cause ongoing or repeated liver damage can lead to liver fibrosis. Conditions that commonly cause fibrosis include:\n\n* Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B. These liver diseases are caused by viruses.\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD can cause alcohol-associated liver disease, which includes the buildup of too much fat in the liver. The fat can cause liver inflammation (swelling) which damages liver tissue.\n* Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This type of fat buildup often happens in people who have diabetes, obesity, and/or high levels of cholesterol in their blood. It is not from drinking too much alcohol.\n\n**How Elastography Works**\n\nThere are two types of liver elastography tests:\n\n* Ultrasound elastography is also called transient elastography. An ultrasound device uses sound waves to send vibrations into your liver. The device measures how fast the vibrations move through your liver. If you have areas of stiff liver tissue, the vibrations will move faster through that area. A computer uses the measurements to make an image that shows any stiffness in your liver tissue, which is a sign of fibrosis.\n* MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) sends vibrations into your liver that are measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a procedure that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create images of organs and structures inside the body. In an MRE test, a computer program makes a map that shows any stiff areas of your liver.\n\n**What is Elastography Used For?**\n\nLiver elastography is used to check for liver fibrosis (scarring). It may be used instead of a liver biopsy, which involves removing a piece of liver tissue for testing.\n\nThe information from an elastography test can help:\n\n* Diagnose liver conditions in people who have a high risk for liver disease\n* Show how serious liver disease is\n* Guide treatment choices for liver disease\n* Monitor how well treatment for liver disease is working\n* Help predict the chance that liver disease will cause certain serious problems\n* Check how much fat is in the liver\n\n**Who Needs an Elastography Test?**\n\nYou may need an elastography test to check for liver fibrosis (scarring) if you:\n\n* Have liver disease and your health care provider needs information to guide treatment choices.\n* Have had other liver tests that show you may have inflammation or damage in your liver.\n* Are more likely to develop cirrhosis (severe liver scarring). Conditions that increase your risk for cirrhosis include:\n\t+ Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n\t+ Type 2 diabetes\n\t+ Chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B or C\n\t+ Certain autoimmune diseases or genetic disorders\n\t+ Long-term use of certain medicines\n\n**What Happens During an Elastography Test?**\n\nAn ultrasound elastography is often done by a radiology technician, who is a health care professional trained to do imaging tests. Sometimes a radiologist does the test. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using medical imaging tests to diagnose medical conditions.\n\nAn elastography test is quick and usually includes these steps:\n\n* You'll remove clothing covering your right abdomen (belly) to expose the skin over your liver.\n* You'll lie on a table and the technician will spread a special gel on your skin.\n* The technician will hold a wand-like device, called a transducer, and move it across your skin.\n* You'll hold your breath for 10 to 15 seconds while the device sends a series of vibrations into your liver. You may feel the device pulse against your skin, but it doesn't hurt.\n* The vibrations will travel through your liver and \"bounce\" back to the device which sends the information to a computer.\n* The computer makes an image of your liver showing any areas of stiff tissue and other signs of liver disease.\n\nMRE (magnetic resonance elastography) is done with an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. During an MRE procedure:\n\n* You'll lie on a narrow exam table.\n* The technician will place some small devices on your lower right abdomen. One device, called a \"driver,\" will send painless vibrations into your liver. The other devices send and receive radio waves to a computer.\n* The table will slide into a large tunnel-like MRI machine. You will hear loud noises as the machine takes pictures. You may be given earplugs or headphones to block the noise.\n* Inside the MRI, you'll be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 15 seconds when the vibrations are going through your liver.\n* The computer will make images of your liver that show any scarring and/or other signs of liver disease.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for a liver elastography. In general, it's best to wear a loose-fitting shirt or sweater that you can easily pull up. You may be told to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test.\n\nIf you're having an MRE, you'll need to remove all metal from your body. If you have any medical devices or metal inside your body let your provider know. The scanner can heat metal and cause burns.\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere are no known risks to having an ultrasound elastography. There is little risk to having an MRE for most people. If being inside a small space makes you nervous, tell your provider before your test. Your provider may give you medicine to help you relax. If you are or could be pregnant, let your provider know.\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nYour elastography images will be studied by a radiologist, who will send your results to your provider. Your results will show how much stiffness was found in your liver. This tells you how much liver scarring (fibrosis) you have. Your results will be given a fibrosis score which is based on the amount of stiffness in your liver and the cause:\n\n* F0 to F1 is normal, which means you have little or no scarring in your liver.\n* F2 means you have moderate scarring.\n* F3 means you have severe scarring.\n* F4 means you have cirrhosis (very severe scarring).\n\n---\n\n**What is Elastography?**\n\nElastography is a type of imaging test that checks your organs to see if they are stiffer than normal.

The measurement of fat in your liver is called a \"CAP score.\" It tells you the percentage of your liver that is fat.\n\n**What to Do After an Elastography Test**\n\nIf you have mild to severe fibrosis and/or fatty liver disease, your condition can improve if you treat the cause and make lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. If you have cirrhosis, treating the cause may keep liver scarring from getting worse. Successful treatment may slowly improve some of the scarring.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Elastography: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What is Elastography?**\n\nElastography is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to measure the stiffness of your liver, which can help diagnose various liver conditions.\n\n**When is Elastography Used?**\n\nElastography may be used to:\n\n* Diagnose cirrhosis and other liver diseases\n* Evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis\n* Monitor the effectiveness of treatment for liver disease\n\n**What Can Affect the Accuracy of an Elastography Test?**\n\nCertain conditions can affect the accuracy of an elastography test, including:\n\n* An illness or drinking alcohol\n* Tumors in your liver\n* Obesity\n* Abnormal fluid buildup in your abdomen (belly)\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Liver Foundation.

    "content": "**Elbasvir and Grazoprevir**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir is used alone or in combination with ribavirin (Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere, Virazole) to treat a certain type of chronic (long-term) hepatitis C infection (swelling of the liver caused by a virus) in adults and children 12 years of age or older. Elbasvir is in a class of antiviral medications called HCV NS5A inhibitors. It works by stopping the virus that causes hepatitis C from spreading inside the body. Grazoprevir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou may already be infected with hepatitis B (a virus that infects the liver and may cause severe liver damage) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, taking the combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious or life-threatening and you will develop symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have or ever had a hepatitis B virus infection. Your doctor will order a blood test to see if you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of hepatitis B infection during and for several months after your treatment. If necessary, your doctor may give you medication to treat this infection before and during your treatment with the combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake elbasvir and grazoprevir at around the same time every day.

    "content": "**Elbow Replacement - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery to replace your elbow joint with artificial joint parts (prosthetics).\n\nThe surgeon made a cut (incision) in the back of your upper or lower arm and removed damaged tissue and parts of the bones. The surgeon then put the artificial joint in place and closed the skin with sutures (stitches).\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nWhile in the hospital, you should have received pain medicine. You also learned how to manage swelling around your new joint.\n\nYour surgeon or physical therapist may have taught you exercises to do at home.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\n* Your elbow area may feel warm and tender for 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.\n* The swelling should go down during this time.\n* For the first week after surgery, you may have a soft splint on your arm to hold your elbow in place. After the incision has healed, you may need to use a harder splint or brace that has a hinge.\n* Arrange for someone to help with chores such as shopping, bathing, making meals, and housework for up to 6 weeks.\n* You may want to make some changes around your home so it is easier for you to take care of yourself.\n\n**Activity**\n\nHow much you can use your arm and when you can start using it will depend on the condition of your new elbow.

If you have pain or problems with your incision when you do this, you may be bending the elbow too much and need to stop.\n* Reduce soreness after physical therapy by putting ice on the joint for 15 minutes. Wrap the ice in a cloth. Do not put the ice directly on the skin because this can cause frostbite.\n\n**Pain**\n\nPain is normal after elbow replacement surgery. It should get better over time.\n\nYour surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine. After surgery, get it filled when you go home so that you have it when you need it.

Keep the dressing (bandage) over your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing every day if you like.\n\nDo not shower until after your follow-up appointment with your surgeon. Your surgeon will tell you when you can begin taking showers. When you do start showering again, let the water run over the incision, but do not let the water beat down on it.

Be sure to ask the surgeon what limits you may have.\n\nThe surgeon will recommend that you go to physical therapy to help you gain strength and use of your arm:\n\nIf you have a splint, you may need to wait a few weeks to start therapy.\nBefore starting physical therapy, ask your surgeon if you should begin to increase movement in your elbow by gently bending it back and forth. If you have pain or problems with your incision when you do this, you may be bending the elbow too much and need to stop.\nReduce soreness after physical therapy by putting ice on the joint for 15 minutes. Wrap the ice in a cloth. Do not put the ice directly on the skin because this can cause frostbite.\n\nAfter the first week, you may be able to use your splint only while sleeping. Ask your surgeon if this is OK. You will need to avoid carrying anything or pulling items even when your splint is off.\n\nBy 6 weeks, you should be able to slowly increase daily activities to help make your elbow and arm stronger.\n\nAsk your surgeon or physical therapist how much weight you can lift.\nYou may also need to do range-of-motion exercises for your shoulder and spine.\n\nBy 12 weeks, you should be able to lift more weight. Ask your surgeon or physical therapist what other activities you can do at this point. Your new elbow will likely have some limitations.\n\nMake sure you know the proper way to use your elbow before you start any activity or move your arm for any reason. Ask your surgeon or physical therapist if you can:\n\nLift things heavier than 5 to 15 pounds (2.3 to 6.8 kilograms) for the rest of your life\nPlay golf or tennis, or throw objects (such as a ball) for the rest of your life\nDo any activities that make you lift your elbow over and over, such as shoveling or shooting a basketball\nDo jamming or pounding activities, such as hammering\nDo impact sports, such as boxing or football\nDo physical activities that need quick stop and start motions or twisting with your elbow\nPush or pull heavy objects\n\n---\n\n**Elbow Replacement - Discharge**\n\nYou likely have some limitations.\n\nMake sure you know the proper way to use your elbow before you start any activity or move your arm for any reason.

Your surgeon will tell you when you can begin taking showers. When you do start showering again, let the water run over the incision, but do not let the water beat down on it. Do not scrub it.\n\nDo not soak the wound in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool for at least the first 3 weeks.\n\n**Pain**\n\nPain is normal after elbow replacement surgery. It should get better over time.\n\nYour surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine. After surgery, get it filled when you go home so that you have it when you need it. Take the pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it allows the pain to get worse than it should.\n\nIbuprofen or another anti-inflammatory medicine may also help. Ask your surgeon what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine. Follow instructions exactly on how to take your medicines.\n\nNarcotic pain medicine (codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone) can make you constipated. If you are taking them, drink plenty of fluids, and eat fruits and vegetables and other high-fiber foods to help keep your stools from becoming too hard.\n\nDo not drink alcohol or drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine.
