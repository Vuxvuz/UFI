    "content": "**Bumetanide**\n\n*pronounced as (byoo met' a nide)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBumetanide is used to treat edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) caused by various medical problems, including heart, kidney, and liver disease. Bumetanide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBumetanide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day. When used to treat edema, a second or third dose may be given every 4 to 5 hours depending on the amount of swelling. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bumetanide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nBumetanide controls edema but does not cure it. Continue to take bumetanide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bumetanide without talking to your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nBumetanide is also sometimes used to treat high blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nThis medicine is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking bumetanide, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bumetanide, sulfonamide medications, any other medications, or any ingredients in bumetanide tablets.

    "content": "**Bunion Removal**\n\n**What is Bunion Removal?**\n\nBunion removal is surgery to treat deformed bones of the big toe and foot. A bunion occurs when the big toe points outward toward the second toe, forming a bump on the inner side of the foot.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou will be given anesthesia (numbing medicine) so that you won't feel pain.\n\n*   **Local Anesthesia**: Your foot may be numbed with pain medicine. You may also be given medicines that relax you. You will stay awake.\n*   **Spinal Anesthesia**: The pain medicine is injected into a space in your spine. You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist.\n*   **Regional Anesthesia**: The pain medicine is injected into your leg. It will numb your lower leg and foot. You may still require general anesthesia to make you sleep through the procedure. However, the amount of anesthesia needed is much less as you cannot feel your leg during surgery.\n*   **General Anesthesia**: You will be asleep and pain-free.\n\nThe surgeon makes a cut around the toe joint and bones. The deformed joint and bones are lined up using pins, screws, plates, or a splint to keep the bones in place.\n\n**How is Bunion Removal Performed?**\n\nThe surgeon may repair the bunion by:\n\n*   Making certain tendons or ligaments shorter or longer\n*   Taking out the damaged part of the joints and then using screws, wires, or a plate to hold the joint together so that they can fuse\n*   Shaving off the bump on the toe joint\n*   Removing the damaged part of the joint\n*   Cutting parts of the bones on each side of the toe joint, and then putting them in their proper position\n\n**Why is Bunion Removal Performed?**\n\nYour health care provider may recommend this surgery if you have a bunion that has not gotten better with other treatments, such as shoes with a wider toe box. Bunion surgery corrects the deformity and relieves pain caused by the bump.\n\n**Risks of Bunion Removal**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of bunion surgery include:\n\n*   Numbness in the big toe.\n*   The wound does not heal well.\n*   The surgery does not correct the problem.\n*   Instability of the toe.\n*   Nerve damage.\n*   Persistent pain.\n*   Stiffness in the toe.\n*   Arthritis in the toe.\n*   Worse appearance of the toe.\n\n**Before Bunion Removal**\n\nTell your provider and surgeon what medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen, (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve).\n*   Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see your provider who treats you for these conditions.\n*   Tell your surgeon if you have been drinking more than 1 or 2 servings of alcohol each day.\n*   If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing.\n*   Tell your surgeon if you get sick with a cold, flu, herpes infection, or other illness before your surgery.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n*   Follow instructions for not eating and drinking before the procedure.\n*   Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Arrive on time at the hospital or surgery center.\n\n---\n\n**Bunion Removal: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n\\n\\n**Preparation**\n\nBefore the procedure:\n\n*   Tell your provider and surgeon what medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n*   During the week before your surgery:\n    *   You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot.

    "content": "**Bunion**\n\nA bunion, known technically as hallux valgus, is a bony bump on the side of the foot at the base of the big toe.\n\n**Description**\n\nBunions develop slowly as pressure on the joint at the base of the big toe causes the toe to move out of place, leaning inward toward the second toe. Because this joint carries a lot of weight during activities like standing and walking, bunions can cause foot pain, stiffness, redness, and swelling. Calluses may form where the big toe and second toe rub together or on the ball of the foot.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nBunions are a very common foot disorder, affecting about a third of adults in the United States. The prevalence of bunions increases with age. They are more common in women than in men, likely because of differences in foot anatomy, footwear, and genetic influences.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of bunions are unclear, although scientists suspect that both inherited and lifestyle factors contribute to their development. Studies suggest that congenital and juvenile hallux valgus tend to be related to joint deformities with a genetic cause. Little is known about the genetic contribution to bunions that occur later in life, and no specific genes involved in the development of bunions have been identified.\n\nFor bunions that appear in adulthood, inherited factors related to the shape and structure of the foot and the way the foot moves (foot mechanics) likely influence a person's risk of developing the condition. It has long been suggested that wearing ill-fitting shoes are another significant risk factor, specifically shoes that are too tight, shoes with high heels, or shoes with a narrow toe box.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly fitting shoes probably do not cause bunions, but they may make bunions develop earlier or worsen more quickly in people with an underlying susceptibility. Other risk factors for bunions include inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis), osteoarthritis, and flat feet (pes planus). Bunions are also a feature of several rare genetic syndromes that affect bone development, including Chitayat syndrome and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\n\n---\n\n**Bunion: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n*   Ill-fitting shoes, particularly those that are too tight, have high heels, or a narrow toe box\n*   Inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Flat feet (pes planus)\n*   Rare genetic syndromes affecting bone development, including Chitayat syndrome and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva\n\n**Causes of Bunions**\n\nThe causes of bunions are unclear, but both inherited and lifestyle factors contribute to their development. Studies suggest that congenital and juvenile hallux valgus tend to be related to joint deformities with a genetic cause.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nBunions are a complex condition without a clear pattern of inheritance. Many affected individuals have multiple family members who are also affected. The risk of developing bunions is greater for first-degree relatives of affected individuals (such as siblings or children) compared to the general public. When bunions occur as part of a genetic syndrome, this feature follows the inheritance pattern of the syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Bunion of great toe\n*   Hallux abductovalgus\n*   Hallux valgus\n*   HAV\n*   HV\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n*   PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Bunion: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/3)**\n\n\\n\\n* **Hallux Valgus**: Ankle Surgeons.

Some genetic conditions may have a good prognosis with proper treatment and management, while others may be more challenging to manage.\n\n\\n\\n* **Gene Variants and Health**: Gene variants can affect health and development in various ways, such as by causing inherited disorders or influencing susceptibility to certain diseases. Understanding the role of gene variants in health and disease is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n\\n\\n* **Family History and Genetic Disorders**: If a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component. However, the presence of a family history does not necessarily mean that you will develop the condition. Many factors contribute to the development of genetic disorders, including environmental influences and random chance.\n\n\\n\\n* **Inheritance Patterns of Genetic Conditions**: Genetic conditions can be inherited in various ways, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive patterns. Understanding the inheritance pattern of a specific disorder is crucial for predicting the risk of transmission to offspring and for making informed reproductive choices.\n\n\\n\\n* **Treatment and Management of Genetic Conditions**: The treatment and management of genetic conditions depend on the specific disorder, its severity, and the presence of any associated health problems. A multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare providers, genetic counselors, and other specialists may be necessary to develop an effective treatment plan.",

    "content": "**Bunions**\n\nA bunion forms when your big toe points outward toward your second toe. This causes a bump to appear on the inside edge of your toe.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Bunions are more common in women than men.\n* The problem can run in families.\n* People born with abnormal alignment of the bones in their feet are more likely to form a bunion.\n* Wearing narrow-toed, high-heeled shoes may lead to the development of a bunion.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Red, thickened skin along the inside edge at the base of the big toe.\n* A bony bump at the first toe joint, with decreased movement in the toe.\n* Pain over the joint, which pressure from shoes makes worse.\n* Big toe turned outward toward the other toes and may cross over the second toe. As a result, corns and calluses often develop where the first and second toes overlap.\n* Difficulty wearing regular shoes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA health care provider can very often diagnose a bunion by looking at it. A foot x-ray can show an abnormal angle between the big toe and the foot. In some cases, arthritis may also be seen.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen a bunion first begins to develop, you can do the following to care for your feet:\n\n* Wear wide-toed shoes. This can often solve the problem and prevent you from needing more treatment.\n* Wear felt or foam pads on your foot to protect the bunion, or devices called spacers to separate the first and second toes. These are available at drugstores.\n* Try cutting a hole in a pair of old, comfortable shoes to wear around the house.\n* Talk to your provider about whether you need inserts to correct flat feet.\n* Stretch the calf muscle of your leg to have better alignment of your feet.\n* If the bunion gets worse and more painful, surgery may help. The surgery called bunionectomy realigns the toe and removes the bony bump.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou can keep a bunion from worsening by taking care of it. Try to wear different shoes when it first starts to develop.\n\nTeenagers may have more trouble treating a bunion than adults. This may be the result of an underlying bone problem or growth changes.\n\nSurgery reduces the pain in many, but not all people with bunions. After surgery, you may not be able to wear tight or fashionable shoes.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if the bunion:\n\n* Continues to cause pain, even after self-care such as wearing wide-toed shoes\n* Prevents you from doing your usual activities\n* Has any signs of infection (such as redness or swelling), especially if you have diabetes\n* Worsening pain that is not relieved by rest\n* Prevents you from finding a shoe that fits\n* Causes stiffness and loss of movement in your big toe\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoid compressing the toes of your foot with narrow, poor-fitting shoes.\n\n---\n\n**Bunions**\n\nA bunion forms when your big toe points outward toward your second toe. This causes a bump to appear on the inside edge of your toe.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Bunions are more common in women than men.\n*   The problem can run in families.\n*   People born with abnormal alignment of the bones in their feet are more likely to form a bunion.\n*   Wearing narrow-toed, high-heeled shoes may lead to the development of a bunion.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Red, thickened skin along the inside edge at the base of the big toe.\n*   A bony bump at the first toe joint, with decreased movement in the toe.\n*   Pain over the joint, which pressure from shoes makes worse.\n*   Big toe turned outward toward the other toes and may cross over the second toe. As a result, corns and calluses often develop where the first and second toes overlap.\n*   Difficulty wearing regular shoes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA health care provider can very often diagnose a bunion by looking at it. A foot x-ray can show an abnormal angle between the big toe and the foot. In some cases, arthritis may also be seen.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen a bunion first begins to develop, you can do the following to care for your feet:\n\n*   Wear wide-toed shoes. This can often solve the problem and prevent you from needing more treatment.\n*   Wear felt or foam pads on your foot to protect the bunion, or devices called spacers to separate the first and second toes. These are available at drugstores.\n*   Try cutting a hole in a pair of old, comfortable shoes to wear around the house.\n*   Talk to your provider about whether you need inserts to correct flat feet.\n*   Stretch the calf muscle of your leg to have better alignment of your feet.\n\nIf the bunion gets worse and more painful, surgery may help. The surgery called bunionectomy realigns the toe and removes the bony bump. There are more than 100 different surgeries to treat this condition. Please discuss with your surgeon which type can help you and why.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou can keep a bunion from worsening by taking care of it. Try to wear different shoes when it first starts to develop.\n\nTeenagers may have more trouble treating a bunion than adults. This may be the result of an underlying bone problem or growth changes.\n\nSurgery reduces the pain in many, but not all people with bunions. After surgery, you may not be able to wear tight or fashionable shoes.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if the bunion:\n\n*   Continues to cause pain, even after self-care such as wearing wide-toed shoes\n*   Prevents you from doing your usual activities\n*   Has any signs of infection (such as redness or swelling), especially if you have diabetes\n*   Worsening pain that is not relieved by rest\n*   Prevents you from finding a shoe that fits\n*   Causes stiffness and loss of movement in your big toe\n\n---\n\n**Bunions**\n\n**What is a bunion?**\n\nA bunion is a bony growth that forms on the joint at the base of your big toe. It's a common condition that can cause pain and discomfort.\n\n**Symptoms of bunions**\n\n* Worsening pain that is not relieved by rest\n* Prevents you from finding a shoe that fits\n* Causes stiffness and loss of movement in your big toe\n\n**When to contact your provider**\n\nContact your provider if the bunion:\n\n* Is causing severe pain or discomfort\n* Is preventing you from performing daily activities\n* Is accompanied by swelling, redness, or warmth around the affected area\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent bunions, avoid compressing the toes of your foot with narrow, poor-fitting shoes. This can put pressure on the joint and cause it to become misshapen.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHallux valgus\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you have a bunion, there are several things you can do to manage the pain and discomfort:\n\n* Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes\n* Use shoe inserts or orthotics to reduce pressure on the affected area\n* Apply ice packs or heat to the affected area to reduce pain and inflammation\n* Consider surgery if the bunion is severe and causing significant pain or discomfort\n\n**Images**\n\n*Bunion removal - series*\n\n**References**\n\nGreisberg JK, Vosseller JT.

    "content": "**Buprenorphine Sublingual and Buccal (opioid dependence)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBuprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat opioid dependence (addiction to opioid drugs, including heroin and narcotic painkillers). Buprenorphine is in a class of medications called opioid partial agonist-antagonists and naloxone is in a class of medications called opioid antagonists. Buprenorphine alone and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone work to prevent withdrawal symptoms when someone stops taking opioid drugs by producing similar effects to these drugs.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBuprenorphine comes as a sublingual tablet. The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone comes as a sublingual tablet (Zubsolv) and as a sublingual film (Suboxone) to take under the tongue or to apply between the gum and cheek.\n\n*   To help you remember to take or apply buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone, take or apply it around the same time every day.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take or apply buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone exactly as directed. Do not take or apply more or less of it or take or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may decide to start your treatment for opioid dependence with buprenorphine, which you will take in the doctor's office. You will start on a low dose of buprenorphine and your doctor may increase your dose for 1 or 2 days before switching you to buprenorphine and naloxone. Depending on the type of opioid that you were taking, a different option that your doctor may choose is to start you on treatment with buprenorphine and naloxone right away. Your doctor may increase or decrease your buprenorphine and naloxone dose depending on your response.\n\nIf you are taking the sublingual tablets, place the tablets under your tongue until they completely melt. If you are taking more than two tablets, either place them all under your tongue at the same time or place them under your tongue up to two at a time. Do not chew the tablets or swallow them whole. Do not eat, drink, or talk until the tablet dissolves completely.\n\nIf you are using the buccal film, rinse your mouth with water before you apply the film. Apply the film with a dry finger against the inside of the cheek. Then remove your finger and the film will stick to the inside of your cheek. If you are to use two films, place another film on the inside of your other cheek at the same time. Do not apply films on top of each other and do not apply more than two films to the inside of the mouth at one time. Leave the film(s) in the mouth until they dissolve. Do not cut, tear, chew, swallow, touch or move the film while it dissolves. Do not eat or drink anything until the film dissolves completely.\n\nIf you are using the sublingual film, rinse your mouth with water before you place the film. Place the film with a dry finger under your tongue to the right or left of the center and hold the film in place for 5 seconds. If you are using two films, place the other one on the opposite side under the tongue. Do not put the films on top of or near each other or let them touch each other. Do not use more than two films at one time. Do not cut, tear, chew, swallow, touch or move the film while it dissolves. Do not eat or drink anything until the film dissolves completely.\n\nAfter the sublingual tablets or sublingual or buccal film have dissolved, take a sip of water, swish it around your teeth and gums, and then swallow. Do not brush your teeth for at least one hour after the tablets or film have dissolved.\n\nIf you need to switch from one buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone product to another, your doctor may need to adjust your dose. Each time you receive your medication, check to be sure that you have received the buprenorphine product that was prescribed for you. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure that you received the right medication.\n\nDo not stop taking buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone without talking to your doctor. Stopping buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone too quickly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor will tell you when and how to stop taking buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone. If you suddenly stop taking buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as hot or cold flushes, restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, sweating, chills, muscle pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThere are no other uses for this medication that have been approved by the FDA.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Buprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone may cause drowsiness. If you experience drowsiness, do not drive or operate machinery.\n*   Do not take buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no special dietary instructions for this medication.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBuprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone may cause the following side effects:\n\n*   Dizziness\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Constipation\n*   Fatigue\n*   Insomnia\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Irritability\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone.\n\nDispose of unused buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone by flushing it down the toilet.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone, seek medical attention immediately. Symptoms of overdose may include:\n\n*   Dizziness\n*   Confusion\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Fainting\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBuprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone are available only by prescription.\n\nDo not give buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone to anyone else.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n*   Your doctor may start you on a low dose buprenorphine patch and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days.\n*   If this increase involves the use of two patches, remove your current patch and at the same time, place the two new patches next to each other at a new site.\n*   If your doctor tells you to use two patches, you should always change and apply them at the same time.\n\n**Important Instructions**\n\n*   Do not stop using buprenorphine patches without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n*   If you suddenly stop using buprenorphine patches you may have symptoms of withdrawal.\n*   Do not use a buprenorphine patch that is cut, damaged, or changed in any way.\n*   If your buprenorphine patch is exposed to extreme heat, it may release too much medication into your body at once.\n\n**Applying the Patch**\n\n1.  Clean the area where you plan to apply the patch with clear water and pat completely dry.\n2.  Use scissors to cut open the pouch containing the buprenorphine patch along the dotted line.\n3.  Remove the patch from the pouch and peel off the protective liner from the back of the patch.\n4.  Immediately press the sticky side of the patch onto the chosen area of skin with the palm of your hand.\n5.  Press the patch firmly for at least 15 seconds.\n\n**Removing the Patch**\n\n*   When it is time to change your patch, peel off the old patch and apply a new patch to a different skin area.\n*   After you remove your patch, use the Patch Disposal Unit provided to you by the manufacturer to safely dispose of the used patch in the trash.\n\n---\n\n**Buprenorphine Transdermal Patch Instructions**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Important:** Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   **Application:** Apply buprenorphine patches exactly as directed.\n\n**Dosing Information**\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose buprenorphine patch and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days.

Do not place patches in your mouth or chew or swallow the patches.\n\nDo not use a buprenorphine patch that is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. If you use cut or damaged patches, you may receive most or all of the medication at once, instead of slowly over 7 days. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death.\n\nIf your buprenorphine patch is exposed to extreme heat, it may release too much medication into your body at once. This can cause serious or life-threatening symptoms. Do not expose your patch or the skin around it to direct heat such as heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds. Do not take long, hot baths or sunbathe while you are wearing the patch.\n\nYou may bathe or shower while you are wearing a buprenorphine patch. If the patch falls off during these activities, dispose of it properly. Then dry your skin completely and apply a new patch.\n\n**Patch Placement**\n\nYou can apply a buprenorphine patch to your upper outer arms, upper chest, upper back, or the side of your chest. Choose an area of skin that is flat and hairless. Do not apply the patch to parts of the body that are irritated, broken, cut, damaged, or changed in any way. If there is hair on the skin, use scissors to clip the hair as close to the skin as possible. Do not shave the area.\n\nWait at least 3 weeks before applying a new patch to the same site.\n\n**Patch Disposal**\n\nAfter you remove your patch, use the Patch Disposal Unit provided to you by the manufacturer to safely dispose of the used patch in the trash. Close the Patch Disposal Unit by folding the sticky sides together, then press firmly and smoothly over the entire Unit so that the patch is sealed within. Do not place used patches in the trash without first sealing them in the Patch Disposal Unit.\n\nAlternatively, you may also fold the sticky sides of a used patch together and flush it down the toilet. Used patches may still contain some medication and may be dangerous to children, pets, or adults who have not been prescribed buprenorphine patches.\n\n---\n\n**Using Your Buprenorphine Patch**\n\nYou may bathe or shower while you are wearing a buprenorphine patch.

It also occurs in the United States.\n* The African type of BL is closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the main cause of infectious mononucleosis. The North American form of BL is not commonly linked to EBV.\n* People with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk for this condition. BL is most often seen in males.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* BL may first be noticed as a swelling of the lymph nodes (glands) in the head and neck. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.\n* In the types commonly seen in the United States, the cancer often starts in the belly area (abdomen). The disease can also start in the ovaries, testes, brain, kidneys, liver, and spinal fluid.\n* Other general symptoms may include:\n\t+ Fever\n\t+ Night sweats\n\t+ Unexplained weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

    "content": "**Burn Evaluation**\n\nA burn evaluation is an exam that health care providers do to find out how serious a burn is. The evaluation is done to estimate:\n\n* How deep into the skin the burn goes\n* How much of the skin is burned\n\nThis information helps providers decide how to treat a burn. You can often treat minor burns at home. But if you've been badly burned, you may need care in a hospital or a special burn center.\n\n**What Happens During a Burn Evaluation?**\n\nIn the case of serious burn injuries, the burn victim is first checked for life-threatening conditions that must be managed right away. These include breathing and blood pressure problems, and other injuries. Clothing will be removed to make sure hot substances and/or chemicals don't continue to cause burns.\n\nWhen a burn victim is in stable condition, a provider will begin a burn evaluation, which includes two steps:\n\n1. **Figuring Out the Degree of the Burn**\n\nThe first step of a burn evaluation is figuring out the degree of the burn. This means checking to see how far into the skin the burn goes. Burns are grouped into three main types depending on how deep they are:\n\n* First-degree burns (superficial) damage only the outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis.\n* Second-degree burns (partial thickness) damage the outer layer of skin and the layer underneath, called the dermis.\n* Third-degree burns (full-thickness) damage or completely destroy the entire thickness of the skin.\n\n2. **Estimating How Much of the Body is Burned**\n\nThe second step of a burn evaluation estimates how much of the body is burned. This estimate is a percentage of the person's total body surface area (TBSA) that has second-degree or deeper burns. First-degree burns are not included in this estimate.\n\nThere are different ways to estimate the percentage of the body that is burned:\n\n* The \"rule of nines\" divides the body into sections that equal about 9% or 18% of the total body surface area.\n* The Lund-Browder chart is the most accurate way to estimate the percentage of the body that's burned, especially for children.\n* The palmar surface or palm method is used in adults and children.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nTo understand the results of a burn evaluation, a provider will also consider the part of the body that's burned, the cause of the burn, and the health of the person with the burn. All of this information helps decide whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe.\n\nThe seriousness of the burn guides treatment decisions. Your provider can explain whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe and why.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Minor burns usually don't require hospitalization and they heal well.\n* Moderate burns may require a stay in the hospital, but they usually don't need treatment in a burn center.\n* Severe burns require special care at a burn center.\n\n---\n\n**Burn Evaluation**\n\nA burn evaluation is an exam that health care providers do to find out how serious a burn is.\n\n**What is a Burn?**\n\nA burn is damage to your skin and/or other tissues that may be caused by:\n\n* Heat, such as fire, steam, and hot surfaces or liquids\n* Chemicals, such as acids or certain cleaning products\n* Electricity, including lightning\n* Radiation, including sunburn and burns from radiation therapy for cancer\n* Friction, such as road rash\n\n**What Happens During a Burn Evaluation?**\n\nIn the case of serious burn injuries, the burn victim is first checked for life-threatening conditions that must be managed right away. These include breathing and blood pressure problems, and other injuries.\n\nWhen a burn victim is in stable condition, a provider will begin a burn evaluation, which includes two steps:\n\n1. **Degree of the Burn**: Checking to see how far into the skin the burn goes.\n\t* First-degree burns (superficial) damage only the outer layer of the skin.\n\t* Second-degree burns (partial thickness) damage the outer layer and the layer underneath.\n\t* Third-degree burns (full-thickness) damage or completely destroy the entire thickness of the skin.\n2. **Extent of the Burn**: Estimating how much of the body is burned.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* First-degree burns: pain, redness, mild swelling\n* Second-degree burns: pain, deep redness, blisters, wet or glossy look from leaking fluid\n* Third-degree burns: loss of skin layers, no pain if nerves are destroyed, dry, leathery skin\n\n**What is a Burn Evaluation Used For?**\n\nBurn evaluations are used to find out how serious burn injuries may be. Providers use information from burn evaluations to make a treatment plan and predict how the burn will heal.\n\nThis includes:\n\n* Deciding if a burn victim needs to receive intravenous (IV) fluids\n* Deciding whether a burn victim needs care in the hospital or a special burn center\n* Preparing for the risk of complications from burns, such as breathing problems, shock, infections, and sepsis\n\n---\n\n**Burn Evaluation: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Estimating the Extent of Burns**\n\nThe Lund-Browder chart is the most accurate way to estimate the percentage of the body that's burned, especially for children. Children's body proportions change as they grow, so the chart has different percentages for the head, neck, and body areas based on a child's age.\n\n\\n\\n**Burn Evaluation Steps**\n\nWhen a burn victim is in stable condition, a provider will begin a burn evaluation, which includes two steps.\n\n1. **Figuring Out the Degree of the Burn**: Checking to see how far into the skin the burn goes.\n\t* First-degree burns are also called superficial burns. These burns damage only the outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis.\n\t* Second-degree burns are also called partial thickness burns. These burns damage the outer layer of skin and the layer underneath, called the dermis.\n\t* Third-degree burns are also called full-thickness burns. They require emergency medical attention.\n2. **Estimating How Much of the Body is Burned**: This estimate is a percentage of the person's total body surface area (TBSA) that has second-degree or deeper burns.\n\n\\n\\n**Methods for Estimating the Percentage of the Body That's Burned**\n\n* The \"rule of nines\" divides the body into sections that equal about 9% or 18% of the total body surface area.\n* For children, the rule of nines has different surface area estimates based on a child's age.\n\n\\n\\n**Understanding the Results**\n\nTo understand the results of a burn evaluation, a provider will also consider the part of the body that's burned, the cause of the burn, and the health of the person with the burn. All of this information helps decide whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe.\n\nThe seriousness of the burn guides treatment decisions. Your provider can explain whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe and why.\n\n\\n\\n**Minor, Moderate, and Severe Burns**\n\n* Minor burns usually don't require hospitalization and they heal well.\n* Moderate burns may require a stay in the hospital, but they usually don't need treatment in a burn center.\n* Severe burns require special care at a burn center. Treatment at a burn center may be recommended for:\n\t+ Second-degree burns that cover more than 10% of the body\n\t+ Third-degree burns\n\t+ Second and third-degree burns of the face, feet, hands, genitals, or over the joints\n\n\\n\\n**When to Get Medical Help**\n\nYou can often treat minor burns at home, but it's important to get medical help if a burn has any of these signs:\n\n* Appears to go deep into the skin\n* Is larger than 3 inches across\n* Looks leathery and dry\n* Has patches of white, brown, or black\n* Swells very fast\n* Gets more painful over time, has pus, or causes a fever\n\nAlso, get medical help for all burns that:\n\n* Are caused by electricity or chemicals\n* Are on the face, hands, genitals, buttocks, over a joint, or go all the way around a part of the body\n* Happen with inhalation (breathing in) of smoke, hot gasses, or chemicals\n* Happen to a child under age 5 or an adult older than age 70\n\n---\n\n**Burn Evaluation**\n\nIf you're an adult older than age 70, it's crucial to get medical help immediately for any burn, no matter how minor it may seem.\n\nYou can often treat minor burns at home, but it's essential to seek medical attention if a burn has any of the following signs:\n\n* Large blisters\n* Charring or blackening of the skin\n* White, leathery skin\n* Blisters that don't heal within two weeks\n* Fever over 101.5°F (38.6°C)\n* Difficulty breathing\n\nAdditionally, get medical help for all burns that occur in:\n\n* Children under six years old\n* People with a history of heart disease or other chronic conditions\n* Those who have been exposed to chemicals or other hazardous materials\n\nReferences:\n\n* Agrawal A, Raibagkar SC, Vora HJ.

    "content": "**Burns**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Burns?**\n\nBurns commonly occur by direct or indirect contact with heat, electric current, radiation, or chemical agents. Burns can lead to cell death, which can require hospitalization and can be fatal.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Burns**\n\nThere are three levels of burns:\n\n*   **First-degree burns**: affect only the outer layer of the skin. They cause pain, redness, and swelling.\n*   **Second-degree burns**: affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin. They cause pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns.\n*   **Third-degree burns**: affect the deep layers of skin. They are also called full thickness burns. They cause white or blackened, burned skin. The skin may be numb.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Classification of Burns**\n\nBurns fall into two groups:\n\n*   **Minor burns**: \n    *   First degree burns anywhere on the body\n    *   Second degree burns less than 2 to 3 inches (in) or 5.08 to 7.62 centimeters (cm) wide\n*   **Major burns**: \n    *   Third-degree burns\n    *   Second-degree burns more than 2 to 3 in (5.08 to 7.62 cm) wide\n    *   Second-degree burns on the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or over a major joint\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Burns**\n\nCauses of burns from most to least common are:\n\n*   Fire/flame\n*   Scalding from steam or hot liquids\n*   Touching hot objects\n*   Electrical burns\n*   Chemical burns\n\nBurns can be the result of any of the following:\n\n*   House and industrial fires\n*   Car accidents\n*   Playing with matches\n*   Faulty space heaters, furnaces, or industrial equipment\n*   Unsafe use of firecrackers and other fireworks\n*   Kitchen accidents, such as a child grabbing a hot iron or touching the stove or oven\n\nYou can also burn your airways if you breathe in smoke, steam, superheated air, or chemical fumes in poorly ventilated areas.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Burns**\n\nBurn symptoms can include:\n\n*   Blisters that are either intact (unbroken) or have ruptured and are leaking fluid.\n*   Pain -- How much pain you have is unrelated to the level of burn. The most serious burns can be painless.\n*   Peeling skin.\n*   Shock -- Watch for pale and clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and a decrease in alertness.\n*   Swelling.\n*   Red, white, or charred skin.\n\nYou may have an airway burn if you have:\n\n*   Burns on the head, face, neck, eyebrows, or nose hairs\n*   Burned lips and mouth\n*   Coughing\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Dark, black-stained mucus\n*   Voice changes\n*   Wheezing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**First Aid for Minor Burns**\n\nIf the skin is unbroken:\n\n*   Run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area under water for at least 5 to 30 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will help reduce pain.\n*   Calm and reassure the person.\n*   After flushing or soaking the burn, cover it with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing.\n*   Protect the burn from pressure and friction.\n*   Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. Do not give aspirin to children under 12.\n*   Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion containing aloe and an antibiotic also can help.\n\nMinor burns will often heal without further treatment. Make sure the person is up to date on their tetanus immunization.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**First Aid for Major Burns**\n\nIf someone is on fire, tell the person to stop, drop, and roll. Then, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wrap the person in thick material; such as a wool or cotton coat, rug, or blanket. This helps put out the flames.\n*   Pour water on the person.\n*   Call 911 or the local emergency number.\n*   Make sure that the person is no longer touching any burning or smoking materials.\n*   Do not remove burned clothing that is stuck to the skin.\n*   Make sure the person is breathing. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.\n*   Cover the burned area with a dry sterile bandage (if available) or clean cloth. A sheet will do if the burned area is large. Do not apply any ointments. Avoid breaking burn blisters.\n*   If fingers or toes have been burned, separate them with dry, sterile, non-stick bandages.\n*   Raise the body part that is burned above the level of the heart.\n*   Protect the burn area from pressure and friction.\n*   If an electrical injury may have caused the burn, do not touch the victim directly. Use a non-metallic object to separate the person away from exposed wires before starting first aid.\n\nYou will also need to prevent shock. If the person does not have a head, neck, back, or leg injury, follow these steps:\n\n*   Lay the person flat\n*   Raise the feet about 12 in (30 cm)\n*   Cover the person with a coat or blanket\n\nContinue to monitor the person's pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure until medical help arrives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nThings that should not be done for burns include:\n\n*   Do not apply oil, butter, ice, medicines, cream, oil spray, or any household remedy to a severe burn.\n*   Do not breathe, blow, or cough on the burn.\n*   Do not disturb blistered or dead skin.\n*   Do not remove clothing that is stuck to the skin.\n*   Do not give the person anything by mouth if there is a severe burn.\n*   Do not place a severe burn in cold water. This can cause shock.\n*   Do not place a pillow under the person's head if there is an airway burn. This can close the airway.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   The burn is very large, about the size of your palm or larger.\n*   The burn is severe (third degree).\n*   You aren't sure how serious it is.\n*   The burn is caused by chemicals or electricity.\n*   The person shows signs of shock.\n*   The person breathed in smoke.\n*   Physical abuse is the known or suspected cause of the burn.\n*   There are other symptoms associated with the burn.\n\nFor minor burns, contact your health care provider if you still have pain after 48 hours.\n\nContact your provider right away if signs of infection develop. These signs include:\n\n*   Drainage or pus from the burned skin\n*   Fever\n*   Increased pain\n*   Red streaks spreading from the burn\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n\nAlso contact your provider right away if symptoms of dehydration occur with a burn:\n\n*   Decreased urination\n*   Dizziness\n*   Dry skin\n*   Headache\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Nausea (with or without vomiting)\n*   Thirst\n\nChildren, older people, and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, from HIV) should be seen right away.\n\nYour provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as needed.\n\nThese may include:\n\n*   Airway and breathing support, including a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, or breathing machine (ventilator) for serious burns or those involving the face or airway\n*   Blood and urine tests if shock or other complications are present\n*   Chest x-ray for face or airway burns\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG), if shock or other complications are present\n*   Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein), if shock or other complications are present\n*   Medicines for pain relief and to prevent infection\n*   Ointments or creams applied to the burned areas\n*   Tetanus immunization, if not up to date\n\nThe outcome will depend on the type (degree), extent, and location of the burn. It also depends upon whether internal organs have been affected, and if other trauma has occurred. Burns can leave permanent scars. They can also be more sensitive to temperature and light than normal skin. Sensitive areas, such as the eyes, nose, or ears, may be badly injured and have lost normal function.\n\nWith airway burns, the person may have less breathing capacity and permanent lung damage. Severe burns that affect the joints may result in contractures, leaving the joint with decreased movement and a reduction in function.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo help prevent burns:\n\n*   Be careful around heat sources, such as stoves, ovens, and fireplaces.\n*   Keep children away from heat sources.\n*   Use protective clothing, such as gloves and long sleeves, when working with chemicals or near heat sources.\n*   Install smoke detectors in your home.\n*   Have a plan for escaping from your home in case of a fire.\n*   Stay informed about local burn hazards, such as wildfires.\n\n---\n\n**Burns: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/6)**\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   Install smoke alarms in your home and check batteries regularly.\n*   Teach children about fire safety and the danger of matches and fireworks.\n*   Keep children from climbing on top of a stove or grabbing hot items such as irons and oven doors.\n*   Turn pot handles toward the back of the stove so that children can't grab them and they cannot accidentally be knocked over.\n*   Place fire extinguishers in key locations at home, work, and school.\n*   Remove electrical cords from floors and keep them out of reach.\n*   Know about and practice fire escape routes at home, work, and school.\n*   Set the water heater temperature at 120°F (48.8°C) or less.\n\n**Types of Burns**\n\n*   **First-degree burns**: affect only the outer layer of the skin, causing pain, redness, and swelling.\n*   **Second-degree burns**: affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin, causing pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns.\n*   **Third-degree burns**: affect the deep layers of skin, causing white or blackened, burned skin. The skin may be numb.\n\n**Causes of Burns**\n\n*   Fire/flame\n*   Scalding from steam or hot liquids\n*   Touching hot objects\n*   Electrical burns\n*   Chemical burns\n\nBurns can be the result of any of the following:\n\n*   House and industrial fires\n*   Car accidents\n*   Playing with matches\n*   Faulty space heaters, furnaces, or industrial equipment\n*   Unsafe use of firecrackers and other fireworks\n*   Kitchen accidents, such as a child grabbing a hot iron or touching the stove or oven\n\nYou can also burn your airways if you breathe in smoke, steam, superheated air, or chemical fumes in poorly ventilated areas.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBurn symptoms can include:\n\n*   Blisters that are either intact (unbroken) or have ruptured and are leaking fluid.\n*   Pain -- How much pain you have is unrelated to the level of burn. The most serious burns can be painless.\n*   Peeling skin.\n*   Shock -- Watch for pale and clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and a decrease in alertness.\n*   Swelling.\n*   Red, white, or charred skin.\n\nYou may have an airway burn if you have:\n\n*   Burns on the head, face, neck, eyebrows, or nose hairs\n*   Burned lips and mouth\n*   Coughing\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Dark, black-stained mucus\n*   Voice changes\n*   Wheezing\n\n**First Aid**\n\nBefore giving first aid, it is important to determine what type of burn the person has. If you are not sure, treat it as a major burn. Serious burns need medical care right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\nMINOR BURNS\n\nIf the skin is unbroken:\n\n*   Run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area under water for at least 5 to 30 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will help reduce pain.\n*   Calm and reassure the person.\n*   After flushing or soaking the burn, cover it with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing.\n*   Protect the burn from pressure and friction.\n*   Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. Do not give aspirin to children under 12.\n*   Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion containing aloe and an antibiotic also can help.\n\nMAJOR BURNS\n\nIf someone is on fire, tell the person to stop, drop, and roll. Then, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wrap the person in thick material; such as a wool or cotton coat, rug, or blanket. This helps put out the flames.\n*   Pour water on the person.\n*   Call 911 or the local emergency number.\n*   Make sure that the person is no longer touching any burning or smoking materials.\n*   Do not remove burned clothing that is stuck to the skin.\n*   Make sure the person is breathing. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.\n*   Cover the burned area with a dry sterile bandage (if available) or clean cloth. A sheet will do if the burned area is large. Do not apply any ointments. Avoid breaking burn blisters.\n*   If fingers or toes have been burned, separate them with dry, sterile, non-stick bandages.\n*   Raise the body part that is burned above the level of the heart.\n*   Protect the burn area from pressure and friction.\n*   If an electrical injury may have caused the burn, do not touch the victim directly.

Burns can lead to cell death, which can require hospitalization and can be fatal.\n\n**Types of Burns**\n\nThere are three levels of burns:\n\n*   **First-degree burns**: affect only the outer layer of the skin, causing pain, redness, and swelling.\n*   **Second-degree burns**: affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin, causing pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns.\n*   **Third-degree burns**: affect the deep layers of skin, causing white or blackened, burned skin. The skin may be numb.\n\nBurns fall into two groups:\n\n*   **Minor burns**:\n    *   First degree burns anywhere on the body\n    *   Second degree burns less than 2 to 3 inches (in) or 5.08 to 7.62 centimeters (cm) wide\n*   **Major burns**:\n    *   Third-degree burns\n    *   Second-degree burns more than 2 to 3 in (5.08 to 7.62 cm) wide\n    *   Second-degree burns on the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or over a major joint\n\nYou can have more than one type of burn at a time.\n\nMajor burns need urgent medical care. This can help prevent scarring, disability, and deformity.\n\nBurns on the face, hands, feet, and genitals can be particularly serious.\n\nChildren under age 4 and adults over age 60 have a higher chance of complications and death from severe burns because their skin tends to be thinner than in other age groups.\n\n**Causes of Burns**\n\nCauses of burns from most to least common are:\n\n*   **Fire/flame**\n*   **Scalding from steam or hot liquids**\n*   **Touching hot objects**\n*   **Electrical burns**\n*   **Chemical burns**\n\nBurns can be the result of any of the following:\n\n*   House and industrial fires\n*   Car accidents\n*   Playing with matches\n*   Faulty space heaters, furnaces, or industrial equipment\n*   Unsafe use of firecrackers and other fireworks\n*   Kitchen accidents, such as a child grabbing a hot iron or touching the stove or oven\n\nYou can also burn your airways if you breathe in smoke, steam, superheated air, or chemical fumes in poorly ventilated areas.\n\n---\n\n**Burns: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/6)**\n\n**Causes of Burns**\n\nYou can also burn your airways if you breathe in smoke, steam, superheated air, or chemical fumes in poorly ventilated areas.\n\nThe causes of burns from most to least common are:\n\n* Faulty space heaters, furnaces, or industrial equipment\n* Unsafe use of firecrackers and other fireworks\n* Kitchen accidents, such as a child grabbing a hot iron or touching the stove or oven\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBurn symptoms can include:\n\n* Blisters that are either intact (unbroken) or have ruptured and are leaking fluid.\n* Pain -- How much pain you have is unrelated to the level of burn.

    "content": "**Bursitis of the Heel**\n\n_Bursitis of the heel is swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone._\n\n_*Causes:_*\n\nA bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle.\n\nThe retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is under the large Achilles tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.\n\nRepeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.\n\nThis condition is very often linked to Achilles tendinitis. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.\n\n_*Risks:_*\n\nStarting a very intense workout schedule\nSuddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning\nIncrease or decrease in activity level\nHistory of arthritis that is caused by inflammation\n\n_*Symptoms:_*\n\nPain at the back of the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched\nPain may get worse when standing on tiptoes\nRed, warm skin over the back of the heel\n\n_*Exams and Tests:_*\n\nYour health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.\n\nThe pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes.\n\nMost of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments do not lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on an MRI.\n\n_*Treatment:_*\n\nYour provider may recommend that you do the following:\n\nAvoid activities that cause pain.\nPut ice on the heel several times a day.\nTake nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.\nTry using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.\nTry ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.\n\nHave physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.\n\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can tear (rupture).\n\nIf the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.\n\n_*Outlook (Prognosis):_*\n\nThis condition most often gets better in several weeks with the proper treatment.\n\n_*When to Contact a Medical Professional:_*\n\nContact your provider if you have heel pain or symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis that do not improve with rest.\n\n_*Prevention:_*\n\nThings you can do to prevent the problem include:\n\nMaintain good flexibility and strength around the ankle to help prevent this condition.\nStretch the Achilles tendon to help prevent injury.\nWear shoes with enough arch support to decrease the amount of stress on the tendon and inflammation in the bursa.\nUse proper form when exercising.\n\n---\n\n**Bursitis of the Heel**\n\n**Causes**\n\nA bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone.

Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.\n\nRisks for this condition include:\n\n* Starting a very intense workout schedule\n* Suddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning\n* Increase or decrease in activity level\n* History of arthritis that is caused by inflammation\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Pain at the back of the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched\n* Pain may get worse when standing on tiptoes\n* Red, warm skin over the back of the heel\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.\n\nThe pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes.\n\nMost of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments do not lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on an MRI.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider may recommend that you do the following:\n\n* Avoid activities that cause pain.\n* Put ice on the heel several times a day.\n* Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.\n* Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.\n* Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.\n\nHave physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.\n\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can tear (rupture).\n\nIf the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.\n\n---\n\n**Bursitis of the Heel**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Overuse or repetitive strain on the heel\n*   Poor foot mechanics or gait\n*   Wearing shoes that are too tight or don't fit properly\n*   Certain medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Pain and swelling in the heel\n*   Redness and warmth in the affected area\n*   Difficulty walking or putting weight on the heel\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n*   Physical examination by a healthcare provider\n*   Imaging tests, such as X-rays or an MRI, to rule out other conditions\n*   Aspiration of fluid from the bursa to examine for signs of infection or inflammation\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Rest and ice to reduce pain and inflammation\n*   Over-the-counter pain medication, such as ibuprofen\n*   Custom heel wedges or shoe inserts to redistribute pressure on the heel\n*   Ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation\n*   Physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle\n*   Steroid injections into the bursa in severe cases\n*   In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the inflamed bursa\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   Maintaining good flexibility and strength around the ankle\n*   Stretching the Achilles tendon regularly\n*   Wearing shoes with enough arch support to decrease stress on the heel\n*   Using proper form when exercising",

    "content": "**Bursitis**\n\nA bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts, such as muscles, tendons, or skin. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed.\n\n**Causes of Bursitis**\n\nPeople get bursitis by overusing a joint. It can also be caused by an injury. It usually occurs at the knee or elbow. Kneeling or leaning your elbows on a hard surface for a long time can make bursitis start. Doing the same kinds of movements every day or putting stress on joints increases your risk.\n\n**Symptoms of Bursitis**\n\nSymptoms of bursitis include pain and swelling. Your doctor will diagnose bursitis with a physical exam and tests such as x-rays and MRIs. He or she may also take fluid from the swollen area to be sure the problem isn't an infection.\n\n**Treatment of Bursitis**\n\nTreatment of bursitis includes rest, pain medicines, or ice. If there is no improvement, your doctor may inject a drug into the area around the swollen bursa. If the joint still does not improve after 6 to 12 months, you may need surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the bursa.\n\n**NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases**\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Sports Injuries   (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)\n* Bursitis of the Hip (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Elbow (Olecranon) Bursitis (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons)\n* Knee Bursitis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* Hypertension and frozen shoulder: A bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization study.\n* A retrospective study on the short-term efficacy of injection and manipulation...\n* Influence of the metabolic and inflammatory profile in patients with frozen...\n\n---\n\n**Bursitis**\n\n\\n\\n* **Journal Articles**\n\t+ A retrospective study on the short-term efficacy of injection and manipulation in patients with frozen shoulder\n\t+ Influence of the metabolic and inflammatory profile in patients with frozen shoulder\n\t+ Hypertension and frozen shoulder: A bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization study\n\n\\n\\n* **Find an Expert**\n\t+ American College of Rheumatology\n\t+ National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\n\n\\n\\n* **Teenagers**\n\t+ Bursitis (Nemours Foundation)\n\n\\n\\n* **Patient Handouts**\n\t+ Bursitis (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\t+ Bursitis of the heel (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\t+ Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n\\n\\n* **Related Health Topics**\n\t+ Elbow Injuries and Disorders\n\t+ Hip Injuries and Disorders\n\t+ Knee Injuries and Disorders\n\t+ Tendinitis\n\n\\n\\n* **National Institutes of Health**\n\t+ The primary NIH organization for research on Bursitis is the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

    "content": "**Butabarbital**\n\n*pronounced as (byoo ta bar' bi tal)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nButabarbital is used on a short-term basis to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). It is also used to relieve anxiety, including anxiety before surgery. Butabarbital is in a class of medications called barbiturates. It works by slowing activity in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nButabarbital comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. When butabarbital is used to treat insomnia, it is usually taken at bedtime as needed for sleep. When butabarbital is used to relieve anxiety before surgery, it is usually taken 60 to 90 minutes before surgery. When butabarbital is used to relieve anxiety, it is usually taken three to four times a day. If you are taking butabarbital on a regular schedule, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take butabarbital exactly as directed.\n\nYour sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking butabarbital. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior.\n\nButabarbital should normally be taken for short periods of time. If you take butabarbital for 2 weeks or longer, butabarbital may not help you sleep as well or control your anxiety as it did when you first began to take the medication. If you take butabarbital for a long time, you also may develop dependence ('addiction,' a need to continue taking the medication) on butabarbital. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking butabarbital for 2 weeks or longer. Do not take a larger dose of butabarbital, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not stop taking butabarbital without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking butabarbital, you may develop anxiety, muscle twitching, uncontrollable shaking of your hands or fingers, weakness, dizziness, changes in vision, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or you may experience more severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or extreme confusion.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nButabarbital should normally be taken for short periods of time. If you take butabarbital for 2 weeks or longer, butabarbital may not help you sleep as well or control your anxiety as it did when you first began to take the medication. If you take butabarbital for a long time, you also may develop dependence ('addiction,' a need to continue taking the medication) on butabarbital.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are taking butabarbital on a regular schedule, take it at around the same time(s) every day. If you miss a dose of butabarbital, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nButabarbital may cause some people to become dependent on the medication. This dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms when the medication is stopped. Other possible side effects include anxiety, muscle twitching, uncontrollable shaking of your hands or fingers, weakness, dizziness, changes in vision, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep butabarbital away from children and pets. Do not take butabarbital that has been damaged by moisture or has an unusual odor or appearance. Dispose of butabarbital properly when it is no longer needed or expired.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you have taken too much butabarbital, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 (US only). If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Butabarbital: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    \\- This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n    \\- Before taking butabarbital, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to butabarbital; other barbiturates such as amobarbital (Amytal, in Tuinal), pentobarbital, phenobarbital, or secobarbital (Seconal); tartrazine (a yellow dye found in some foods and medications); aspirin; or any other medications.

You should also bring the container with you, if possible.\n\nThe healthcare provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Tests may include:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Fluids through a vein (IV)\n* Laxatives\n* Medicine to treat symptoms\n\n**What Is the Outlook for Recovery?**\n\nRecovery from a butazolidin overdose is generally very likely.

However, bleeding in the stomach or intestines may be severe and require blood transfusion. If there is kidney damage, it may be permanent. If bleeding does not stop, even with medicine, an endoscopy may be needed to stop the bleeding. In an endoscopy, a tube is placed through the mouth and into the stomach and upper intestine.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n*   Aronson JK. Tolmetin. In: Aronson JK, ed.

Butorphanol is in a class of medications called opioid agonist-antagonists. It works by changing the way the body senses pain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nButorphanol injection comes as a liquid to be injected into a muscle or vein. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain, it is usually given once every 3 to 4 hours as needed. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain during surgery, it may be given 60 to 90 minutes before surgery and then as needed during the surgery. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain during labor, it may be given once every 4 hours but should not be given less than 4 hours before delivery is expected.\n\nYou may receive butorphanol injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you have been told to administer butorphanol injection at home, it is very important that you use the medication exactly as directed. Follow the directions that you are given carefully, and ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions or do not understand the directions.\n\nIf you have been told to use butorphanol injection at home, do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using butorphanol injection, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, shakiness, diarrhea, chills, sweats, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, confusion, loss of coordination, or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist). Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nButorphanol injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain.

Naloxone is used to reverse the life-threatening effects of an overdose. It works by blocking the effects of opiates to relieve dangerous symptoms caused by high levels of opiates in the blood. Your doctor may also prescribe you naloxone if you are living in a household where there are small children or someone who has abused street or prescription drugs.\n\nYou should make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you and your family members how to use the medication. Ask your pharmacist for the instructions or visit the manufacturer's website to get the instructions.\n\nIf symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\n**Symptoms of Overdose**\n\nSlow or shallow breathing\nDifficulty breathing\nSleepiness\nUnable to respond or wake up\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and laboratory.

Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication.\n\n\\n\\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. https://www.upandaway.org\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\n\\n\\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.\n\n\\n\\nWhile using butorphanol nasal spray, you should talk to your doctor about having a rescue medication called naloxone readily available (e.g., home, office). Naloxone is used to reverse the life-threatening effects of an overdose. It works by blocking the effects of opiates to relieve dangerous symptoms caused by high levels of opiates in the blood. Your doctor may also prescribe you naloxone if you are living in a household where there are small children or someone who has abused street or prescription drugs.\n\n\\n\\nAsk your doctor about other ways that you can obtain naloxone (directly from a pharmacy or as part of a community based program). You should make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you and your family members how to use the medication.\n\n\\n\\nIf symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\n\\n\\nSymptoms of overdose may include the following:\n* slow or shallow breathing\n* difficulty breathing\n* excessive sleepiness\n* unable to respond or wake up\n* limp or weak muscles\n* narrowing or widening of the pupils (dark circle in the eye)\n* cold, clammy skin\n* slowed heartbeat\n* unusual snoring\n\n---\n\n**Butorphanol Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 7/7)**\n\n**Symptoms of Overdose**\n\n*   slow or shallow breathing\n*   difficulty breathing\n*   excessive sleepiness\n*   unable to respond or wake up\n*   limp or weak muscles\n*   narrowing or widening of the pupils (dark circle in the eye)\n*   cold, clammy skin\n*   slowed heartbeat\n*   unusual snoring\n\n**In Case of Overdose**\n\nCall the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\n**Keeping Appointments and Laboratory Tests**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to butorphanol.\n\n**Before Laboratory Tests**\n\nBefore having any laboratory test (especially those that involve methylene blue), tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are using butorphanol.\n\n**Refilling Prescriptions**\n\nDo not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.\n\n**Keeping a List of Medications**\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.\n\n**Brand Names**\n\n*   Stadol® NS¶\n    ¶This branded product is no longer on the market. Generic alternatives may be available.",

But if it becomes stuck in the food pipe (esophagus) or stomach, these symptoms may occur:\n\n* Abdominal pain\n* Bloody stools\n* Cardiovascular collapse (shock)\n* Chest pain\n* Drooling\n* Nausea or vomiting (possibly bloody)\n* Metallic taste in the mouth\n* Painful or difficult swallowing\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSeek medical help right away.

This may be done under general anesthesia to ensure the child's comfort and safety.\n\nIn some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair any damage caused by the battery. It is essential to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect your child has ingested a button battery.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent button battery ingestion in children, it is crucial to:\n\n*   Keep button batteries out of reach of children\n*   Dispose of used batteries properly\n*   Educate children about the dangers of button batteries\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can help protect your child from the risks associated with button battery ingestion.",

    "content": "**Buying and Caring for Baby Bottles and Nipples**\n\nWhether you feed your baby breast milk, infant formula, or both, you will need to buy bottles and nipples. You have many choices, so it can be hard to know what to buy. Learn about the different options and how to care for bottles and nipples.\n\n**How to Choose Bottles and Nipples**\n\nThe type of nipple and bottle you choose will mainly depend on which type your baby will use. Some babies prefer a certain nipple shape, or they may have less gas with certain bottles. Others are less fussy with certain bottles. Start by buying a few different types of bottles and nipples. That way, you can try them out and see what works best for you and your baby.\n\n**Nipples**\n\nNipples can be made from latex or silicone.\n\n* Latex nipples are softer and more flexible. But some babies are sensitive to latex, and it does not last as long as silicone.\n* Silicone nipples last longer and tend to hold their shape better.\n\nNipples come in different shapes.\n\n* Dome-shaped\n* Flat\n* Wide\n\nFlat or wide nipples are shaped more like a mother's breast. Try different shapes to see which one your baby prefers.\n\nNipples come in different flow rates.\n\n* Slow, medium, or fast flow rate\n* Infants usually start with a smaller hole and slower flow. You will increase the size as your baby gets better at feeding and drinks more.\n* Your baby should be able to get enough milk without having to suck too hard.\n* If your baby is choking or spitting up, the flow is too fast.\n\n**Baby Bottles**\n\nBaby bottles come in different materials.\n\n* Plastic bottles are lightweight and will not break if dropped. If you choose plastic, it is best to buy new bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.\n* Glass bottles do not have BPA and are recyclable, but they can break if dropped. Some manufacturers sell plastic sleeves to prevent bottles from breaking.\n* Stainless steel bottles are sturdy and will not break, but they may be more expensive.\n* Disposable bottles have a plastic sleeve inside that you throw away after each use. The liner collapses as baby drinks, which helps prevent air bubbles. Liners save on cleanup, and are handy for traveling. But they add an extra cost, as you need a new liner for every feeding.\n\nYou can choose from several different bottle shapes and sizes:\n\n* Standard bottles have straight or slightly rounded sides. They are easy to clean and fill, and you can easily tell how much milk is in the bottle.\n* Angle-neck bottles are easier to hold. The milk collects at the end of the bottle. This helps prevent your baby from sucking in air. These bottles can be harder to fill and you need to hold them sideways or use a funnel.\n* Wide bottles have a wide mouth and are short and squat. They are said to be more like a mother's breast, so they may be a good option for babies who go back and forth between breast and bottle.\n* Vented bottles have a venting system inside to prevent air bubbles. They are said to help prevent colic and gas, but this is unproven. These bottles have a straw-like inner vent, so you will have more parts to keep track of, clean, and assemble.\n\nWhen your baby is small, start with the smaller 4- to 5-ounce (120- to 150-milliliters) bottles. As your baby's appetite grows, you can switch to larger 8- to 9-ounce (240- to 270-milliliters) bottles.\n\n**Cleaning and Care**\n\nThese tips can help you safely care for and clean baby bottles and nipples:\n\n* When you first buy bottles and nipples, sterilize them. Place all of the parts in a pan covered with water and boil them for 5 minutes. Then wash with soap and warm water and air dry them.\n* Clean bottles right after you use them so the milk doesn't dry and become caked onto the bottle. Wash bottles and other parts with soap and warm water. Use a bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach areas. ONLY use these brushes on baby bottles and parts. Dry bottles and nipples on a drying rack on the counter. Make sure everything is completely dry before using again.\n* If bottles and nipples are labeled \"dishwasher safe,\" you can wash and dry them in the top rack of the dishwasher.\n* Throw out cracked or torn nipples. Small pieces of the nipple can come off and cause choking.\n* Throw out cracked or chipped bottles, which can pinch or cut you or your baby.\n* Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling bottles and nipples.\n\nReferences:\n\n* American Academy of Pediatrics website.

Some manufacturers sell plastic sleeves to prevent bottles from breaking.\n*   **Shapes and Sizes:** Standard bottles have straight or slightly rounded sides. Angle-neck bottles are easier to hold. Wide bottles have a wide mouth and are short and squat. Vented bottles have a venting system inside to prevent air bubbles.\n*   **Choosing the Right Bottle:** When your baby is small, start with smaller 4- to 5-ounce (120- to 150-milliliters) bottles. As your baby's appetite grows, you can switch to larger 8- to 9-ounce (240- to 270-milliliters) bottles.\n\n**Cleaning and Care**\n\n*   **Sterilizing Bottles:** When you first buy bottles and nipples, sterilize them by boiling them for 5 minutes.\n*   **Cleaning Bottles:** Clean bottles right after use so the milk doesn't dry and become caked onto the bottle. Wash bottles and other parts with soap and warm water. Use a bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach areas.\n*   **Drying Bottles:** Dry bottles and nipples on a drying rack on the counter. Make sure everything is completely dry before using again.\n*   **Disposal:** Throw out cracked or torn nipples. Small pieces of the nipple can come off and cause choking. Throw out cracked or chipped bottles, which can pinch or cut you or your baby.\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Academy of Pediatrics website.

    "content": "**Byssinosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Byssinosis?**\n\nByssinosis is a disease of the lungs caused by breathing in cotton dust or dusts from other vegetable fibers such as flax, hemp, or sisal while at work.\n\n**Causes**\n\nInhaling the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis. It is most common in people who work in the textile industry. Those who are sensitive to the dust can have an asthma-like condition after being exposed.\n\nMethods of prevention in the United States have reduced the number of cases. Byssinosis is still common in developing countries. Smoking increases risk of developing this disease. Being exposed to the dust many times can lead to long-term (chronic) lung disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Chest tightness\n*   Cough\n*   Wheezing\n*   Shortness of breath\n\nSymptoms are worse at the beginning of the work week and improve later in the week. Symptoms are also less severe when the person is away from the workplace.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will take your medical history. You'll be asked if your symptoms relate to certain exposures or times of exposure. Your provider will also do a physical exam, paying special attention to the lungs.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Chest CT scan\n*   Lung function tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe most important treatment is to stop being exposed to the dust. Reducing dust levels in the factory (by improving machinery or ventilation) will help prevent byssinosis. Some people may have to change jobs to avoid further exposure.\n\nMedicines used for asthma, such as bronchodilators, usually improve symptoms. Corticosteroid medicines may be prescribed in more severe cases.\n\nStopping smoking is very important for people with this condition. Breathing treatments, including nebulizers, may be prescribed if the condition becomes long-term. Home oxygen therapy may be needed if blood oxygen level is low.\n\nPeople with a long-term (chronic) lung disease can be helped with:\n\n*   Physical exercise programs\n*   Breathing exercises\n*   Patient education programs\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nStopping exposure to the dust often improves symptoms. Continued exposure can lead to reduced lung function. In the United States, worker's compensation may be available to people with byssinosis.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nChronic bronchitis may develop. This is swelling (inflammation) of the large airways of the lungs with a large amount of phlegm production. Continued exposure can lead to end-stage lung disease.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n*   Have symptoms of byssinosis and know you have been exposed to cotton or other fibers\n*   Think you have been exposed to cotton or other fiber dust at work and you have breathing problems\n\nHaving byssinosis makes it easier for you to develop lung infections. So if you've been diagnosed with byssinosis, contact your provider right away if you develop:\n\n*   A cough\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fever\n*   Other signs of a lung infection\n*   Symptoms of the flu or COVID-19\n\nSince your lungs are already damaged, it's important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe. It will also prevent further damage to your lungs.\n\nTalk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, and other recommended vaccines.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nControlling dust, using face masks, and other measures can reduce the risk. Stop smoking, especially if you work in textile manufacturing.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCotton worker's lung; Cotton bract disease; Mill fever; Brown lung disease; Monday fever\n\n---\n\n**Byssinosis**\n\n**Causes**\n\nInhaling the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-peptide-test/",
    "content": "**C-Peptide Test**\n\nThis test measures the level of C-peptide in a sample of your blood or urine. Measuring C-peptide is an accurate way to find out how much insulin your body is making.\n\n**What is Insulin?**\n\nInsulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes. It helps blood glucose (blood sugar) get into your cells, where it can be used for energy. This helps keep your blood glucose at healthy levels.\n\n**How Does C-Peptide Work?**\n\nDuring the process of making insulin, your pancreas produces C-peptide. C-peptide and insulin enter your bloodstream at the same time and in equal amounts. C-peptide doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but it stays in your blood longer than insulin, so it's easier to measure accurately.\n\n**What is a C-Peptide Test Used For?**\n\nA C-peptide test may be used to help:\n\n* Find the cause of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)\n* Manage diabetes treatment\n* Monitor treatment for a tumor in your pancreas, called an insulinoma (uncommon)\n\n**Why Do I Need a C-Peptide Test?**\n\nYou may need a C-peptide test if:\n\n* You have been diagnosed with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) but don't know what's causing it\n* You have diabetes and you:\n\t+ Take insulin, and your provider is considering changing your treatment\n\t+ Have type 2 diabetes, and your provider wants to see if you need to start taking insulin\n\t+ Have hypoglycemia, which could be caused by taking too much diabetes medicines\n* You have been diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor (insulinoma). A C-peptide test can help monitor your condition and treatment.\n\n**What Happens During a C-Peptide Test?**\n\nA C-peptide test usually uses a sample of your blood. But the test may also be done on a sample of all your urine collected over a 24-hour period.\n\nDuring a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a 24-hour urine sample test, you will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nFor a C-peptide blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before the test. Ask your provider if there are any specific instructions you need to follow before either a blood or a urine test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to a urine test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe meaning of your results depends on your age, health, the medicines you take, and the results of other tests, such as a blood glucose test. In general:\n\n* A high level of C-peptide usually means that your body is making too much insulin.\n* A low level of C-peptide may mean your body isn't making enough insulin.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**C-Peptide Test**\n\nThe C-peptide test can provide important information to help understand, monitor, and/or treat disorders that involve how well your body makes insulin, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and diabetes.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA C-peptide test may be used to help:\n\n* Find the cause of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Some types of hypoglycemia are linked to high insulin levels. A C-peptide test can tell you whether too much insulin is involved in your condition.\n* Manage diabetes treatment. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, treatment decisions may depend on knowing how much insulin your pancreas is producing.\n* Monitor treatment for a tumor in your pancreas, called an insulinoma (uncommon).\n* To find out whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes if your diagnosis is uncertain.\n\n**Why do I need a C-peptide test?**\n\nYou may need a C-peptide test if:\n\n* You have been diagnosed with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) but don't know what's causing it.\n* You have diabetes and you:\n\t+ Take insulin, and your provider is considering changing your treatment.\n\t+ Have type 2 diabetes, and your provider wants to see if you need to start taking insulin.\n\t+ Have hypoglycemia, which could be caused by taking too much diabetes medicines.\n* You have been diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor (insulinoma).

This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a 24-hour urine sample test, you will be given a special container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps:\n\n* To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine.\n* For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container.\n* During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice.\n* 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test.\n* Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFor a C-peptide blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before the test.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-reactive-protein-crp-test/",
    "content": "**C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test**\n\nA c-reactive protein test measures the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in a sample of your blood. CRP is a protein that your liver makes. Normally, you have low levels of c-reactive protein in your blood. Your liver releases more CRP into your bloodstream if you have inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP may mean you have a serious health condition that causes inflammation.\n\n**Inflammation**\n\nInflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues and helping them heal from an injury, infection, or other disease. Inflammation can be acute (sudden) and temporary. This type of inflammation is usually helpful. For example, if you cut your skin, it may turn red, swell, and hurt for a few days. Those are signs of inflammation. Inflammation can also happen inside your body.\n\nIf inflammation lasts too long, it can damage healthy tissues. This is called chronic (long-term) inflammation. Chronic infections, certain autoimmune disorders, and other diseases can cause harmful chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can also happen if your tissues are repeatedly injured or irritated, for example from smoking or chemicals in the environment.\n\n**What is a CRP test used for?**\n\nA CRP test may be used to help find or monitor inflammation in acute or chronic conditions, including:\n\n* Infections from bacteria or viruses\n* Inflammatory bowel disease, disorders of the intestines that include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n* Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis\n* Lung diseases, such as asthma\n\n**Why do I need a CRP test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection, such as:\n\n* Fever or chills\n* Rapid heart rate\n* Rapid breathing\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\nYou may also need a CRP test if your provider thinks you may have a chronic condition that causes inflammation. The symptoms will depend on the condition.\n\nIf you've already been diagnosed with an infection or a chronic disease that causes inflammation, you may need this test to monitor your condition and treatment. CRP levels rise and fall depending on how much inflammation is in your body. If your CRP levels fall, it's a sign that your treatment for inflammation is working or you're healing on your own.\n\n**What happens during a CRP test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nSome medicines may affect your results. So, tell your provider about any supplements or medicines that you take, including ibuprofen, aspirin, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Don't stop taking any prescription medicines without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour CRP test results tell you how much inflammation you have in your body. But your test results can't tell you what's causing the inflammation. To make a diagnosis, your provider will look at your CRP results along with the results of other tests, your symptoms, and medical history.\n\nIn general, healthy people have very low amounts of CRP in their blood. Any increases above normal mean you have inflammation in your body. But labs measure CRP levels in different ways, and they define \"normal\" CRP ranges differently, so it's best to ask your provider what your results mean.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CRP test?**\n\nA CRP test is sometimes confused with a high-sensitivity-(hs) CRP test. They both measure CRP, but they are used for different conditions. An hs-CRP test measures very tiny increases in your CRP levels. It is used to estimate your risk of heart disease.\n\n---\n\n**C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is a CRP test?**\n\nA C-Reactive Protein (CRP) test is a blood test that measures the amount of CRP in your blood.

But labs measure CRP levels in different ways, and they define \"normal\" CRP ranges differently, so it's best to ask your provider what your results mean.\n\n\\n\\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CRP test?**\n\nA CRP test is sometimes confused with a high-sensitivity-(hs) CRP test. They both measure CRP, but they are used for different conditions. An hs-CRP test measures very tiny increases in your CRP levels. It is used to estimate your risk of heart disease.\n\n---\n\n**C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test**\n\nThe C-Reactive Protein (CRP) test is a blood test that measures the level of CRP in the blood. It is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. There are two types of CRP tests: a standard CRP test and an hs-CRP test.\n\n**What does the CRP test measure?**\n\nThe CRP test measures the level of C-reactive protein, a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. The test is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body.\n\n**When is the CRP test used?**\n\nThe CRP test is used to diagnose and monitor various conditions, including:\n\n* Sepsis\n* Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\n* Infections, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis\n* Cancer\n\n**What are the differences between a standard CRP test and an hs-CRP test?**\n\nA standard CRP test measures the level of CRP in the blood. An hs-CRP test measures very tiny increases in CRP levels. The hs-CRP test is used to estimate the risk of heart disease.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* InformedHealth.org\n* LabCorp\n* Mayo Clinic\n* National Cancer Institute\n* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n* Nehring SM, Goyal A, Patel BC.

    "content": "**C-reactive Protein**\n\n_C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation in the body._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed, most often taken from a vein through a procedure called venipuncture.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe CRP test is a general test to check for inflammation in the body. It is not a specific test, meaning it can reveal that you have inflammation somewhere in your body, but it cannot pinpoint the exact location or reason. The CRP test is often done with the ESR (erythrocyte or sedimentation rate) test which also looks for inflammation.\n\nYou may have this test to:\n\n* Check for flare-ups of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or vasculitis.\n* Determine if anti-inflammatory medicine is working to treat a disease or condition.\n\nA more sensitive CRP test, called a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) assay, is available to determine a person's risk for heart disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal CRP values vary from lab to lab. The levels often increase slightly with age, female sex and in African Americans. The majority of healthy adults have levels less than 0.3 mg/dL.\n\nHowever, a low CRP level does not always mean that there is no inflammation present. Levels of CRP may not be increased in people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The reason for this is unknown.\n\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIt is unclear if a minor rise of 0.3 to 1 mg/dL in CRP levels is a cause for concern. The hs-CRP is more precise and may be used to further understand these results.\n\nCRP levels from 1 mg/dL to 10 mg/dL are thought to be a moderate increase.\nCRP Levels greater than 10 mg/dL are considered a marked increase.\n\nA positive test means you have inflammation in the body. The cause of a high CRP cannot always be determined. Some include:\n\n* Cancer\n* Heart attack\n* Infection\n* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n* Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and related diseases\n* Rheumatic fever\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, results of the hs-CRP can be interpreted as follows:\n\n* You are at low risk of developing cardiovascular disease if your hs-CRP level is lower than 1.0 mg/L.\n* You are at average risk of developing cardiovascular disease if your levels are between 1.0 mg/L and 3.0 mg/L.\n* You are at high risk for cardiovascular disease if your hs-CRP level is higher than 3.0 mg/L.\n\nNote: Positive CRP results also occur during the last half of pregnancy or with the use of birth control pills (oral contraceptives).\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**C-reactive Protein (CRP)**\n\n**What is CRP?**\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein produced by the liver that rises when there is inflammation in the body.

This method of childbirth has been used for centuries, but its popularity has increased significantly over the past few decades.\n\n\\n\\n**Why are C-Sections Performed?**\n\nC-sections are typically performed when there are complications with vaginal delivery or when it is deemed safer for the mother or baby to deliver surgically. Some common reasons for performing a C-section include:\n\n*   **Placenta previa**: A condition where the placenta covers the cervix, making vaginal delivery impossible.\n*   **Abruptio placentae**: A condition where the placenta separates from the uterus, causing bleeding and potentially harming the baby.\n*   **Vasa previa**: A condition where the umbilical cord is compressed or cut off during vaginal delivery, which can lead to fetal distress or death.\n*   **Subchorionic hemorrhage**: A condition where there is bleeding in the uterus that can cause complications during pregnancy.\n\n\\n\\n**How is a C-Section Performed?**\n\nA C-section typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  The mother is given anesthesia to numb the pain and relax her muscles.\n2.  An incision is made in the abdomen, usually above the pubic bone.\n3.  A second incision is made in the uterus to deliver the baby.\n4.  The baby is carefully removed from the uterus and handed over to a pediatrician for examination and care.\n5.  The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the Benefits of C-Sections?**\n\nC-sections have several benefits, including:\n\n*   **Reduced risk of complications**: C-sections can reduce the risk of complications during vaginal delivery, such as fetal distress or death.\n*   **Increased control**: C-sections allow for more control over the birth process, which can be beneficial for mothers who are anxious or have had previous traumatic experiences.\n*   **Improved outcomes**: C-sections have been shown to improve outcomes for both mothers and babies, particularly in cases where vaginal delivery is not possible.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the Risks of C-Sections?**\n\nWhile C-sections are generally safe, there are some risks associated with this procedure, including:\n\n*   **Infection**: As with any surgical procedure, there is a risk of infection with a C-section.\n*   **Bleeding**: There is a risk of bleeding during or after the procedure.\n*   **Adhesions**: There is a risk of adhesions forming in the abdomen, which can cause pain and discomfort.\n\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\n\nC-sections are a common method of childbirth that has been used for centuries. While there are some risks associated with this procedure, the benefits far outweigh the risks. If you are considering a C-section, it is essential to discuss your options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.",

You may see it called other names, such as Clostridioides difficile (the new name), Clostridium difficile (an older name), and C. difficile. It causes close to half a million illnesses each year.\n\n**What causes C. diff infections?**\n\nC. diff bacteria are commonly found in the environment, but people usually only get C. diff infections when they are taking antibiotics. That's because antibiotics not only wipe out bad germs, but they also kill the good germs that protect your body against infections. The effect of antibiotics can last as long as several months. If you come in contact with C. diff germs during this time, you can get sick. You are more likely to get a C. diff infection if you take antibiotics for more than a week.\n\n**Who is more likely to get a C. diff infection?**\n\nYou are at more likely to get a C. diff infection if you:\n\n* Are taking antibiotics\n* Are 65 or older\n* Recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home\n* Have a weakened immune system\n* Have had a previous infection with C. diff or were exposed to it\n\n**What are the symptoms of C. diff infections?**\n\nThe symptoms of C. diff infections include:\n\n* Diarrhea (loose, watery stools) or frequent bowel movements for several days\n* Fever\n* Stomach tenderness or pain\n* Loss of appetite\n* Nausea\n\nSevere diarrhea causes you to lose a lot of fluids. This can put you at risk for dehydration.\n\n**How are C. diff infections diagnosed?**\n\nIf you have been taking antibiotics recently and have symptoms of a C. diff infection, you should see your health care provider. Your provider will ask about your symptoms and do a lab test of your stool. In some cases, you might also need an imaging test such as an x-ray or CT scan to check for complications.\n\n**What are the treatments for C. diff infections?**\n\nCertain antibiotics can treat C. diff infections. If you were already taking a different antibiotic when you got C. diff, your provider may ask you to stop taking that one.\n\nIf you have a severe case, you may need to stay in the hospital. If you have very severe pain or serious complications, you may need surgery to remove the diseased part of your colon.\n\nAbout 1 in 6 people who have had a C. diff infection will get it again within the following 2 to 8 weeks. This is called recurrent C. diff. It could be that your original infection came back or that you have a new infection. Contact your provider if your symptoms come back.\n\nFor people who keep getting C. diff infections, treatments such as fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have shown promising results. FMT uses stool (or bacteria from stool) from a healthy donor to try to restore the balance of healthy bacteria in your intestines.\n\n**Can C. diff infections be prevented?**\n\nThere are steps you can take to try to prevent getting or spreading C. diff:\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom and before you eat.\n* If you have diarrhea, clean the bathroom that you used before anyone else uses it. Use bleach mixed with water or another disinfectant to clean the toilet seat, handle, and lid.\n\nHealth care providers can also help prevent C. diff infections by taking infection control precautions and improving how they prescribe antibiotics.\n\n---\n\n**C. diff Infections**\n\n**What is C. diff?**\n\nC. diff, also known as Clostridioides difficile, is a bacterium that can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis.\n\n**How common are C. diff infections?**\n\nClose to half a million illnesses occur each year due to C. diff infections.\n\n**Who is at risk for C. diff infections?**\n\nYou are more likely to get a C. diff infection if you take antibiotics for more than a week, especially if you have been taking antibiotics recently and have symptoms of a C. diff infection.\n\n**How do I prevent getting or spreading C. diff?**\n\nThere are steps you can take to try to prevent getting or spreading C. diff:\n\n*   Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom and before you eat.\n*   If you have diarrhea, clean the bathroom that you used before anyone else uses it.

Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for C. diff testing.\n\n**Risks to Testing**\n\nThere is no known risk to having C. diff testing.\n\n**Interpreting Results**\n\nA positive (abnormal) test result may mean that toxins from C. diff bacteria are causing your symptoms. A negative (normal) test result generally means that no signs of a C. diff infection were found in your sample.\n\n**Treatment for C. diff Infection**\n\nIf you're diagnosed with a C. diff infection while you're taking an antibiotic for another infection, your provider may tell you to stop taking it. Your treatment may include:\n\n* Taking a different type of antibiotic that targets C. diff bacteria\n* Fluids if you are dehydrated\n\n**Preventing Future Infections**\n\nTo lower your chance of getting or spreading C. diff:\n\n* Avoid taking antibiotics that you don't really need.\n* Let all your providers know if you've had a C. diff infection, including your dentist.\n* Wash your hands with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and before you eat anything.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About C. diff Testing?**\n\nAfter treatment for a C. diff infection, you won't be tested again to see if you're cured. That's because it's common to still have C. diff in your body after you get better.\n\n---\n\n**C. Diff Testing**\n\nC. diff testing checks a sample of your stool (poop) for signs of an infection with a bacteria called C. diff.\n\n**What is C. Diff?**\n\nC. diff is also called C. difficile or Clostridioides difficile. It used to be called Clostridium difficile.\n\n**Symptoms of C. Diff Infection**\n\nA C. diff infection affects your large intestine and can cause symptoms that range from mild diarrhea to serious dehydration and colitis (inflammation in your colon). In rare cases, a C. diff infection can become life-threatening.\n\n**How is C. Diff Spread?**\n\nC. diff bacteria are common in the environment, and it's in the stool of people who have the bacteria. If a person with a C. diff infection doesn't wash their hands well after using the bathroom, tiny amounts of contaminated stool can get on anything or anyone that they touch.\n\n**Who is at Risk?**\n\nYou may be at risk if you:\n\n* Have taken antibiotics within the last six to eight weeks.\n* Are aged 65 or older.\n* Have recently stayed in or worked at a hospital, nursing home, or other health care facility.\n* Have a weakened immune system from a health condition such as HIV or certain medicines or treatments.\n* Had C. diff in the past.\n\n**What Happens During C. Diff Testing?**\n\nYou will need to provide a fresh sample of loose or liquid stool for your test. Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for C. diff testing.\n\n**What Happens After the Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order more than one type of C. diff test to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**C. diff Testing: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Category:** health\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for C. diff testing.\n\nThere is no known risk to having C. diff testing.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThere are several tests for C. diff that check for different signs of infection in your stool sample. Your provider may order a combination or two or more types of tests along with tests for other conditions that can cause diarrhea. Your provider will consider all your test results, your symptoms, and your medical history to figure out whether C. diff is causing your illness.\n\nIn general:\n\n* A positive (abnormal) test result may mean that toxins from C. diff bacteria are causing your symptoms.\n* You may be diagnosed with C. diff if your tests show that your sample contained:\n\t+ C. diff toxin genes\n\t+ C. diff toxins (types A and B)\n* A negative (normal) test result generally means that no signs of a C. diff infection were found in your sample. Your symptoms are probably caused by something else.\n* But a negative result on a C. diff toxin test alone isn't enough to rule out a C. diff infection. That's because C. diff toxins can break down quickly if your sample isn't kept cool.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you're diagnosed with a C. diff infection while you're taking an antibiotic for another infection, your provider may tell you to stop taking it. Your treatment may include:\n\n* Taking a different type of antibiotic that targets C. diff bacteria\n* Fluids if you are dehydrated\n* Some people may take probiotics, a type of supplement that might support good bacteria in your digestive system. But researchers aren't sure if these supplements are helpful.\n* If C. diff infections keep returning after treatment, talk with your provider. There are treatments that can help reduce the chance that C. diff will come back.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo lower your chance of getting or spreading C. diff:\n\n* Avoid taking antibiotics that you don't really need.\n* Let all your providers know if you've had a C. diff infection, including your dentist. This information will help them make decisions if you need antibiotics in the future.\n* Wash your hands with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and before you eat anything. C. diff is contagious.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about C. diff testing?**\n\nAfter treatment for a C. diff infection, you won't be tested again to see if you're cured. That's because it's common to still have C. diff in your body after you get better. A test would only show that the bacteria is still there, but not whether you're likely to get sick again.\n\n---\n\n**C. diff Testing**\n\nAre you wondering how to test for C. diff? Well, let me tell you - it's not that simple. A test would only show that the bacteria is still there, but not whether you're likely to get sick again. So, what can you do to lower your chance of getting or spreading C. diff?\n\n**Lower Your Chance**\n\nTo lower your chance of getting or spreading C. diff:\n\n*   Get treated for any underlying medical conditions\n*   Practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and thoroughly\n*   Avoid taking antibiotics unless absolutely necessary\n*   Consider fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) if you've had recurrent C. diff infections\n\n**References**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about C. diff testing and treatment, here are some reliable sources:\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov))\n*   Familydoctor.org ([familydoctor.org](http://familydoctor.org))\n*   Harvard Health Publishing: Harvard Medical School ([www.health.harvard.edu](http://www.health.harvard.edu))\n*   Infectious Diseases Society of America ([www.idsociety.org](http://www.idsociety.org))\n*   Johns Hopkins Medicine ([www.hopkinsmedicine.org](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org))\n*   Mayo Clinic ([www.mayoclinic.org](http://www.mayoclinic.org))\n*   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ([www.niddk.nih.gov](http://www.niddk.nih.gov))\n*   Saint Luke's ([www.saintlukeskc.org](http://www.saintlukeskc.org))\n*   Testing.com ([www.testing.com](http://www.testing.com))\n*   UF Health: University of Florida Health ([ufhealth.org](http://ufhealth.org))\n*   University of Rochester Medical Center ([www.urmc.rochester.edu](http://www.urmc.rochester.edu))\n*   UW Health ([patient.uwhealth.org](http://patient.uwhealth.org))\n*   Wolters Kluwer ([www.uptodate.com](http://www.uptodate.com))\n\nRemember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.",

    "content": "**C1 Esterase Inhibitor**\n\n**What is C1 esterase inhibitor?**\n\nC1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is a protein found in the fluid part of your blood. It controls a protein called C1, which is part of the complement system.\n\n**The Complement System**\n\nThe complement system is a group of nearly 60 proteins in blood plasma or on the surface of some cells. The complement proteins work with your immune system to protect the body from infections. They also help remove dead cells and foreign material. There are nine major complement proteins, labeled C1 through C9.\n\n**Hereditary Angioedema**\n\nYou may need this test if you have signs of hereditary or acquired angioedema, which is a type of tissue swelling. Both forms of angioedema are caused by low levels of C1-INH. Hereditary angioedema affects children and young adults under age 20, while acquired angioedema is seen in adults older than age 40.\n\n**Autoimmune Diseases**\n\nComplement factors may also be important in testing for autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. This is most often taken through a vein using a procedure called venipuncture.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed before taking this test.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Your health care provider will also measure the functional activity level of your C1 esterase inhibitor. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nLow levels of C1-INH may cause certain types of angioedema, which can result in sudden swelling of the tissues of the face, upper throat, and tongue. It may also cause difficulty breathing, swelling in the intestine, and abdominal pain.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Test**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken).\n\n---\n\n**C1 Esterase Inhibitor**\n\n**What is C1 esterase inhibitor?**\n\nC1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is a protein found in the fluid part of your blood.

The complement proteins work with your immune system to protect the body from infections. They also help remove dead cells and foreign material. There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of some complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders.\n\n**How is C1 esterase inhibitor measured?**\n\nA blood sample is needed to measure the amount of C1-INH in your blood. This is most often taken through a vein using a procedure called venipuncture.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed before taking this test.\n\n**What does the test feel like?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain, while others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation.

It may also cause difficulty breathing. Swelling in the intestine and abdominal pain may also occur. There are two types of angioedema that result from decreased levels of C1-INH: hereditary angioedema affects children and young adults under age 20, while acquired angioedema is seen in adults older than age 40.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection.\n\n---\n\n**C1 Esterase Inhibitor**\n\n**What is C1 esterase inhibitor?**\n\nC1 esterase inhibitor, also known as C1-INH, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the complement system, which is part of the immune system. It helps regulate the activity of the complement system and prevents excessive inflammation.\n\n**Types of C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency**\n\nThere are two main types of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency:\n\n*   **Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)**: A rare genetic disorder characterized by recurring episodes of severe swelling, particularly in the skin and mucous membranes.\n*   **Acquired C1-INH Deficiency**: A condition that occurs when the body's immune system produces antibodies against C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to a decrease in its levels.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Swelling**: Recurring episodes of severe swelling, particularly in the skin and mucous membranes.\n*   **Abdominal Pain**: Severe abdominal pain that may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.\n*   **Shortness of Breath**: Difficulty breathing due to swelling in the lungs or airways.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency typically involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical Examination**: A thorough examination to assess the severity of symptoms and identify any signs of organ dysfunction.\n*   **Laboratory Tests**: Blood tests to measure C1 esterase inhibitor levels, as well as other tests to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Corticosteroids**: Medications that help reduce inflammation and swelling.\n*   **Antihistamines**: Medications that can help alleviate symptoms such as itching and hives.\n*   **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**: A treatment that involves infusing plasma from healthy donors to replace deficient C1 esterase inhibitor.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency varies depending on the type and severity of the condition. With proper treatment and management, many people can lead normal lives despite their condition. However, some individuals may experience more severe symptoms or complications, which can impact their quality of life.",

    "content": "**CA 19-9 Blood Test (Pancreatic Cancer)**\n\nWhat is a CA 19-9 blood test?\n\nA CA 19-9 test measures the amount of a protein called CA 19-9 (cancer antigen 19-9) in a sample of your blood. CA 19-9 is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in your body.\n\nHealthy people can have small amounts of CA 19-9 in their blood. High levels of CA 19-9 are often a sign of pancreatic cancer. But high levels can also be a sign of other types of cancer or certain conditions that aren't cancer. For example, gallstones and cirrhosis of the liver can cause high CA 19-9 levels.\n\nBecause high levels of CA 19-9 can mean different things, the test is not used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer or other diseases. But it can help monitor your cancer and check how well your treatment is working.\n\nOther names: cancer antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, CA 199 measurement, CA 19-9 radioimmunoassay (RIA)\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\n* Monitor certain types of cancer and cancer treatment. CA 19-9 levels often go up as cancer grows and go down as tumors shrink.\n* Help predict how cancer may behave over time.\n* Check whether cancer has returned after treatment.\n* Help diagnose certain cancers and other diseases when used with other tests.\n\nSome people do not make CA 19-9 even when they have a cancer that usually produces high levels of CA 19-9. For these people, a CA 19-9 tumor marker test is not useful.\n\nWhy do I need a CA 19-9 test?\n\nYou may need a CA 19-9 blood test if you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or another type of cancer that causes high CA 19-9. These include cancers of the:\n\n* Bile duct\n* Colon and rectum\n* Stomach\n* Ovaries\n* Bladder\n\nDuring cancer treatment, your health care provider may test you on a regular basis to see if your treatment is working.\n\nWhat happens during a CA 19-9 blood test?\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nUsually, you don't need any special preparations for a CA 19-9 blood test. But ask your provider to be sure. If you take certain vitamins, you may need to stop them before the test.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nIf you're being treated for cancer, you may be tested several times during your treatment. Your provider will look at all your test results to see how your CA 19-9 levels have changed. Your results may show:\n\n* Your levels of CA 19-9 are increasing. This may mean your tumor is growing, and/or your treatment is not working.\n* Your levels of CA 19-9 are decreasing. This may mean your tumor is shrinking and your treatment is working.\n* Your levels of CA 19-9 have stayed the same. This may mean your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse.\n* Your CA 19-9 levels decreased after treatment, but increased later. This may mean your cancer has come back or grown.\n\nIf you don't have cancer but your test results show a high level of CA 19-9, you may not have a health problem that needs treatment. Healthy people can have high CA 19-9 levels. But high levels may be a sign of a condition, such as:\n\n* Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas\n* Gallstones\n* Bile duct disease, including a blockage or infection\n* Liver disease\n* Cystic fibrosis\n\nTalk with your provider about what your results may mean.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about a CA 19-9 test?\n\nLabs use different methods to measure the amount of CA 19-9 in your blood sample. The test method can affect your results. If you're having regular tests to monitor cancer, it's important to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab. This allows your provider to compare your results over time. Your test report usually says what method was used to measure your CA 19-9 levels. If you have any questions about how your tests are done, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**CA 19-9 Blood Test (Pancreatic Cancer)**\n\n**What is a CA 19-9 blood test?**\n\nA CA 19-9 blood test measures the level of a protein called carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in your blood. This protein is often found in people with pancreatic cancer, but it can also be elevated in other types of cancer and certain health conditions.\n\n**Who needs a CA 19-9 blood test?**\n\nYou may need a CA 19-9 blood test if you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or another type of cancer that causes high CA 19-9 levels. These include cancers of the:\n\n* Bile duct\n* Colon and rectum\n* Stomach\n* Ovaries\n* Bladder\n\nDuring cancer treatment, your health care provider may test you on a regular basis to see if your treatment is working.\n\nAfter your treatment is complete, you may need to have CA 19-9 tests to check whether the cancer has come back. High levels of CA 19-9 may be one of the first signs that cancer cells are growing again.\n\n**What happens during a CA 19-9 blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

    "content": "**CA-125 Blood Test (Ovarian Cancer)**\n\n\\n\\nThis test measures the amount of a protein called CA-125 (cancer antigen 125) in a sample of your blood. CA-125 is a type of tumor marker. High levels of certain tumor markers in your blood may be a sign of cancer. If you have cancer, measuring certain tumor markers may help provide important information about how to treat your disease.\n\n\\n\\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CA-125 blood test may be used:\n\n*   To see if ovarian cancer treatment is working and to check for ovarian cancer that has come back. This is the most common use of CA-125 blood testing.\n*   To learn more about a growth or lump in your pelvis (the area below your belly). If a suspicious lump shows up on imaging, such as an ultrasound, your health care provider may check your CA-125 levels along with other tests to find out whether the lump could be ovarian cancer. But a CA-125 blood test alone can't diagnose cancer.\n*   To screen for ovarian cancer if you're risk is very high. If your family health history includes ovarian cancer, your provider may suggest a CA-125 blood test and other tests to look for signs of cancer. But a CA-125 test is not used as a routine screening test for people who don't have a high risk for ovarian cancer. That's because many common conditions that aren't cancer can also cause high CA-125 levels, such as endometriosis or even a menstrual period.\n\n\\n\\n**Why do I need a CA-125 blood test?**\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have several CA-125 blood tests:\n\n*   During your treatment to see if your cancer is going away. If CA-125 levels go down, it usually means your treatment is working\n*   After your treatment, to check whether your cancer has returned\n\n\\n\\n**What happens during a CA-125 blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

Together, you can discuss how your results affect your diagnosis, treatment, and need for more testing.\n\n\\n\\nIn general:\n\n*   If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, and the results of several tests show that your CA-125 levels are going down, it usually means that the treatment is helping. If your levels go up or stay the same over time, it may mean that the treatment isn't working.\n*   If you have finished your treatment for ovarian cancer and your CA-125 levels begin to increase over time, your cancer may be coming back.\n*   If you have a high risk for ovarian cancer or have a suspicious pelvic lump, a high CA-125 levels could be a sign of cancer. Your provider will usually order more tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\nA high CA-125 level doesn't always mean cancer. Other conditions may increase CA-125, including:\n\n*   Endometriosis\n*   Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n*   Uterine fibroids\n*   Liver disease\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Your menstrual period, at certain times during your cycle\n\n\\n\\nA normal CA-125 test result doesn't rule out ovarian cancer.

    "content": "**CA-125 Blood Test**\n\nThe CA-125 blood test measures the level of the protein CA-125 in the blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. A healthcare professional will insert a needle into a vein in your arm to draw out a sample of blood.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo preparation is necessary before taking this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted, some people may feel moderate pain, while others may only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but this usually goes away quickly.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCA-125 is a protein that is found more in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. This blood test is often used to monitor women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It's useful if the CA-125 level was high when the cancer was first diagnosed, as measuring the CA-125 over time can help determine if treatment is working.\n\nThe CA-125 test may also be done if a woman has symptoms or findings on ultrasound that suggest ovarian cancer. However, this test is not used to screen healthy women for ovarian cancer when a diagnosis has not yet been made.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA level above 35 U/mL is considered abnormal. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, so it's essential to discuss the meaning of your specific test results with your doctor.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIn a woman who has ovarian cancer, a rise in CA-125 usually indicates that the disease has progressed or come back (recurred). A decrease in CA-125 typically means the disease is responding to current treatment.\n\nIn a woman who hasn't been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, a rise in CA-125 may indicate other types of cancer or several other diseases, such as endometriosis. In healthy women, an elevated CA-125 usually doesn't mean ovarian cancer is present; most healthy women with an elevated CA-125 do not have ovarian cancer or any other cancer.\n\nAny woman with an abnormal CA-125 test needs further tests, which may include surgery to confirm the cause.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other, making it more challenging for some people to have a blood sample drawn. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**CA-125 Blood Test**\n\n**What is the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nThe CA-125 blood test measures the level of a protein called CA-125 in your blood.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the CA-125 test performed?**\n\nThe CA-125 test is often used to monitor women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The test is useful if the CA-125 level was high when the cancer was first diagnosed. In these cases, measuring the CA-125 over time is a good tool to determine if ovarian cancer treatment is working.\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\n\nIn a woman who has ovarian cancer, a rise in CA-125 usually means that the disease has progressed or come back (recurred). A decrease in CA-125 usually means the disease is responding to current treatment.\n\nIn a woman who has not been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, a rise in CA-125 may mean a number of things. While it may mean that she has ovarian cancer, it can also indicate other types of cancer, as well as several other diseases, such as endometriosis, which are not cancer.\n\n**What are the risks associated with the test?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**What is the normal value range for CA-125?**\n\nA level above 35 U/mL is considered abnormal. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n---\n\n**CA-125 Blood Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nThe CA-125 blood test measures the level of a protein called cancer antigen 125 in your blood. This protein is often found in people with ovarian cancer, but it can also be present in people without the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is the CA-125 blood test used?**\n\nThe CA-125 blood test is sometimes used to help diagnose ovarian cancer, particularly in women who are experiencing symptoms such as bloating, pelvic pain, or difficulty eating. However, it's essential to note that this test is not 100% accurate and can produce false positives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the limitations of the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nThe CA-125 blood test has several limitations:\n\n*   It is not a definitive diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer.\n*   It can produce false positives, leading to unnecessary follow-up tests and procedures.\n*   It may not detect ovarian cancer in its early stages.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the potential risks of using the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nThe potential risks of using the CA-125 blood test include:\n\n*   False positives, which can lead to unnecessary testing and procedures.\n*   Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of ovarian cancer.\n*   Emotional distress and anxiety caused by false positive results.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the alternatives to the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nIf you're considering using the CA-125 blood test for ovarian cancer screening, it's essential to discuss alternative options with your healthcare provider. These may include:\n\n*   Pelvic exam: A physical examination of your pelvis can help detect abnormalities in the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\n*   Imaging tests: Ultrasound or CT scans can help visualize the ovaries and detect any abnormalities.\n*   Other biomarkers: Researchers are exploring other biomarkers, such as HE4 and mesothelin, which may be more accurate than CA-125 for detecting ovarian cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I get the most accurate results from the CA-125 blood test?**\n\nTo get the most accurate results from the CA-125 blood test, it's essential to:\n\n*   Discuss your symptoms and medical history with your healthcare provider.\n*   Understand the limitations of the test and its potential risks.\n*   Consider alternative screening options, such as pelvic exams or imaging tests.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the latest developments in ovarian cancer screening?**\n\nResearchers are continually exploring new biomarkers and screening methods for ovarian cancer. Some of the latest developments include:\n\n*   Liquid biopsy: A non-invasive test that can detect cancer cells in your blood.\n*   Artificial intelligence: Researchers are using AI to analyze imaging tests and detect abnormalities more accurately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Where can I find more information about ovarian cancer screening?**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about ovarian cancer screening, consider the following resources:\n\n*   American Cancer Society: A trusted source for information on cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n*   National Ovarian Cancer Coalition: A organization dedicated to raising awareness and funding research for ovarian cancer.\n*   Your healthcare provider: Discuss your concerns and questions with your healthcare provider, who can provide personalized guidance and support.",

    "content": "**CCP Antibody Test**\n\nThis test looks for CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies in your blood. CCP antibodies, also called anti-CCP antibodies, are a type of antibody called autoantibodies. Antibodies and autoantibodies are proteins made by the immune system:\n\n*   **Antibodies protect you from disease** by fighting foreign substances like viruses and bacteria.\n*   **Autoantibodies like CCP antibodies are abnormal proteins**. Instead of protecting your body, they attack your body's healthy cells by mistake.\n\nCCP antibodies target healthy tissues in the joints. Joints are places in your body where two bones meet, such as your elbows, wrists, and knees. If CCP antibodies are found in your blood, it can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that gets worse over time. It causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and a loss of function in your joints.\n\nCCP antibodies are found in most people who have rheumatoid arthritis. They are almost never found in people who don't have the disease.\n\n**Other names:** Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, anticitrullinated peptide antibody, citrulline antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-CCP antibody, ACPA\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CCP antibody test is used to help diagnose or rule out rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIt's often done along with or after a rheumatoid factor (RF) test. Rheumatoid factors are another type of autoantibody. RF tests used to be the main test to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. However, RF factors can be found in people with other autoimmune diseases and even in some healthy people. And some people with RA have little to no RF factors. Doing both tests provides a more accurate diagnosis than only using RF testing results.\n\n**Why do I need a CCP antibody test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include:\n\n*   Joint pain\n*   Joint stiffness, especially in the morning\n*   Joint swelling\n*   Fatigue\n*   Low-grade fever\n\nYou may also need this test if other tests couldn't confirm or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**What happens during a CCP antibody test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nBe sure to tell your provider about all medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements you are taking. You may need to stop taking certain substances for 8 hours before your test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your CCP antibody results were positive, it means these antibodies were found in your blood. A negative result means no CCP antibodies were found. The meaning of these results may depend on the results of a rheumatoid factor (RF) test as well as a physical exam.\n\nIf you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and your results show:\n\n*   **Positive CCP antibodies and positive RF**, it means that you probably have rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Positive CCP antibodies and negative RF**, it could mean you are in the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis or will develop it in the future.\n*   **Negative CCP antibodies and negative RF**, it means you are less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Your provider may need to do more tests to help find out what is causing your symptoms.\n\nSometimes, CCP antibodies may be found in other conditions such as:\n\n*   Other autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome or lupus\n*   Active tuberculosis (TB)\n*   Chronic lung disease\n\nTo understand the results of a CCP antibody test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, physical exam, and the results of other tests.\n\n---\n\n**CCP Antibody Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is the CCP antibody test?**\n\nThe CCP antibody test is a blood test used to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis.

Your provider may need to do more tests to help find out what is causing your symptoms.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a CCP antibody test?**\n\nRheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose, especially in its early stages. Your provider may order one or more tests in addition to CCP antibody and RF tests. These include x-rays of your joints and the following blood tests:\n\n* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\n* Synovial fluid analysis\n* C-reactive protein\n* Antinuclear antibody\n\nThese blood tests can show increased protein in the blood, which may be a sign of having a medical condition that causes inflammation. Inflammation can be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**References**\n\nAbdul Wahab A, Mohammad M, Rahman MM, Mohamed Said MS.

It measures the presence of cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in the blood.\n*   **How does the CCP antibody test work?**\n    The test detects the presence of autoantibodies, which are proteins produced by the immune system that attack healthy tissues. In RA, the immune system produces autoantibodies against the joints, leading to inflammation and damage.\n*   **What is the purpose of an anti-CCP test?**\n    The primary purpose of an anti-CCP test is to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis in patients with joint symptoms. It can also be used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Autoimmune Diseases\n*   Immune System and Disorders\n*   Joint Disorders\n*   Rheumatoid Arthritis",

    "content": "**CD4 Lymphocyte Count**\n\nWhat is a CD4 count?\n\nA CD4 count is a blood test that measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that circulates throughout the body in the blood. They're also called CD4 T lymphocytes or \"helper T cells.\" That's because they help fight infection by triggering your immune system to destroy viruses, bacteria, and other germs that may make you sick.\n\nA CD4 count is mostly used to check the health of your immune system if you are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\n\nHIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells. Without treatment, HIV may destroy so many CD4 cells that your immune system will have trouble fighting off infections. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). AIDS is the most serious stage of an HIV infection. If you have AIDS, your CD4 count is so low that you may develop serious infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungi that usually don't cause problems in healthy people. These are called \"opportunistic infections,\" and they can become life-threatening. AIDS increases your risk of developing certain cancers, too.\n\nMost people with HIV don't have AIDS. And if they take their HIV medicine as prescribed, they may never develop AIDS.\n\nIf you have HIV, a CD4 count can help your health care provider check your risk for serious infections. A CD4 count may also be used to help diagnose and monitor certain other conditions that affect your immune system.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nIf you have HIV, a CD4 count may be used to:\n\n* See how HIV is affecting your immune system\n* Help check how well HIV treatment is working\n* Help check the stage of HIV and diagnose AIDS\n\nA CD4 count may also be used to:\n\n* Monitor treatment after an organ transplant\n* Help diagnose different types of lymphoma\n* Help diagnose DiGeorge syndrome\n\n**Why do I need a CD4 count?**\n\nYour provider may order a CD4 count when you are first diagnosed with HIV. You will probably be tested again every few months to see if your counts have changed since your first test.\n\nIf you are taking medicine for HIV, your provider may order regular CD4 counts with an HIV viral load test to see how well your medicines are working.\n\n**What happens during a CD4 count?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nCD4 results are usually given as a number of cells per cubic millimeter of blood. But labs may have different ways of describing \"normal\" CD4 counts. What's normal for you depends on your age, other health conditions, and the medicines you may take. That's why it's important to talk with your provider about what your test results mean.\n\nCD4 counts may change even when your health has not changed. So, your provider will usually look at a few test results over time to see if there's a trend in your CD4 counts.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with HIV, it's important to start treatment as soon as possible. If your CD4 count continues to decrease for many months, your provider may change your medicine and also may start preventive treatment for opportunistic infections. The goal of this is to increase or stabilize your CD4 count.\n\n**Ranges for CD4 counts**\n\n* Normal CD4 count for healthy adults and teens: 500 to 1,200 cells per cubic millimeter\n* Low CD4 count: Below 500 cells per cubic millimeter\n* If you have HIV, a low CD4 count means that HIV has weakened your immune system. A CD4 count of 200 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter means that you have AIDS.\n* High CD4 Count: Counts above the normal range may be a sign of an infection or a blood cancer.\n\n---\n\n**CD4 Lymphocyte Count**\n\nA CD4 count is a blood test that measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of your blood.

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nCD4 results are usually given as a number of cells per cubic millimeter of blood.

In fact, CD4 counts usually increase with these medicines, which helps keep you healthy. If you are living with HIV, it's crucial to take your medicine as prescribed and get regular blood tests, including CD4 counts.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests**\n\n*   Reference ranges\n*   Understanding results\n\n**What's Normal for You?**\n\nCD4 results are usually given as a number of cells per cubic millimeter of blood.
