It affects women more often than men. The reasons for the lack of symptoms are not well understood.\n\nYou are more likely to have this problem if you:\n\n* Have a urinary catheter in place\n* Are female\n* Are pregnant\n* Are sexually active (in females)\n* Have long-term diabetes and are female\n* Are an older adult\n* Have recently had a surgical procedure on your urinary tract\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere are no symptoms of this problem.\n\nIf you have these symptoms, you may have a urinary tract infection, but you do not have asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n\n* Burning during urination\n* Increased urgency to urinate\n* Increased frequency of urination\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose asymptomatic bacteriuria, a urine sample must be sent for a urine culture. Most people with no urinary tract symptoms do not need this test.\n\nYou may need a urine culture done as a screening test, even without symptoms, if:\n\n* You are pregnant\n* You have a surgery or procedure planned that involves the bladder, prostate, or other parts of the urinary tract\n\nTo make the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the culture must show a large growth of bacteria.\n\nIn men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteria.\nIn women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteria.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost people who have bacteria growing in their urine, but no symptoms, do not need treatment. This is because the bacteria are not causing any harm. In fact, treating people with this problem may make it harder to treat infections in the future.\n\nHowever, for some people getting a urinary tract infection is more likely or may cause more severe problems.

    "content": "**At-Home Medical Tests**\n\nAre you curious about the world of at-home medical tests? Look no further! In this article, we'll delve into the realm of home use tests, exploring what they are, how they're used, and the various types available.\n\n**What Are At-Home Medical Tests?**\n\nAt-home medical tests, also known as home use tests, are kits you can buy online or at your local pharmacy or supermarket. These kits allow you to test for, screen, or monitor certain diseases and conditions in the privacy of your own home. Common at-home tests can include:\n\n*   Pregnancy tests\n*   Blood glucose (blood sugar) tests, which may be used regularly to help you manage your diabetes\n*   Fecal occult blood tests, which screen for colon cancer\n*   Tests that check for signs of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and COVID-19\n*   Genetic tests, which may show if you are at higher risk for certain diseases\n\n**How Are At-Home Medical Tests Used?**\n\nAt-home testing is frequently used to:\n\n*   Find or screen for disorders, such as high cholesterol or certain infections, before you have any symptoms. This may allow you to get treatment earlier and avoid serious complications.\n*   Help diagnose pregnancy early so you can take steps to care for your health and your baby's by scheduling an appointment with your provider.\n*   Monitor chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. This may allow you to make more quickly begin making treatment and/or lifestyle changes to improve your condition.\n\n**How Do I Use An At-Home Test?**\n\nThe specific instructions will vary, depending on the type and brand of the test kit. Below are examples of some common at-home tests and how they are performed.\n\n*   **Pregnancy Test**: Used to diagnose pregnancy by checking for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is normally only produced during pregnancy.\n    *   If possible, plan to do the test in the morning. Most pregnancy tests recommend using your first morning urine for more accurate results.\n    *   You will hold a test strip in your urine stream or collect your urine in a cup and place the test strip into the cup.\n    *   If you are pregnant, the strip will display a colored line, a double line, or a symbol such as a plus sign. The type of display depends on the brand.\n*   **Glucose Test**: Used to monitor blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This test is essential for some people with diabetes. If your blood glucose gets too high or too low for you, it can cause dangerous complications.\n    *   You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n    *   You place the blood on a test strip and insert it into a monitor.\n    *   The meter will show your glucose level.\n*   **Fecal Occult Blood Test**: Used to check stool for signs of colon cancer. Your provider will give you a test kit.\n    *   You will collect small stool samples and place them on a special card or container.\n    *   Seal and mail the card or container to your provider or a lab.\n*   **Hepatitis C Test**: Used to find out if you have hepatitis C now or were infected in the past.\n    *   You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n    *   You place the blood sample on a special piece of paper.\n    *   You will seal and mail the paper to a laboratory.\n*   **Genetic Test**: Used to find out if you may be at higher risk of cancer or other diseases by looking for certain genetic changes. Genetic tests may also be used to find out information about your ancestors.\n    *   You can order many of these tests yourself. Others require a provider's prescription.\n    *   Most test kits will instruct you to provide a saliva sample or to take a swab from the inside of your cheek.\n    *   You will mail the sample to the test company or as directed.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need To Know About At-Home Medical Tests?**\n\nAt-home medical tests can provide helpful information, but they are not a replacement for guidance and treatment by your provider. After at-home testing, you should follow up with your provider regardless of the result.\n\nIn addition, when purchasing and using an at-home test kit:\n\n*   Only use FDA-approved or FDA-authorized tests. The FDA has strict requirements for the quality and accuracy of home test kits.\n*   Follow the test instructions exactly. Even minor changes can affect your results.\n*   Don't buy or use expired tests. Chemicals in the test may lose their effectiveness over time.\n*   Don't change your medicines because of a test result without talking with your provider. Let your provider know about your results. They can tell you if you need to change your medicine or the dose you take based on your at-home test results.\n\nBy understanding what at-home medical tests are and how they're used, you can make informed decisions about your health and well-being.\n\n---\n\n**At-Home Medical Tests**\n\nAre you considering using at-home medical tests to check for signs of infectious diseases or monitor chronic conditions? Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Types of At-Home Tests**\n\nThere are two types of at-home tests:\n\n*   **Self-tests**: These involve taking a sample of a body fluid, such as blood, urine, or saliva, and applying it to the kit as directed. These tests provide immediate results.\n*   **Self-collection tests**: These also allow you to take your sample at home, but then you'll need to package it and mail it to a lab. You can get the results from your health care provider, or you may be able to get them in an online portal with a unique login and password.\n\n**How Are They Used?**\n\nAt-home testing is frequently used to:\n\n*   Find or screen for disorders, such as high cholesterol or certain infections, before you have any symptoms.\n*   Help diagnose pregnancy early so you can take steps to care for your health and your baby's by scheduling an appointment with your provider.\n*   Monitor chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n**How Do I Use An At-Home Test?**\n\nThe specific instructions will vary, depending on the type and brand of the test kit.

    "content": "**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease that affects the brain and other parts of the body. It is characterized by uncoordinated movements, such as walking, and enlarged blood vessels (telangiectasias) just below the surface of the skin.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder. The disease results from a variant in the ATM gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell growth and division.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia include:\n\n* Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood\n* Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12\n* Delayed walking\n* Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight\n* Enlarged blood vessels in the skin of the nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee\n* Jerky or abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) late in the disease\n* Premature graying of the hair\n* Seizures\n* Sensitivity to radiation, including x-rays\n* Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show signs of the following:\n\n* Tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen below normal size\n* Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes\n* Delayed or absent physical and sexual development\n* Growth failure\n* Mask-like face\n* Multiple skin coloring and texture changes\n\nPossible tests include:\n\n* Alpha fetoprotein\n* B and T cell screen\n* Carcinoembryonic antigen\n* Genetic testing to look for changes in the ATM gene\n* Glucose tolerance test\n* Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgA)\n* X-ray or CT scan to look at the size of the thymus gland\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia. Treatment is directed at specific symptoms.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with ataxia-telangiectasia condition and their families can be found at:\n\n* Ataxia Telangiectasia Children's Project: www.atcp.org\n* National Ataxia Foundation (NAF): www.ataxia.org\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEarly death is common, but life expectancy varies.

It is characterized by uncoordinated movements, such as walking, and enlarged blood vessels (telangiectasias) just below the surface of the skin.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait, meaning both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder. The variant in the ATM gene leads to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood\n* Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12\n* Delayed walking\n* Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight\n* Discoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots)\n* Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee\n* Enlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes\n* Jerky or abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) late in the disease\n* Premature graying of the hair\n* Seizures\n* Sensitivity to radiation, including x-rays\n* Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show signs of the following:\n\n* Tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen below normal size\n* Decreased to absent deep tendon reflexes\n* Delayed or absent physical and sexual development\n* Growth failure\n* Mask-like face\n* Multiple skin coloring and texture changes\n\nPossible tests include:\n\n* Alpha fetoprotein\n* B and T cell screen\n* Carcinoembryonic antigen\n* Genetic testing to look for changes in the ATM gene\n* Glucose tolerance test\n* Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgA)\n* X-ray or CT scan to look at the size of the thymus gland\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia.

Because people with this condition are very sensitive to radiation, they should never be given radiation therapy, and no unnecessary x-rays should be done.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Telangiectasia?**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other bodily systems. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms including ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels), and immunodeficiency.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia typically appear in early childhood and may include:\n\n*   **Ataxia**: Difficulty with motor skills, balance, and coordination\n*   **Telangiectasia**: Dilated blood vessels that can be seen on the skin or in other tissues\n*   **Immunodeficiency**: Weakened immune system that makes individuals more susceptible to infections\n*   **Cancer**: Increased risk of developing cancer, particularly lymphoma\n*   **Diabetes**: Some individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia may develop diabetes\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene for their child to have a chance of inheriting the condition.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ataxia-telangiectasia typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis. The diagnosis may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as ataxia and telangiectasia, and confirmed through genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ataxia-telangiectasia, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. These may include:\n\n*   **Supportive care**: Providing emotional support and helping individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia adapt to their condition\n*   **Infection prevention**: Implementing measures to prevent infections, such as vaccinations and antibiotics\n*   **Cancer screening**: Regularly monitoring for signs of cancer, particularly lymphoma\n*   **Diabetes management**: Managing diabetes through lifestyle changes and medication\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia is generally poor. Most children with the condition do not survive beyond early childhood due to the severity of their symptoms and the risk of complications. However, advances in medical care and supportive services have improved the quality of life for some individuals with this condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no way to prevent ataxia-telangiectasia, as it is a genetic disorder. However, couples with a family history of the condition who are considering pregnancy may want to consider genetic counseling to understand their risks and make informed decisions about their reproductive choices.",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/ataxia-neuropathy-spectrum/",
    "content": "**Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\n**Description**\n\nAtaxia neuropathy spectrum is part of a group of conditions called the POLG-related disorders. The conditions in this group feature a range of similar signs and symptoms involving muscle-, nerve-, and brain-related functions. Ataxia neuropathy spectrum now includes the conditions previously called mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO).\n\nAs the name implies, people with ataxia neuropathy spectrum typically have problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The neuropathy can be classified as sensory, motor, or a combination of the two (mixed). Sensory neuropathy causes numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs, and motor neuropathy refers to disturbance in the nerves used for muscle movement.\n\nMost people with ataxia neuropathy spectrum also have severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) and seizures. Some affected individuals have weakness of the external muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia), which leads to drooping eyelids (ptosis). Other signs and symptoms can include involuntary muscle twitches (myoclonus), liver disease, depression, migraine headaches, or blindness.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of ataxia neuropathy spectrum is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtaxia neuropathy spectrum is caused by mutations in the POLG gene or, rarely, the TWNK gene. The POLG gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ). The TWNK gene provides instructions for making a protein called Twinkle.

Although the mechanisms are unknown, mutations in the POLG gene often result in fewer copies of mtDNA (mtDNA depletion), and mutations in the TWNK gene often result in deletions of large regions of mtDNA (mtDNA deletion). MtDNA depletion or deletion occurs most commonly in muscle, brain, or liver cells.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtaxia neuropathy spectrum is caused by mutations in the POLG gene or, rarely, the TWNK gene.\n\n* The POLG gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ).\n* The TWNK gene provides instructions for making a protein called Twinkle.\n* Pol γ and Twinkle function in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nMutated pol γ or mutated Twinkle reduce mtDNA replication.

MtDNA depletion or deletion occurs most commonly in muscle, brain, or liver cells. MtDNA depletion causes a decrease in cellular energy, which could account for the signs and symptoms of ataxia neuropathy spectrum.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAtaxia neuropathy spectrum can have different inheritance patterns depending on the associated gene.\n\n* Mutations in the POLG gene cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n* Mutations in the TWNK gene cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nANS, MIRAS, Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome, SANDO\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Sensory ataxic neuropathy-dysarthria-ophthalmoparesis syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: SENSORY ATAXIC NEUROPATHY, DYSARTHRIA, AND OPHTHALMOPARESIS; SANDO\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\n**What is Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum?**\n\nAtaxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and ophthalmoparesis.

These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\nThere is no cure for ANS, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. This may include:\n\n* Physical therapy to improve mobility and balance\n* Occupational therapy to maintain independence\n* Speech therapy to improve communication\n* Medications to manage pain, muscle spasms, and other symptoms\n* Lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management\n\n**Prognosis of Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\nThe prognosis for ANS is generally poor, with most patients experiencing progressive deterioration of motor and sensory function. However, the rate of disease progression can vary significantly among individuals.\n\n**Genetic Testing for Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum**\n\nGenetic testing can identify mutations in the POLG gene, which can help diagnose ANS.

    "content": "**Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia**\n\n**Description**\n\nAtaxia with oculomotor apraxia is a condition characterized by problems with movement that worsen over time. The hallmark of this condition is poor coordination and balance (ataxia), which is often the first symptom. Most affected people also have oculomotor apraxia, which makes it difficult to move their eyes side-to-side. People with oculomotor apraxia have to turn their head to see things in their side (peripheral) vision.\n\n**Types of Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia**\n\nThere are several types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, the most common of which are types 1, 2, and 4. The types are very similar but are caused by mutations in different genes.\n\n* **Type 1**: Begins around age 4. In addition to ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, affected individuals can have involuntary jerking movements (chorea) or muscle twitches (myoclonus); these movement problems tend to disappear over time.\n* **Type 2**: Usually begins around age 15. As in type 1, affected individuals may have chorea or myoclonus, although these movement problems persist throughout life in type 2.\n* **Type 4**: Begins around age 4. In addition to ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, individuals with this type typically develop dystonia, which is involuntary, sustained muscle tensing that causes unusual positioning of body parts.\n\n**Blood Abnormalities**\n\nPeople with some types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia may have characteristic blood abnormalities. Individuals with type 1 tend to have reduced amounts of a protein called albumin, which transports molecules in the blood. The shortage of albumin likely results in elevated levels of cholesterol circulating in the bloodstream.\n\n**Intellectual Disability**\n\nIntelligence is usually not affected by ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, but some people with the condition have intellectual disability.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia**\n\n\\n\\nThere are several types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, the most common of which are types 1, 2, and 4.

Mutations in another gene cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 3.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtaxia with oculomotor apraxia is a rare condition. Types 1 and 4 are most frequent in Portugal, and type 1 is also found in Japan. Type 2 is estimated to occur in 1 in 900,000 individuals worldwide. Type 3 has been found in only one family.\n\n**Intellectual Disability**\n\nIntelligence is usually not affected by ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, but some people with the condition have intellectual disability.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia**\n\n**What is Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia?**\n\nAtaxia with oculomotor apraxia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system.

    "content": "**Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency**\n\nAtaxia with vitamin E deficiency is a disorder that impairs the body's ability to use vitamin E obtained from the diet. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means that it protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals.\n\n**Description**\n\nA shortage (deficiency) of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems, such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some people with this condition have developed an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss. Most people who have ataxia with vitamin E deficiency start to experience problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The movement problems tend to worsen with age.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtaxia with vitamin E deficiency is a rare condition; however, its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the TTPA gene cause ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. The TTPA gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain. This protein controls distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called α-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body. Vitamin E helps cells prevent damage that might be done by free radicals.\n\nTTPA gene mutations impair the activity of the αTTP protein, resulting in an inability to retain and use dietary vitamin E. As a result, vitamin E levels in the blood are greatly reduced and free radicals accumulate within cells. Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) are particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of free radicals and these cells die off when they are deprived of vitamin E. Nerve cell damage can lead to problems with movement and other features of ataxia with vitamin E deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency\n\nThe TTPA gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain.

The age when signs and symptoms begin, the severity of the condition, and the rate at which it worsens all vary among affected individuals.\n\n**Neurological Problems**\n\nPeople with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome have neurological problems associated with a loss of tissue (atrophy) and other changes in the cerebellum. These problems include:\n\n* Poor coordination and balance (ataxia)\n* Difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria)\n* Uncontrollable muscle contractions (clonus)\n* Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus)\n\nThese neurological issues worsen over time, making walking and other movements challenging. Some affected individuals eventually require wheelchair assistance.\n\n**Blood-Forming Cell Problems**\n\nAtaxia-pancytopenia syndrome also causes a shortage of one or more types of normal blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of all three of these cell types is known as pancytopenia. Pancytopenia can result in:\n\n* Extreme tiredness (fatigue) due to low numbers of red blood cells (anemia)\n* Frequent infections due to low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia)\n* Abnormal bleeding due to low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n\nAtaxia-pancytopenia syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of certain cancerous conditions of the blood, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome?**\n\nAtaxia-pancytopenia syndrome is a rare condition that affects the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum) and blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.

The protein produced from this gene is involved in regulating the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells, particularly cells in the bone marrow that give rise to blood cells.\n\n**Genetic Changes**\n\nThe mutations that cause ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome are described as \"gain-of-function.\" They increase the SAMD9L protein's ability to block cell growth and division. In the bone marrow, the resulting reduction in cell proliferation leads to a shortage of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtaxia-pancytopenia syndrome appears to be very rare. At least 25 affected individuals from four families have been described in the medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome?**\n\nAtaxia-pancytopenia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pancytopenia (a reduction in all blood cell types), and an increased risk of developing cancerous conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n**Causes of Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome**\n\nThe mutations that cause ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome are described as \"gain-of-function.\" They increase the SAMD9L protein's ability to block cell growth and division.

    "content": "**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Telangiectasia?**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems.\n\n**Characteristics of Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\nThis disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood, usually before age 5. Affected children typically develop:\n\n* Difficulty walking\n* Problems with balance and hand coordination\n* Involuntary jerking movements (chorea)\n* Muscle twitches (myoclonus)\n* Disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy)\n\nThe movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have:\n\n* Slurred speech\n* Trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia)\n* Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases, which occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin\n\n**Symptoms and Complications**\n\nAffected individuals tend to have high amounts of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in their blood. The level of this protein is normally increased in the bloodstream of pregnant women, but it is unknown why individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have elevated AFP or what effects it has in these individuals.\n\nPeople with ataxia-telangiectasia often have a weakened immune system, and many develop chronic lung infections. They also have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly:\n\n* Cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia)\n* Cancer of immune system cells (lymphoma)\n\nAffected individuals are very sensitive to the effects of radiation exposure, including medical x-rays.\n\n**Treatment and Life Expectancy**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia has no cure, though treatments might improve some symptoms. These treatments include:\n\n* Physical and speech therapy\n* Improving deficits in the immune system and nutrition\n\nThe life expectancy of people with ataxia-telangiectasia varies greatly, but affected individuals typically live into early adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Rare inherited disorder\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Genetic mutation\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Ataxia-telangiectasia\n* A-T\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)\n* MedlinePlus Genetics\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Telangiectasia?**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood\n* Difficulty walking\n* Problems with balance and hand coordination\n* Involuntary jerking movements (chorea)\n* Muscle twitches (myoclonus)\n* Disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy)\n* Slurred speech\n* Trouble moving eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia)\n\n**Characteristics**\n\n* Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases, which occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin\n* High amounts of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in their blood\n\n**Complications**\n\n* Weakened immune system\n* Chronic lung infections\n* Increased risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia and lymphoma\n* Sensitivity to radiation exposure, including medical x-rays\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia has no cure, though treatments might improve some symptoms. These treatments include physical and speech therapy and improving deficits in the immune system and nutrition.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nThe life expectancy of people with ataxia-telangiectasia varies greatly, but affected individuals typically live into early adulthood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia occurs in 1 in 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the ATM gene cause ataxia-telangiectasia. The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell division and is involved in DNA repair.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the ATM gene in each cell have variants.\n\n---\n\n**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\n**What is Ataxia-Telangiectasia?**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other bodily systems. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms including ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels in the skin), and an increased risk of cancer.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the ATM gene in each cell have variants. Most often, the parents of an individual with this condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nAbout 1 percent of the United States population carries one altered copy and one normal copy of the ATM gene in each cell. These individuals are called carriers. Although ATM gene variant carriers do not have ataxia-telangiectasia, they are more likely than people without an ATM gene variant to develop cancer; female carriers are particularly at risk for developing breast cancer.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* A-T\n* Ataxia telangiectasia syndrome\n* ATM\n* Louis-Bar syndrome\n* Telangiectasia, cerebello-oculocutaneous\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Demuth I, Dutrannoy V, Marques W Jr, Neitzel H, Schindler D, Dimova PS, Chrzanowska KH, Bojinova V, Gregorek H, Graul-Neumann LM, von Moers A, Schulze I, Nicke M, Bora E, Cankaya T, Olah E, Kiss C, Bessenyei B, Szakszon K, Gruber-Sedlmayr U, Kroisel PM, Sodia S, Goecke TO, Dork T, Digweed M, Sperling K, de Sa J, Lourenco CM, Varon R.

    "content": "**Atazanavir and Cobicistat**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of atazanavir and cobicistat, along with other medications, is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children who weigh at least 77 lb (35 kg). Atazanavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat is in a class of medications called pharmacokinetic boosters. It works by increasing the amount of atazanavir in the body so that it can have a greater effect.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAtazanavir and cobicistat comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food one time a day. Take atazanavir and cobicistat at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take atazanavir and cobicistat exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nAtazanavir and cobicistat controls HIV but does not cure it. Atazanavir and cobicistat does not treat HIV infection alone and must always be given as part of a complete regimen. It is important that all of the medications prescribed by your doctor to treat HIV infection are taken together so that the medications will continue to work to control the infection. Continue to take atazanavir and cobicistat even if you feel well. Do not stop taking atazanavir and cobicistat without talking to your doctor.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n---\n\n**Atazanavir and Cobicistat: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking atazanavir and cobicistat, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atazanavir or cobicistat, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in atazanavir and cobicistat tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with atazanavir and cobicistat. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with atazanavir and cobicistat. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting atazanavir and cobicistat with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with atazanavir: medications for indigestion, heartburn or ulcers (esomeprazole (Nexium), famotidine (Pepcid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), ranitidine (Zantac)) or St. John's wort. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking atazanavir and cobicistat.\n\nIf you are taking antacids or any other buffered medication such as buffered aspirin (Bufferin), take atazanavir and cobicistat 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take the medication. If you are taking didanosine delayed-release capsules (Videx EC), take atazanavir and cobicistat 2 hours before or 1 hour after you take the medication.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, diabetes or high blood sugar, hemophilia (a condition in which the blood does not clot normally) or any other bleeding disorder, hepatitis (a viral infection of the liver) or any other liver disease, kidney or heart disease.\n\nIf you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, tell your doctor. If you become pregnant while taking atazanavir and cobicistat, call your doctor. You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV and are taking atazanavir and cobicistat.\n\nAtazanavir and cobicistat may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections). Talk to your doctor about methods of birth control that will work for you while you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat.\n\nYou may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness.\n\nIt is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis.\n\n---\n\n**Atazanavir and Cobicistat: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**High Blood Sugar Symptoms**\nYou should know that while you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat, your blood sugar may get too high. This can cause symptoms such as:\n\n*   dry mouth\n*   nausea and vomiting\n*   shortness of breath\n*   breath that smells fruity\n*   decreased consciousness\n\n**New or Worsening Symptoms**\nYou should know that while you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at any time during your treatment with atazanavir and cobicistat, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\n**Fat Redistribution**\nYou should know that while you are taking atazanavir and cobicistat, your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts, upper back, neck, chest, and stomach area. Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face can also happen.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\nTalk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medication.\n\n**Missing a Dose**\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one..\n\n**Side Effects**\nAtazanavir and cobicistat may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   yellowing of the skin or eyes\n*   rash\n*   nausea\n*   diarrhea\n*   headache\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Atazanavir**\n\n*pronounced as (at a za na' veer)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAtazanavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children who are at least 3 months of age and weigh at least 22 lb (10 kg). Atazanavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although atazanavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAtazanavir comes as a capsule and as a powder to take by mouth. Atazanavir capsules are taken with food once a day and may be given with a pharmacokinetic booster (medication given to increase the levels of another drug in the body) such as ritonavir or cobicistat. Atazanavir powder must be taken with food and ritonavir.\n\n* Take atazanavir at around the same time every day.\n* Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n* Take atazanavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou will take other medications for HIV while you are taking atazanavir. Your doctor will tell you whether these medications should be taken at the same time as atazanavir, or several hours before or after you take atazanavir. Follow this schedule carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the times you should take your medications.\n\n* Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or open them.\n* If you are unable to swallow the capsules, tell your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nAtazanavir powder may be added to foods such as applesauce or yogurt, or liquids such as water, milk, or infant formula. Mix well, and take all of the mixture right away in order to take the full dose. If mixed with water, eat a snack or meal right away after taking the powder mixture.\n\n* For infants (older than 3 months of age) unable to drink from a cup, the powder can be mixed with infant formula and given with an oral dosing syringe; do not give the mixture to the infant in a baby bottle.\n* If the mixture is not taken immediately it must be stored at room temperature and taken within 1 hour.\n\nCarefully read the manufacturer's instructions that describe how to mix and take a dose of atazanavir. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to mix or take this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Atazanavir: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Take Atazanavir**\n\nTake atazanavir exactly as directed by your doctor. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to mix or take this medication.\n\n*   **Capsules**: Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or open them.\n*   **Powder**: Mix well with food such as applesauce or yogurt, or liquids such as water, milk, or infant formula. Take all of the mixture right away to take the full dose. If mixed with water, eat a snack or meal right away after taking the powder mixture.\n\n**Important Information**\n\nAtazanavir controls HIV but does not cure it. It is essential that all medications prescribed by your doctor to treat HIV infection are taken together so that the medications will continue to work to control the infection. Continue to take atazanavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking atazanavir without talking to your doctor.\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nAtazanavir is also sometimes used to prevent infection in healthcare workers or other people who were accidentally exposed to HIV. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking atazanavir, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atazanavir, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in atazanavir capsules or powder. Some medications should not be taken with atazanavir. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with atazanavir.\n\n**Interactions**\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with atazanavir:\n\n*   Medications for indigestion, heartburn, or ulcers (esomeprazole (Nexium), famotidine (Pepcid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), ranitidine (Zantac))\n*   St. John's wort\n\nBe sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking atazanavir.\n\n**Other Precautions**\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, diabetes or high blood sugar, hemophilia (a condition in which the blood does not clot normally) or any other bleeding disorder, hepatitis (a viral infection of the liver) or any other liver disease, kidney or heart disease.\n\nYou should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV and are taking atazanavir. Atazanavir may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections). Talk to your doctor about methods of birth control that will work for you while you are taking atazanavir.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking atazanavir. You may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking atazanavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness.\n\n---\n\n**Atazanavir: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n **Before Taking Atazanavir**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atazanavir, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in atazanavir capsules or powder. Your doctor may tell you not to take atazanavir. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Some medications should not be taken with atazanavir. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with atazanavir. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting atazanavir with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\n**Interactions with Other Medications**\n\n*   The following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with atazanavir: medications for indigestion, heartburn, or ulcers (esomeprazole (Nexium), famotidine (Pepcid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), ranitidine (Zantac)) or St. John's wort.\n*   If you are taking antacids, didanosine delayed-release capsules (Videx EC), or any other buffered medication such as buffered aspirin (Bufferin), take atazanavir 2 hours before or 1 hour after you take the medication.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, diabetes or high blood sugar, hemophilia (a condition in which the blood does not clot normally) or any other bleeding disorder, hepatitis (a viral infection of the liver) or any other liver disease, kidney or heart disease.\n*   You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV and are taking atazanavir.\n\n**Hyperglycemia**\n\n*   You may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking atazanavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness.\n\n**Changes in Body Fat**\n\n*   While you are taking atazanavir, your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as the back of your neck and upper shoulders ('buffalo hump'), stomach, and breasts. You may lose fat from your arms, legs, face, and buttocks.\n\n**PKU**\n\n*   If you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that atazanavir oral powder is sweetened with aspartame that forms phenylalanine.\n\n**Immune System**\n\n*   While taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with atazanavir, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\n*   Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.\n\n---\n\n**Atazanavir: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAtazanavir may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* stomach pain\n* diarrhea\n* headache\n* depression\n* fever\n* difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* muscle pain\n* mild rash\n* numbness, burning, pain, or tingling of hands or feet\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Atelectasis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Atelectasis?**\n\nAtelectasis is the collapse of part or, much less commonly, all of a lung.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis is not the same as another type of collapsed lung called pneumothorax, which occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. In atelectasis, there is usually fluid between the lung and the chest wall and the air sacs within the lung fill with fluid.\n\n**Common Situations**\n\nThere is fluid or a tumor that compresses the lung.\nThere is a blockage in the airway not allowing air into the air sacs of the lung.\nThe air sacs collapse when the lung has a condition that decreases production of a protein, called surfactant that normally keeps the air sacs open.\n\n**Atelectasis After Surgery**\n\nAtelectasis is common after surgery or in people who are or were in the hospital.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nAnesthesia\nUse of a breathing tube\nForeign object in the airway (most common in children)\nLung disease\nMucus that plugs the airway\nPressure on the lung caused by a buildup of fluid between the ribs and the lungs (called a pleural effusion)\nProlonged bed rest with few changes in position\nShallow breathing (may be caused by painful breathing or muscle weakness as in people who have had surgery)\nTumors that block an airway\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\nBreathing difficulty\nChest pain\nCough\n\nThere are no symptoms if atelectasis is mild.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo confirm if you have atelectasis and determine its cause, the following tests will likely be done to view the lungs and airways:\n\nPhysical exam by auscultating (listening) or percussing (tapping) the chest\nBronchoscopy\nChest CT or MRI scan\nChest x-ray\nUltrasound of the chest\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to treat the underlying cause and re-expand the collapsed lung tissue. If fluid is putting pressure on the lung, removing the fluid may allow the lung to expand.\n\nTreatments include one or more of the following:\n\nClap (percussion) on the chest to loosen mucus plugs in the airway.\nDeep breathing exercises (with the help of incentive spirometry devices).\nRemove or relieve any blockage in the airways by bronchoscopy.\nTilt the person so the head is lower than the chest (called postural drainage). This allows mucus to drain more easily.\nTreat a tumor or other condition.\nTurn the person to lie on the healthy side, allowing the collapsed area of lung to re-expand.\nUse inhaled medicines to open the airway.\nUse other devices that help increase positive pressure in the airways and clear fluids.\nBe physically active if possible\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn an adult, atelectasis in a small area of the lung is usually not life threatening. The rest of the lung can make up for the collapsed area, bringing in enough oxygen for the body to function.\n\nLarge areas of atelectasis may be life threatening, often in a baby or small child, or in someone who has another lung disease or illness.\n\nThe collapsed lung usually reinflates slowly if the airway blockage has been removed. Scarring or damage may remain.\n\nThe outlook depends on the underlying disease. For example, people with extensive cancer often don't do well, while those with simple atelectasis after surgery have a very good outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Atelectasis**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung.

This can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, bronchial obstruction, or trauma to the chest.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of atelectasis may include coughing, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. In some cases, patients may experience fever, chills, and fatigue.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAtelectasis can be diagnosed using various imaging techniques such as bronchoscopy, X-rays, and CT scans. These tests help identify the collapsed lung tissue and determine the underlying cause of the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for atelectasis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. In some cases, patients may require hospitalization and oxygen therapy to help expand the collapsed lung. In more severe cases, surgery or other interventions may be necessary to restore normal lung function.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Collapsed Lung\n*   Respiratory system",

    "content": "**Atelosteogenesis Type 1**\n\nAtelosteogenesis type 1 is a rare disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. Affected individuals are born with inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet) and dislocations of the hips, knees, and elbows. Bones in the spine, rib cage, pelvis, and limbs may be underdeveloped or in some cases absent. As a result of the limb bone abnormalities, individuals with this condition have very short arms and legs.\n\nCharacteristic facial features include a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), an upturned nose with a grooved tip, and a very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia). Affected individuals may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). Males with this condition can have undescended testes.\n\nIndividuals with atelosteogenesis type 1 typically have an underdeveloped rib cage that affects the development and functioning of the lungs. As a result, affected individuals are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtelosteogenesis type 1 is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown. Only a few dozen affected individuals have been identified.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the FLNB gene cause atelosteogenesis type 1. The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B, which helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin B attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton.\n\nFilamin B is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. It is active (expressed) in the cell membranes of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, a process called ossification, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears.\n\nFLNB gene mutations that cause atelosteogenesis type 1 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin B protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with the proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 1.\n\n---\n\n**Atelosteogenesis Type 1**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the FLNB gene cause atelosteogenesis type 1.

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAO2\nAtelosteogenesis de la Chapelle type\nAtelosteogenesis, type 2\nDe la Chapelle dysplasia\nMcAlister dysplasia\nNeonatal osseous dysplasia 1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Atelosteogenesis type II\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Atelosteogenesis type II\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ATELOSTEOGENESIS, TYPE II; AO2\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nHastbacka J, Superti-Furga A, Wilcox WR, Rimoin DL, Cohn DH, Lander ES.

Some variants may lead to severe medical conditions, while others may cause mild symptoms or no apparent effects. The relationship between gene variants and health is complex and influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\nIf a disorder appears to run in your family, it may indicate a possible genetic link. However, the presence of a family history does not necessarily mean that a condition will be inherited. Genetic testing can help determine whether a specific variant is associated with an increased risk of developing a particular disorder.\n\nGenetic conditions can be inherited through various mechanisms, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance patterns. Understanding the mode of inheritance for a specific condition is crucial for predicting the likelihood of transmission to offspring.\n\nThe management of genetic conditions often involves a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating medical, surgical, and supportive care strategies tailored to the individual's needs. Regular monitoring and follow-up with healthcare providers are essential for ensuring optimal outcomes and addressing any emerging concerns.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Atelosteogenesis Type 3**\n\n**Description**\n\nAtelosteogenesis type 3 is a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. Affected individuals are born with inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet) and dislocations of the hips, knees, and elbows. Bones in the spine, rib cage, pelvis, and limbs may be underdeveloped or in some cases absent. As a result of the limb bone abnormalities, individuals with this condition have very short arms and legs. Their hands and feet are wide, with broad fingers and toes that may be permanently bent (camptodactyly) or fused together (syndactyly). Characteristic facial features include a broad forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and an underdeveloped nose. About half of affected individuals have an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate.)\n\nIndividuals with atelosteogenesis type 3 typically have an underdeveloped rib cage that affects the development and functioning of the lungs. As a result, affected individuals are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. Some affected individuals survive longer, usually with intensive medical support. They typically experience further respiratory problems as a result of weakness of the airways that can lead to partial closing, short pauses in breathing (apnea), or frequent infections. People with atelosteogenesis type 3 who survive past the newborn period may have learning disabilities and delayed language skills, which are probably caused by low levels of oxygen in the brain due to respiratory problems. As a result of their orthopedic abnormalities, they also have delayed development of motor skills such as standing and walking.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Typically fatal at birth or shortly after\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Genetic mutation affecting bone development\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* None specified\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n**References**\n\n* MedlinePlus Genetics\n* Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)\n\n---\n\n**Atelosteogenesis Type 3**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the FLNB gene cause atelosteogenesis type 3. The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B. This protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move.\n\nFilamin B attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. It also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development.\n\nFilamin B is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. It is active (expressed) in the cell membranes of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears.\n\nFLNB gene mutations that cause atelosteogenesis type 3 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin B protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with the proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 3.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtelosteogenesis type 3 is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown. About two dozen affected individuals have been identified.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAffected individuals are born with inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet) and dislocations of the hips, knees, and elbows. Bones in the spine, rib cage, pelvis, and limbs may be underdeveloped or in some cases absent. As a result of the limb bone abnormalities, individuals with this condition have very short arms and legs.

As a result of their orthopedic abnormalities, they also have delayed development of motor skills such as standing and walking.\n\n---\n\n**Atelosteogenesis Type 3**\n\n**What is Atelosteogenesis Type 3?**\n\nAtelosteogenesis type 3 (AOIII) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of cartilage and bone. It is characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, including short limbs, clubfoot, and other deformities.\n\n**Causes of Atelosteogenesis Type 3**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the FLNB gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B. This protein plays a crucial role in cell growth, division, and maturation, particularly in cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). The abnormal protein produced as a result of the mutation interferes with the proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of AOIII.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAOIII is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AOIII\n* Atelosteogenesis type III\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on this condition, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atelosteogenesis type III\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Atelosteogenesis type III\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ATELOSTEOGENESIS, TYPE III; AO3\n\n**References**\n\nThe following studies provide more information on the genetic basis and clinical features of AOIII:\n\n* Farrington-Rock C, et al.

Normally, the walls of an artery are smooth, allowing blood to flow unimpeded. However, if damage occurs to its inner lining, fat, cholesterol, platelets, and other substances may accumulate at a damaged section of the arterial wall.\n\nEventually, the tissue builds up and a plaque is formed, narrowing the lumen of the artery. Where the narrowing is severe, there is a risk that the vessel can become blocked completely if a thrombus forms in the diseased segment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   **Atherosclerosis**\n*   Browse the Encyclopedia",

    "content": "**Atherosclerosis | Arteriosclerosis**\n\n**What is Atherosclerosis?**\n\nAtherosclerosis is a condition in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of cholesterol, fat, blood cells, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and causes your arteries to narrow, limiting the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.\n\n**Is Atherosclerosis Different from Arteriosclerosis?**\n\nYes, atherosclerosis is different from arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis refers to the hardening of the arteries, which means that the arteries thicken and become less flexible. It can have several different causes. Atherosclerosis, on the other hand, develops from plaque buildup and is a common type of arteriosclerosis.\n\n**What are the Different Names for Atherosclerosis?**\n\nAtherosclerosis can affect most of the arteries in the body and has different names based on which arteries are affected:\n\n* Coronary artery disease (CAD) - plaque buildup in the arteries of your heart\n* Peripheral artery disease (PAD) - plaque buildup in the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body\n* Carotid artery disease - plaque buildup in the neck arteries, reducing blood flow to the brain\n* Renal artery stenosis - plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to your kidneys\n* Vertebral artery disease - plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the back of your brain\n* Mesenteric artery ischemia - plaque buildup in the arteries that supply your intestines with blood\n\n**What Causes Atherosclerosis?**\n\nThe exact cause of atherosclerosis is unknown, but researchers believe that this buildup happens when there is damage to the arteries. This damage may be caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits, medical conditions, and your genes.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Atherosclerosis?**\n\nYou may be more likely to develop atherosclerosis if you:\n\n* Have certain medical conditions, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis\n* Have a family history of high blood cholesterol\n* Eat a lot of foods high in saturated fats\n* Smoke or chew tobacco\n* Are older - the risk increases after age 45 for men and age 55 for women\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Atherosclerosis?**\n\nIn the early stages, atherosclerosis often does not cause any symptoms. You may first notice some symptoms at times when your body needs more oxygen. For example, this could be when you are having physical or emotional stress.\n\nYour symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected and how much blood flow is blocked:\n\n* With coronary artery disease, the symptoms may include angina (a type of chest pain), palpitations (racing or pounding heart), and shortness of breath.\n* With carotid artery disease, you may have a bruit (a whooshing sound) or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n* With peripheral artery disease, you may have pain, aching, heaviness, or cramping in the legs when walking or climbing stairs.\n* With vertebral artery disease, you may have problems with thinking and memory, weakness or numbness on one side of the body or face, and vision trouble. You could also have a transient ischemic attack.\n* With mesenteric artery ischemia, the symptoms can include severe pain after meals, weight loss, and diarrhea.\n\n**Can Atherosclerosis be Prevented?**\n\nYes, there are steps you can take to try to prevent atherosclerosis:\n\n* Choose heart-healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit foods that are high in saturated fats, salt, and added sugars.\n* Do regular physical activity. But before you start an exercise program, ask your provider what level of physical activity is right for you.\n* Aim for a healthy weight.\n* Limit how much alcohol you drink. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. Men should limit their intake to 2 drinks or less in a day. Women should drink 1 drink or less per day.\n* Manage stress.\n* If you smoke, quit smoking.\n* Avoid secondhand smoke.\n* Get enough good-quality sleep.\n\n**How is Atherosclerosis Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have atherosclerosis, your provider:\n\n* Will ask about your medical and family health history\n* Will ask about your lifestyle and risk factors for plaque buildup in the arteries\n* Will do a physical exam, which will include listening to your heart and the blood flow in your arteries\n* Will likely order tests, such as blood tests and heart health tests\n\n**What are the Treatments for Atherosclerosis?**\n\nIf you have atherosclerosis, your provider will work with you to create a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan will depend on which arteries are affected, how much the blood flow is blocked, and what other medical conditions you have. Possible treatments may include:\n\n* Heart-healthy lifestyle changes\n* Medicines to manage your risk factors, treat atherosclerosis or its complications, and treat any medical conditions you have that can worsen plaque buildup\n* Procedures or surgeries to treat diseases or complications that were caused by plaque buildup\n* Cardiac rehabilitation, if you have had certain complications from atherosclerosis\n\n---\n\n**Atherosclerosis | Arteriosclerosis**\n\n**What Is Atherosclerosis?**\n\nAtherosclerosis is a condition in which plaque builds up inside your arteries.

This is a whooshing sound that your health care provider hears when using a stethoscope. You could also have a transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke.\n* With peripheral artery disease, you may have pain, aching, heaviness, or cramping in the legs when walking or climbing stairs.\n* With vertebral artery disease, you may have problems with thinking and memory, weakness or numbness on one side of the body or face, and vision trouble. You could also have a transient ischemic attack.\n* With mesenteric artery ischemia, the symptoms can include severe pain after meals, weight loss, and diarrhea.\n\nFor men, erectile dysfunction (ED) is an early warning sign that you may be at higher risk for atherosclerosis and its complications. If you have ED, talk with your provider about your risk of plaque buildup.\n\n**Complications**\n\nAtherosclerosis can cause other health problems, or complications. For example, if a plaque bursts, a blood clot may form. The clot could block the artery completely or travel to another part of the body. Other possible complications can vary, depending on which arteries are affected. For example, blockages in different parts of the body can lead to complications such as a heart attack, stroke, vascular dementia, or limb loss.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo find out if you have atherosclerosis, your provider:\n\n* Will ask about your medical and family health history\n* Will ask about your lifestyle and risk factors for plaque buildup in the arteries\n* Will do a physical exam, which will include listening to your heart and the blood flow in your arteries\n* Will likely order tests, such as blood tests and heart health tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you have atherosclerosis, your provider will work with you to create a treatment plan that works for you.

    "content": "**Atherosclerosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Atherosclerosis?**\n\nAtherosclerosis, sometimes called \"hardening of the arteries,\" occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. These deposits are called plaques. Over time, these plaques can narrow or completely block the arteries and cause problems throughout the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Atherosclerosis**\n\nAtherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them.\n\nClots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them.\n\nThese blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death. It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke.\n\nHigh blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age.\n\nFor many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats.\n\nOther factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include:\n\n*   Diabetes\n*   Family history of hardening of the arteries\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Lack of exercise\n*   Being overweight or obese\n*   Smoking\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Atherosclerosis**\n\nAtherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked.\n\nIf the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n\nNarrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests for Atherosclerosis**\n\nA health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Atherosclerosis can create a whooshing or blowing sound (\"bruit\") over an artery.\n\nAll people age 18 or older should have their blood pressure checked every year. More frequent measurement may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure.\n\nCholesterol testing is recommended in all adults.

Things you can do include:\n\nQuit smoking: This is the single most important change you can make to reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke.\nAvoid fatty foods: Eat well-balanced meals that are low in fat and cholesterol. Include several daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Adding fish to your diet at least twice a week may be helpful. However, do not eat fried fish.\nLimit how much alcohol you drink: Recommended limits are one drink a day for women, two a day for men.\nGet regular physical activity: Exercise with moderate intensity (such as brisk walking) 5 days a week for 30 minutes a day if you are at a healthy weight. For weight loss, exercise for 60 to 90 minutes a day. Talk to your provider before starting a new exercise plan, especially if you have been diagnosed with heart disease or you have ever had a heart attack.\n\nIf your blood pressure is high, it is important for you to lower it and keep it under control.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of health problems caused by high blood pressure. You and your provider should set a blood pressure goal for you.\n\nDo not stop or change high blood pressure medicines without talking to your provider.\n\nYour provider may want you to take medicine for abnormal cholesterol levels or for high blood pressure if lifestyle changes do not get you to your goals for these. This will depend on:\n\n*   Your age\n*   The medicines you take\n*   Your risk of side effects from possible medicines\n*   Whether you have heart disease or other blood flow problems\n*   Whether you smoke or are overweight\n*   Whether you have diabetes or other heart disease risk factors\n*   Whether you have any other medical problems, such as kidney disease\n\nYour provider may suggest taking aspirin or another medicine to help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines are called antiplatelet drugs. DO NOT take aspirin without first talking to your provider.\n\nLosing weight if you are overweight and reducing blood sugar if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes can help reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Atherosclerosis**\n\nAtherosclerosis cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can prevent or slow the process from becoming worse. This can help reduce the chances of having a heart attack and stroke as a result of atherosclerosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications of Atherosclerosis**\n\nIn some cases, the plaque is part of a process that causes a weakening of the wall of an artery. This can lead to a bulge in an artery called an aneurysm. Aneurysms can break open (rupture). This causes bleeding that can be life threatening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names for Atherosclerosis**\n\nHardening of the arteries; Arteriosclerosis; Plaque buildup - arteries; Hyperlipidemia - atherosclerosis; Cholesterol - atherosclerosis\n\n---\n\n**Atherosclerosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Atherosclerosis?**\n\nAtherosclerosis, sometimes called \"hardening of the arteries,\" occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. These deposits are called plaques. Over time, these plaques can narrow or completely block the arteries and cause problems throughout the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them.\n\nClots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them.\n\nThese blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death. It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke.\n\nHigh blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age.\n\nFor many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats.\n\nOther factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Family history of hardening of the arteries\n* High blood pressure\n* Lack of exercise\n* Being overweight or obese\n* Smoking\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAtherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked.\n\nIf the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n\nNarrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Atherosclerosis can create a whooshing or blowing sound (\"bruit\") over an artery.\n\nAll people age 18 or older should have their blood pressure checked every year. More frequent measurement may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure.\n\nCholesterol testing is recommended in all adults.

If tests are needed, they may include:\n    *   A simple office test called a KOH exam to check for fungus\n    *   Skin culture\n    *   A skin biopsy may also be performed with a special stain called PAS to identify fungus\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Over-the-counter antifungal powders or creams can help control the infection.\n*   Keep using the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks after the infection has cleared to prevent it from returning.\n*   In addition:\n    *   Keep your feet clean and dry, especially between your toes.\n    *   Wash your feet thoroughly with soap and water and dry the area carefully and completely. Try to do this at least twice a day.\n    *   To widen and keep the web space (area between the toes) dry, use lamb's wool. This can be bought at a drugstore.\n    *   Wear clean cotton socks. Change your socks and shoes as often as needed to keep your feet dry.\n    *   Wear sandals or flip-flops at a public shower or pool.\n    *   Use antifungal or drying powders to prevent athlete's foot if you tend to get it often, or you frequent places where athlete's foot fungus is common (like public showers).\n    *   Wear shoes that are well-ventilated and made of natural material such as leather. It may help to alternate shoes each day, so they can completely dry between wearings. Do not wear plastic-lined shoes.\n\nIf athlete's foot does not get better in 2 to 4 weeks with self-care, or frequently returns, see your provider. Your provider may prescribe:\n\n*   Antifungal medicines to take by mouth\n*   Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections that occur from scratching\n*   Topical creams that kill the fungus\n\n---\n\n**Athlete's Foot**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall your provider right away if:\n\n* Your foot is swollen and warm to the touch, especially if there are red streaks or pain. These are signs of a possible bacterial infection. Other signs include pus, drainage, and fever.\n* Athlete's foot symptoms do not go away within 2 to 4 weeks of self-care treatments.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Tinea pedis\n* Fungal infection - feet\n* Tinea of the foot\n* Infection - fungal - feet\n* Ringworm - foot\n\n**Images**\n\n* Athlete's foot - tinea pedis\n\n**References**\n\n* Elewski BE, Hughey LC, Hunt KM, Hay RJ.

    "content": "**Atidarsagene Autotemcel Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAtidarsagene autotemcel injection is used to treat children with pre-symptomatic or early metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD; an inherited condition in which certain fats [lipids] build up in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, resulting in nerve and brain damage). Atidarsagene autotemcel injection is in a class of medications called autologous cellular immunotherapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood. It works by helping your body to break down the fats and stop or slow the progression of nerve and brain damage.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAtidarsagene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. Atidarsagene autotemcel injection is given as a one-time dose, which is contained in 1 to 8 infusion bags. Each infusion bag is usually given over no more than 30 minutes. Before you receive your atidarsagene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for atidarsagene autotemcel.\n\nBefore your dose of atidarsagene autotemcel injection is to be given, a sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). The sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of atidarsagene autotemcel injection. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving atidarsagene autotemcel injection,\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atidarsagene autotemcel, any other medications, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or any of the ingredients in atidarsagene autotemcel injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* tell your doctor if your child has or has ever had hepatitis B or C (a virus that infects the liver and may cause severe liver damage), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), blood clots, or kidney or liver disease.\n* tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you are a female of childbearing age, you will need to have a pregnancy test before you start treatment with atidarsagene autotemcel injection. If you are a male or female of childbearing age, you should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment and for 6 months after you receive atidarsagene autotemcel injection. If you become pregnant while receiving atidarsagene autoleucel, call your doctor immediately.\n* do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation after you receive atidarsagene autotemcel injection.\n* check with your doctor to see if you need to receive any vaccinations. Do not have any vaccinations without talking to your doctor for at least 6 weeks before starting chemotherapy, during your atidarsagene autotemcel treatment, and until your doctor tells you that your immune system has recovered.\n\n---\n\n**Atidarsagene Autotemcel Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Precautions**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atidarsagene autotemcel, any other medications, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or any of the ingredients in atidarsagene autotemcel injection.

    "content": "**Atopic Dermatitis in Children**\n\nAtopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that causes scaly and itchy rashes. It's most common in infants and children, often starting as early as age 2 to 6 months.\n\n**Understanding the Condition**\n\nThe condition is due to a hypersensitive skin reaction similar to an allergy. It may also be caused by variations in certain proteins in the surface of the skin, leading to ongoing inflammation of the skin.\n\n**Working with Your Child's Provider**\n\nThis condition can be difficult to regulate in children, so it's essential to work closely with your child's health care provider. Daily skin care is crucial to help prevent flare-ups and keep the skin from being inflamed.\n\n**Help for Itching and Scratching**\n\nSevere itching is common, often starting before the rash appears. To help your child avoid scratching:\n\n*   Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, barrier repair cream, or other medicine prescribed by your child's provider.\n*   Keep your child's fingernails cut short. Have them wear light gloves while sleeping if scratching at night is a problem.\n*   Give antihistamines or other medicines by mouth as directed by your child's provider.\n*   Teach older children not to scratch itchy skin.\n\n**Day-to-Day Skin Care**\n\nDaily skin care with allergen-free products may reduce the need for medicines. Use moisturizing ointments, creams, or lotions made for people with eczema or sensitive skin. Choose products without alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. A humidifier can also help keep air moist.\n\n**Tips for Skin Care**\n\n*   Bathe less often and keep water contact as brief as possible.\n*   Use gentle skin care cleansers rather than traditional soaps.\n*   Do not scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long.\n*   Apply lubricating cream, lotion, or ointment while skin is still damp to trap moisture.\n\n**Dressing Your Child**\n\nDress your child in soft, comfortable clothing, such as cotton clothes. Encourage them to drink plenty of water to help add moisture to the skin.\n\n**Teaching Older Children**\n\nTeach older children these same tips for skin care.\n\n**The Rash and Scratching**\n\nThe rash itself, as well as the scratching, often causes breaks in the skin and may lead to infection. Keep an eye out for redness, warmth, swelling, or other signs of infection.

    "content": "**Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nAtopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a disorder characterized by inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). The condition usually begins in early infancy, and it often disappears before adolescence. However, in some affected individuals the condition continues into adulthood; in others, it does not begin until adulthood.\n\n**Hallmarks of Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nHallmarks of atopic dermatitis include dry, itchy skin and red rashes that come and go. The rashes can occur on any part of the body, although the pattern tends to be different at different ages. In affected infants, the rashes commonly occur on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. In children, the rashes are usually found in the bend of the elbows and knees and on the front of the neck. In adolescents and adults, the rashes typically occur on the wrists, ankles, and eyelids in addition to the bend of the elbows and knees.\n\n**Association with Allergies**\n\nThe word \"atopic\" indicates an association with allergies. While atopic dermatitis is not always due to an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic disorders: up to 60 percent of people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma or hay fever (allergic rhinitis) later in life, and up to 30 percent have food allergies.\n\n**Atopic March**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is often the beginning of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the \"atopic march.\" Development of these disorders typically follows a pattern, beginning with atopic dermatitis, followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all individuals with atopic dermatitis will progress through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.\n\n**Increased Risk of Other Conditions**\n\nIndividuals with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of developing other conditions related to inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hair loss caused by a malfunctioning immune reaction (alopecia areata). They also have an increased risk of having a behavioral or psychiatric disorder, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression.\n\n**Immunodeficiency**\n\nIn a particular subset of individuals with atopic dermatitis, the immune system is unable to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi (which is known as immunodeficiency). These individuals are prone to recurrent infections. Most also have other allergic disorders, such as asthma, hay fever, and food allergies.\n\n**Separate Disorders**\n\nAtopic dermatitis can also be a feature of separate disorders that have a number of signs and symptoms, which can include skin abnormalities and immunodeficiency. Some such disorders are Netherton syndrome; immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome; and severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Atopic Dermatitis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Atopic Dermatitis?**\n\nAtopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema) is a disorder characterized by inflammation of the skin (dermatitis).

It affects 10-20% of children and 5-10% of adults.\n\n**Causes of Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nThe genetics of atopic dermatitis are not completely understood. Studies suggest that several genes can be involved in the development of the condition. In very rare cases, atopic dermatitis is caused by inherited mutations in a single gene, such as the CARD11 gene. This gene produces a protein that turns on signaling pathways involved in the development and function of immune system cells called lymphocytes.\n\n**Genetic Associations**\n\n*   **CARD11 Gene**: Mutations in this gene lead to production of an altered CARD11 protein that does not function normally. This impairment affects the response of certain lymphocytes, called T cells, to foreign invaders.\n*   **FLG Gene**: Variations in this gene are associated with atopic dermatitis, as they affect the structure and function of the outermost layer of skin. The FLG gene provides instructions for making a protein called profilaggrin, which is important for maintaining hydration and creating a strong barrier against allergens.\n\n**Development of Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is not initially caused by an allergic reaction. However, substances that can cause allergic reactions may contribute to flare-ups of the rashes. The condition is thought to occur due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as living with a pet. Several common genetic variations may be involved, each contributing only a small amount to the risk of developing atopic dermatitis.\n\n**Syndromes Associated with Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nAtopic dermatitis can also be a feature of separate disorders that have multiple signs and symptoms, including skin abnormalities and immunodeficiency. Some such disorders are Netherton syndrome; immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome; and severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Learn more about the genes associated with Atopic Dermatitis\n\n---\n\n**Atopic Dermatitis**\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a complex disorder influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n*   **FLG Gene**: Variations in the FLG gene lead to production of an abnormally short profilaggrin protein that cannot be processed to produce other profilaggrin-related proteins. This impairment contributes to development of allergic disorders, including atopic dermatitis.\n*   **CARD11 Gene**: Rare cases of atopic dermatitis are caused by inherited mutations in the CARD11 gene. These changes impair pathway signaling, leading to a weakened immune system and recurrent infections.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAllergic disorders tend to run in families; having a parent with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or hay fever raises the chances a person will develop atopic dermatitis.\n\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**: When caused by CARD11 gene mutations or FLG gene mutations, atopic dermatitis follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n*   **Increased Risk**: Individuals with two altered copies of the FLG gene are more likely to develop the disorder and can have more severe signs and symptoms than individuals with a single altered copy.\n\n**Genetic Variations**\n\nSeveral common genetic variations may be involved in atopic dermatitis, each contributing only a small amount to the risk of developing the condition. The strongest association is with the FLG gene, which is altered in 20 to 30 percent of people with atopic dermatitis compared with 8 to 10 percent of the general population without atopic dermatitis.\n\n**Environmental Factors**\n\nExposure to certain environmental factors also contributes to the development of atopic dermatitis. Studies suggest that these exposures trigger epigenetic changes to the DNA, which can affect gene activity and regulate the production of proteins influencing the development of allergies in susceptible individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Atopic Dermatitis: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 5/6)**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nWhen considering the condition without other contributing factors, people with changes in the FLG gene or another atopic dermatitis-associated gene inherit an increased risk of this condition, not the condition itself. Not all people with this condition have a mutation in a risk-associated gene, and not all people with a variation in a risk-associated gene will develop the disorder.\n\n**Family History**\n\nAllergic disorders tend to run in families; having a parent with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or hay fever raises the chances a person will develop atopic dermatitis.\n\n**CARD11 Gene Mutations**\n\nWhen caused by CARD11 gene mutations, atopic dermatitis has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered CARD11 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**FLG Gene Mutations**\n\nSimilarly, when associated with FLG gene mutations, risk of the condition follows an autosomal dominant pattern; a mutation in one copy of the FLG gene is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. Individuals with two altered copies of the FLG gene are more likely to develop the disorder and can have more severe signs and symptoms than individuals with a single altered copy.\n\n**Unclear Inheritance Pattern**\n\nWhen atopic dermatitis is associated with other genetic factors, the inheritance pattern is unclear.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Atopic eczema\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Dermatitis, atopic, 2\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\t+ DERMATITIS, ATOPIC\n\t+ DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2; ATOD2\n\t+ IMMUNODEFICIENCY 11B WITH ATOPIC DERMATITIS; IMD11B\n\n**References**\n\n* Bieber T.

It is a type of eczema.\n\n**Other Forms of Dermatitis**\n\n*   Contact dermatitis\n*   Dyshidrotic eczema\n*   Nummular eczema\n*   Seborrheic dermatitis\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is due to a reaction in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing itching, swelling and redness. People with atopic dermatitis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks specific proteins that maintain the skin's barrier to water.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSkin changes may include:\n\n*   Blisters with oozing and crusting\n*   Dry skin all over the body, or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs\n*   Ear discharge or bleeding\n*   Raw areas of the skin from scratching\n*   Skin color changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone\n*   Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters\n*   Thickened or leather-like areas, which can occur after long-term irritation and scratching\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin and do a physical exam. You may need a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis or check for other causes of dry, itchy skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSKIN CARE AT HOME\n\nDaily skin care may cut down on the need for medicines.\n\nTo help you avoid scratching your rash or skin:\n\n*   Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, or other medicine your provider prescribes.\n*   Take antihistamine medicines by mouth to reduce severe itching.\n*   Keep your fingernails cut short. Wear light gloves during sleep if nighttime scratching is a problem.\n\nKeep your skin moist by using lotions, creams, or ointments (such as petroleum jelly) 2 to 3 times a day. Choose skin products that do not contain alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. A humidifier to keep home air moist will also help.\n\nAvoid things that make symptoms worse, such as:\n\n*   Foods, such as eggs, that may cause an allergic reaction in a very young child (always talk to your provider first)\n*   Irritants, such as wool and lanolin\n*   Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents\n*   Sudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating\n*   Triggers that cause allergy symptoms\n\nWhen washing or bathing:\n\n*   Expose your skin to water for as short a time as possible. Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths.\n*   Use gentle body washes and cleansers instead of regular soaps.\n*   Do not scrub or dry your skin too hard or for too long.\n*   Apply lubricating lotions, creams, or ointment to your skin while it is still damp after bathing. This will help trap moisture in your skin.\n\nMEDICINES\n\nAt this time, allergy shots are not used to treat atopic dermatitis.\n\nAntihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching or allergies. You can often buy these medicines without a prescription.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines:\n\n*   You will probably be prescribed a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment at first (such as hydrocortisone). You may need a stronger medicine if this does not work.\n*   Medicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. Ask your provider about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines.\n*   Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas.\n*   Barrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used.\n\nWet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help regulate the condition. But, it may lead to an infection.\n\nOther treatments that may be used include:\n\n*   Antibiotic creams or pills if your skin is infected\n*   Medicines that suppress the immune system\n*   Targeted biologic medicines that are designed to affect parts of the immune system involved in atopic dermatitis\n*   Phototherapy, a treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light\n*   Short-term use of systemic steroids (steroids given by mouth or through a vein)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAtopic dermatitis can last a long time. You can help its symptoms by treating it, avoiding irritants, and by keeping your skin well-moisturized.\n\nIn children, the condition often starts to go away around age 5 to 6, but flare-ups will often occur. In adults, the problem is generally a long-term or returning condition.\n\nAtopic dermatitis may be harder to regulate if it:\n\n*   Begins at an early age\n*   Involves a large amount of the body\n*   Occurs along with allergies and asthma\n*   Occurs in someone with a family history of eczema\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of atopic dermatitis include:\n\n*   Infections of the skin caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses\n*   Permanent scars\n*   Side effects from long-term use of medicines to regulate eczema\n\n---\n\n**Atopic Dermatitis**\n\n**What is Atopic Dermatitis?**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves scaly and itchy rashes.

The reaction leads to ongoing itching, swelling and redness. People with atopic dermatitis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks specific proteins that maintain the skin's barrier to water.\n\nIt is most common in infants and may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood.\n\nPeople with atopic dermatitis often have asthma or seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive for allergy skin tests. However, atopic dermatitis is not caused by allergies.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSkin changes may include:\n\n* Blisters with oozing and crusting\n* Dry skin all over the body, or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs\n* Ear discharge or bleeding\n* Raw areas of the skin from scratching\n* Skin color changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone\n* Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters\n* Thickened or leather-like areas, which can occur after long-term irritation and scratching\n\nThe type and location of the rash can depend on the age of the person:\n\n* In children younger than age 2, the rash may begin on the face, scalp, hands, and feet.\n* In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet.\n* In adults, the rash may be limited to the hands, eyelids, or genitals.\n\nIntense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the \"itch that rashes\" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin and do a physical exam. You may need a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis or check for other causes of dry, itchy skin.\n\nThe diagnosis is based on:\n\n* A thorough medical history\n* A physical examination of the skin\n* Laboratory tests (such as allergy testing)\n* A skin biopsy (if necessary)\n\n---\n\n**Atopic Dermatitis**\n\n**Diagnosing Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin and do a physical exam.

    "content": "**Atorvastatin**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAtorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAtorvastatin comes as a tablet and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food. The suspension is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Take atorvastatin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nTake atorvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of atorvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nIf you are taking the suspension, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use a properly marked measuring device such as a medicine spoon or oral syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you need help getting or using a measuring device.\n\nContinue to take atorvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking atorvastatin without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Atorvastatin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Take Atorvastatin**\n\nTake atorvastatin exactly as directed by your doctor.

    "content": "**Atovaquone and Proguanil**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of atovaquone and proguanil is used to treat a certain kind of malaria infection (a serious infection that is spread by mosquitoes in certain parts of the world and can cause death) and to prevent a certain kind of malaria infection in travelers who visit areas where malaria is common. Atovaquone and proguanil is in a class of medications called antimalarials. It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of atovaquone and proguanil comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Atrial Fibrillation | AFib**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAtrial fibrillation, also known as AFib or AF, is one of the most common types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They can cause your heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.\n\nIf you have AFib, your heart beats irregularly and sometimes much faster than normal. Also, your heart's upper and lower chambers do not work together as they should. When this happens, the lower chambers do not fill completely or pump enough blood to your lungs and body. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and a pounding heartbeat.\n\nAFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. It's very important to treat it, since AFib can put you at risk for stroke and other heart conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAFib is most often caused by changes to the heart's tissue or the electrical signaling that helps the heartbeat. These changes can happen due to different conditions and factors, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defects, infections, and aging. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAnyone can develop AFib, but there are certain things that raise your risk for it:\n\n*   Aging. The risk of atrial fibrillation increases as you get older, especially when you are over age 65.\n*   Family history and genetics. AFib can run in families. So can heart disease, which raises your risk of AFib.\n*   Some lifestyle choices. Your risk is higher if you drink a lot of alcohol, use certain illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, or smoke.\n*   Having certain health conditions, such as:\n    *   High blood pressure\n    *   Diabetes\n    *   Heart failure\n    *   Heart valve diseases\n    *   Obesity\n    *   Hyperthyroidism\n    *   Chronic kidney disease\n    *   COPD and other lung diseases\n    *   Sleep apnea\n    *   Race. AFib is more common in people with European ancestry.\n    *   Recent surgery. You may be at risk of atrial fibrillation in the early days and weeks after surgery on your heart, lungs, or esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nSome people who have AFib don't have any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do have symptoms, you may only notice them once in a while. Or you may have symptoms that are more frequent. And in some cases, the symptoms might be severe. If you have heart disease, you are more likely to notice your symptoms. And those symptoms could get worse if your heart disease gets worse.\n\nThe symptoms of AFib can include:\n\n*   Extreme fatigue, which is the most common symptom\n*   Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast)\n*   Trouble breathing, especially when lying down or when exercising\n*   Chest pain\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n*   Low blood pressure\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Problems Can AFib Cause?**\n\nIf AFib is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (complications) such as:\n\n*   Stroke\n*   Heart failure\n*   Blood clots\n*   Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)\n*   Cognitive impairment and dementia\n\nTo help prevent these problems, it's important to contact your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do have AFib, the sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have AFib, your provider:\n\n*   Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have\n*   Will ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had AFib\n*   Will do a physical exam\n*   May order blood tests\n*   Will likely order heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) and echocardiogram\n*   May ask you to wear a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activity\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Treatments for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nThe treatments for AFib may include:\n\n*   Blood thinner medicines that help prevent blood clots from forming.\n*   Medicines to control your heart's rhythm and rate.\n*   Following heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n    *   Following a heart-healthy eating plan that limits saturated fats, salt, and cholesterol. An example is the DASH eating plan.\n    *   Limiting or avoiding alcohol, because it can increase your heart rate.\n    *   Aiming for a healthy weight.\n    *   Getting regular physical activity.\n    *   Managing stress.\n    *   Quitting smoking.\n*   Procedures such as:\n    *   Electrical cardioversion, which restores your heart rhythm using low-energy shocks to your heart.\n    *   Catheter ablation, which scars the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia.

Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They can cause your heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.\n\nIf you have AFib, your heart beats irregularly and sometimes much faster than normal. Also, your heart's upper and lower chambers do not work together as they should. When this happens, the lower chambers do not fill completely or pump enough blood to your lungs and body. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and a pounding heartbeat.\n\nAFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. It's very important to treat it, since AFib can put you at risk for stroke and other heart conditions.\n\n**What causes atrial fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAFib is most often caused by changes to the heart's tissue or the electrical signaling that helps the heartbeat. These changes can happen due to different conditions and factors, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defects, infections, and aging. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\n\n**Who is more likely to develop atrial fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAnyone can develop AFib, but there are certain things that raise your risk for it:\n\n* Aging. The risk of atrial fibrillation increases as you get older, especially when you are over age 65.\n* Family history and genetics. AFib can run in families. So can heart disease, which raises your risk of AFib.\n* Some lifestyle choices. Your risk is higher if you drink a lot of alcohol, use certain illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, or smoke.\n* Having certain health conditions, such as:\n\t+ High blood pressure\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ Heart failure\n\t+ Heart valve diseases\n\t+ Obesity\n\t+ Hyperthyroidism\n\t+ Chronic kidney disease\n\t+ COPD and other lung diseases\n\t+ Sleep apnea\n\t+ Race. AFib is more common in people with European ancestry.\n\t+ Recent surgery. You may be at risk of atrial fibrillation in the early days and weeks after surgery on your heart, lungs, or esophagus.\n\n**What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nSome people who have AFib don't have any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do have symptoms, you may only notice them once in a while. Or you may have symptoms that are more frequent. And in some cases, the symptoms might be severe. If you have heart disease, you are more likely to notice your symptoms. And those symptoms could get worse if your heart disease gets worse.\n\nThe symptoms of AFib can include:\n\n* Extreme fatigue, which is the most common symptom\n* Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast)\n* Trouble breathing, especially when lying down or when exercising\n* Chest pain\n* Dizziness or fainting\n* Low blood pressure\n\n**What other problems can AFib cause?**\n\nIf AFib is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (complications) such as:\n\n* Stroke\n* Heart failure\n* Blood clots\n* Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)\n* Cognitive impairment and dementia\n\nTo help prevent these problems, it's important to contact your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do have AFib, the sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better.\n\n**How is atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have AFib, your provider:\n\n* Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have\n* Will ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had AFib\n* Will do a physical exam\n* May order blood tests\n* Will likely order heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) and echocardiogram\n* May ask you to wear a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activity\n\n**What are the treatments for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nThe treatments for AFib may include:\n\n* Antiarrhythmics (Texas Heart Institute)\n* Atrial Fibrillation Medications (American Heart Association)\n* Heart Treatments  (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)\n* Maze Surgery (Texas Heart Institute)\n* Treatment Options for Atrial Fibrillation  (American Heart Association)\n\n---\n\n**Atrial Fibrillation | AFib**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?**\n\nAtrial fibrillation, also known as AFib or AF, is one of the most common types of arrhythmias.

It occurs when the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, beat too quickly and irregularly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nThe symptoms of atrial fibrillation may include:\n\n*   Irregular heartbeat\n*   Rapid heartbeat\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Chest pain or discomfort\n*   Confusion or memory loss (in severe cases)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors of Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nAtrial fibrillation can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n*   Age: The risk of developing atrial fibrillation increases with age.\n*   High blood pressure: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\n*   Heart valve problems: Certain heart valve problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, can increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\n*   Coronary artery disease: Narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries can increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\n*   Thyroid disorders: Both overactive and underactive thyroid glands can increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nAtrial fibrillation is typically diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart. Other tests, such as a Holter monitor or cardiac event monitor, may also be used to diagnose and manage atrial fibrillation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options for Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nThe treatment options for atrial fibrillation depend on the individual's overall health and the severity of their symptoms. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   Medications: Anti-arrhythmic medications, blood thinners, and other medications may be used to manage atrial fibrillation.\n*   Cardioversion: A procedure that uses electrical shocks or chemicals to convert an abnormal heart rhythm back to a normal one.\n*   Ablation: A minimally invasive procedure that uses heat or cold energy to destroy the abnormal electrical pathways in the heart.\n*   Pacemakers: Small devices implanted in the chest to regulate the heartbeat.\n*   Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct underlying heart problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nWhile atrial fibrillation cannot be completely prevented, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing this condition. These include:\n\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Managing high blood pressure and other underlying health conditions\n*   Getting regular check-ups with a healthcare provider\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Living with Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nWhile atrial fibrillation can be a challenging condition to manage, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of complications and improve overall quality of life. These include:\n\n*   Working closely with a healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan\n*   Taking medications as directed\n*   Making lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of stroke and other heart-related problems\n*   Participating in regular check-ups with a healthcare provider\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter**\n\n_Atrial fibrillation (Afib) and atrial flutter are common types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which affect the upper chambers (atria) of the heart._\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way.\n\nElectrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).\n\nIn people with AFib:\n\n*   The atria do not contract in an organized pattern.\n*   The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast.\n*   As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern. When symptoms are present, they may include one or more of the following:\n\n*   Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding or thumping, fluttering, irregular, or too slow.\n*   Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations).\n*   Confusion.\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness.\n*   Fainting.\n*   Fatigue.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Loss of ability to exercise.\n*   Shortness of breath and anxiety.\n*   Sweating.\n*   Chest pain or pressure, which may be a sign of a heart attack. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider may hear a fast heartbeat while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your pulse may feel fast, uneven, or both.\n\nThe normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. In Afib or flutter, the heart rate may be as high as 250 to 350 beats per minute and is very often over 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be normal or low.\n\nAn ECG (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) may show AFib or atrial flutter.\n\nIf your abnormal heart rhythm comes and goes, you may need to wear a special monitor to diagnose the problem. The monitor records the heart's rhythms over a period of time.\n\nEvent monitor (3 to 4 weeks)\nHolter monitor (24-hour test)\nImplanted loop recorder (extended monitoring)\n\nTests to find heart disease may include:\n\n*   Echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart)\n*   Tests to examine the blood supply of the heart muscle\n*   Tests to study the heart's electrical system\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCardioversion treatment may be used to get the heart back into a normal rhythm right away. There are two options for treatment:\n\nElectric shocks to your heart\nMedicines given through a vein\n\nThese treatments may be done as emergency methods, or planned ahead of time.\n\nDaily medicines taken by mouth are used to:\n\n*   Slow the irregular heartbeat and maintain normal heart rhythm -- These drugs may include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and anti-arrhythmics.\n*   Prevent blood clots -- Blood-thinning medicines are often given to reduce the risk of blood clots that can result from ongoing irregular heart rhythms.\n*   Prevent AFib from coming back -- These drugs work well in many people, but they can have serious side effects. AFib returns in many people, even while they are taking these medicines.\n\nA procedure called radiofrequency ablation can be used to scar areas in your heart where the heart rhythm problems are triggered. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals that cause AFib or flutter from moving through your heart. You may need a heart pacemaker after this procedure. All people with AFib will need to learn how to manage this condition at home.\n\nPeople with AFib will most often need to take blood thinner medicines. These medicines are used to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot that travels in the body (and that can cause a stroke, for example). The irregular heart rhythm that occurs with AFib makes blood clots more likely to form.\n\nBlood thinner medicines include heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel may also be prescribed. However, blood thinners increase the chance of bleeding, so not everyone can use them.\n\nAnother stroke prevention option for people who cannot safely take these medicines is the Watchman Device, which has recently been approved by the FDA. This is a small basket-shaped implant that is placed inside the heart to block off the area of the heart where most of the clots form. This limits clots from forming.\n\nYour provider will consider your age and other medical problems when deciding which stroke prevention methods are best for you.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment can often control this disorder. Many people with AFib do very well with treatment.\n\nAFib tends to return and get worse. It may come back in some people, even with treatment.\n\nClots that break off and travel to the brain can cause a stroke.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of AFib or flutter.\n\nPrevention\n\nTalk to your provider about steps to treat conditions that cause atrial fibrillation and flutter. Avoid binge drinking.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nAuricular fibrillation; AFib; A-fib; Afib; Supraventricular arrhythmia; AF; AFL \n\nReferences\n\nCalkins H, Tomaselli GF, Morady F.

The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).\n\nIn people with AFib:\n\n*   The atria do not contract in an organized pattern.\n*   The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast.\n*   As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nCommon causes of AFib include:\n\n*   Alcohol use (especially binge drinking)\n*   Coronary artery disease\n*   Heart attack or heart bypass surgery\n*   Heart failure or an enlarged heart\n*   Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve)\n*   Hypertension\n*   Medicines\n*   Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n*   Pericarditis\n*   Sick sinus syndrome\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern. When symptoms are present, they may include one or more of the following:\n\n*   Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding or thumping, fluttering, irregular, or too slow.\n*   Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations).\n*   Confusion.\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness.\n*   Fainting.\n*   Fatigue.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Loss of ability to exercise.\n*   Shortness of breath and anxiety.\n*   Sweating.\n*   Chest pain or pressure, which may be a sign of a heart attack. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider may hear a fast heartbeat while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your pulse may feel fast, uneven, or both.\n\nThe normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. In Afib or flutter, the heart rate may be as high as 250 to 350 beats per minute and is very often over 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be normal or low.\n\nAn ECG (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) may show AFib or atrial flutter.\n\nIf your abnormal heart rhythm comes and goes, you may need to wear a special monitor to diagnose the problem. The monitor records the heart's rhythms over a period of time.\n\nEvent monitor (3 to 4 weeks)\nHolter monitor (24-hour test)\nImplanted loop recorder (extended monitoring)\n\nTests to find heart disease may include:\n\n*   Echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart)\n*   Tests to examine the blood supply of the heart muscle\n*   Tests to study the heart's electrical system\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCardioversion treatment may be used to get the heart back into a normal rhythm right away. There are two options for treatment:\n\nElectric shocks to your heart\nMedicines given through a vein\n\nThese treatments may be done as emergency methods, or planned ahead of time.\n\nDaily medicines taken by mouth are used to:\n\n*   Slow the irregular heartbeat and maintain normal heart rhythm -- These drugs may include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and anti-arrhythmics.\n*   Prevent blood clots -- Blood-thinning medicines are often given to reduce the risk of blood clots that can result from ongoing irregular heart rhythms.\n*   Prevent AFib from coming back -- These drugs work well in many people, but they can have serious side effects. AFib returns in many people, even while they are taking these medicines.\n\nA procedure called radiofrequency ablation can be used to scar areas in your heart where the heart rhythm problems are triggered. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals that cause AFib or flutter from moving through your heart. You may need a heart pacemaker after this procedure. All people with AFib will need to learn how to manage this condition at home.\n\nPeople with AFib will most often need to take blood thinner medicines. These medicines are used to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot that travels in the body (and that can cause a stroke, for example). The irregular heart rhythm that occurs with AFib makes blood clots more likely to form.\n\nBlood thinner medicines include heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel may also be prescribed. However, blood thinners increase the chance of bleeding, so not everyone can use them.\n\nAnother stroke prevention option for people who cannot safely take these medicines is the Watchman Device, which has recently been approved by the FDA. This is a small basket-shaped implant that is placed inside the heart to block off the area of the heart where most of the clots form. This limits clots from forming.\n\nYour provider will consider your age and other medical problems when deciding which stroke prevention methods are best for you.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment can often control this disorder. Many people with AFib do very well with treatment.\n\nAFib tends to return and get worse. It may come back in some people, even with treatment.\n\nClots that break off and travel to the brain can cause a stroke.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of AFib or flutter.\n\nPrevention\n\nTalk to your provider about steps to treat conditions that cause atrial fibrillation and flutter. Avoid binge drinking.\n\n---\n\n**Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter**\n\nLearn how to cite this page\n\n**What are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter?**\n\nAtrial fibrillation (Afib) and atrial flutter are common types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which affect the upper chambers (atria) of the heart.\n\nIn atrial flutter, the heart beats too fast, but mostly continues to contract in a regular rhythm. AFib is a closely related condition in which the atria contract in a chaotic manner, or \"quivers.\" This creates an irregular heart rhythm that is also usually too fast. Afib and atrial flutter often occur in the same person at different times.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way.\n\nElectrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).\n\nIn people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the sequence of heart muscle contractions (rhythm) in the upper chambers of the heart (atria).\n\nIn AFib:\n\n* The atria do not contract in an organized pattern.\n* The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast.\n* As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nIn people with atrial flutter, the atria beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern.\n\nThese problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age.\n\nCommon causes of AFib include:\n\n* Alcohol use (especially binge drinking)\n* Coronary artery disease\n* Heart attack or heart bypass surgery\n* Heart failure or an enlarged heart\n* Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve)\n* Hypertension\n* Medicines\n* Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n* Pericarditis\n* Sick sinus syndrome\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern.

It most often grows on the wall that separates the two sides of the heart, known as the atrial septum.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor, meaning it started within the heart. Most heart tumors begin elsewhere. Primary cardiac tumors like myxomas are rare, with about 75% occurring in the left atrium. They often start in the wall dividing the two upper chambers of the heart.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany myxomas won't cause symptoms and are discovered during an imaging study (echocardiogram, MRI, CT) for another reason. Symptoms may occur at any time, often accompanied by a change in body position.

    "content": "**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**\n\n_A congenital heart defect present at birth_\n\nAs a baby develops in the womb, a wall (septum) forms that divides the upper chamber into a left and right atrium. When this wall does not form correctly, it can result in a defect that remains after birth. This is called an atrial septal defect, or ASD.\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen.\n\nWhen blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left. If this occurs, there will be less oxygen in the blood that goes to the body.\n\n**Types of ASD**\n\nAtrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum.\n\n* Primum defects are linked to other heart defects of the ventricular septum and mitral valve.\n* Secundum defects can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later.\n\nSymptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood. They can include:\n\n* Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\n* Frequent respiratory infections in children\n* Feeling the heart beat (palpitations) in adults\n* Shortness of breath with activity\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will check how large and severe an ASD is based on the symptoms, physical exam, and the results of heart tests.\n\nThe provider may hear abnormal heart sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. A murmur may be heard only in certain body positions. Sometimes, a murmur may not be heard at all. A murmur means that blood is not flowing through the heart smoothly.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nASD may not need treatment if there are few or no symptoms, or if the defect is small and is not associated with other abnormalities. Surgery to close the defect is recommended if the defect causes a large amount of shunting, the heart is swollen, or symptoms occur.\n\nA procedure has been developed to close the defect (if no other abnormalities are present) without open heart surgery. Some people with ASDs may be able to have this procedure, depending on the size and location of the defect.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPeople with a larger or more complicated ASD are at an increased risk for developing other problems, including:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms, particularly atrial fibrillation\n* Heart failure\n* Heart infection (endocarditis)\n* High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**\n\n**What is Atrial Septal Defect?**\n\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect that occurs when there is a hole in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. This hole allows blood to flow between the two chambers, which can lead to various health problems.\n\n**Causes of Atrial Septal Defect**\n\nNormally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen. When blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens, the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time, pressure in the lungs may build up.\n\n**Types of Atrial Septal Defects**\n\nAtrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum.\n\n*   **Primum Defects**: These are linked to other heart defects of the ventricular septum and mitral valve.\n*   **Secundum Defects**: These can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers.\n\n**Symptoms of Atrial Septal Defect**\n\nA person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later. Symptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood and can include:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\n*   Frequent respiratory infections in children\n*   Feeling the heart beat (palpitations) in adults\n*   Shortness of breath with activity\n\n**Diagnosis of Atrial Septal Defect**\n\nThe health care provider will check how large and severe an ASD is based on the symptoms, physical exam, and the results of heart tests. The provider may hear abnormal heart sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. A murmur may be heard only in certain body positions.

They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers.\n\nVery small defects (less than 5 millimeters or ¼ inch) are less likely to cause problems. Smaller defects are often discovered much later in life than larger ones.\n\nAlong with the size of the ASD, where the defect is located plays a role that affects blood flow and oxygen levels. The presence of other heart defects is also important.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later.\n\nSymptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood. They can include:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\n*   Frequent respiratory infections in children\n*   Feeling the heart beat (palpitations) in adults\n*   Shortness of breath with activity\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will check how large and severe an ASD is based on the symptoms, physical exam, and the results of heart tests.\n\nThe provider may hear abnormal heart sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. A murmur may be heard only in certain body positions. Sometimes, a murmur may not be heard at all. A murmur means that blood is not flowing through the heart smoothly.\n\nThe physical exam may also show signs of heart failure in some adults.\n\nAn echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. It is often the first test done. A Doppler study done as part of the echocardiogram allows the provider to assess the amount of shunting of blood between the heart chambers.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n*   Cardiac catheterization\n*   Coronary angiography (for patients over 35 years old)\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Heart MRI or CT\n*   Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nASD may not need treatment if there are few or no symptoms, or if the defect is small and is not associated with other abnormalities. Surgery to close the defect is recommended if the defect causes a large amount of shunting, the heart is swollen, or symptoms occur.\n\nA procedure has been developed to close the defect (if no other abnormalities are present) without open heart surgery. Some people with ASDs may be able to have this procedure, depending on the size and location of the defect.\n\nThe procedure involves placing an ASD closure device into the heart through tubes called catheters.\nThe provider makes a tiny cut in the groin, then inserts the catheters into a blood vessel and up into the heart.\nThe closure device is then placed across the ASD and the defect is closed.\n\nSometimes, open-heart surgery may be needed to repair the defect. This type of surgery is more likely needed when other heart defects are present.\n\nPeople who have a repair to close an ASD should get antibiotics before any dental procedures they have in the period following the procedure. Antibiotics are not needed later on.\n\n---\n\n**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Atrial Septal Defect?**\n\nAn atrial septal defect, or ASD, is a congenital heart condition where there is an abnormal opening in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart. This opening allows blood to flow between the left and right atria.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ASDs is not known. However, they are more common in people with a family history of congenital heart defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome people with ASD may have no symptoms at all, while others may experience:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Chest pain or discomfort\n* Coughing up blood (in rare cases)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nASDs are typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence using echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent ASDs. However, some complications can be prevented with early detection and treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\n* **Catheter-based closure**: A small device is placed across the ASD using a catheter inserted through a blood vessel in the groin.\n* **Open-heart surgery**: In some cases, open-heart surgery may be needed to repair the defect. This type of surgery is more likely needed when other heart defects are present.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent ASDs. However, some complications can be prevented with early detection and treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCongenital heart defect - ASD; Birth defect heart - ASD; Primum ASD; Secundum ASD\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPeople with a larger or more complicated ASD are at an increased risk for developing other problems, including:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms\n* Heart failure\n* Heart infection (endocarditis)\n* High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Atrial Septal Defect?**\n\nAn atrial septal defect, or ASD, is a congenital heart defect that occurs when there is an opening in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart. This opening allows blood to flow between the left and right atria.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ASDs is not known, but they are thought to occur due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some risk factors for developing an ASD include:\n\n*   Family history: Individuals with a family history of congenital heart defects may be more likely to develop an ASD.\n*   Genetic mutations: Certain genetic mutations have been linked to the development of ASDs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of an ASD can vary depending on the size and location of the defect, as well as the presence of any other heart problems. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Coughing or wheezing\n*   Swelling in the legs or feet\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing an ASD typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as:\n\n*   Echocardiogram: This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n*   Chest X-ray: This test uses radiation to take pictures of the chest.\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG): This test measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for an ASD depends on the size and location of the defect, as well as the presence of any other heart problems. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   Surgical repair: This involves closing the opening in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart.\n*   Catheter-based closure: This involves using a catheter to place a device that closes the opening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with an ASD is generally good, especially if the defect is small and there are no other heart problems. However, larger defects or those that occur in combination with other heart problems may have a poorer prognosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects",

    "content": "**Atropine Ophthalmic**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOphthalmic atropine is used before eye examinations to dilate (open) the pupil, the black part of the eye through which you see. It is also used to relieve pain caused by swelling and inflammation of the eye.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAtropine comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes and an eye ointment to apply to the eyes. The drops are usually instilled two to four times a day. The ointment is usually applied one to three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use atropine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**To instill the eye drops:**\n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n2. Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n3. Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n4. While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n5. Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n7. While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n8. Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n9. Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure for 2-3 minutes.\n10. Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n11. If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n12. Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n13. Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**To apply the eye ointment:**\n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n2. Use a mirror or have someone else apply the ointment.\n3. Avoid touching the tip of the tube against your eye or anything else. The ointment must be kept clean.\n4. Tilt your head forward slightly.\n5. Holding the tube between your thumb and index finger, place the tube as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.\n7. With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of your eye down to form a pocket.\n8. Place a small amount of ointment into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. A 1/2-inch (1.25-centimeter) strip of ointment usually is enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n9. Gently close your eyes and keep them closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.\n10. Replace and tighten the cap right away.\n11. Wipe off any excess ointment from your eyelids and lashes with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n* Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n* If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n\n---\n\n**Atropine Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n    Before using atropine eye drops or eye ointment,\n        tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atropine, belladonna, or any other drugs.\n        Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using atropine.

However, some individuals may not be diagnosed with ADHD until they are adults.\n\n**Types of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**\n\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n\n1. **Mostly Inattentive ADHD**: Characterized by difficulty paying attention and being easily distracted.\n2. **Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD**: Includes symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity, such as:\n\t* Hyperactivity: constant movement or \"on the go\"\n\t* Impulsivity: trouble controlling actions and words\n3. **Combined ADHD**: A mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms\n\n**Symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**\n\nThe symptoms of ADHD depend on the type:\n\n1. **Attention problems**:\n\t* Miss details or make careless mistakes\n\t* Trouble staying focused\n\t* Not seem to listen\n\t* Difficulty following instructions or finishing tasks\n\t* Trouble being organized and managing time\n2. **Hyperactivity-impulsivity**:\n\t* Fidgeting and squirming while seated\n\t* Getting up when expected to stay seated\n\t* Running around or climbing (children) or feeling restless (teens and adults)\n\t* Trouble doing quiet activities\n\t* Constant movement or \"on the go\"\n\t* Talking excessively\n\t* Blurring out answers before questions are completed\n3. **Combined ADHD**: A mix of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms\n\n**Causes of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**\n\nThe exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but it likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**\n\nADHD is typically diagnosed through a comprehensive evaluation, including:\n\n1. **Medical history**: To rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. **Behavioral observations**: To assess the severity and impact of symptoms on daily life.\n3. **Psychological evaluations**: To identify patterns of behavior and cognitive functioning.\n\nA diagnosis of ADHD is typically made by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician, psychologist, or psychiatrist.\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder | ADHD | ADD**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with combined ADHD show a mix of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosing ADHD**\n\nThere is no single test to diagnose ADHD. One step of the process for diagnosing ADHD involves having a physical exam, including vision tests, hearing tests (for children and adults), and other tests to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD. Other problems with similar symptoms include anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities.\n\nThe process also involves a thorough medical history and family history. And it usually includes using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions. These tools have rating scales (scoring systems) that help the provider see if a person's symptoms and history fit a diagnosis of ADHD.\n\nTo make a diagnosis of ADHD, the provider needs to have found all of these things:\n\n* Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12.\n* Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems:\n\t+ For children up to age 16, there must be at least 6 ongoing symptoms.\n\t+ For people 17 and older, there must be at least 5 ongoing symptoms.\n* Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings, for example, at home and at work or school.\n* Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations.\n* Symptoms aren't caused by another mental health disorder.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nAlthough there is no cure for ADHD, treatments may help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. ADHD is commonly treated with:\n\nMedicines.\nPsychotherapy (talk therapy), including behavior therapy.\nEducation or training for parents to give them the skills and strategies to help their child. This is especially important for younger children.\nA combination of these treatments.\n\nGood treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.\n\nHaving a healthy lifestyle, such as healthy eating and regular exercise, may also help manage symptoms.\n\nFor school-aged children, school support is important. This could include classroom-based behavioral interventions such as behavior management plans or teaching your child organizational and study skills. It may also include accommodations such as specific seating in the classroom, reduced classwork, or extended time on tests and exams.\n\n**Living With ADHD**\n\nADHD: Tips to Try (Nemours Foundation)\nIndividualized Education Plans (IEPs) (Nemours Foundation)\nParenting a Child with ADHD (Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nADHD and Substance Abuse: The Link Parents Need to Know (American Academy of Pediatrics)\nAllergies and Hyperactivity (American Academy of Pediatrics)\nOther Concerns and Conditions with ADHD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder | ADHD | ADD**\n\n**Allergies and Hyperactivity**\n* Also in Spanish: [Alérgicas y hiperactividad](http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-aap/committees/allergy/Documents/Allergies%20and%20Hyperactivity.pdf)\n\n**Other Concerns and Conditions with ADHD**\n* Also in Spanish: [Otros problemas y condiciones con TDAH](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/pdf/fs_adhd_spanish.pdf)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* **College Students with ADHD**\n\t+ American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n\t+ [Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: MedlinePlus Genetics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279498/) (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\t+ National Library of Medicine\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n* **Data and Statistics on ADHD**\n\t+ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\t+ [Faststats: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/adhd.htm) (National Center for Health Statistics)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* **ClinicalTrials.gov: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity**\n\t+ National Institutes of Health\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* **References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed**\n\t+ National Library of Medicine\n\t+ [The effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programme for parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148491)\n\t+ [The effects of physical activity on mental health in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944451)\n\t+ [Gut microbiome differences in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and typically developing peers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22852041)\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n* **American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry**\n\t+ [Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist Finder](http://www.aacap.org/page/findadoctor)\n* **Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\t+ FindTreatment.gov (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration)\n\n**Children**\n\n* **ADHD (Nemours Foundation)**\n* **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: What You Need to Know** (National Institute of Mental Health)\n\n**Girls**\n\n* **Women and Girls (With ADHD)** (Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)\n\n**Teenagers**\n\n* **ADHD (Nemours Foundation)**\n* **ADHD Medicines (Nemours Foundation)**\n\n**Adults**\n\n* **ADHD in Adults: 4 Things to Know** (National Institute of Mental Health)\n* **Adult Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n* **ADHD: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Fact Sheet** (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) - PDF\n* **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder** (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* **Medicines for ADHD** (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n**Topic Image**\n\n* [MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n* [Hyperactivity](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n* [Hyperactivity and sugar](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n* [Medicines for ADHD](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Child Behavior Disorders**\n* **Learning Disabilities**\n* **National Institutes of Health**\n\t+ The primary NIH organization for research on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is the National Institute of Mental Health\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder | ADHD | ADD**\n\n\\n\\nSee our disclaimer about external links and our quality guidelines.\\n\\nDisclaimers\\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

    "content": "**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?**\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem caused by the presence of one or more of these findings:\n\n* Not being able to focus\n* Being overactive\n* Not being able to control behavior\n\n**Causes**\n\nADHD often begins in childhood. But it may continue into the adult years. ADHD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls.\n\nIt is not clear what causes ADHD. It may be linked to genes and home or social factors. Experts have found that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of children without ADHD. Brain chemicals are also different.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nADHD symptoms fall into three groups:\n\n* Not being able to focus (inattentiveness)\n* Being extremely active (hyperactivity)\n* Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity)\n\nSome people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors.\n\n**Inattentive Symptoms**\n\n* Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork\n* Has problems focusing during tasks or play\n* Doesn't listen when spoken to directly\n* Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores\n* Has problems organizing tasks and activities\n* Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork)\n* Often loses things, such as homework or toys\n* Is easily distracted\n* Is often forgetful\n* Has trouble concentrating\n\n**Hyperactivity Symptoms**\n\n* Fidgets or squirms in seat\n* Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat\n* Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so\n* Has problems playing or working quietly\n* Is often on the go, acts as if \"driven by a motor\"\n* Talks all the time\n\n**Impulsivity Symptoms**\n\n* Blurts out answers before questions have been completed\n* Has problems awaiting their turn\n* Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)\n\nMany of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThere is no test that can diagnose ADHD. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed above. When a child is suspected to have ADHD, parents and teachers are often involved during the evaluation.\n\nMost children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health issue. This may be a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Or, it may be a learning issue or a tic disorder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreating ADHD is a partnership between your health care provider and the person with ADHD. If it's a child, parents and often teachers are involved. For treatment to work, it is important to:\n\n* Set specific goals that are right for you or your child.\n* Start medicine or talk therapy, or both.\n* Follow-up regularly with your provider to check on goals, results, and any side effects of medicines.\n\nIf treatment does not seem to work, your provider will likely:\n\n* Confirm the person has ADHD.\n* Check for health problems that can cause similar symptoms.\n* Make sure the treatment plan is being followed.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nMedicine combined with behavioral treatment often works best. Different ADHD medicines can be used alone or combined with each other. Your provider will decide which medicine is right, based on your child's symptoms and needs.\n\nPsychostimulants (also known as stimulants) are the most commonly used medicines. Although these medicines are called stimulants, they actually have a calming effect on people with ADHD. Other medicines that are not stimulants are FDA approved for some people with ADHD. Ask your provider what is best for you.\n\nFollow your provider's instructions about how to take ADHD medicine. Your provider needs to monitor if the medicine is working and if there are any problems with it. So, be sure to keep all appointments with your provider.\n\nSome ADHD medicines have side effects. If you or your child has side effects, contact your provider right away. The dosage or medicine itself may need to be changed.\n\n**Therapy**\n\nA common type of ADHD therapy is called behavioral therapy. It teaches children and parents healthy behaviors and how to manage disruptive behaviors. For mild ADHD, behavioral therapy alone (without medicine) may be effective.\n\nOther tips to help a child with ADHD include:\n\n* Talk regularly with your child's teacher.\n* Keep a daily schedule, including regular times for homework, meals, and activities. Make changes to the schedule ahead of time and not at the last moment.\n* Limit distractions in your child's environment.\n* Make sure your child gets a healthy, varied diet, with plenty of fiber and basic nutrients.\n* Make sure your child gets enough sleep.\n* Praise and reward good behavior.\n* Provide clear and consistent rules for your child.\n\nThere is little proof that alternative treatments for ADHD such as herbs, supplements, and chiropractic treatments are helpful.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can find help and support in dealing with ADHD at:\n\nChildren and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) -- chadd.org\n\n**Outlook**\n\nADHD is a long-term condition. ADHD may lead to:\n\n* Illegal drug use and alcohol misuse\n* Not doing well in school\n* Problems keeping a job\n* Trouble with the law\n\nOne third to one half of children with ADHD have symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity as adults. Adults with ADHD are often able to control behavior and mask problems.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child's teachers suspect ADHD. You should also tell your provider about:\n\n* Problems at home, school, and with peers\n* Side effects of ADHD medicine\n* Signs of depression\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**Causes**\n\nADHD often begins in childhood, but it may continue into the adult years.

For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThere is no test that can diagnose ADHD. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed above. When a child is suspected to have ADHD, parents and teachers are often involved during the evaluation.\n\nMost children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health issue. This may be a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Or, it may be a learning issue or a tic disorder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreating ADHD is a partnership between your healthcare provider and the person with ADHD. If it's a child, parents and often teachers are involved. For treatment to work, it is important to:\n\n* Set specific goals that are right for you or your child.\n* Start medicine or talk therapy, or both.\n* Follow-up regularly with your provider to check on goals, results, and any side effects of medicines.\n\nIf treatment does not seem to work, your provider will likely:\n\n* Confirm the person has ADHD.\n* Check for health problems that can cause similar symptoms.\n* Make sure the treatment plan is being followed.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nMedicine combined with behavioral treatment often works best. Different ADHD medicines can be used alone or combined with each other. Your provider will decide which medicine is right, based on your child's symptoms and needs.\n\nPsychostimulants (also known as stimulants) are the most commonly used medicines. Although these medicines are called stimulants, they actually have a calming effect on people with ADHD. Other medicines that are not stimulants are FDA approved for some people with ADHD. Ask your provider what is best for you.\n\n**Therapy**\n\nA common type of ADHD therapy is called behavioral therapy. It teaches children and parents healthy behaviors and how to manage disruptive behaviors. For mild ADHD, behavioral therapy alone (without medicine) may be effective.\n\nOther tips to help a child with ADHD include:\n\n* Talk regularly with your child's teacher.\n* Keep a daily schedule, including regular times for homework, meals, and activities. Make changes to the schedule ahead of time and not at the last moment.\n* Limit distractions in your child's environment.\n* Make sure your child gets a healthy, varied diet, with plenty of fiber and basic nutrients.\n* Make sure your child gets enough sleep.\n* Praise and reward good behavior.\n* Provide clear and consistent rules for your child.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can find help and support in dealing with ADHD at:\n\nChildren and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) -- chadd.org\n\n**Outlook**\n\nADHD is a long-term condition. If left untreated, it may lead to:\n\n* Illegal drug use and alcohol misuse\n* Not doing well in school\n* Problems keeping a job\n* Trouble with the law\n\nOne third to one half of children with ADHD have symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity as adults. Adults with ADHD are often able to control behavior and mask problems.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child's teachers suspect ADHD. You should also tell your provider about:\n\n* Problems at home, school, and with peers\n* Side effects of ADHD medicine\n* Signs of depression\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?**\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

The diagnosis of ADHD involves a comprehensive evaluation of the individual's symptoms, behavior, and developmental history.\n\n**Clinical Practice Guidelines**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has developed clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents. These guidelines provide recommendations for clinicians on how to assess and manage ADHD in this population.\n\n**Diagnostic Criteria**\n\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), ADHD is diagnosed when an individual exhibits a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with their functioning or relationships. The diagnostic criteria for ADHD include symptoms such as difficulty sustaining attention, following instructions, or completing tasks; excessive running around or feeling restless; and difficulty waiting one's turn.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment of ADHD involves a multidisciplinary approach that may include medication, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Medications such as stimulants and non-stimulants can help manage symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. Behavioral therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be effective in teaching individuals with ADHD coping skills and strategies to improve their functioning.\n\n**References**\n\n* Wolraich ML, Hagan JF Jr, Allan C, et al.

    "content": "**Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder**\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that typically begins in childhood and is characterized by a short attention span (inattention), an inability to be calm and stay still (hyperactivity), and poor impulse control (impulsivity). Some people with ADHD have problems with only inattention or with hyperactivity and impulsivity, but most have problems related to all three features.\n\nIn people with ADHD, the characteristic behaviors are frequent and severe enough to interfere with the activities of daily living such as school, work, and relationships with others. Because of an inability to stay focused on tasks, people with inattention may be easily distracted, forgetful, avoid tasks that require sustained attention, have difficulty organizing tasks, or frequently lose items.\n\n*   **Hyperactivity**: usually shown by frequent movement\n    *   Individuals with this feature often fidget or tap their foot when seated\n    *   Leave their seat when it is inappropriate to do so (such as in the classroom)\n    *   Talk a lot and interrupt others\n\n**Impulsivity**\n\nCan result in hasty actions without thought for the consequences. Individuals with poor impulse control may have difficulty waiting for their turn, deferring to others, or considering their actions before acting.\n\nMore than two-thirds of all individuals with ADHD have additional conditions, including:\n\n*   Insomnia\n*   Mood or anxiety disorders\n*   Learning disorders\n*   Substance use disorders\n\nAffected individuals may also have autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interaction, or Tourette syndrome, which is a disorder characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements or noises called tics.\n\nIn most affected individuals, ADHD continues throughout life, but in about one-third of individuals, signs and symptoms of ADHD go away by adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**What is Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?**\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that typically begins in childhood and is characterized by a short attention span (inattention), an inability to be calm and stay still (hyperactivity), and poor impulse control (impulsivity).\n\n**Symptoms of ADHD**\n\nSome people with ADHD have problems with only inattention or with hyperactivity and impulsivity, but most have problems related to all three features.

Many gene variations, most of which have not been identified, are thought to affect the risk of developing ADHD. Environmental risk factors that may contribute to the development of ADHD include complications during pregnancy and delivery and exposure to heavy metals such as lead.\n\nLess commonly, ADHD is caused by rare gene mutations or chromosome abnormalities. In these instances, ADHD is usually one of several features of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body.\n\n---\n\n**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nADHD is a complex disorder that involves both genetic and environmental factors. The exact causes of ADHD are still unclear, but research suggests that it may be related to:\n\n*   **Genetic mutations**: Rare gene mutations or chromosome abnormalities can cause ADHD.\n*   **Environmental factors**: Exposure to toxins such as lead, as well as other environmental factors, may contribute to the development of ADHD.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nADHD has a tendency to run in families, but the inheritance pattern is usually unknown. Overall, the risk of developing this condition is about nine times greater for first-degree relatives of people with the condition (such as siblings or children) as compared to the general public. People with genetic changes associated with ADHD generally inherit an increased risk of developing the condition, rather than the condition itself. When ADHD is a feature of another genetic syndrome, it can be passed on according to the inheritance pattern of that syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   ADD\n*   ADH\n*   ADHD\n*   Attention deficit\n*   Attention deficit disorder\n*   Attention deficit disorder of childhood with hyperactivity\n*   Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity\n*   Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity syndrome\n*   Hyperkinetic disorder\n*   Hyperkinetic syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, susceptibility to, 1\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, susceptibility to, 7\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials**\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ADHD\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**\n\n**Genetics**\n\nResearch has shown that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is heritable, with certain genetic variants contributing to the risk of developing the condition. A study of 8,500 twin pairs found that childhood ADHD was associated with a specific genetic variant.\n\n**Medicines for ADHD**\n\nSeveral medications are available to treat ADHD, including stimulants and non-stimulants. The choice of medication depends on the individual's symptoms and medical history.\n\n**ADHD Screening**\n\nScreening tests can help identify individuals who may be at risk for ADHD. These tests typically involve a series of questions about behavior and symptoms.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nGenetic conditions are caused by changes in an individual's DNA. Some genetic conditions are inherited, meaning they are passed down from parents to children through genes. Understanding genetics can help individuals make informed decisions about their health and the health of their family members.\n\n**Prognosis of a Genetic Condition**\n\nThe prognosis of a genetic condition depends on various factors, including the specific condition, the individual's overall health, and the effectiveness of treatment. Some genetic conditions have a good prognosis with early intervention, while others may require ongoing management.\n\n**Gene Variants and Health Development**\n\nGene variants can affect an individual's health and development in various ways. Some gene variants may increase the risk of developing certain medical conditions, while others may influence an individual's response to treatment or their susceptibility to environmental factors.\n\n**Disorder Running in Family**\n\nIf a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component to the condition. In some cases, identifying a family history of a particular disorder can help individuals and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n**Inheritance of Genetic Conditions**\n\nGenetic conditions can be inherited through different mechanisms, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance. Understanding the mode of inheritance for a specific condition can help individuals and their families prepare for potential health challenges.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Genetic Conditions**\n\nThe treatment and management of genetic conditions depend on the specific condition, its severity, and the individual's overall health. In some cases, early intervention and ongoing management can help mitigate the effects of a genetic condition, while in other cases, treatment may focus on managing symptoms and preventing complications.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n* Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting:\n\n*   **Hemolytic anemia**: red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely\n*   **Thrombocytopenia**: reduced level of circulating platelets\n*   **Kidney failure**: acute kidney failure that can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nHemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Symptoms of anemia include:\n\n*   Unusually pale skin (pallor)\n*   Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\n*   Fatigue\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Rapid heart rate\n\nThrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.\n\n**Distinguishing from Typical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10.\n\n---\n\n**Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\n**What is Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome?**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare disease that primarily affects kidney function. It causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow.\n\n**Symptoms of Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nThe condition is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting:\n\n*   **Hemolytic Anemia**: Red blood cells break down prematurely due to clots in small blood vessels. This can lead to anemia, causing pale skin, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.\n*   **Thrombocytopenia**: A reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that assist with blood clotting. This can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.\n*   **Kidney Damage and Acute Kidney Failure**: Clot formation in small blood vessels leads to kidney damage and acute kidney failure, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases.\n\n**Distinguishing Atypical HUS from Typical HUS**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins.\n\n**Frequency of Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nThe incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States. The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form.\n\n**Causes of Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome often results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Mutations in at least seven genes appear to increase the risk of developing the disorder. Mutations in a gene called CFH are most common, found in about 30 percent of all cases.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nThe genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome provide instructions for making proteins involved in the complement system, which is part of the body's immune response. These regulatory proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.\n\n**Environmental Triggers**\n\nAlthough gene mutations increase the risk of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, studies suggest that they are often not sufficient to cause the disease. In people with certain genetic changes, the signs and symptoms of the disorder may be triggered by factors including certain medications, chronic diseases, viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, or pregnancy.\n\n**Idiopathic Cases**\n\nSome people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome do not have any known genetic changes or environmental triggers for the disease. In these cases, the disorder is described as idiopathic.\n\n---\n\n**Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\n**What is Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome?**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of abnormal blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. This can lead to kidney damage and, in many cases, kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\n**Causes of Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome often results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Mutations in at least seven genes appear to increase the risk of developing the disorder.\n\n*   **CFH Gene:** Mutations in this gene are most common, found in about 30 percent of all cases of aHUS.\n*   **Other Genes:** Mutations in other genes have each been identified in a smaller percentage of cases.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nThe genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome provide instructions for making proteins involved in the complement system, a part of the body's immune response. This system must be carefully regulated to target only unwanted materials and not attack healthy cells.\n\nMutations in these genes lead to uncontrolled activation of the complement system, causing inflammation and the formation of abnormal clots that can damage the kidneys.\n\n**Environmental Triggers**\n\nIn people with certain genetic changes, the signs and symptoms of aHUS may be triggered by factors such as:\n\n*   Certain medications (e.g., anticancer drugs)\n*   Chronic diseases\n*   Viral or bacterial infections\n*   Cancers\n*   Organ transplantation\n*   Pregnancy\n\n**Idiopathic Cases**\n\nSome people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome do not have any known genetic changes or environmental triggers for the disease. In these cases, the disorder is described as idiopathic.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of aHUS are sporadic, occurring in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. Less than 20 percent of all cases have been reported to run in families.\n\nWhen the disorder is familial, it can have an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance:\n\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Inheritance:** One copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder.\n*   **Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:** Both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nTo learn more about the genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, expand the section below:\n\n*   C3\n*   CFH\n*   CFHR5\n*   CFI\n\nAdditional information from NCBI Gene includes:\n\n*   CD46\n*   CFB\n*   THBD\n\n---\n\n**Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome**\n\n**Symptoms and Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAtypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (AHUS) is a rare disorder characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, acute kidney failure, and low platelet count. The symptoms of AHUS can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Hemolytic anemia: destruction of red blood cells\n* Acute kidney failure: impaired function of the kidneys\n* Low platelet count: thrombocytopenia\n\nAHUS is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with AHUS each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Types of Inheritance Patterns**\n\nThere are two main types of inheritance patterns associated with AHUS:\n\n* **Autosomal recessive inheritance**: both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. This is the most common pattern of inheritance for AHUS.\n* **Autosomal dominant inheritance**: one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAHUS is also known by other names, including:\n\n* Non-Shiga-like toxin-associated HUS\n* Nonenteropathic HUS\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify individuals with AHUS. The following genetic tests are available:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with B factor anomaly\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with C3 anomaly\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with I factor anomaly\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with MCP/CD46 anomaly\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with thrombomodulin anomaly\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on AHUS:\n\n* Caprioli J, Noris M, Brioschi S, et al.

    "content": "**Atypical Pneumonia**\n\nPneumonia is inflamed or swollen lung tissue due to infection with a germ. With atypical pneumonia, the infection is caused by different bacteria than the more common ones that cause pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia also tends to have milder symptoms than typical pneumonia. It more often has symptoms that aren't just related to the lungs, including headache, low-grade fever, rash, joint pain, and stomach symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBacteria that cause atypical pneumonia include:\n\n*   Pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae often affects people younger than age 40.\n*   Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria occurs year round.\n*   Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila bacteria is seen more often in middle-aged and older adults, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses or a weak immune system. It can be more severe. This type of pneumonia is also called Legionnaire disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPneumonia due to mycoplasma or chlamydia bacteria is usually mild. Pneumonia due to legionella gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days.\n\nThe most common symptoms of pneumonia are:\n\n*   Chills\n*   Cough (with legionella pneumonia, you may cough up bloody mucus)\n*   Fever, which may be mild or high\n*   Shortness of breath (may only occur when you exert yourself)\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n*   Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough\n*   Confusion, most often in older people or those with legionella pneumonia\n*   Headache\n*   Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue\n*   Muscle aches and joint stiffness\n*   Sweating and clammy skin\n\nLess common symptoms include:\n\n*   Diarrhea and vomiting (often with legionella pneumonia)\n*   Ear pain (with mycoplasma pneumonia)\n*   Eye pain or soreness (with mycoplasma pneumonia)\n*   Neck lump (with mycoplasma pneumonia)\n*   Rash (with mycoplasma pneumonia)\n*   Sore throat (with mycoplasma pneumonia)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPeople with suspected pneumonia should have a complete medical evaluation. It may be hard for your health care provider to tell whether you have pneumonia, bronchitis, or another respiratory infection, so you may need a chest x-ray. The evaluation is similar for people who have more typical pneumonia.\n\nDepending on how severe the symptoms are, other tests may be done, including:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Blood tests to identify the specific bacteria\n*   Bronchoscopy in which a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the end is passed down to your lungs in selected cases (rarely needed)\n*   CT scan of the chest\n*   Measuring levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood (arterial blood gases)\n*   Nose or throat swab to check for bacteria and viruses\n*   Blood cultures\n*   Open lung biopsy (only done in very serious illnesses when the diagnosis cannot be made from other sources)\n*   Sputum culture to identify the specific bacteria\n*   Urine test to check for legionella bacteria\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTo feel better, you can take these self-care measures at home:\n\n*   Regulate your fever with aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen or naproxen), or acetaminophen. Do not give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called Reye syndrome.\n*   Do not take cough medicines without first checking with your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up the extra sputum.\n*   Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm.\n*   Get a lot of rest. Have someone else do household chores.\n\nIf needed, you will be prescribed antibiotics.\n\nYou may be able to take antibiotics by mouth at home.\nIf your condition is severe, you will likely be admitted to a hospital. There, you will be given antibiotics through a vein (intravenously), as well as oxygen.\nAntibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more.\nFinish all the antibiotics you've been prescribed, even if you feel better. If you stop the medicine too soon, the pneumonia can return and may be harder to treat.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people with pneumonia due to mycoplasma or chlamydia get better with the right antibiotics. Legionella pneumonia can be severe. It can lead to problems, most often in those with kidney failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system. It can also lead to death.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result include any of the following:\n\n*   Brain and nervous system infections, such as meningitis, myelitis, and encephalitis\n*   Hemolytic anemia, a condition in which there are not enough red blood cells in the blood because the body is destroying them\n*   Severe lung damage\n*   Respiratory failure requiring breathing machine support (ventilator)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath. There are many causes for these symptoms. The provider will need to check for pneumonia.\n\nAlso, contact your provider if you have been diagnosed with this type of pneumonia and your symptoms become worse after improving first.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWash your hands often and have other people around you do the same.\n\nAvoid contact with sick people whenever possible.\n\nIf your immune system is weak, stay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have a cold to wear a mask.\n\nDo not smoke. If you do, get help to quit.\n\nGet appropriate vaccines like flu and COVID-19 shot as prescribed.

    "content": "**Au-Kline Syndrome**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is a condition that affects many body systems. Individuals with this condition typically have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disability, and delayed development.\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\nIndividuals with Au-Kline syndrome can have distinctive facial features, including:\n\n* Long openings of the eyelids (long palpebral fissures)\n* Drooping eyelids (ptosis)\n* Shallow eye sockets\n* Broad nasal bridge\n* Mouth with outer corners turned downward and often held in an open position\n* Deep groove down the middle of the tongue\n\nLess common abnormalities include:\n\n* Premature joining of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) in affected infants\n* An opening or unusually high arch in the roof of the mouth (cleft or high-arched palate)\n* A split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth (bifid uvula)\n* Missing teeth (oligodontia)\n\n**Medical Complications**\n\nMalformations of the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, or bones can also occur in people with Au-Kline syndrome. These may include:\n\n* Aortic dilatation, which can be life-threatening\n* Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)\n* Difficulty feeding\n* Poor vision\n\nAu-Kline syndrome can sometimes affect the autonomic nervous system, leading to digestive problems, difficulty feeling pain, abnormal sweating, and an inability to adjust to high heat.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is a rare condition, and its exact frequency is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Au-Kline Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is caused by mutations in the HNRNPK gene. The protein produced from this gene, called heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), plays a crucial role in the normal development and function of several body systems, including the brain.\n\nHNRNPK gene mutations result in the production of little or no hnRNP K protein. This shortage alters gene activity and protein production, disrupting the normal development or functioning of several body systems, resulting in the varied features of Au-Kline syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new (de novo) mutations that occur during reproductive cell formation or early embryonic development.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is a rare condition with an unknown prevalence. At least 25 cases have been diagnosed.\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\nIndividuals with Au-Kline syndrome typically have weak muscle tone, intellectual disability, and delayed development. Speech is delayed in children, and some are unable to speak. They may also have distinctive facial features, including long palpebral fissures, ptosis, and shallow eye sockets.\n\nMalformations of the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, or bones can occur, including aortic dilatation, scoliosis, difficulty feeding, and poor vision. The autonomic nervous system may be affected, leading to digestive problems, difficulty feeling pain, abnormal sweating, and an inability to adjust to high heat.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Au-Kline syndrome:\n\n* Gene: HNRNPK\n* Function: Regulates gene activity and protein production in several body systems, including the brain.\n\n---\n\n**Au-Kline Syndrome**\n\n**What is Au-Kline syndrome?**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features.\n\n**Causes of Au-Kline syndrome**\n\nThis condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the HNRNPK gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nAu-Kline syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other names for this condition**\n\n* Okamoto syndrome\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: Au-Kline syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Okamoto syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: AU-KLINE SYNDROME; AUKS\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Au PYB, Goedhart C, Ferguson M, Breckpot J, Devriendt K, Wierenga K, Fanning E, Grange DK, Graham GE, Galarreta C, Jones MC, Kini U, Stewart H, Parboosingh JS, Kline AD, Innes AM; Care for Rare Canada Consortium.

    "content": "**Audiometry**\n\n\\n\\nAn audiometry exam tests your ability to hear sounds. Sounds vary, based on their loudness (intensity) and the speed of sound wave vibrations (tone).\n\nHearing occurs when sound waves stimulate the nerves of the inner ear. The sound then travels along nerve pathways to the brain.\n\nSound waves can travel to the inner ear through the ear canal, eardrum, and bones of the middle ear (air conduction). They can also pass through the bones around and behind the ear (bone conduction).\n\n**Intensity of Sound**\n\nThe INTENSITY of sound is measured in decibels (dB):\n\n* A whisper is about 20 dB.\n* Loud music (some concerts) is around 80 to 120 dB.\n* A jet engine is about 140 to 180 dB.\n\nSounds greater than 85 dB can cause hearing loss after a few hours. Louder sounds can cause immediate pain, and hearing loss can develop in a very short time.\n\n**Tone of Sound**\n\nThe TONE of sound is measured in cycles per second (cps) or Hertz (Hz):\n\n* Low bass tones range around 50 to 60 Hz.\n* Shrill, high-pitched tones range around 10,000 Hz or higher.\n\nThe normal range of human hearing is about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear up to 50,000 Hz. Human speech is usually 500 to 3,000 Hz.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may test your hearing with simple tests that can be done in the office. These may include completing a questionnaire and listening to whispered voices, tuning forks, or tones from an ear examination scope.\n\nA specialized tuning fork test can help determine the type of hearing loss. The tuning fork is tapped and held in the air on each side of the head to test the ability to hear by air conduction. It is tapped and placed against the bone behind each ear (mastoid bone) to test bone conduction.\n\n**Formal Hearing Testing**\n\nA formal hearing testing can give a more exact measure of hearing. Several tests may be done:\n\n* Pure tone testing (audiogram)\n* Speech audiometry\n* Immittance audiometry\n* Tympanometry\n\n---\n\n**Audiometry**\n\nAn audiometry exam tests your ability to hear sounds. Sounds vary, based on their loudness (intensity) and the speed of sound wave vibrations (tone).\n\n*   **Intensity**: Measured in decibels (dB)\n    *   A whisper is about 20 dB\n    *   Loud music (some concerts) is around 80 to 120 dB\n    *   A jet engine is about 140 to 180 dB\n    *   Sounds greater than 85 dB can cause hearing loss after a few hours\n*   **Tone**: Measured in cycles per second (cps) or Hertz (Hz)\n    *   Low bass tones range around 50 to 60 Hz\n    *   Shrill, high-pitched tones range around 10,000 Hz or higher\n    *   The normal range of human hearing is about 20 to 20,000 Hz\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may test your hearing with simple tests that can be done in the office. These may include completing a questionnaire and listening to whispered voices, tuning forks, or tones from an ear examination scope.\n\nA specialized tuning fork test can help determine the type of hearing loss. The tuning fork is tapped and held in the air on each side of the head to test the ability to hear by air conduction. It is tapped and placed against the bone behind each ear (mastoid bone) to test bone conduction.\n\nA formal hearing testing can give a more exact measure of hearing. Several tests may be done:\n\n*   **Pure tone testing (audiogram)**: You wear earphones attached to the audiometer, and pure tones of a specific frequency and volume are delivered to one ear at a time.\n*   **Speech audiometry**: This tests your ability to detect and repeat spoken words at different volumes heard through a head set.\n*   **Immittance audiometry**: This test measures the function of the ear drum and the flow of sound through the middle ear. A probe is inserted into the ear and air is pumped through it to change the pressure within the ear as tones are produced. A microphone monitors how well sound is conducted within the ear under different pressures.\n*   **Tympanometry**: A measure of the vibration of the ear drum and middle ear pressure.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special steps are needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is no discomfort. The length of time varies. An initial screening may take about 5 to 10 minutes. Detailed audiometry may take about 1 hour.\n\n---\n\n**Audiometry: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/4)**\n\n**What is Audiometry?**\n\nAudiometry is a test used to assess your hearing ability. It can be done in an office setting and may include simple tests such as completing a questionnaire, listening to whispered voices, tuning forks, or tones from an ear examination scope.\n\n**Types of Tests**\n\nThere are several types of audiometry tests:\n\n*   **Pure Tone Testing (Audiogram)**: This test measures your ability to hear different frequencies of sound. You will wear earphones and be asked to signal when you can hear a tone.\n*   **Speech Audiometry**: This test assesses your ability to detect and repeat spoken words at different volumes.\n*   **Immittance Audiometry**: This test measures the function of the eardrum and the flow of sound through the middle ear. A probe is inserted into the ear and air is pumped through it to change the pressure within the ear as tones are produced.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nThere are no special steps needed to prepare for an audiometry test.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe length of time for the test varies, but an initial screening may take about 5 to 10 minutes. Detailed audiometry may take about 1 hour. There is no discomfort during the test.\n\n**Why is Audiometry Performed?**\n\nThis test can detect hearing loss at an early stage and may also be used when you have hearing problems from any cause.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal results include:\n\n*   The ability to hear a whisper, normal speech, and a ticking watch\n*   The ability to hear a tuning fork through air and bone\n*   In detailed audiometry, hearing is normal if you can hear tones from 250 to 8,000 Hz at 25 dB or lower\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nThere are many kinds and degrees of hearing loss. Abnormal results may indicate some type of hearing loss, which may give clues to the cause and chances of recovering your hearing.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is no risk associated with an audiometry test.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nOther tests may be used to determine how well the inner ear and brain pathways are working. One of these is otoacoustic emission testing (OAE) that detects sounds given off by the inner ear when responding to sound. This test is often done as part of a newborn screening. A head MRI may be done to help diagnose hearing loss due to an acoustic neuroma.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAudiometry; Hearing test; Audiography (audiogram)\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Ear anatomy\n\n**References**\n\nAmundsen GA.
