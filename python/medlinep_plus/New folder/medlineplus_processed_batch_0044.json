OTC cold medicines may help relieve symptoms of a cold.\n\nThis article is about OTC cold medicines for children. These cold remedies should be used with caution.

For infants, the same medicine may be available in a more concentrated form (drops).\n\n**Use OTC Cold Medicines With Care**\n\nOTC cold medicines may cause serious side effects, including:\n\n* Seizures\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Reduced consciousness\n* Reye syndrome (from aspirin)\n* Death\n\nCertain medicines should not be given to children, or only after a certain age.\n\nDo not give cold medicines to children younger than 4 years old.\nOnly give cold medicines to children ages 4 to 6 years if your health care provider recommends it.\nDo not give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months unless directed by your provider.\nDo not give aspirin to children and teens unless directed by your provider.\n\nTaking too many different medicines also may cause harm. Many OTC cold remedies contain more than one active ingredient.\n\nAvoid giving more than one OTC cold medicine to your child. It may cause an overdose with severe side effects.\nReplacing one cold medicine with another may be ineffective or cause an overdose.\n\nFollow the dosage instructions strictly while giving an OTC medicine to your child.\n\nWhen giving OTC cold medicines to your child:\n\n* Ask yourself if your child really needs it - a cold will go away on its own without treatment.\n* Read the label. Check the active ingredients and strength.\n* Stick to the right dose -- less could be ineffective, more could be unsafe.\n* Follow instructions. Be sure you know how to give the medicine and how often to give it.\n* Use the syringe or measuring cup provided with the liquid medicines. Do not use a household spoon.\n* If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your pharmacist or provider.\nNever give OTC medicines to children less than 2 years old unless your provider recommends it.\n\nYou can also try some home care tips to help relieve cold symptoms in infants and younger children.\n\nStore medicines in a cool, dry area.

While both are respiratory illnesses, they have distinct symptoms and causes.\n\n*   A cold is a mild illness caused by viruses, such as rhinovirus or coronavirus. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, coughing, and sore throat.\n*   The flu, on the other hand, is a more severe illness caused by the influenza virus. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, and fatigue.\n\n**What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen you're dealing with a cold or the flu, it's crucial to ask your doctor the right questions to ensure you receive proper treatment. Here are some essential questions to ask:\n\n*   What is the cause of my illness?\n*   How can I manage my symptoms?\n*   Are there any medications or treatments that can help alleviate my symptoms?\n*   How long will it take for me to recover?\n*   Are there any preventive measures I can take to avoid getting a cold or the flu in the future?\n\n**Taking Care of Yourself**\n\nIn addition to asking your doctor the right questions, there are several things you can do to take care of yourself when you have a cold or the flu.\n\n*   Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or soup.\n*   Get plenty of rest to help your body fight off the illness.\n*   Use over-the-counter medications, such as pain relievers or decongestants, to alleviate symptoms.\n*   Practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others.\n\nBy understanding the difference between a cold and the flu and asking your doctor the right questions, you can take better care of yourself and recover more quickly. So next time you're feeling under the weather, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor and ask for guidance!",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699050.html",
    "content": "**Colesevelam: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nColesevelam is used in adults along with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in the blood alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Colesevelam is also used alone or in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in certain boys and in girls, ages 10 to 17, with familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally) to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood. Colesevelam is also used along with diet and exercise to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Colesevelam is in a class of medications called bile acid sequestrants. It works by binding bile acids in your intestines to form a product that is removed from the body.\n\nBile acids are made when cholesterol is broken down in your body. Removing these bile acids helps to lower your blood cholesterol. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nColesevelam comes as a tablet, in a chewable bar, and as a powder to be mixed with a liquid to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken once or twice a day with meals and a beverage. The chewable bars and the powder are usually taken once a day with a meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take colesevelam exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking the powder for oral suspension, empty the entire contents of 1 packet into a glass. Add 8 ounces of water, fruit juice, or a diet soft drink. Stir well and drink the entire contents of the glass. It is normal for the contents to appear cloudy and not fully dissolve. Do not take the powder in its dry form.\n\nIf you are taking the chewable bars, you should know that the chewable bars contain 80 calories per bar.\n\nColesevelam controls your condition but does not cure it. Continue to take colesevelam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking colesevelam without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Colesevelam: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Tablets**: Take once or twice a day with meals and a beverage.

Your doctor may change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   The following nonprescription products may interact with colesevelam: vitamins A, D, E, and K supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking colesevelam. Do not start any of these medications while taking colesevelam without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n*   If you are taking cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepride (Amaryl), glyburide (Diabeta), levothyroxine (Synthroid), olmesartan (Benicar), oral contraceptives (birth control pills), phenytoin (Dilantin), or vitamins, take them at least 4 hours before colesevelam.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a blockage in your stomach or intestines, high levels of triglycerides (fatty substance) in the blood, or swelling of the pancreas caused by high levels of triglycerides in the blood. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take colesevelam.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have had gastrointestinal surgery, and if you have or have ever had any problem with the ability to digest or absorb nutrients from food, any type of stomach problem such as slow stomach emptying, or difficulty swallowing.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking colesevelam, call your doctor.\n*   If you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that the powder for oral suspension contains aspartame that forms phenylalanine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nEat a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000753.htm",
    "content": "**Colic and Crying - Self-Care**\n\nIf your baby cries for longer than 3 hours a day, they might have colic. Colic is not caused by another medical problem. Many babies go through a fussy period. Some cry more than others.\n\nYou're not alone if you have a baby with colic. One in five babies cry enough that people call them colicky. Colic usually starts when babies are about 3 weeks old. It gets worse when they are between 4 and 6 weeks old. Most of the time, colicky babies get better after they are 6 weeks old, and are completely fine by the time they are 12 weeks old.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nColic normally begins at about the same time every day. Babies with colic are usually fussier in the evenings.\n\n* Colic symptoms often begin suddenly.\n* Your baby's hands may be in a fist.\n* The legs may curl up and the belly may seem swollen.\n* Crying may last for minutes to hours.\n* Crying often calms down when your baby is tired or when gas or stool is passed.\n\nEven though colicky babies look like they have belly pain, they eat well and gain weight normally.\n\n**Possible Causes of Colic**\n\nCauses of colic may include any of the following:\n\n* Pain from gas\n* Hunger\n* Overfeeding\n* Baby cannot tolerate certain foods or certain proteins in breast milk or formula\n* Sensitivity to certain stimuli\n* Emotions such as fear, frustration, or even excitement\n\nPeople around your baby may also seem worried, anxious, or depressed.\n\nOften the exact cause of colic is unknown.\n\n**Seeing Your Baby's Health Care Provider**\n\nYour baby's health care provider can often diagnose colic by asking you about the baby's medical history, symptoms, and how long the crying lasts. Your baby's provider will perform a physical exam and may do some tests to check your baby.\n\nYour baby's provider needs to make sure your baby does not have other medical problems, such as reflux, a hernia, or intussusception.\n\n**Avoiding Your Baby's Triggers**\n\nFoods that are passed through your breast milk to your baby may trigger colic. If your baby is colicky and you are breastfeeding, avoid eating or drinking the following foods for a few weeks to see if that helps:\n\n* Stimulants, such as caffeine and chocolate.\n* Dairy products and nuts. Your baby may have allergies to these foods.\n\nSome breastfeeding moms avoid eating broccoli, cabbage, beans, and other gas-producing foods. But research has not shown that these foods can have a negative effect on your baby.\n\nOther possible triggers include:\n\n* Medicines passed through breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, talk to your own provider about the medicines you take.\n* Baby formula. Some babies are sensitive to proteins in formula. Talk to your baby's provider about switching formulas to see if that helps.\n* Overfeeding or feeding your baby too quickly. Bottle feeding your baby should take about 20 minutes. If your baby is eating faster, use a nipple with a smaller hole.\n\nTalk to a lactation consultant to learn more about the possible causes related to breastfeeding.\n\n**Comforting Your Baby**\n\nWhat comforts one baby may not calm another. And what calms your baby during one episode may not work for the next. But try different techniques and revisit what seems to help, even if it only helps a little.\n\nIf you breastfeed:\n\n* Allow your baby to finish nursing on the first breast before offering the second. The milk at the end of emptying each breast, called the hind milk, is far richer and sometimes more soothing.\n* If your baby still seems uncomfortable or is eating too much, offer only one breast as often as you want, over a 2 to 3 hour period. This will give your baby more hind milk.\n\nSometimes it can be really hard to stop your baby from crying. Here are techniques you may want to try:\n\n* Swaddle your baby. Wrap your baby snugly in a blanket.\n* Hold your baby. Holding your baby more may help them be less fussy in the evening. This will not spoil your baby. Try an infant carrier that you wear on your body to hold your baby close.\n* Gently rock your baby. Rocking calms your baby and can help your baby pass gas. When babies cry, they swallow air. They get more gas and more stomach pain, which causes them to cry more. Babies get in a cycle that is hard to break. Try an infant swing if your baby is at least 3 weeks old and can hold their head up.\n* Sing to your baby.\n* Hold your baby in an upright position. This helps your baby pass gas and reduces heartburn.\n* Try placing a warm towel or warm water bottle on your baby's stomach.\n* Lay babies on their stomach when they are awake and give them back rubs. Do not let babies sleep on their stomachs. Babies who sleep on their stomachs have a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n* Give your baby a pacifier to suck on.\n* Put your baby in a stroller and go for a walk.\n* Put your baby in a car seat and go for a drive. If this works, look for a device that makes a car motion and sound.\n* Put your baby in a crib and turn on something with white noise. You can use a white noise machine, a fan, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, or dishwasher.\n\n**Colic Always Goes Away**\n\nYour baby will most likely outgrow colic by 3 to 4 months of age. There are usually no complications from colic.\n\nParents can get really stressed when a baby cries a lot. Know when you have reached your limit and ask family members or friends to help. If you feel like you may shake or hurt your baby, get help right away.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your baby's provider if your baby is:\n\n* Crying a lot and you are unable to calm your baby\n* 3 months old and still has colic\n\nYou need to make sure that your baby does not have any serious medical problems.\n\nCall your baby's provider right away if:\n\n* Your baby's behavior or crying pattern changes suddenly\n* Your baby has a fever, forceful vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or other stomach problems\n\nGet help right away for yourself if you feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming your baby.\n\n---\n\n**Colic and Crying - Self-Care**\n\nIf your baby cries for longer than 3 hours a day, they might have colic. Colic is not caused by another medical problem. Many babies go through a fussy period. Some cry more than others.\n\n*   **Prevalence**: One in five babies cry enough that people call them colicky.\n*   **Age of onset**: Colic usually starts when babies are about 3 weeks old.\n*   **Worst age**: It gets worse when they are between 4 and 6 weeks old.\n*   **Resolution**: Most of the time, colicky babies get better after they are 6 weeks old, and are completely fine by the time they are 12 weeks old.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nColic normally begins at about the same time every day. Babies with colic are usually fussier in the evenings.\n\n*   **Sudden onset**: Colic symptoms often begin suddenly.\n*   **Physical signs**: Your baby's hands may be in a fist, the legs may curl up, and the belly may seem swollen.\n*   **Crying pattern**: Crying may last for minutes to hours. Crying often calms down when your baby is tired or when gas or stool is passed.\n\n**Possible Causes of Colic**\n\nCauses of colic may include any of the following:\n\n*   Pain from gas\n*   Hunger\n*   Overfeeding\n*   Baby cannot tolerate certain foods or certain proteins in breast milk or formula\n*   Sensitivity to certain stimuli\n*   Emotions such as fear, frustration, or even excitement\n\n**Seeing Your Baby's Health Care Provider**\n\nYour baby's health care provider can often diagnose colic by asking you about the baby's medical history, symptoms, and how long the crying lasts. Your baby's provider will perform a physical exam and may do some tests to check your baby.\n\n*   **Diagnosis**: Your baby's provider needs to make sure your baby does not have other medical problems, such as reflux, a hernia, or intussusception.\n\n**Avoiding Your Baby's Triggers**\n\nFoods that are passed through your breast milk to your baby may trigger colic. If your baby is colicky and you are breastfeeding, avoid eating or drinking the following foods for a few weeks to see if that helps.\n\n*   **Stimulants**: Stimulants, such as caffeine and chocolate.\n*   **Dairy products and nuts**: Dairy products and nuts. Your baby may have allergies to these foods.\n\n**Comforting Your Baby**\n\nWhat comforts one baby may not calm another. And what calms your baby during one episode may not work for the next. But try different techniques and revisit what seems to help, even if it only helps a little.\n\n*   **Breastfeeding**: Allow your baby to finish nursing on the first breast before offering the second. The milk at the end of emptying each breast, called the hind milk, is far richer and sometimes more soothing.\n*   **Swaddling**: Swaddle your baby. Wrap your baby snugly in a blanket.\n*   **Holding**: Hold your baby. Holding your baby more may help them be less fussy in the evening.\n*   **Rocking**: Gently rock your baby. Rocking calms your baby and can help your baby pass gas.\n\n**Colic Always Goes Away**\n\nYour baby will most likely outgrow colic by 3 to 4 months of age. There are usually no complications from colic.\n\n*   **Resolution**: Your baby will get better with time.\n*   **Complications**: There are usually no complications from colic.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your baby's provider if your baby is:\n\n*   Crying a lot and you are unable to calm your baby\n*   3 months old and still has colic\n\nYou need to make sure that your baby does not have any serious medical problems.\n\n*   **Serious medical problems**: Your baby may have other underlying medical conditions that need to be addressed.\n\n---\n\n**Colic and Crying - Self-Care**\n\n**What is Colic?**\n\nColic is a condition that affects some babies, causing them to cry persistently for no apparent reason. The exact cause of colic is often unknown, but it may be related to factors such as pain from gas, hunger, overfeeding, or sensitivity to certain stimuli.\n\n**Symptoms of Colic**\n\nBabies with colic typically exhibit the following symptoms:\n\n* Crying that lasts for minutes to hours\n* Hands in a fist\n* Legs curled up\n* Belly seems swollen\n* Crying often calms down when the baby is tired or when gas or stool is passed\n\nEven though colicky babies may look like they have belly pain, they usually eat well and gain weight normally.\n\n**Possible Causes of Colic**\n\nCauses of colic may include:\n\n* Pain from gas\n* Hunger\n* Overfeeding\n* Baby cannot tolerate certain foods or proteins in breast milk or formula\n* Sensitivity to certain stimuli\n* Emotions such as fear, frustration, or excitement\n\nPeople around the baby may also seem worried, anxious, or depressed.\n\n**Seeing Your Baby's Health Care Provider**\n\nYour baby's health care provider can often diagnose colic by asking about the baby's medical history, symptoms, and how long the crying lasts. A physical exam and some tests may be performed to check for other medical problems, such as reflux, a hernia, or intussusception.\n\n**Avoiding Your Baby's Triggers**\n\nFoods that are passed through breast milk to the baby may trigger colic. If your baby is colicky and you are breastfeeding, avoid eating or drinking the following foods for a few weeks to see if it helps:\n\n* Stimulants such as caffeine and chocolate\n* Dairy products and nuts (your baby may have allergies to these foods)\n* Broccoli, cabbage, beans, and other gas-producing foods\n\nOther possible triggers include:\n\n* Medicines passed through breast milk\n* Baby formula (some babies are sensitive to proteins in formula)\n* Overfeeding or feeding the baby too quickly\n\nTalk to a lactation consultant to learn more about the possible causes related to breastfeeding.\n\n**Comforting Your Baby**\n\nWhat comforts one baby may not calm another, and what calms your baby during one episode may not work for the next. But try different techniques and revisit what seems to help, even if it only helps a little.\n\nIf you breastfeed:\n\n* Allow your baby to finish nursing on the first breast before offering the second\n* Offer only one breast as often as you want, over a 2 to 3 hour period, to give your baby more hind milk\n\nSometimes it can be really hard to stop your baby from crying. Here are techniques you may want to try:\n\n---\n\n**Colic and Crying - Self-Care**\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nSometimes it can be really hard to stop your baby from crying. Here are techniques you may want to try:\n\n*   **Swaddle your baby**: Wrap your baby snugly in a blanket.\n*   **Hold your baby**: Holding your baby more may help them be less fussy in the evening. This will not spoil your baby. Try an infant carrier that you wear on your body to hold your baby close.\n*   **Gently rock your baby**: Rocking calms your baby and can help your baby pass gas. When babies cry, they swallow air. They get more gas and more stomach pain, which causes them to cry more. Babies get in a cycle that is hard to break. Try an infant swing if your baby is at least 3 weeks old and can hold their head up.\n*   **Sing to your baby**: Singing can be soothing for babies.\n*   **Hold your baby in an upright position**: This helps your baby pass gas and reduces heartburn.\n*   **Try placing a warm towel or warm water bottle on your baby's stomach**: This can help ease discomfort.\n*   **Lay babies on their stomach when they are awake and give them back rubs**: Do not let babies sleep on their stomachs. Babies who sleep on their stomachs have a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n*   **Give your baby a pacifier to suck on**: Sucking can help calm babies.\n*   **Put your baby in a stroller and go for a walk**: A change of scenery may help soothe your baby.\n*   **Put your baby in a car seat and go for a drive**: If this works, look for a device that makes a car motion and sound.\n*   **Put your baby in a crib and turn on something with white noise**: You can use a white noise machine, a fan, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, or dishwasher.\n\n**Comforting Your Baby**\n\nWhat comforts one baby may not calm another.

The exact cause of colic is unknown, but it's thought to be related to gas in the intestines.\n\n**Understanding colic**\n\nAccording to Maheshwari and Gupta, \"colic and gastrointestinal gas\" are related conditions that can cause discomfort and pain in newborn babies (Wylie et al., 2021). Onigbanjo and Feigelman note that crying is a normal part of a baby's development, but excessive crying can be a sign of colic (Kliegman et al., 2020).\n\n**Self-care for colic**\n\nIf your baby has colic, there are some self-care strategies you can try to help soothe them. These include:\n\n*   **The \"5 S's\"**: The \"5 S's\" are a method of soothing that involves:\n    *   **Swaddling**: Wrapping your baby snugly in a blanket to help them feel secure.\n    *   **Shushing**: Making a soft, constant noise to mimic the sound of the womb.\n    *   **Side/stomach position**: Holding your baby on their side or stomach, as this can help them feel more comfortable.\n    *   **Swinging**: Gently rocking your baby back and forth.\n    *   **Sucking**: Allowing your baby to suck on a pacifier or their own finger.",

Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Diarrhea**: Frequent, loose stools\n*   **Abdominal Pain**: Cramping or discomfort in the abdomen\n*   **Weight Loss**: Unintended weight loss due to malabsorption of nutrients\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or exhausted\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for colitis, various treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications:\n\n*   **Medications**: A range of medications, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators, may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system.\n*   **Dietary Changes**: Making dietary changes, such as avoiding trigger foods or following a specific diet, can help alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases of colitis, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue or repair any resulting complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with colitis varies depending on the severity and type of the condition. With proper treatment and management, many people with mild to moderate colitis can experience significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life. However, those with severe or unresponsive disease may face a poorer outlook.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   **Colonic Diseases**\n*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease**\n*   **Gastrointestinal Disorders**\n\n\\n\\n",

Collagen is one of the materials that makes up cartilage, bone, and skin.\n\nCollagen peptides are made by breaking down whole collagen proteins into smaller pieces. When taken by mouth, collagen peptides seem to build up in the skin and cartilage. This might help improve some skin and joint conditions.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for COLLAGEN PEPTIDES are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Aging skin: Taking collagen peptides by mouth seems to improve skin hydration and skin elasticity in older people.\n\t+ Dry skin: Taking collagen peptides by mouth seems to improve skin hydration and skin elasticity in people with dry skin.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Muscle strength: Taking collagen peptides by mouth does not seem to improve leg muscle strength. However, collagen peptides may improve hand-grip strength.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Collagen peptides are possibly safe. Collagen peptides have been safely used in doses up to 10 grams daily for up to 6 months. Side effects are rare.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if collagen peptides are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nIt is not known if this product interacts with any medicines.\n\nBefore taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nCollagen peptides have most often been used by adults in doses of 2.5-10 grams daily for up to 6 months.

    "content": "**Collagen Vascular Disease**\n\nIn a class of diseases known as autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Some of these diseases are similar to each other. They may involve arthritis and inflammation of arteries in the tissues. People who developed these disorders were previously said to have \"connective tissue\" or \"collagen vascular\" disease. We now have names for many specific conditions such as:\n\n* Ankylosing spondylitis\n* Dermatomyositis\n* Polyarteritis nodosa\n* Polymyositis\n* Psoriatic arthritis\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Scleroderma\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Mixed connective tissue disease\n* Relapsing polychondritis\n* Vasculitis\n\nWhen a specific disease cannot be diagnosed, more general terms may be used. These are called undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases or overlap syndromes.\n\n**References**\n\nGraf J. Overlap syndromes.

    "content": "**Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCollagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection (Xiaflex) is used to treat Dupuytren's contracture (a painless thickening and tightening of tissue [cord] beneath the skin in the palm of the hand, which may make it difficult to straighten one or more fingers) when a cord of tissue can be felt upon examination. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection (Xiaflex) is also used to treat Peyronie's disease (a thickening of tissue [plaque] inside the penis that causes the penis to curve). Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection (QWO) is also used to treat cellulite (fat deposit beneath the skin) in the buttocks of adult women.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nFor men receiving collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection (Xiaflex) for treatment of Peyronie's disease:\n\n*   Serious injury to the penis, including penile fracture (corporal rupture), has been reported in patients receiving Clostridium histolyticum injection (Xiaflex) for treatment of Peyronie's disease.\n*   Surgery may be required to treat the injury, but in some cases the damage may be permanent.\n*   If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n    *   A popping sound or sensation in an erect penis\n    *   Sudden inability to maintain an erection\n    *   Pain in the penis\n    *   Bruising, bleeding, or swelling of the penis\n    *   Difficult urination\n    *   Blood in the urine\n\n\\n\\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of receiving collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection (Xiaflex).\n\n---\n\n**Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection**\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected by a doctor.\n*   For Dupuytren's contracture, the medicine is injected into a cord just under the skin in the affected hand.\n*   For Peyronie's disease, the medicine is injected into the plaque causing the penis to curve.\n*   For cellulite, the medicine is injected subcutaneously into the buttock(s).\n\n**Treatment Instructions**\n\n### Dupuytren's Contracture\n\n*   Do not bend or straighten the fingers of the injected hand after injection.\n*   Keep the injected hand elevated until bedtime.\n*   Return to your doctor's office on the day after injection for follow-up.\n*   Your doctor may need to give additional injections if condition does not improve.\n*   Avoid strenuous activity with the injected hand until told by your doctor.\n\n### Peyronie's Disease\n\n*   Inject collagenase Clostridium histolyticum into the penis, followed by a second injection 1-3 days later.\n*   Return to your doctor's office 1-3 days after the second injection for follow-up.\n*   Your doctor will perform a penile modeling procedure to help straighten the penis.\n*   Gently stretch and straighten the penis at home for 6 weeks afterward.\n*   Avoid sexual activity between injections until told by your doctor.\n\n### Cellulite\n\n*   Inject collagenase Clostridium histolyticum into each buttock with up to 12 injections per treatment area.\n*   Repeat treatments every 21 days for a total of 3 visits.\n*   Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection**\n\n**Treatment for Cellulite, Dupuytren's Contracture, and Peyronie's Disease**\n\nThis medication is used to treat cellulite, Dupuytren's contracture, and Peyronie's disease. It works by breaking down the collagen that causes these conditions.\n\n**How to Use Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection**\n\n* For cellulite: Your doctor will inject collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (QWO) into each buttock (treatment area) with up to 12 injections in each treatment area. You may receive injections into two treatment areas during each visit.\n* For Dupuytren's contracture: Your doctor will inject the medicine into a cord just under the skin in the affected hand.\n* For Peyronie's disease: Your doctor will inject the medicine into the plaque that is causing your penis to curve.\n\n**What to Expect During Treatment**\n\n* For cellulite: You may receive injections into two treatment areas during each visit. Your doctor will repeat treatments every 21 days for a total of 3 visits.\n* For Dupuytren's contracture: Do not bend or straighten the fingers of the injected hand or put pressure on the injected area after your injection. Keep the injected hand elevated until bedtime.\n* For Peyronie's disease: You must return to your doctor's office 1 to 3 days after your second injection. Your doctor will gently move and stretch your penis (penile modeling procedure) to help straighten your penis.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n* Before receiving collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection, collagenase ointment (Santyl), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n* Tell your doctor if you have an infection in the affected area. Your doctor will probably tell you not to receive collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection for the treatment of cellulitis.\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a bleeding condition that makes it difficult for you to form clots, including receiving anticoagulant medications (e.g., aspirin more than 150 mg a day, warfarin, enoxaparin, etc.) 7 days prior to receiving collagenase injection. Also, tell your doctor if you have previously received collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection to treat another condition.\n* You should know that collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting. This is more common if you have pain immediately after you receive your injection or within 1 to 2 days after the injection. If you feel dizzy or faint after you receive collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection, you should lie down until your symptoms go away.\n* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.\n\n---\n\n**Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**After Treatment Instructions**\n\nAfter receiving collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection, lie down until your symptoms go away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Information**\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

    "content": "**Collateral Ligament (CL) Injury - Aftercare**\n\nA collateral ligament injury occurs when the ligaments are stretched or torn. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) runs on the outer side of your knee, while the medial collateral ligament (MCL) runs along the inner side.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nThe collateral ligaments help keep your knee stable by keeping your leg bones in place and preventing excessive sideways movement. A collateral ligament injury can occur from a direct blow to the inside or outside of the knee or from a twisting injury.\n\nSkiers and individuals who participate in basketball, football, or soccer are more likely to experience this type of injury.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nWith a collateral ligament injury, you may notice:\n\n*   A loud pop when the injury occurs\n*   Knee instability, causing it to shift side to side\n*   Locking or catching of the knee with movement\n*   Swelling in the knee area\n*   Pain along the inside or outside of the knee\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nAfter examining your knee, your healthcare provider may order imaging tests such as X-rays to check for damage to the bones in your knee or an MRI to visualize the tissues inside your knee.\n\nTreatment options may include:\n\n*   Crutches to aid mobility until swelling and pain subside\n*   A brace to provide support and stability to the knee\n*   Physical therapy to improve joint motion and leg strength\n*   Surgery to repair the collateral ligament or associated injuries\n\nMost individuals do not require surgery for an MCL injury; however, surgical intervention may be necessary if the LCL is injured or if the injuries are severe and involve other ligaments in the knee.\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nTo reduce pain and swelling, follow the R.I.C.E. method:\n\n1.  **Rest**: Avoid putting weight on the affected leg.\n2.  **Ice**: Apply ice to the knee for 20 minutes at a time, three to four times a day. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth before applying it directly to the skin.\n3.  **Compression**: Use an elastic bandage or compression wrap to compress the area.\n4.  **Elevation**: Elevate the leg above the level of your heart.\n\nYou can use over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain but not swelling. Consult with your provider before using these medications if you have certain medical conditions.\n\n**Activity**\n\nAvoid putting all your weight on the affected leg if it hurts. Consult with your provider about how much weight you can put on the leg. Rest and self-care may be sufficient for the tear to heal, and crutches can help protect the injured ligament.\n\nYou may need to work with a physical therapist (PT) to regain knee and leg strength. The PT will teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles, ligaments, and tendons around your knee.\n\nAs your knee heals, you can return to normal activities and, for most people, eventually play sports again.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You experience increased swelling or pain\n*   Self-care does not seem to help\n*   You lose feeling in your foot\n*   Your foot or leg feels cold or changes color\n\nIf you have surgery, contact your surgeon if you have a fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher, drainage from the incisions, bleeding that won't stop, or other concerning symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Collateral Ligament Injury - Aftercare**\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nFollow R.I.C.E. to help reduce pain and swelling:\n\n*   Rest your leg. Avoid putting weight on it.\n*   Ice your knee for 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first.\n*   Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap.\n*   Elevate your leg by raising it above the level of your heart.\n\nYou can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYou should not put all of your weight on your leg if it hurts. You should check with your provider about how much weight you may put on your leg. Rest and self-care may be enough to allow the tear to heal. You should use crutches to protect the injured ligament.\n\nYou may need to work with a physical therapist (PT) to regain knee and leg strength. The PT will teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles, ligaments, and tendons around your knee.\n\nAs your knee heals, you can return to normal activities and, for most people, eventually play sports again.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have increased swelling or pain\n*   Self-care does not seem to help\n*   You lose feeling in your foot\n*   Your foot or leg feels cold or changes color\n\nIf you have surgery, contact your surgeon if you have:\n\n*   A fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher\n*   Drainage from the incisions\n*   Bleeding that won't stop\n\n---\n\n**Collateral Ligament (CL) Injury - Aftercare**\n\n**What to Expect as You Recover**\n\n*   Pain and swelling will decrease\n*   A brace to support and stabilize your knee\n*   Physical therapy to help improve joint motion and leg strength\n*   Surgery to repair the collateral ligament or other associated injuries\n\n**Most People Do Not Need Surgery for an MCL Injury**\n\nHowever, you may need surgery if your LCL is injured or if your injuries are severe and involve other ligaments in your knee.\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nFollow R.I.C.E. to help reduce pain and swelling:\n\n*   Rest your leg. Avoid putting weight on it.\n*   Ice your knee for 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first.\n*   Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap.\n*   Elevate your leg by raising it above the level of your heart.\n\nYou can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYou should not put all of your weight on your leg if it hurts.

The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) are the two types of CL injuries that can occur in the knee.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Collateral Ligament Injuries**\n\nThe symptoms of a CL injury may include:\n\n*   Pain, especially when the joint is moved\n*   Swelling or bruising around the joint\n*   Limited mobility or stiffness in the affected joint\n*   Instability or feeling of the joint giving way\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Collateral Ligament Injuries**\n\nTo diagnose a CL injury, your doctor may perform the following:\n\n*   Physical examination to assess joint stability and range of motion\n*   Imaging tests such as X-rays or an MRI to evaluate the extent of ligament damage\n*   Arthroscopy to visually inspect the joint for any tears or other damage\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treating Collateral Ligament Injuries**\n\nTreatment for a CL injury typically involves:\n\n*   Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) to reduce pain and swelling\n*   Physical therapy to improve range of motion and strengthen surrounding muscles\n*   Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage pain and inflammation\n*   In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or reconstruct the damaged ligament\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Collateral Ligament Injuries**\n\nTo prevent CL injuries, it's essential to:\n\n*   Warm up before engaging in physical activities\n*   Use proper technique when participating in sports or exercises\n*   Strengthen surrounding muscles through regular exercise and stretching\n*   Avoid overexertion or repetitive strain on the joint\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Collateral Ligament Injuries in Sports**\n\nCL injuries are common in contact sports such as football, hockey, and soccer. They can also occur in non-contact sports like basketball and tennis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCollateral ligament injuries can be painful and debilitating, but with proper treatment and prevention strategies, individuals can recover and return to their normal activities. If you suspect a CL injury, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly to prevent further damage and ensure optimal recovery.",

    "content": "**College Students and the Flu**\n\nEvery year, the flu spreads across college campuses nationwide. Close living quarters, shared restrooms, and a lot of social activities make a college student more likely to catch the flu.\n\nThis article will give you information about the flu and college students. This is not a substitute for medical advice from your health care provider.\n\n**What are the Symptoms of the Flu?**\n\nA college student with the flu will most often have a fever of 100°F (37.8°C) or higher, and a sore throat or a cough. Other symptoms may include:\n\n* Chills\n* Diarrhea\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Runny nose\n* Sore muscles\n* Vomiting\n\nMost people with milder symptoms should feel better within 3 to 4 days and do not need to see a provider.\n\n**How Do I Treat My Symptoms?**\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever. Check with your provider before taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you have liver disease.\n\n* Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours or as directed.\n* Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours or as directed.\n* Do NOT use aspirin.\n\nA fever does not need to come all the way down to normal to be helpful. Most people will feel better if their temperature drops by one degree Fahrenheit.\n\n**What About Antiviral Medicines?**\n\nMost people with milder symptoms feel better within 3 to 4 days and do not need to take antiviral medicines.\n\nAsk your provider if antiviral medicine is right for you. If you have any of the medical conditions below, you may be at risk for a more severe case of the flu:\n\n* Lung disease (including asthma)\n* Heart conditions (except high blood pressure)\n* Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions\n* Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease)\n* Diabetes and other metabolic disorders\n* A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids\n* Other long-term (chronic) medical problems\n\nAntiviral medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and baloxavir (Xofluza) are taken as pills. Zanamivir (Relenza) is taken by an inhaler. Peramivir (Rapivab) is available for intravenous use. Any of these may be used to treat some people who have the flu. These medicines work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms.\n\n**When Can I Return to School?**\n\nYou should be able to return to school when you're feeling well and have not had a fever for 24 hours (without taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other medicines to lower your fever).\n\n**Should I Get the Flu Vaccine?**\n\nPeople should get the vaccine even if they've had a flu-like illness already. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive the flu vaccine.\n\nReceiving the flu vaccine will help protect you from getting the flu.\n\n**Where Can I Get a Flu Vaccine?**\n\nFlu vaccines are often available at local health centers, provider's offices, and pharmacies. Ask your student health center, provider, pharmacy, or your place of work if they offer the flu vaccine.\n\n**How Do I Avoid Catching or Spreading the Flu?**\n\nStay in your apartment, dorm room, or home for at least 24 hours after your fever goes away. Wear a mask if you leave your room.\nDo NOT share food, utensils, cups, or bottles.\nCover your mouth with a tissue when coughing and throw it away after use.\nCough into your sleeve if a tissue is not available.\nCarry alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you. Use it often during the day and always after touching your face.\nDo NOT touch your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n**When Should I See a Provider?**\n\nMost college students do not need to see a provider when they have mild flu symptoms. This is because most college-age people are not at risk for a severe case.\n\nIf you feel you should see a provider, call the office first and tell them your symptoms. This helps the staff prepare for your visit, so that you do not spread germs to other people there.\n\nIf you have an increased risk of flu complications, contact your provider. Risk factors include:\n\n* Long-term (chronic) lung problems (including asthma or COPD)\n* Heart problems (except high blood pressure)\n* Kidney disease or failure (long-term)\n* Liver disease (long-term)\n* Brain or nervous system disorder\n* Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease)\n* Diabetes and other metabolic disorders\n* Weak immune system (such as people with AIDS, cancer, or an organ transplant; receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or taking corticosteroid pills every day)\n\nYou may also want to talk to your provider if you are around others who may be at risk for a severe case of the flu, including people who:\n\n* Live with or care for a child 6 months old or younger\n* Work in a health care setting and have direct contact with patients\n* Live with or care for someone with a long-term (chronic) medical problem who has not been vaccinated for the flu\n\nContact your provider right away or go to the emergency room if you have:\n\n* Difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath\n* Chest pain or abdominal pain\n* Sudden dizziness\n* Confusion, or problems reasoning\n* Severe vomiting, or vomiting that does not go away\n* Flu-like symptoms improve, but then return with a fever and worse cough\n\n---\n\n**College Students and the Flu**\n\nEvery year, the flu spreads across college campuses nationwide.

    "content": "**Colles Wrist Fracture - Aftercare**\n\n**About Your Injury**\n\nA Colles wrist fracture is caused by a forceful injury to the wrist. This may occur due to:\n\n*   Car accident\n*   Contact sports\n*   Falling while skiing, riding a bike, or other activity\n*   Falling on an outstretched arm (most common cause)\n\nHaving osteoporosis is a major risk factor for wrist fractures. Osteoporosis makes bones brittle, so they need less force to break. Sometimes a broken wrist is the first sign of weakening of the bones.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYou will likely get a splint to keep your wrist from moving.\n\nIf you have a small fracture and the bone pieces do not move out of place, you will likely wear a splint for 3 to 5 weeks. Some breaks may require you to wear a cast for about 6 to 8 weeks. You may need a second cast if the first one gets too loose as the swelling goes down.\n\nIf your break is severe, you may need to see a bone doctor (orthopedic surgeon). Treatments may include:\n\n*   Closed reduction, a procedure to set (reduce) a broken bone without surgery\n*   Surgery to insert screws and plates to hold your bones in place or replace the broken piece with a metal part\n\n**Self-care at Home**\n\nTo help with pain and swelling:\n\n*   Elevate your arm or hand up above your heart. This can help reduce swelling and pain.\n*   Apply an ice pack to the injured area.\n*   Use the ice for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours for the first few days while the swelling goes down.\n*   To prevent skin injury, wrap the ice pack in a clean cloth before applying it rather than putting it directly on your skin.\n\nFor pain, you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines without a prescription.\n\nTalk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle.\nDo not give aspirin to children.\n\nFor severe pain, you may need a prescription pain reliever.\n\nFollow your provider's instructions about elevating your wrist and using a sling.\n\nIf you have a cast, follow the instructions for your cast that your provider gave you.\nKeep your splint or cast dry.\n\n---\n\n**Colles Wrist Fracture - Aftercare**\n\nIf you have a Colles wrist fracture, follow these steps for aftercare:\n\n*   **Elevate your arm or hand**: Keep it up above your heart to reduce swelling and pain.\n*   **Apply an ice pack**: Use an ice pack wrapped in a clean cloth (not directly on your skin) for 15-20 minutes every few hours for the first few days while the swelling goes down.\n*   **Take over-the-counter pain medicines**: You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as directed on the bottle. However, talk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have certain medical conditions.\n*   **Follow your provider's instructions**: Elevate your wrist and use a sling as instructed by your healthcare provider.\n*   **Keep your splint or cast dry**: Make sure to keep your splint or cast clean and dry to prevent any complications.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your healthcare provider:\n\n*   Your cast is too loose or too tight\n*   Your hand or arm is swollen above or below your cast or splint\n*   Your cast is falling apart or rubs or irritates your skin\n*   Pain or swelling continues to get worse or becomes severe\n*   You have numbness, tingling, or coldness in your hand or your fingers look dark\n*   You cannot move your fingers because of swelling or pain\n\n---\n\n**Colles Wrist Fracture - Aftercare**\n\nIf you have a cast, follow the instructions for your cast that your provider gave you.\n\nKeep your splint or cast dry.\n\n**Self-care at Home**\n\nTo help with pain and swelling:\n\n* Elevate your arm or hand up above your heart. This can help reduce swelling and pain.\n* Apply an ice pack to the injured area.\n* Use the ice for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours for the first few days while the swelling goes down.\n\nFor pain, you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).

You can buy these pain medicines without a prescription.\n* For severe pain, you may need a prescription pain reliever.\n\nFollow your provider's instructions about elevating your wrist and using a sling.\n\n**Activity**\n\nExercising your fingers, elbow, and shoulder is important. It can help keep them from losing their function. Talk with your provider about how much exercise to do and when you can do it. Typically, the provider or surgeon will want you to start moving your fingers as soon as possible after having surgery or the splint or cast put on.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nThe initial recovery from a wrist fracture can take 3 to 4 months or more. You will need physical therapy.\n\nYou should start working with a physical therapist as soon as your provider recommends. The work may seem hard and at times painful. But doing the exercises you are given will speed your recovery. If you have surgery, you may start physical therapy earlier to avoid wrist stiffness. However, if you don't have surgery, you may start wrist motion later to avoid shifting of the fracture.\n\nIt can take anywhere from a few months to a year for your wrist to fully recover its function. Some people have stiffness and pain in their wrist for the rest of their life.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nAfter your arm is placed in a cast or splint, see your provider if:\n\n* Your cast is too loose or too tight.\n* Your hand or arm is swollen above or below your cast or splint.\n* Your cast is falling apart or rubs or irritates your skin.\n* Pain or swelling continues to get worse or becomes severe.\n* You have numbness, tingling, or coldness in your hand or your fingers look dark.\n* You cannot move your fingers because of swelling or pain.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDistal radius fracture; Broken wrist\n\n---\n\n**Colles Wrist Fracture - Aftercare**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of the condition:**\n\n*   A Colles wrist fracture is a break in the distal radius, which is the lower part of the forearm bone that connects to the wrist.\n*   It typically occurs when a person falls onto an outstretched hand, causing the bone to break.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms and signs:**\n\n*   Pain, swelling, and bruising around the fracture site\n*   Difficulty moving the wrist or forearm\n*   Deformity of the wrist, with the bone protruding through the skin\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment options:**\n\n*   Immobilization in a cast or splint to hold the bone in place while it heals\n*   Surgery may be necessary for more complex fractures or if the bone is significantly displaced\n\n\\n\\n**Aftercare instructions:**\n\n*   Keep the affected arm elevated above heart level to reduce swelling\n*   Apply ice packs to the area to help manage pain and inflammation\n*   Take over-the-counter pain medication as directed by your doctor\n*   Follow up with your healthcare provider for regular check-ins and to ensure proper healing\n\n\\n\\n**Preventing complications:**\n\n*   Monitor for signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, or increased pain around the fracture site\n*   Keep the affected arm clean and dry to prevent skin irritation and infection",

    "content": "**Cologuard: A Screening Test for Colon and Rectal Cancer**\n\n_Cologuard is a screening test for colon and rectal cancer._\n\nThe colon sheds cells from its lining every day. These cells pass with the stool through the colon. Colon cancer cells may have DNA changes in certain genes. Cologuard detects the altered DNA. The presence of abnormal cells or blood in the stool may indicate cancer or precancer tumors.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe Cologuard testing kit for colon and rectal cancer must be ordered by your health care provider. It will be sent by mail to your address. You collect the sample at home and send it back to the lab for testing.\n\n*   The Cologuard testing kit will contain a sample container, a tube, preserving liquid, labels, and instructions on how to collect the sample.\n*   When you are ready to have a bowel movement, use the Cologuard testing kit to collect your stool sample.\n*   Read the instructions that come with the testing kit carefully. Wait until you are ready to have a bowel movement. Collect the sample only when it is possible to ship it within 24 hours. The sample must reach the lab in 72 hours (3 days).\n*   DO NOT collect the sample if:\n    *   You have diarrhea.\n    *   You are menstruating.\n    *   You have rectal bleeding due to hemorrhoids.\n\n**Follow These Steps to Collect the Sample**\n\n1.  Read all instructions that come with the kit.\n2.  Use the brackets provided with the testing kit to fix the sample container on your toilet seat.\n3.  Use the toilet as usual for your bowel movement.\n4.  Try not to let urine get into the sample container.\n5.  Do not put toilet paper into the sample container.\n6.  Once your bowel movement is over, remove the sample container from the brackets and keep it on a flat surface.\n7.  Follow instructions to collect a little sample in the tube provided with the testing kit.\n8.  Pour the preserving liquid in the sample container and close the lid tightly.\n9.

You do not need to change your diet or medicines before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe test requires you to have a normal bowel movement. It will not feel any different from your regular bowel movements. You can collect the sample at your home privately.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done to screen for colon and rectal cancer and abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon or rectum.\n\nYour provider may suggest Cologuard testing once every 1 to 3 years starting at age 45 years. The test is recommended if you are age 45 to 75 years and have an average risk of colon cancer. This means that you do not have:\n\n*   Personal history of colon polyps and colon cancer\n*   Family history of colon cancer\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis)\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal result (negative result) will indicate that:\n\n*   The test did not detect blood cells or altered DNA in your stool.\n*   You do not need further testing for colon cancer if you have an average risk of colon or rectal cancer.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal result (positive result) suggests that the test found some pre-cancer or cancer cells in your stool sample. However, the Cologuard test does not diagnose cancer. You will need further tests to make a diagnosis of cancer. Your provider will likely suggest a colonoscopy.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is no risk involved in taking the sample for Cologuard test.\n\nScreening tests carry a small risk of:\n\n*   False-positives (your test results are abnormal, but you do NOT have colon cancer or pre-malignant polyps)\n*   False-negatives (your test is normal, even when you have colon cancer)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt is unclear yet whether the use of Cologuard will lead to better outcomes compared with other methods used to screen for colon and rectal cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Cologuard: A Screening Test for Colon and Rectal Cancer**\n\nThe Cologuard testing kit must be ordered by your health care provider.

However, the Cologuard test does not diagnose cancer. You will need further tests to make a diagnosis of cancer. Your provider will likely suggest a colonoscopy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is no risk involved in taking the sample for Cologuard test.\n\nScreening tests carry a small risk of:\n\n* False-positives (your test results are abnormal, but you do NOT have colon cancer or pre-malignant polyps)\n* False-negatives (your test is normal, even when you have colon cancer)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\nIt is unclear yet whether the use of Cologuard will lead to better outcomes compared with other methods used to screen for colon and rectal cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Cologuard**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Multitarget stool DNA screening**: A high positive predictive value for colorectal neoplasia regardless of exposure to previous colonoscopy.\n*   **NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology (NCCN Guidelines)**: Colon cancer, version 2.2023.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bresalier RS.

    "content": "**Colon Cancer Screening**\n\nColon cancer screening can detect polyps and early cancers in the large intestine. This type of screening can find problems that can be treated before cancer develops or spreads. Regular screenings may reduce the risk for death and complications caused by colorectal cancer.\n\n**SCREENING TESTS**\n\nThere are several ways to screen for colon cancer:\n\n* **Stool Test**: Checks your stool for blood. A common test used is the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Another stool test, commonly known as Cologuard, checks for both blood and abnormal stool DNA (sDNA).\n* **Sigmoidoscopy**: Uses a small flexible scope to view the lower part of your colon. It may miss some cancers or polyps that are higher in the large intestine.\n* **Colonoscopy**: Similar to sigmoidoscopy, but the entire colon can be viewed. Your health care provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. During a colonoscopy, you receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy.\n* **Capsule Endoscopy**: Involves swallowing a small, pill-sized camera that takes a video of the inside of your large intestine. This method is being studied, but it is not recommended for standard screening at this time.\n\n**SCREENING FOR AVERAGE-RISK PEOPLE**\n\nThere is not enough evidence to say that any one screening method is best. Colonoscopy is the most thorough but also has the highest risk. Talk to your provider about which test is right for you.\n\nAll adults should have a colon cancer screening test starting at age 45.\n\nThe most commonly recommended screening options for people with an average risk for colon cancer:\n\n* **Colonoscopy every 10 years** starting at age 45\n* **FIT every year** (colonoscopy is needed if results are positive)\n* **Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or every 10 years plus stool testing with FIT done every year**\n\nNote: If any of these tests are positive, colonoscopy is recommended.\n\n---\n\n**Colon Cancer Screening**\n\nAre you at risk for colon cancer? Learn about the different screening tests available to detect polyps and early cancers in the large intestine.\n\n**Screening Tests**\n\nThere are several ways to screen for colon cancer:\n\n*   **Stool Test**: Polyps in the colon and small cancers can cause small amounts of bleeding that cannot be seen with the naked eye. But blood can often be found in the stool.\n    This method checks your stool for blood.\n    A common test used is the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) was commonly used in the past. Another stool test, commonly known as Cologuard checks for both blood and abnormal stool DNA (sDNA).\n*   **Sigmoidoscopy**: This test uses a small flexible scope to view the lower part of your colon. Because the test only looks at the last one third of the large intestine (colon), it may miss some cancers or polyps that are higher in the large intestine.\n    Sigmoidoscopy and a stool test may be used together.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: A colonoscopy is similar to a sigmoidoscopy, but the entire colon can be viewed.\n    Your health care provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation.\n    During a colonoscopy, you receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy.\n    Sometimes, CT scans are used as an alternative to a regular colonoscopy. This is called a virtual colonoscopy (or CT colography).\n*   **Other Test**: Capsule endoscopy involves swallowing a small, pill-sized camera that takes a video of the inside of your large intestine. The method is being studied, but it is not recommended for standard screening at this time.\n\n**Screening for Average-Risk People**\n\nThere is not enough evidence to say that any one screening method is best.

If any of these tests are positive, colonoscopy is recommended:\n\n*   **sDNA-FIT**: every 3 years\n*   **CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy)**: every 5 years\n\n---\n\n**Colon Cancer Screening**\n\nThere are several ways to screen for colon cancer.\n\n**Stool Test**\n\nThe fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a commonly used stool test.

    "content": "**Colonoscopy**\n\n**What is colonoscopy?**\n\nColonoscopy is a medical procedure that allows your doctor to look inside your rectum and colon (large intestine). It uses an instrument called a scope, which has a light and a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube. This procedure lets your doctor see problems such as inflamed tissue, ulcers, polyps, and cancer.\n\n**Types of colonoscopy**\n\nThere are three types of colonoscopy:\n\n*   **Colonoscopy**: checks the entire colon and rectum\n*   **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: checks the rectum and the lower colon (sigmoid colon) only\n*   **Virtual colonoscopy**: an x-ray test that looks inside your rectum and part of your colon\n\n**Who needs a colonoscopy?**\n\nYou may need a colonoscopy to find the cause of unexplained symptoms such as:\n\n*   Bleeding from your anus\n*   Changes in your bowel activity, such as diarrhea\n*   Pain in your abdomen (belly)\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n\nDoctors also use these procedures to screen for colon polyps and cancer. If you aren't at higher risk for colorectal cancer, your health care provider will likely recommend you start getting screenings at age 45. If you are at higher risk, you may need to start getting screened for colorectal cancer earlier.\n\n**How do I prepare for a colonoscopy?**\n\nTo prepare for a colonoscopy, you will need to:\n\n*   Talk with your doctor about any health problems you have and all of the medicines and supplements that you take. You may need to stop taking some of your medicines and/or supplements before the procedure.\n*   Follow the bowel prep instructions from your doctor. The bowel prep clears the stool out of your colon, so your doctor will be able to see the colon during the procedure:\n    *   You may need to follow a clear liquid diet, usually for about one day before the procedure. Avoid red or purple drinks or gelatin; the dye can look like blood in the colon.\n    *   You probably need to stop eating and drinking the night before the exam.\n    *   You will need to take some laxatives. They may be pills, a powder that you dissolve in liquid, an enema, or a combination of these.\n\n**How is a colonoscopy done?**\n\nFor a colonoscopy:\n\n*   You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes 30 to 60 minutes.\n*   You will get IV (intravenous) sedatives or anesthesia, usually along with pain medicine, so you won't be awake or feel pain during the procedure.\n*   You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a colonoscope through your anus and into your rectum and colon. The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your colon.\n*   Once the scope reaches the opening to your small intestine, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your colon again.\n*   If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on.\n*   If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy.\n\n**What should I expect after a colonoscopy?**\n\nYou may feel cramping in your abdomen or bloating during the first hour after the procedure. If the doctor removed polyps or performed a biopsy, you may have light bleeding from your anus. This bleeding is normal.\n\nFor a virtual colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, you go back to your regular activities and diet right after the test. For a colonoscopy, you can expect a full recovery and return to your normal diet by the next day.\n\nYour doctor will give you the results of your procedure. If you had a biopsy, it can take a few days to get those results.\n\n---\n\n**Colonoscopy and Flexible Sigmoidoscopy**\n\nColonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy are procedures that let your doctor look inside your rectum and colon (large intestine). They use instruments called scopes, which have a light and a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube.\n\n**What is Colonoscopy?**\n\nColonoscopy checks your entire colon and rectum. It's usually done to find the cause of unexplained symptoms such as bleeding from your anus, changes in your bowel activity, pain in your abdomen, or unexplained weight loss. Doctors also use this procedure to screen for colon polyps and cancer.\n\n**What is Virtual Colonoscopy?**\n\nVirtual colonoscopy looks inside your rectum and part of your colon using an x-ray test, also known as CT colonography. It's similar to a regular colonoscopy but doesn't use a scope.\n\n**Who Needs These Procedures?**\n\nYou may need one of these procedures if you have unexplained symptoms such as bleeding from your anus, changes in your bowel activity, pain in your abdomen, or unexplained weight loss. Doctors also use these procedures to screen for colon polyps and cancer.\n\n**Preparation for the Procedure**\n\nTo prepare for a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy:\n\n*   Talk with your doctor about any health problems you have and all of the medicines and supplements that you take.\n*   Follow the bowel prep instructions from your doctor. This may include following a clear liquid diet, stopping eating and drinking the night before the exam, and taking laxatives.\n\n**How Are These Procedures Done?**\n\nFor a colonoscopy:\n\n*   You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a colonoscope through your anus and into your rectum and colon.\n*   The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view.\n*   The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your colon.\n\nFor a virtual colonoscopy:\n\n*   You'll lie on a table while a specially trained x-ray technician inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum.\n*   The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view.\n*   The table slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x-ray images.\n\nFor a flexible sigmoidoscopy:\n\n*   You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum.\n*   The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view.\n*   The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your lower colon.\n\n**What Should I Expect After the Procedure?**\n\nYou may feel cramping in your abdomen or bloating during the first hour after the procedure.

It can also be done in the outpatient department of a hospital or medical center. This procedure is most often done by a specially trained doctor called a gastroenterologist.\n\nYou will be asked to change out of your street clothes and wear a hospital gown for the procedure.\nYou will likely be given medicine into a vein (IV) to help you relax. You should not feel any pain. You may be awake during the test and may even be able to speak. You will probably not remember anything.\nYou lie on your left side with your knees drawn up toward your chest.\nThe scope is gently inserted through the anus. It is carefully moved into the lowest part of the large intestine. The scope is slowly advanced as far as the lowest part of the small intestine.\nAir is inserted through the scope to provide a better view. Suction may be used to remove fluid or stool.\nThe doctor gets a better view as the scope is moved back out. So, a more careful exam is done while the scope is being pulled back.\nTissue samples (biopsy) or polyps may be removed using tiny tools inserted through the scope. Photos may be taken using the camera at the end of the scope. If needed, procedures, such as laser therapy, are also done.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour bowel needs to be completely empty and clean for the exam. A problem in your large intestine that needs to be treated may be missed if your intestines are not cleaned out.\n\nYour provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation. Steps may include:\n\n*   Using enemas\n*   Not eating solid foods for 1 to 3 days before the test\n*   Taking laxatives\n\nYou need to drink plenty of clear liquids for 1 to 3 days before the test. Examples of clear liquids are:\n\n*   Clear coffee or tea\n*   Fat-free bouillon or broth\n*   Gelatin\n*   Sports drinks without added color\n*   Strained fruit juices\n*   Water\n\nYou will likely be told to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other blood-thinning medicines for several days before the test. Keep taking your other medicines unless your provider tells you otherwise.\n\nYou will need to stop taking iron pills or liquids a few days before the test, unless your provider tells you it is OK to continue. Iron can make your stool dark black. This makes it harder for the doctor to view inside your bowel.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe medicines given for the test will make you sleepy so that you may not feel any discomfort or have any memory of the test.\n\nYou may feel pressure as the scope moves inside. You may feel brief cramping and gas pains as air is inserted or the scope advances. Passing gas is necessary and should be expected.\n\nAfter the exam, you may have mild abdominal cramping and pass a lot of gas. You may also feel bloated and sick to your stomach. These feelings will soon go away.\n\nYou should be able to go home about one hour after the test. You must plan to have someone take you home after the test because you will be woozy and unable to drive. Your providers will not let you leave until someone arrives to help you.\n\nWhen you are home, follow instructions on recovering from the procedure. These may include:\n\n*   Drink plenty of liquids.\n*   Eat a healthy meal to restore your energy.\n*   You should be able to return to your regular activities the next day.\n*   Avoid driving, operating machinery, drinking alcohol, and making important decisions for at least 24 hours after the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nColonoscopy may be done for the following reasons:\n\n*   Abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, or weight loss\n*   Abnormal changes (polyps) found on sigmoidoscopy or x-ray tests (virtual colonoscopy, CT scan, or barium enema)\n*   Anemia due to low iron (usually when no other cause has been found)\n*   Blood in the stool, or black, tarry stools\n*   Follow-up of a past finding, such as polyps or colon cancer\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease)\n*   Screening for colorectal cancer\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal findings are healthy intestinal tissues.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal test results may mean any of the following:\n\n*   Abnormal pouches on the lining of the intestines, called diverticulosis\n*   Areas of bleeding\n*   Cancer in the colon or rectum\n*   Colitis (a swollen and inflamed intestine) due to Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, infection, or lack of blood flow\n*   Small growths called polyps on the lining of your colon (which can be removed through the colonoscope during the exam)\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of colonoscopy may include any of the following:\n\n*   Heavy or ongoing bleeding from biopsy or removal of polyps\n*   Hole or tear in the wall of the colon that requires surgery to repair\n*   Infection needing antibiotic therapy (very rare)\n*   Reaction to the medicine you are given to relax, causing breathing problems or low blood pressure\n\n---\n\n**Colonoscopy**\n\nA colonoscopy is an exam that views the inside of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, using a tool called a colonoscope.\n\n**The Colonoscope**\n\nThe colonoscope has a small camera attached to a flexible tube that can reach the entire length of the colon.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nColonoscopy is done most often in a procedure room at your health care provider's office. It can also be done in the outpatient department of a hospital or medical center. This procedure is most often done by a specially trained doctor called a gastroenterologist.\n\nYou will be asked to change out of your street clothes and wear a hospital gown for the procedure.\nYou will likely be given medicine into a vein (IV) to help you relax. You should not feel any pain. You may be awake during the test and may even be able to speak. You will probably not remember anything.\nYou lie on your left side with your knees drawn up toward your chest.\nThe scope is gently inserted through the anus. It is carefully moved into the lowest part of the large intestine. The scope is slowly advanced as far as the lowest part of the small intestine.\nAir is inserted through the scope to provide a better view. Suction may be used to remove fluid or stool.\nThe doctor gets a better view as the scope is moved back out. So, a more careful exam is done while the scope is being pulled back.\nTissue samples (biopsy) or polyps may be removed using tiny tools inserted through the scope. Photos may be taken using the camera at the end of the scope. If needed, procedures, such as laser therapy, are also done.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour bowel needs to be completely empty and clean for the exam. A problem in your large intestine that needs to be treated may be missed if your intestines are not cleaned out.\n\nYour provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation. Steps may include:\n\nUsing enemas\nNot eating solid foods for 1 to 3 days before the test\nTaking laxatives\n\nYou need to drink plenty of clear liquids for 1 to 3 days before the test. Examples of clear liquids are:\n\nClear coffee or tea\nFat-free bouillon or broth\nGelatin\nSports drinks without added color\nStrained fruit juices\nWater\n\nYou will likely be told to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other blood-thinning medicines for several days before the test. Keep taking your other medicines unless your provider tells you otherwise.\n\nYou will need to stop taking iron pills or liquids a few days before the test, unless your provider tells you it is OK to continue. Iron can make your stool dark black. This makes it harder for the doctor to view inside your bowel.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe medicines given for the test will make you sleepy so that you may not feel any discomfort or have any memory of the test.\n\nYou may feel pressure as the scope moves inside. You may feel brief cramping and gas pains as air is inserted or the scope advances. Passing gas is necessary and should be expected.\n\n**After the Exam**\n\nYou may have mild abdominal cramping and pass a lot of gas. You may also feel bloated and sick to your stomach. These feelings will soon go away.\n\nYou should be able to go home about one hour after the test. You must plan to have someone take you home after the test because you will be woozy and unable to drive.

    "content": "**Color Blindness**\n\nMost of us see our world in color. We enjoy looking at a lush green lawn or a red rose in full bloom. If you have a color vision defect, you may see these colors differently than most people.\n\n**Types of Color Vision Defects**\n\nThere are three main kinds of color vision defects:\n\n*   Red-green color vision defects: the most common type\n*   Blue-yellow color vision defects\n*   A complete absence of color vision\n\n**Causes and Genetics**\n\nMost of the time, color blindness is genetic. There is no treatment, but most people adjust and the condition doesn't limit their activities.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Achromatopsia**: a rare form of color blindness that affects both eyes\n*   **Genetics**: color blindness is often inherited from one's parents\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n*   **Eye Health Data and Statistics**: a resource from the National Eye Institute\n*   **Clinical Trials**: information on current trials for color vision defects\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   \"Keeping an eye on Parkinson's disease: color vision and outer retinal...\" \n*   \"Arabic Reading Performance With a Chromatic Acuity Chart.\"\n*   \"Perception and communication of relevant colours in paintings by observers with...\"\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   **Find an Ophthalmologist**: a resource from the American Academy of Ophthalmology\n\n**Children**\n\n*   **Ask a Scientist**: a Q&A on color blindness from the National Eye Institute\n*   **Color Blindness**: information for children from the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   **Color blindness**: a patient handout from the Medical Encyclopedia\n*   **Color vision test**: a patient handout from the Medical Encyclopedia\n\n---\n\n**Color Blindness**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Color Blindness?**\n\nColor blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is a condition where a person has difficulty perceiving certain colors. The most common form of color blindness is red-green color blindness, which affects about 8% of all men and 0.5% of all women.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Color Blindness**\n\nColor blindness can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Inherited from one's parents, this is the most common cause of color blindness.\n*   **Age-related changes**: As people age, their eyes may become less sensitive to certain colors.\n*   **Eye diseases**: Certain eye diseases, such as cataracts or glaucoma, can cause color vision problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Color Blindness**\n\nThe symptoms of color blindness can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n*   **Difficulty distinguishing between red and green colors**\n*   **Trouble perceiving certain shades or hues**\n*   **Color vision that is limited to only a few colors**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Color Blindness**\n\nColor blindness can be diagnosed through a variety of tests, including:\n\n*   **Color vision test**: A simple test where the person is shown different colored cards and asked to identify them.\n*   **Genetic testing**: In some cases, genetic testing may be used to determine if color blindness is inherited.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options for Color Blindness**\n\nWhile there is no cure for color blindness, there are several treatment options available, including:\n\n*   **Special glasses or contact lenses**: These can help people with color blindness distinguish between certain colors.\n*   **Assistive technology**: Software and apps can be used to assist individuals with color vision deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Color Blindness is the National Eye Institute.",

About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness. Very few women are color blind.\n\nThe drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can also cause color blindness. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions.\n\n**How Does Color Blindness Occur?**\n\nColor blindness occurs when there is a problem with the pigments in certain nerve cells of the eye that sense color. These cells are called cones. They are found in the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina.\n\nIf just one pigment is missing, you may have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. If a different pigment is missing, you may have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness often have problems seeing reds and greens, too.\n\nThe most severe form of color blindness is achromatopsia. This is a rare condition in which a person cannot see any color, only shades of gray.\n\n**Symptoms of Color Blindness**\n\nSymptoms vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n* Trouble seeing colors and the brightness of colors in the usual way\n* Inability to tell the difference between shades of the same or similar colors\n\nOften, symptoms are so mild that people may not know they are color blind. A parent may notice signs of color blindness when a young child is first learning colors.\n\nRapid, side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other symptoms may occur in severe cases.\n\n**Exams and Tests for Color Blindness**\n\nYour health care provider or eye specialist can check your color vision in several ways. Testing for color blindness is usually part of a complete eye exam.\n\n**Treatment for Color Blindness**\n\nThere is no known treatment. Special contact lenses and glasses may help people with color blindness tell the difference between similar colors.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Color Blindness**\n\nColor blindness is a lifelong condition. Most people are able to adjust to it.\n\n**Possible Complications of Color Blindness**\n\nPeople who are colorblind may not be able to get a job that requires the ability to see colors accurately. For example, electricians, painters, and fashion designers need to be able to see colors accurately.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional about Color Blindness**\n\nCall your provider or eye specialist if you think you (or your child) may have color blindness.\n\n**References**\n\n* Robson AG, Moore AT, Duncan JL.

The health care provider will explain the test to you.\n\nThere are several tests for color vision. During the most common, you will be shown several cards with colored dot patterns. These cards are called Ishihara plates. In the patterns, some of the dots will appear to form numbers or symbols. You will be asked to identify the symbols, if possible.\n\nAs you cover one eye, the tester will hold the cards 14 inches (35 centimeters) from your face and ask you to quickly identify the symbol found in each color pattern.\n\nDepending on the problem suspected, you may be asked to determine the intensity of a color, particularly in one eye compared to the other. This is often tested by using the cap of a red eyedrop bottle.\n\nA more detailed test is called the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test in which you arrange 100 tiles in order as the hue gradually changes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nIf your child is having this test performed, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel, and to practice or demonstrate on a doll. Your child will feel less anxious about the test if you explain what will happen and why.\n\nUsually there is a sample card of multicolored dots that almost everyone can identify, even people with color vision problems.\n\nIf you or your child normally wears glasses, wear them during the test.\n\nSmall children may be asked to tell the difference between a red bottle cap and caps of a different color.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe test is similar to a vision test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to determine whether you have any problems with your color vision.\n\nColor vision problems often fall into two categories:\n\nPresent from birth (congenital) problems in the light-sensitive cells (cones) of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) -- the color cards are used in this case.\nDiseases of the optic nerve (the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain) -- the bottle caps are used in this case.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIf your color vision is normal, you will be able to distinguish all the letters, numbers, or symbols on the Ishihara plates. If you were tested with bottle caps, you will be able to identify the colors correctly.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThis test can determine the following congenital (present from birth) color vision problems:\n\n* Achromatopsia -- complete color blindness, seeing only shades of gray\n* Deuteranopia -- difficulty telling the difference between red/purple and green/purple\n* Protanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between blue/green and red/green\n* Tritanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between yellow/green and blue/green\n\nProblems in the optic nerve can show up as a loss of color intensity, although the color card test may be normal.\n\nThere is no treatment for congenital colorblindness. But, there are special contact lenses that may help you distinguish between certain colors, depending on the type of colorblindness you have.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with this test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEye test - color; Vision test - color; Ishihara color vision test\n\n---\n\n**Color Vision Test**\n\nA color vision test checks your ability to distinguish between different colors.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will sit in a comfortable position in regular lighting.

If you were tested with bottle caps, you will be able to identify the colors correctly.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThis test can determine the following congenital (present from birth) color vision problems:\n\n* Achromatopsia -- complete color blindness, seeing only shades of gray\n* Deuteranopia -- difficulty telling the difference between red/purple and green/purple\n* Protanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between blue/green and red/green\n* Tritanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between yellow/green and blue/green\n\nProblems in the optic nerve can show up as a loss of color intensity, although the color card test may be normal.\n\nThere is no treatment for congenital colorblindness. But, there are special contact lenses that may help you distinguish between certain colors, depending on the type of colorblindness you have.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with this test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Eye test - color\n* Vision test - color\n* Ishihara color vision test",

    "content": "**Colorado Tick Fever**\n\nColorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral infection spread by the bite of the Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_).\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   This disease is usually seen between March and September.\n*   Most cases occur in April, May, and June.\n*   CTF is seen most often in the western United States and Canada at elevations higher than 4,000 feet (1,219 meters).\n*   The CTF virus is transmitted by a tick bite or, in very rare cases, by a blood transfusion.\n\n---\n\n**Colorado Tick Fever**\n\n**What is Colorado tick fever?**\n\nColorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral disease that affects humans and animals. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick, which is found in the western United States and Canada.\n\n**Who is affected by CTF?**\n\nAnyone who spends time outdoors in areas where the ticks are present can be affected by CTF. The disease is most common among people who work or play outside in these areas during the warmer months of the year.\n\n**What are the symptoms of CTF?**\n\nThe symptoms of CTF typically begin 1 to 14 days after a tick bite and may include:\n\n* Sudden fever that lasts for 3 days, then goes away, only to return 1 to 3 days later\n* Feeling weak all over and muscle aches\n* Headache behind the eyes (typically during fever)\n* Lethargy (sleepiness) or confusion\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Rash (may be light colored)\n* Sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n* Sweating\n\n**How is CTF diagnosed?**\n\nDiagnosis of CTF typically involves a physical examination, a review of the patient's symptoms, and laboratory tests, such as:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Liver function tests\n* Antibody tests to confirm the infection\n\n**What is the treatment for CTF?**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for CTF. The goal of treatment is to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. This may include removing the tick from the skin, taking pain relievers as needed, and monitoring for any signs of complications.\n\n**Can CTF be prevented?**\n\nYes, CTF can be prevented by taking steps to avoid tick bites. These include:\n\n* Wearing closed shoes, long sleeves, and tucking long pants into socks when walking or hiking in tick-infested areas\n* Wearing light-colored clothing, which shows ticks more easily than darker colors\n* Checking yourself and your pets frequently for ticks and removing them right away using tweezers\n* Using insect repellent\n\n**What are the possible complications of CTF?**\n\nComplications of CTF may include:\n\n* Infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n* Irritation and swelling of the brain (encephalitis)\n* Repeated bleeding episodes for no apparent cause\n\n**When should I seek medical attention?**\n\nYou should seek medical attention if you or your child develops symptoms of CTF, if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop.\n\n---\n\n**Colorado Tick Fever**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Colorado tick fever?**\n\nColorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral disease caused by the presence of antibodies against the CTF virus. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick, which lives in the western United States.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe cause of CTF is the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick. The risk factors for developing CTF include:\n\n*   Exposure to ticks in areas where they are common\n*   Engaging in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or hunting in tick-prone regions\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of CTF can vary from person to person but may include:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Rash\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle and joint pain\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing CTF typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests such as blood tests to detect the presence of antibodies against the CTF virus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for CTF, but symptoms can be managed with supportive care, including:\n\n*   Rest\n*   Fluid replacement\n*   Pain management\n*   Antipyretics to reduce fever\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent CTF, individuals should take steps to avoid tick bites, such as:\n\n*   Wearing protective clothing and insect repellent when outdoors in tick-prone areas\n*   Conducting regular tick checks after spending time outside\n*   Removing any attached ticks promptly and correctly\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\nTick Bites",

    "content": "**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\n**What are colorectal cancer screening tests?**\n\nColorectal cancer screening tests check for colorectal cancer before you have any symptoms. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum.\n\n**Benefits of Colorectal Cancer Screening**\n\nColorectal cancer screening can help to:\n\n* Find colorectal cancer early, when treatment is most effective.\n* Prevent cancer from developing. Some screening tests let your health care provider find and remove abnormal growths, known as colorectal polyps. Cancer in the colon or rectum often starts as a polyp. Most of these polyps are benign (not cancerous) but could become cancerous if not removed.\n* Find bleeding that you can't see, which may mean you have a polyp.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nColorectal cancer screening tests are used to check for signs of colorectal cancer and remove any colorectal polyps.\n\n**Why do I need a colorectal cancer screening test?**\n\nRegular screening can detect colon polyps and colorectal cancer. If you aren't at higher risk for colorectal cancer, your provider will likely recommend you start screenings at age 45. If you are at higher risk, you may need to start getting screened for colorectal cancer earlier. Talk with your provider about when to start, how often to get screened, and which type of test you should have.\n\nYou may need to be screened at a younger age, or more often, if you have certain risk factors, including:\n\n* A family history of colorectal cancer\n* A personal or family history of ovarian cancer\n* An inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease\n* Being overweight or having obesity\n* Smoking tobacco products\n* Alcohol misuse\n\n**What happens during a colorectal cancer screening?**\n\nThere are two main types of colorectal cancer screening tests: visual exams and stool tests. There are different options for both types of tests.\n\n**Visual Exams**\n\nVisual exams are procedures that allow your provider to look inside your colon and rectum. They are done using a thin tube with a camera attached or a special imaging device. They usually require some type of bowel prep to clear the stool out of your colon. If you need a bowel prep, your provider will give you instructions on how to do it.\n\nTypes of visual exams include:\n\n* Colonoscopy: This test lets your provider view your entire rectum and colon (large intestine). It is often done in the outpatient department of a hospital or medical center. The procedure takes about 30 to 60 minutes.\n* Sigmoidoscopy: This test allows your provider to look at your rectum and the lower colon (sigmoid colon).\n* Virtual Colonoscopy: This test uses x-rays and a computer to take detailed, 3-dimensional pictures of the entire colon and rectum.\n\n**Stool Tests**\n\nStool tests look at stool samples for blood or other signs of cancer you can't see. But you can also have blood in your stool if you have a health condition that isn't cancer, such as hemorrhoids. Your provider usually prescribes the test, which can be done at home. You take a stool sample and send it to a lab.\n\nTypes of stool tests include:\n\n* Fecal occult blood tests (FOBT): These tests look for hidden (known as occult) blood in your stool.\n* Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)\n* Guaiac smear method (gFOBT)\n\n**Instructions for Stool Tests**\n\nFor a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), you will most likely need to:\n\n* Collect multiple samples from one bowel movement.\n* Use the brush or device included in your kit to take the sample from the stool's surface.\n* Brush the sample onto a test card.\n\nFor a guaiac smear test (gFOBT), you will most likely need to:\n\n* Collect samples from three separate bowel movements.\n* Use the applicator from your test kit to smear some of the stool on the test card or slide.\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\n**What are colorectal cancer screening tests?**\n\nColorectal cancer screening tests check for colorectal cancer before you have any symptoms. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum. The colon makes up most of the large intestine. The rectum is at the end of the large intestine and connects to the anus.\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Can Help To:**\n\n* Detect colorectal cancer early, when it is easier to treat\n* Find polyps in the colon before they turn into cancer\n* Prevent colorectal cancer by removing polyps\n\n**Types of Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests:**\n\n1. **Colonoscopy**: A visual exam of the entire colon using a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ The most sensitive colon cancer screening test\n\t\t+ Looks at the entire colon\n\t\t+ Can remove polyps and test for cancer\n\t\t+ May help find other diseases\n\t\t+ Needed only every 10 years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Small risk of tears and bleeding\n\t\t+ Bowel prep needed\n\t\t+ Sedatives are needed for the procedure\n\t\t+ Takes at least one day for bowel prep and recovery\n2. **Sigmoidoscopy**: A visual exam of a third of the colon using a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ Usually doesn't require bowel prep\n\t\t+ Sedatives are not usually needed\n\t\t+ Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Only looks at a third of the colon\n\t\t+ May miss small polyps\n\t\t+ Can't remove all polyps\n\t\t+ Very small risk of tears or bleeding\n3. **Virtual Colonoscopy**: A visual exam of the entire colon using a CT scan.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ Looks at the entire colon\n\t\t+ Sedatives not needed\n\t\t+ Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Bowel prep needed\n\t\t+ May miss small polyps\n\t\t+ Polyps cannot be removed during the procedure\n\t\t+ Exposure to a small amount of radiation\n4. **Fecal Immunochemical (FIT)**: A stool test that checks for blood in the stool.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ No risk to colon\n\t\t+ No bowel prep\n\t\t+ Sample can be collected at home\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Can have false positives, which means your test results show that blood is in your stool, but there isn't any\n\t\t+ Cannot detect precancerous changes (cells that are at risk for turning into cancer)\n\t\t+ May miss some signs of polyps and/or cancer\n5. **Guaiac Smear Test (gFOBT)**: A stool test that checks for blood in the stool.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ No risk to colon\n\t\t+ No bowel prep\n\t\t+ Sample can be collected at home\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Can have false positives, which means your test results show that blood is in your stool, but there isn't any\n\t\t+ Cannot detect precancerous changes\n\t\t+ May miss some signs of polyps and/or cancer\n6. **Stool DNA (FIT-DNA)**: A stool test that checks for genetic changes in the stool.\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ No risk to colon\n\t\t+ No bowel prep\n\t\t+ Sample can be collected at home\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Can have false positives\n\t\t+ Cannot detect precancerous changes\n\t\t+ May miss some cancers\n\n**Preparing for a Colorectal Cancer Screening Test:**\n\nBefore undergoing a colorectal cancer screening test, you may need to:\n\n* Follow a liquid diet for one to three days before the test (for colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy)\n* Drink plenty of clear liquids one to three days before the test (for colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy)\n* Take a laxative or use an enema on the evening before your test (for colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy)\n* Avoid certain foods and medicines for several days before your gFOBT test\n\n**Risks Associated with Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests:**\n\nWhile rare, serious risks associated with colorectal cancer screening tests include:\n\n* Tears in the colon or rectum wall\n* Bleeding\n* Reaction to the sedative (for colonoscopy)\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your test results show abnormal findings, it may indicate the presence of polyps or cancer. Your healthcare provider will likely order further testing, such as a colonoscopy, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Colorectal Cancer Screening?**\n\nEach type of screening test has its advantages and disadvantages. You and your healthcare provider should discuss the benefits and risks of each option to determine the best course of action for your individual needs.\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\nColorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum.

It is often done in the outpatient department of a hospital or medical center.\n\t* Before the test, you will need to empty your colon (large bowel) in a procedure called bowel prep.\n\t* During the test:\n\t\t+ You will lie on an exam table.\n\t\t+ A colonoscope, a thin, lighted tube with a camera attached, will be inserted into your rectum and up into your colon.\n\t\t+ The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your provider can see your colon.\n\t\t+ Your provider will look for colorectal polyps or other abnormal areas.\n\t\t+ If you have polyps, your provider may remove them or tissue samples using special tools inserted through the scope.\n2. **Sigmoidoscopy**: This test allows your provider to look at your rectum and the lower colon (sigmoid colon).\n\t* During the test:\n\t\t+ You will lie on an exam table with your knees drawn up to your chest.\n\t\t+ A sigmoidoscope, a flexible, lighted tube with a camera, will be inserted into your rectum and up into the lower part of your colon.\n\t\t+ Air will be pumped through the sigmoidoscope to make your colon bigger and easier to see.\n3. **Virtual Colonoscopy**: This test is also called a computerized tomography (CT) colonography. It uses x-rays and a computer to take detailed, 3-dimensional pictures of the entire colon and rectum.\n\nStool Tests:\n\n1. **Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT)**: These tests look for hidden (known as occult) blood in your stool.\n\t* Your provider will give you a kit that includes instructions on how to do the test.\n\t* There are two types of fecal occult blood tests: the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the guaiac smear method (gFOBT).\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Visual Exams**\n\nVisual exams are procedures that allow your provider to look inside your colon and rectum.

You should arrange for someone to take you home.\n*   **Sigmoidoscopy**: This test allows your provider to look at your rectum and the lower colon (sigmoid colon). During the test:\n    *   You may need to follow a clear liquid diet one or more days before the procedure.\n    *   You may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) on the morning of the procedure.\n    *   You may need to take a laxative (a medicine used to cause a bowel movement) the night before the test.\n    *   You should empty your bowels with an enema about one hour before the procedure. A second enema is sometimes needed.\n*   **Virtual Colonoscopy**: This test is also called a computerized tomography (CT) colonography. It uses x-rays and a computer to take detailed, 3-dimensional pictures of the entire colon and rectum. Since this is an x-ray, this test is not recommended if you are pregnant. Tell your provider if you have any implanted medical devices, such as a pacemaker.\n    *   This test is usually done in the radiology department of a hospital or medical center and takes about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Stool Tests**\n\nStool tests look at stool samples for blood or other signs of cancer you can't see. But you can also have blood in your stool if you have a health condition that isn't cancer, such as hemorrhoids.\n\n*   **Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)**: These tests look for hidden (known as occult) blood in your stool.

The typical preparations for other colorectal cancer screening tests are below.\n\n*   **Bowel Prep**: For a colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy, you will need to do a bowel prep. Your provider will give you specific instructions on how to do your bowel prep, but steps may include:\n    *   Following a liquid diet for one to three days before the test.\n    *   Drinking plenty of clear liquids one to three days before the test. Clear liquids include water, black coffee or tea, fat-free broth, and sports drinks without added color. Avoid red or purple drinks or gelatin; the dye in those can look like blood in the colon.\n    *   Drinking a strong liquid laxative (a medicine used to cause a bowel movement), taking laxative pills, and/or using an enema on the evening before your test.\n*   **Medicines**: You may need to stop taking certain medicines before these tests, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Avoiding Certain Foods and Medicines**\n\nFor a g(FOBT) test, you may need to avoid the following foods and medicines for several days before your test:\n\n*   **Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin\n*   **Vitamin C**: daily from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit\n*   **Certain vegetables**: such as broccoli and turnips\n*   **Red meat**: such as beef, lamb, or pork\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\n**Preparation for Screening Tests**\n\nYour provider will give you full instructions on how to prepare for your screening test.\n\n*   For a colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy, you will need to do a bowel prep. Your provider will give you specific instructions on how to do your bowel prep.\n*   Bowel prep can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, but if the colon is not thoroughly cleaned out, your provider may not be able to get a complete picture of your colon and rectum.\n*   You may need to stop taking certain medicines before these tests, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Special Preparations Needed**\n\n*   For a sigmoidoscopy, before the test, you may need to:\n    *   Avoid eating for 6-8 hours beforehand\n    *   Follow your provider's instructions for bowel prep and preparation of the rectum\n*   For a g(FOBT) test, you may need to avoid the following foods and medicines for several days before your test:\n    *   Red meat\n    *   Certain vegetables, such as broccoli and turnips\n    *   Vitamin C daily from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit\n    *   NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere are no risks to having a fecal occult blood test or a stool DNA test.\n\n*   Serious risks of colonoscopy are rare but can include:\n    *   Tears in the colon or rectum wall\n    *   Bleeding\n    *   Reaction to the sedative\n*   There are fewer risks to sigmoidoscopy than with a colonoscopy. Tears and bleeding can happen in the colon, but they are even less common than with a colonoscopy.\n*   In a virtual colonoscopy, risks include:\n    *   Exposure to a small dose of radiation from the scan\n    *   Rarely, a tear in the colon or rectum can happen when it is inflated with air\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your fecal occult blood test or stool DNA test had abnormal results, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. But your provider will probably order more tests, such as a colonoscopy, to help make a diagnosis.\n\n*   Abnormal results for the other types of screening tests may include the following:\n    *   Colonoscopy: Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found and removed.\n        *   Most polyps aren't cancerous but can turn into cancer if not removed. Depending on the size and number of polyps, your provider may recommend more frequent colonoscopies.\n    *   Sigmoidoscopy: Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found. They may or may not be removed depending on their location.\n        *   Whether or not your polyps were removed, you will probably need a colonoscopy so your provider can view your entire colon and rectum.\n    *   Virtual colonoscopy: Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were seen on the CT scan.\n        *   You may need a traditional colonoscopy so your provider can get a tissue sample. Sometimes this procedure can be done on the same day as your virtual colonoscopy.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Colorectal Cancer Screening?**\n\nEach type of screening test has advantages and disadvantages. You and your provider should discuss the benefits and risks of each option.\n\n*   Colonoscopy (visual exam)\n    *   Advantages:\n        *   The most sensitive colon cancer screening test\n        *   Looks at the entire colon\n        *   Can remove polyps and test for cancer\n        *   May help find other diseases\n        *   Needed only every 10 years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n    *   Disadvantages:\n        *   Small risk of tears and bleeding\n        *   Bowel prep needed\n        *   Sedatives are needed for the procedure\n        *   Takes at least one day for bowel prep and recovery\n*   Sigmoidoscopy (visual exam)\n    *   Advantages:\n        *   Usually doesn't require bowel prep\n        *   Sedatives are not usually needed\n        *   Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n    *   Disadvantages:\n        *   Only looks at a third of the colon\n        *   May miss small polyps\n        *   Can't remove all polyps\n        *   Very small risk of tears or bleeding\n*   Virtual Colonoscopy (visual exam)\n    *   Advantages:\n        *   Looks at the entire colon\n        *   Sedatives not needed\n        *   Needed every five years (if no polyps were found in previous tests)\n    *   Disadvantages:\n        *   Bowel prep needed\n        *   May miss small polyps\n        *   Polyps cannot be removed during the procedure\n        *   Exposure to a small amount of radiation\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests**\n\nEach type of screening test has advantages and disadvantages.

Your colon and rectum are part of your digestive system:\n\nYour colon is the first and longest part of your large intestine. It absorbs water and some nutrients from foods. It also changes the leftover waste products into stool (poop).\nYour rectum is the lower part of your large intestine. It's where your body stores stool.\n\nCancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects either of these parts may also be called colorectal cancer.\n\n**What causes colorectal cancer?**\n\nColorectal cancer happens when there are changes in your genetic material (DNA). These changes are also called mutations or variants. Often, the genetic changes that lead to colorectal cancer happen during your lifetime and the exact cause is unknown. But certain genetic changes that raise your risk for colorectal cancer are inherited, meaning that you are born with them.\n\nBesides genetics, other factors, including your lifestyle and the environment, can affect your risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n**Who is more likely to develop colorectal cancer?**\n\nAnyone can get colorectal cancer, but certain factors make you more likely to develop it:\n\nBeing older; your risk of getting colorectal cancer increases as you age.\nHaving a personal or family history of colorectal cancer.\nHaving a history of adenomas. Adenomas are colorectal polyps (growths) that look abnormal under a microscope or are 1 centimeter or larger. Adenomas are not cancer, but they can sometimes turn into cancer over time.\nHaving a genetic syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).\nHaving chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease for 8 years or more.\nHaving three or more alcoholic drinks per day.\nSmoking cigarettes.\nBeing Black; Black people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races.\nHaving obesity.\n\n**What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?**\n\nColorectal cancer may not always cause symptoms, especially at first. If you do have symptoms, they could include:\n\nA change in bowel habits that lasts more than a few days, such as:\nDiarrhea\nConstipation\nFeeling that the bowel does not empty completely\nYour stool is narrower or has a different shape than usual\nBlood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool\nFrequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, or cramps\nWeight loss for no known reason\nFatigue\n\n**What is screening for colorectal cancer and who needs it?**\n\nBecause colorectal cancer may not cause symptoms at first, it's important to have screening tests for colorectal cancer. Screening tests look for signs of a disease before you have any symptoms. They can help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat.\n\nMost experts recommend that start screenings at 45 and continue until at least age 75. People over 75 and those who are at high risk should talk to their providers about how often you need screening and what type of test they should get.\n\nThe types of tests include different stool tests and procedures such as colonoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your provider about how often you need screening and what type of test you should get.\n\n**How is colorectal cancer diagnosed?**\n\nIf you have symptoms that could be caused by colorectal cancer or if your screening test results are abnormal, you may need to have more tests to find out if you have cancer. Possible tests include:\n\nA physical exam.\nA digital rectal exam. For this exam, your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps or anything unusual.\nThe tests that are also used for screening (colonoscopy, stool tests, etc.) and biopsy, if you have not already had them.\nOther blood and tissue tests.\n\n**What are the treatments for colorectal cancer?**\n\nYour treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, how serious the cancer is, and which type of cancer you have.\n\nFor colon cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:\n\nSurgery.\nRadiofrequency ablation, a procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells. The radio waves travel through electrodes (small devices that carry electricity).\nCryosurgery, a procedure in which an extremely cold liquid or an instrument called a cryoprobe is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue.\nChemotherapy.\nRadiation therapy.\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells.\nImmunotherapy.\n\nFor rectal cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:\n\nSurgery.\nRadiation therapy.\nChemotherapy.\nActive surveillance, which means having regular tests to see if your rectal cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer.\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells.\nImmunotherapy.\n\n**Can colorectal cancer be prevented?**\n\nAvoiding the risk factors that you have control over may help prevent some cancers.

    "content": "**Colorectal Cancer**\n\nColorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). It is also sometimes simply called colon cancer.\n\nIn the United States, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths due to cancer. Early diagnosis can often lead to a complete cure.\n\n**Causes**\n\nNearly all colorectal cancers begin as noncancerous (benign) lumps (polyps) in the lining of the colon and rectum. These can slowly develop into cancer.\n\nYou have a higher risk for colorectal cancer if you:\n\n* Are age 45 or older\n* Drink alcohol\n* Smoke tobacco\n* Are overweight or have obesity\n* Are African American or of eastern European descent\n* Eat a lot of red or processed meats\n* Eat a low-fiber and high-fat diet\n* Have a diet low in fruits and vegetables\n* Have colorectal polyps\n* Have inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis)\n* Have a family history of colorectal cancer\n\nSome inherited diseases also increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. One of the most common is called Lynch syndrome.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany cases of colon cancer have no symptoms. If there are symptoms, the following may indicate colon cancer:\n\n* Abdominal pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen\n* Blood in the stool\n* Diarrhea, constipation, or other change in bowel habits\n* Narrow stools\n* Weight loss with no known reason\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThrough screening tests, colon cancer can be detected before symptoms develop. This is when the cancer is most curable. Abnormal stool screening tests should be followed up with a colonoscopy, which can see the entire colon.\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and press on your belly area. The physical exam rarely shows any problems, although your provider may feel a lump (mass) in the abdomen. A rectal exam may reveal a mass in people with rectal cancer, but not colon cancer.\n\nBlood tests may be done for those diagnosed with colorectal cancer, including:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia\n* Liver function tests\n\nIf you are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, more tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called staging. CT or MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvic area, or chest may be used to stage the cancer. Sometimes, PET scans are also used.\n\n**Stages of Colorectal Cancer**\n\nThe stages of colorectal cancer are:\n\n* Stage 0: Cancer is only on the innermost layer of the lining of the intestine\n* Stage I: Cancer is in the inner layers of the colon\n* Stage II: Cancer has spread through the muscle wall of the colon\n* Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\n* Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other organs, such as the liver or lungs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:\n\n* Endoscopic surgery (less invasive surgery using a lighted, flexible tube)\n* Surgery\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Immunotherapy\n* Targeted therapy\n\n**Surgery**\n\nStage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor using endoscopic surgery (colonoscopy). For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove all or part of the colon and rectum that is cancerous. This surgery is called colon resection (colectomy).\n\n**Chemotherapy**\n\nChemotherapy involves taking medicines that kill cancer cells. You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.\n\nMost people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 3 to 6 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may remain.\n\nChemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.\n\n**Immunotherapy**\n\nImmunotherapy involves taking medicines that increase the ability of your own immune system to destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy has different side effects than chemotherapy.\n\n**Radiation Therapy**\n\nRadiation therapy involves using radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is often used in the treatment of rectal cancer.\n\n**Targeted Therapy**\n\nTargeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.\n\n**Cancer in the Liver**\n\nFor people with stage IV disease that has spread to the liver, treatment can be directed at the cancer tumors in the liver. This may include:\n\n* Burning the liver tumors (ablation)\n* Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly into the liver\n* Freezing the liver tumors (cryotherapy)\n* Surgery\n* Radioactive beads/spheres that deliver treatment to kill the cancer cells\n* Alcohol (ethanol) injected into the liver tumors to kill cancer cells\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of the disease by joining a colon cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith treatment, stages 0, I, II, and III cancers often are cured, although higher stages of cancer are less likely to be cured. In most cases, stage IV cancer is not curable, but there are exceptions, including sometimes when the spread of the cancer is limited to the liver.\n\nCancer treatment can cause problems such as:\n\n* Bowel obstruction from surgical scarring\n* Many sorts of short- and long-term side effects from chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, and therapy targeted to the liver\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Blockage of the colon, causing bowel obstruction\n* Cancer returning in the colon\n* Cancer spreading to other organs or tissues (metastasis)\n* Development of a second primary colorectal cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Black, tar-like stools\n* Blood during a bowel movement\n* Change in bowel habits\n* Unexplained weight loss\n\n**Prevention**\n\nColon cancer can almost always be caught by colonoscopy in early stages, when it is most curable. All adults age 45 and older should have a colon cancer screening. How often you should have screening depends upon the test being used.\n\nColon cancer screening can often find polyps before they become cancerous. Removing these polyps may prevent colon cancer.\n\nPeople with certain risk factors for colon cancer may need earlier testing (before age 45) or more frequent testing.\n\nA healthy lifestyle also may help reduce your risk for colon cancer:\n\n* Get regular physical activity.\n* Don't smoke or use tobacco.\n* Maintain a healthy weight.\n* Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats.\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Cancer**\n\nColorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). It is also sometimes simply called colon cancer.\n\n**Causes**\n\nNearly all colorectal cancers begin as noncancerous (benign) lumps (polyps) in the lining of the colon and rectum. These can slowly develop into cancer.\n\nYou have a higher risk for colorectal cancer if you:\n\n* Are age 45 or older\n* Drink alcohol\n* Smoke tobacco\n* Are overweight or have obesity\n* Are African American or of eastern European descent\n* Eat a lot of red or processed meats\n* Eat a low-fiber and high-fat diet\n* Have a diet low in fruits and vegetables\n* Have colorectal polyps\n* Have inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis)\n* Have a family history of colorectal cancer\n\nSome inherited diseases also increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. One of the most common is called Lynch syndrome.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany cases of colon cancer have no symptoms. If there are symptoms, the following may indicate colon cancer:\n\n* Abdominal pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen\n* Blood in the stool\n* Diarrhea, constipation, or other change in bowel habits\n* Narrow stools\n* Weight loss with no known reason\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThrough screening tests, colon cancer can be detected before symptoms develop. This is when the cancer is most curable. Abnormal stool screening tests should be followed up with a colonoscopy, which can see the entire colon.\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and press on your belly area. The physical exam rarely shows any problems, although your provider may feel a lump (mass) in the abdomen. A rectal exam may reveal a mass in people with rectal cancer, but not colon cancer.\n\nBlood tests may be done for those diagnosed with colorectal cancer, including:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia\n* Liver function tests\n\nIf you are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, more tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called staging. CT or MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvic area, or chest may be used to stage the cancer. Sometimes, PET scans are also used.\n\n**Stages of Colorectal Cancer**\n\nBlood tests to detect tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) may help your provider monitor your progress during and after treatment.\n\nThe stages of colorectal cancer are:\n\n* Stage 0: Cancer is only on the innermost layer of the lining of the intestine\n* Stage I: Cancer is in the inner layers of the colon\n* Stage II: Cancer has spread through the muscle wall of the colon\n* Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\n* Stage IV: Cancer spread to other organs, such as the liver or lungs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:\n\n* Endoscopic surgery (less invasive surgery using a lighted, flexible tube)\n* Surgery\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Immunotherapy\n* Targeted therapy\n\nSURGERY\n\nStage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor using endoscopic surgery (colonoscopy). For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove all or part of the colon and rectum that is cancerous. This surgery is called colon resection (colectomy).\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY\n\nChemotherapy involves taking medicines that kill cancer cells. You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.\n\nMost people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 3 to 6 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may remain.\n\nChemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY\n\nImmunotherapy involves taking medicines that increase the ability of your own immune system to destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy has different side effects than chemotherapy.\n\nRADIATION\n\nRadiation therapy involves using radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is often used in the treatment of rectal cancer.\n\nTARGETED THERAPY\n\nTargeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.\nYou may have targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment.\n\nCANCER IN THE LIVER\n\nFor people with stage IV disease that has spread to the liver, treatment can be directed at the cancer tumors in the liver. This may include:\n\n* Burning the liver tumors (ablation)\n* Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly into the liver\n* Freezing the liver tumors (cryotherapy)\n* Surgery\n* Radioactive beads/spheres that deliver treatment to kill the cancer cells\n* Alcohol (ethanol) injected into the liver tumors to kill cancer cells\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of the disease by joining a colon cancer support group.

The statement, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, recommends that adults aged 50-75 undergo regular screening for colorectal cancer using one or more of the following methods: fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography colonography (CTC), or virtual colonoscopy. The choice of screening method depends on individual patient factors and preferences.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Reducing Risk for Colorectal Cancer**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidance on reducing the risk of colorectal cancer through lifestyle changes and regular screening. According to the CDC, individuals can reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, limiting alcohol consumption, and not smoking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Colonic Polyps and Polyposis Syndromes**\n\nColonic polyps are growths on the inner lining of the colon that can be benign or cancerous. According to Garber and Chung, colonic polyps can be classified into three main types: adenomatous polyps, hyperplastic polyps, and inflammatory polyps. Adenomatous polyps have the potential to develop into colorectal cancer if left untreated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Colorectal Cancer**\n\nLawler et al. provide an overview of colorectal cancer, including its definition, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the large intestine (colon) or rectum. The exact cause of colorectal cancer is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Prevention**\n\nThe National Cancer Institute provides information on preventing colorectal cancer through early detection and treatment. According to the NCI, regular screening for colorectal cancer can detect precancerous polyps before they develop into cancer. Early detection and removal of these polyps can prevent the development of colorectal cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Screening**\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network provides guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50-75.

There are many types of polyps.\n\n* **Adenomatous Polyps**: A common type, gland-like growths that develop on the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine.\n\t+ Tubular polyp: protrudes out in the lumen (open space) of the colon\n\t+ Villous adenoma: sometimes flat and spreading, more likely to become a cancer\n* **Hyperplastic Polyps**: Rarely, if ever, develop into cancer\n* **Serrated Polyps**: Less common, may develop into cancer over time\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n* Age\n* Family history of colon cancer or polyps\n* A type of polyp called villous adenoma\n\n**Inherited Disorders**\n\nA small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including:\n\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n* Gardner syndrome (a type of FAP)\n* Juvenile polyposis, a disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years old\n* Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestine\n* Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benign\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Polyps**\n\nA colorectal polyp is a growth on the lining of the colon or rectum.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPolyps of the colon and rectum are most often benign.

Risk factors include:\n\n* Age\n* Family history of colon cancer or polyps\n* A type of polyp called villous adenoma\n\nA small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including:\n\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n* Gardner syndrome (a type of FAP)\n* Juvenile polyposis, a disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years old\n* Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestine\n* Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benign\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Polyps**\n\nPolyps usually do not have symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:\n\n* Blood in the stools\n* Change in bowel habit\n* Fatigue caused by losing blood over time\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. A large polyp in the rectum may be felt during a rectal exam.\n\nMost polyps are found with the following tests:\n\n* Barium enema (rarely done)\n* Colonoscopy\n* Sigmoidoscopy\n* Stool test for hidden (occult) blood\n* Virtual colonoscopy\n* Stool DNA test\n* Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)\n\nColorectal polyps should be removed because some can develop into cancer. In most cases, the polyps may be removed during a colonoscopy.\n\nFor people with adenomatous polyps, new polyps can appear in the future. You should have a repeat colonoscopy, usually 1 to 10 years later, depending on:\n\n* Your age and general health\n* Number of polyps you had\n* Size and type of the polyps\n* Family history of polyps or cancer\n\nIn rare cases, when polyps are very likely to turn into cancer or too large to remove during colonoscopy, the provider will recommend a partial colectomy. This is surgery to remove part of the colon that has the polyps.\n\nThe outlook is excellent if the polyps are removed. Polyps that are not removed can develop into cancer over time.\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Blood in a bowel movement\n* Change in bowel habits\n\nTo reduce your risk of developing polyps:\n\n* Eat foods low in fat and eat more fruits, vegetables, and fiber.\n* Do not smoke and do not drink alcohol in excess.\n* Maintain a normal body weight.\n* Get regular exercise.\n\nYour provider can order a colonoscopy or other screening tests to help prevent colon cancer by finding and removing polyps before they become cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Colorectal Polyps**\n\n**What are colorectal polyps?**\n\nColorectal polyps are growths on the inside wall of the colon or rectum that can turn into cancer if left untreated. Removing these polyps before they become cancerous may reduce the chance of developing colon cancer, or at least help catch it in its most treatable stage.\n\n**Who should get screened?**\n\nAll adults should begin one of these tests at age 45.\n\n**How to reduce your risk of developing polyps:**\n\nYour provider can order a colonoscopy or other screening tests:\n\n*   Taking aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, or similar medicines may help reduce the risk for new polyps. Be aware that these medicines can have serious side effects if taken for a long time. Side effects include bleeding in the stomach or colon and heart disease. Talk with your provider before taking these medicines.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Intestinal polyps\n*   Polyps - colorectal\n*   Adenomatous polyps\n*   Hyperplastic polyps\n*   Villous adenomas\n*   Serrated polyp\n*   Serrated adenoma\n*   Precancerous polyps\n*   Colon cancer - polyps\n*   Bleeding - colorectal polyps\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

They can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.\n\n\\n\\n**Types of Colorectal Polyps**\n\nThere are three main types of colorectal polyps:\n\n*   **Benign polyps**: These polyps are not cancerous and do not increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n*   **Precancerous polyps**: These polyps have the potential to become cancerous if left untreated. They can be removed during a colonoscopy.\n*   **Cancerous polyps**: These polyps are already cancerous and require prompt treatment.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Colorectal Polyps**\n\nThe exact cause of colorectal polyps is unknown, but several factors may contribute to their development:\n\n*   Genetics: A family history of colorectal cancer or polyps may increase the risk.\n*   Diet: A diet high in fat and low in fiber may increase the risk.\n*   Age: The risk of developing colorectal polyps increases with age.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Colorectal Polyps**\n\nMost people with colorectal polyps do not experience any symptoms. However, some people may notice:\n\n*   Rectal bleeding\n*   Changes in bowel movements\n*   Abdominal pain\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Polyps**\n\nColorectal polyps are typically diagnosed during a colonoscopy. The treatment for colorectal polyps depends on the type and size of the polyp:\n\n*   Benign polyps: May be removed during a colonoscopy.\n*   Precancerous polyps: May be removed during a colonoscopy.\n*   Cancerous polyps: Require prompt surgical removal.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention of Colorectal Polyps**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent colorectal polyps, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle may reduce the risk:\n\n*   Eat a high-fiber diet\n*   Exercise regularly\n*   Maintain a healthy weight\n\n\\n\\n**Screening for Colorectal Cancer**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 45. Screening options include:\n\n*   Colonoscopy\n*   Fecal occult blood test (FOBT)\n*   Flexible sigmoidoscopy",

Stools moving through the intestine drain through the stoma into a bag attached to the skin of the abdomen._\n\n**Description**\n\nThe procedure is usually done after:\n\n* Bowel resection\n* Injury to the bowel\n\nThe colostomy may be short-term or permanent.\n\nColostomy is done while you are under general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). It may be done either with a large surgical cut in the abdomen or with a small camera and several small cuts (laparoscopy).\n\nFor the colostomy, one end of the healthy colon is brought out through an opening made in the abdomen wall, usually on the left side. The edges of bowel are stitched to the skin of opening. This opening is called a stoma. A bag called a stoma appliance is placed around the opening to allow stool to drain.\n\nYour colostomy may be short-term. If you have surgery on part of your large intestine, a colostomy allows the other part of your intestine to rest while you recover. Once your body has fully recovered from the first surgery, you will have another surgery to reattach the ends of the large intestine. This is usually done after 12 weeks.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nReasons a colostomy is done include:\n\n* Infection of the abdomen, such as perforated diverticulitis or an abscess.\n* Injury to the colon or rectum (for example, a gunshot wound).\n* Partial or complete blockage of the large bowel (intestinal obstruction).\n* Rectal or colon cancer.\n* Wounds or fistulas in the perineum. This is the area between the anus and vulva (women) or the anus and scrotum (men).\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of colostomy include:\n\n* Bleeding inside your belly\n* Damage to nearby organs\n* Development of a hernia at the site of the surgical cut\n* Bowel protrudes through the stoma more than it should (prolapse of the colostomy)\n* Narrowing or blockage of the colostomy opening (stoma)\n* Scar tissue forming in the belly and causing intestinal blockage\n* Skin irritation\n* Wound breaking open\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will be in the hospital for 3 to 7 days. You may have to stay longer if your colostomy was done as an emergency procedure.\n\nYou will be allowed to slowly go back to your normal diet:\n\n* The same day as your surgery, you may be able to suck on ice chips to ease your thirst.\n* By the next day, you will probably be allowed to drink clear liquids.\n* Thicker fluids and then soft foods will be added as your bowels begin to work again. You may be eating normally within 2 days after surgery.\n\nThe colostomy drains stool (feces) from the colon into the colostomy bag. Colostomy stool is often softer and more liquid than stool that is passed normally. The texture of stool depends on which part of the intestine was used to form the colostomy.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBefore you are released from the hospital, an ostomy nurse will teach you about diet and how to care for your colostomy.\n\n---\n\n**Colostomy**\n\nColostomy is a surgical procedure that brings one end of the large intestine out through an opening (stoma) made in the abdominal wall.

    "content": "**Colposcopy - Directed Biopsy**\n\nA colposcopy is a special way of looking at the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of your cervix are called cervical dysplasia.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups to position your pelvis for the exam. The provider will place an instrument (called a speculum) into your vagina to see the cervix clearly.\n\nThe cervix and vagina are gently cleaned with a vinegar or iodine solution, which removes the mucus that covers the surface and highlights abnormal areas.\n\nThe provider will place the colposcope at the opening of your vagina and examine the area. Photographs may be taken. The colposcope does not touch you.\n\nIf any areas look abnormal, a small sample of tissue will be removed using small biopsy tools. Several samples may be taken. Sometimes a tissue sample from inside the cervix is removed, which is called endocervical curettage (ECC).\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed. You may be more comfortable if you empty your bladder and bowel before the procedure.\n\nBefore the exam:\n\n* Do not douche.\n* Do not place any products into the vagina.\n* Do not have sex for 24 hours before the exam.\n* Tell your provider if you are pregnant or could be pregnant.\n\nThis test should not be done during a heavy period, unless it is abnormal. Keep your appointment if you are at the very end or beginning of your regular period or having abnormal bleeding.\n\nYou may be able to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) before the colposcopy. Ask your provider if this is OK and when and how much you should take.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may have some discomfort when the speculum is placed inside your vagina. It may be more uncomfortable than a regular Pap test.\n\nSome women feel a slight sting from the cleansing solution.\nYou may feel a pinch or cramp each time a tissue sample is taken.\nYou may have some cramping or slight bleeding after the biopsy.\nDo not use tampons or put anything in your vagina for several days after a biopsy.\n\nSome women may hold their breath during pelvic procedures because they expect pain. Slow, regular breathing will help you relax and relieve pain. Ask your provider about bringing a support person with you if that will help.\n\nYou may have some bleeding after the biopsy, for about 2 days.\n\nYou should not douche, place tampons or creams into your vagina, or have sex for up to a week afterward. Ask your provider how long you should wait.\nYou can use sanitary pads.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nColposcopy is done to detect cervical cancer and changes that may lead to cervical cancer.\n\nIt is most often done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear or HPV test. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.\n\nColposcopy may also be done when your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a pelvic exam. These may include:\n\n* Any abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina\n* Genital warts or HPV\n* Irritation or inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)\n\nThe colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV, and to look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA smooth, pink surface of the cervix is normal.\n\nA specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue sample from the cervical biopsy and send a report to your provider. Biopsy results most often take 1 to 2 weeks. A normal result means there is no cancer and no abnormal changes were seen.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nYour provider should be able to tell you if anything abnormal was seen during the test, including:\n\n* Abnormal patterns in the blood vessels\n* Areas that are swollen, worn away, or wasted away (atrophic)\n* Cervical polyps\n* Genital warts\n* Whitish patches on the cervix\n\nAbnormal biopsy results may be due to changes that can lead to cervical cancer. These changes are called dysplasia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).\n\nCIN I is mild dysplasia\nCIN II is moderate dysplasia\nCIN III is severe dysplasia or very early cervical cancer called carcinoma in situ\n\nAbnormal biopsy results may be due to:\n\n* Cervical cancer\n* Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) -- precancerous tissue changes that are also called cervical dysplasia\n* Cervical warts (infection with human papilloma virus, or HPV)\n\nIf the biopsy does not determine the cause of abnormal results, you may need a procedure called a cold knife cone biopsy.\n\n**Risks**\n\nAfter the biopsy, you may have some bleeding for up to a week. You may have mild cramping, your vagina may feel sore, and you may have a dark discharge for 1 to 3 days.\n\nA colposcopy and biopsy will not make it more difficult for you to become pregnant, or cause problems during pregnancy.\n\nContact your provider right away if:\n\n* Bleeding is very heavy or lasts for longer than 2 weeks.\n* You have pain in your belly or in the pelvic area.\n* You notice any signs of infection (fever, foul odor, or discharge).\n\n---\n\n**Colposcopy - Directed Biopsy**\n\nA colposcopy is a special way of looking at the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of your cervix is called cervical dysplasia.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nColposcopy uses a light and a low-powered microscope to make the cervix appear much larger. This helps your health care provider find and then biopsy abnormal areas in your cervix.\n\nYou will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups, to position your pelvis for exam.

The colposcope does not touch you.\n\nIf any areas look abnormal, a small sample of the tissue will be removed using small biopsy tools. Several samples may be taken. Sometimes a tissue sample from inside the cervix is removed. This is called endocervical curettage (ECC).\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation. You may be more comfortable if you empty your bladder and bowel before the procedure.\n\nBefore the exam:\n\n* Do not douche (this is never recommended).\n* Do not place any products into the vagina.\n* Do not have sex for 24 hours before the exam.\n* Tell your provider if you are pregnant or could be pregnant.\n\nThis test should not be done during a heavy period, unless it is abnormal. Keep your appointment if you are:\n\n* At the very end or beginning of your regular period\n* Having abnormal bleeding\n\nYou may be able to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) before the colposcopy. Ask your provider if this is OK, and when and how much you should take.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may have some discomfort when the speculum is placed inside your vagina. It may be more uncomfortable than a regular Pap test.\n\nSome women feel a slight sting from the cleansing solution.\nYou may feel a pinch or cramp each time a tissue sample is taken.\nYou may have some cramping or slight bleeding after the biopsy.\nDo not use tampons or put anything in your vagina for several days after a biopsy.\n\nSome women may hold their breath during pelvic procedures because they expect pain. Slow, regular breathing will help you relax and relieve pain. Ask your provider about bringing a support person with you if that will help.\n\nYou may have some bleeding after the biopsy, for about 2 days.\n\nYou should not douche, place tampons or creams into your vagina, or have sex for up to a week afterward. Ask your provider how long you should wait.\nYou can use sanitary pads.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nColposcopy is done to detect cervical cancer and changes that may lead to cervical cancer.\n\nIt is most often done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear or HPV test. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.\n\nColposcopy may also be done when your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a pelvic exam. These may include:\n\n* Any abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina\n* Genital warts or HPV\n* Irritation or inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)\n\nThe colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV, and to look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Colposcopy - Directed Biopsy**\n\n**What is a colposcopy?**\n\nA colposcopy is a procedure used to examine the cervix for abnormal cell growth. During a pelvic exam, your provider may notice abnormalities on your cervix, such as:\n\n* Any abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina\n* Genital warts or HPV\n* Irritation or inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)\n\nThe colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV and look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment.\n\n**When is a colposcopy done?**\n\nA colposcopy is usually done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear or HPV test. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.\n\n**What happens during a colposcopy?**\n\nDuring the procedure, your provider will use a special microscope to examine your cervix for any abnormalities. If any areas of concern are found, a biopsy may be performed to collect a tissue sample for further examination.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means there is no cancer and no abnormal changes were seen. A specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue sample from the cervical biopsy and send a report to your provider. Biopsy results most often take 1 to 2 weeks.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nYour provider should be able to tell you if anything abnormal was seen during the test, including:\n\n* Abnormal patterns in the blood vessels\n* Areas that are swollen, worn away, or wasted away (atrophic)\n* Cervical polyps\n* Genital warts\n* Whitish patches on the cervix\n\nAbnormal biopsy results may be due to changes that can lead to cervical cancer. These changes are called dysplasia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).\n\n**Risks**\n\nAfter the biopsy, you may have some bleeding for up to a week. You may have mild cramping, your vagina may feel sore, and you may have a dark discharge for 1 to 3 days.\n\nA colposcopy and biopsy will not make it more difficult for you to become pregnant, or cause problems during pregnancy.\n\n**Contact Your Provider**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your provider right away:\n\n* Bleeding is very heavy or lasts for longer than 2 weeks.\n* You have pain in your belly or in the pelvic area.\n* You notice any signs of infection (fever, foul odor, or discharge).\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nColposcopy - directed biopsy; Biopsy - cervix - colposcopy; Endocervical curettage; ECC; Cervical punch biopsy; Biopsy - cervical punch; Cervical biopsy; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - colposcopy; CIN - colposcopy; Precancerous changes of the cervix - colposcopy; Cervical cancer - colposcopy; Squamous intraepithelial lesion - colposcopy; LSIL - colposcopy; HSIL - colposcopy; Low-grade colposcopy; High-grade colposcopy; Carcinoma in situ - colposcopy; CIS - colposcopy; ASCUS - colposcopy; Atypical glandular cells - colposcopy; AGUS - colposcopy; Atypical squamous cells - colposcopy; Pap smear - colposcopy; HPV - colposcopy; Human papilloma virus - colposcopy; Cervix - colposcopy; Colposcopy\n\n---\n\n**Reproductive Anatomy**\n\n*   **Colposcopy-Directed Biopsy**\n    A colposcopy-directed biopsy is a procedure used to diagnose abnormal cell changes on the cervix.

    "content": "**Colposcopy**\n\nA colposcopy is a procedure to examine your cervix, vagina, and vulva:\n\n*   The vagina connects your womb (uterus) and cervix to the outside of your body.\n*   The cervix is the lower part of your uterus (the uterus is the place where a baby grows during pregnancy).\n*   The vulva includes your genital parts that are outside your body.\n\nDuring the procedure, your health care provider will be looking for abnormal cells, which could be cancer or precancer. Precancer means that the cells could turn into cancer over time.\n\nTo do the procedure, your provider will use a lighted, magnifying device called a colposcope. They will place the device at the opening of your vagina. The device magnifies the normal view, allowing your provider to see problems that can't be seen by the eyes alone.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA colposcopy is most often used to find abnormal cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva. It may also be used to:\n\n*   Check for genital warts, which may be a sign of an HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Having HPV may put you at higher risk for developing cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.\n*   Look for noncancerous growths called polyps.\n*   Check for irritation or inflammation of the cervix.\n*   Check for the cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding or vulvar itching.\n\n**Why do I need a colposcopy?**\n\nYou may need this test if you had abnormal results on a Pap smear. A Pap smear is a test that involves collecting a sample of cells from the cervix. It can show if there are abnormal cells but can't provide a diagnosis. A colposcopy provides a more detailed look at the cells. It may help your provider confirm a diagnosis and/or find other potential problems. It could allow your provider to find precancer cells early enough that they can be treated and might not turn into cancer.\n\nYou may also need this test if you have:\n\n*   Been diagnosed with HPV\n*   Abnormal areas on your cervix (which were seen during a routine pelvic exam)\n*   Bleeding after sex\n\n**What happens during a colposcopy?**\n\nA colposcopy may be done by your primary care provider or a gynecologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases of the female reproductive system. The test is usually done in the provider's office and takes 10 to 20 minutes. If the provider finds abnormal tissue, you may also get a biopsy. which may take about 10 minutes longer.\n\nDuring a colposcopy:\n\n*   You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.\n*   You will lie on your back on an exam table with your feet in stirrups.\n*   Your provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina. A speculum is the same instrument used in a Pap smear. It is used to spread open your vaginal walls so that your cervix is visible.\n*   Your provider will place the colposcope outside your vagina.\n*   Your provider will shine a light into your vagina and look through the colposcope, which provides a magnified view of the cervix, vagina, and vulva.\n*   Your provider will gently swab your cervix and vagina with a vinegar or iodine solution. The solution makes abnormal tissues easier to see.\n*   If any areas of tissue look abnormal, your provider may perform a cervical, vaginal, or vulvar biopsy.\n\nDuring a biopsy:\n\n*   A vaginal biopsy may cause mild to moderate pain, and your provider may recommend you take an over-the-counter pain reliever before the procedure or give you medicine to numb the area.\n*   Once the area is numb, your provider will use a small tool to remove a tissue sample for testing. Sometimes, many samples are taken.\n*   Your provider may also do a procedure called an endocervical curettage (ECC). This procedure involves taking a tissue sample from the inside of the opening of the cervix. This area can't be seen during a colposcopy. An ECC is done with a special tool called a curette. You may feel a pinch or cramp as the tissue is removed.\n*   Your provider may apply a topical medicine to the biopsy site to treat any bleeding you may have.\n\nAfter a biopsy, you should not douche, use tampons, or have sex for a week after your procedure or for as long as your provider advises.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nDo not douche, use tampons or vaginal medicines, or have any kind of vaginal penetration for 48 hours before the test. Also, it's best to schedule your colposcopy when you are not having your menstrual period. Your provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever before your appointment.\n\nTell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Colposcopy is generally safe during pregnancy, but being pregnant raises your risk of bleeding after a biopsy.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a colposcopy. You may have some discomfort when the speculum is inserted into the vagina, and the vinegar or iodine solution may sting, tingle, or burn.\n\nA biopsy is also a safe procedure. You may feel a pinch or some pain when the tissue sample is taken. After the procedure, you may be sore for a day or two. You may have some cramping and slight bleeding. It's normal to have a little bleeding and discharge for up to a week after the biopsy.\n\nSerious complications from a biopsy are rare, but call your provider if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n*   Heavy bleeding\n*   Abdominal (belly) pain\n*   Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and/or bad smelling vaginal discharge\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nDuring your colposcopy, your provider may find one or more of the following conditions:\n\n*   Genital warts\n*   Polyps\n*   Swelling or irritation of the cervix\n*   Abnormal tissue\n\nIf your provider also performed a biopsy, your results may show you have:\n\n*   Precancerous cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva\n*   An HPV infection\n*   Cancer of the cervix, vagina, or vulva\n\nIf your biopsy results were normal, it's unlikely that you have cells in your cervix, vagina, or vulva that are at risk for turning into cancer. But that can change. So, your provider may want to monitor you for cell changes with more frequent Pap smears and/or additional colposcopies.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a colposcopy?**\n\nIf your results show that you have precancerous cells, you may need to have a procedure to remove them. This may prevent them from developing into cancer.\n\nIf your results show that you have cancer, you may be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. This is a provider who specializes in treating cancers of the female reproductive system.\n\n---\n\n**Colposcopy: A Procedure to Examine Your Cervix, Vagina, and Vulva**\n\nA colposcopy is a procedure used to examine your cervix, vagina, and vulva for abnormal cells that could be cancer or precancer.

    "content": "**Common Cold**\n\nThe common cold is a mild infection of your upper respiratory tract (which includes your nose and throat). Colds are probably the most common illness. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more. Colds are more common in the winter and spring, but you can get them at any time.\n\n**What causes the common cold?**\n\nMore than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type. The viruses that cause colds are very contagious. They can spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected when you touch something that has the virus on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.\n\n**What are the symptoms of the common cold?**\n\nThe symptoms of a common cold usually include:\n\n* Sneezing\n* Stuffy nose (congestion)\n* Runny nose\n* Sore throat\n* Coughing\n* Headache\n\nSome symptoms can last for 10-14 days.\n\n**What are the treatments for the common cold?**\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold. But there are treatments that can make you feel better while you wait for the cold to go away on its own:\n\n* Getting lots of rest.\n* Drinking plenty of fluids.\n* Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.\n* Gargling with warm salt water.\n* Using saline nose drops or sprays.\n* Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines. But you need to be careful with certain medicines:\n\t+ Children and teens should not take aspirin.\n\t+ Some cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines.\n\t+ Some cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers. If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever.\n\nAntibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds.\n\n**Can the common cold be prevented?**\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by:\n\n* Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n* Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n* Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick.\n* Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch.\n* Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue.

If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever.\n\nAntibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by:\n\n* Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n* Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n* Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick.\n* Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch.\n* Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands.\n* Staying home when sick.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nThe common cold is a mild infection of your upper respiratory tract, which includes your nose and throat. Colds are probably the most common illness. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more. Colds are more common in the winter and spring, but you can get them at any time.\n\nMore than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type.

Some symptoms can last for 10-14 days.\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold.

    "content": "**Common Cold**\n\nThe common cold most often causes a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. You may also have a sore throat, cough, headache, or other symptoms.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIt is called the common cold for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness.\n\nColds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children.\n\nChildren can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares.\n\nColds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.\n\nA cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.\n\nYou can catch a cold if:\n\n* A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you\n* You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob\n\nPeople are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is most often not contagious after the first week.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCold symptoms usually start about 2 or 3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose.\n\nThe most common cold symptoms are:\n\n* Nasal congestion\n* Runny nose\n* Scratchy throat\n* Sneezing\n\nAdults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever. Young children often run a fever around 100°F to 102°F (37.7°C to 38.8°C).\n\nDepending on which virus caused your cold, you may also have:\n\n* Cough\n* Decreased appetite\n* Headache\n* Muscle aches\n* Postnasal drip\n* Sore throat\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost colds go away in a few days. Some things you can do to take care of yourself with a cold include:\n\n* Get plenty of rest and drink fluids.\n* Over-the-counter (OTC) cold and cough medicines may help ease symptoms in adults and older children. They do not make your cold go away faster, but can help you feel better. These OTC medicines are not recommended for children under age 4.\n* Antibiotics should not be used to treat a common cold.\n* Many alternative treatments have been tried for colds, such as vitamin C, zinc supplements, and echinacea. Talk to your health care provider before trying any herbs or supplements.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe fluid from your runny nose will become thicker over time. It may turn yellow or green within a few days. This is normal, and not a reason for antibiotics.\n\nMost cold symptoms go away within a week in most cases. If you still feel sick after 7 days, consult with your provider. Your provider may check you for a sinus infection, allergies, or other medical problem.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nColds are the most common trigger of wheezing in children with asthma.\n\nA cold may also lead to:\n\n* Bronchitis\n* Ear infection\n* Pneumonia\n* Sinusitis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nTry treating your cold at home first. Contact your provider if:\n\n* You have problems breathing.\n* Your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 7 to 10 days.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo lower your chances of getting sick:\n\n* Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.\n* Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.\n* Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.\n* Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol to stop the spread of germs.\n* Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.\n\nThe immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:\n\n* Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.\n* DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.\n* Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.\n* Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.\n* Eat yogurt that contains \"active cultures.\" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.\n* Get enough sleep.\n\n---\n\n**The Common Cold**\n\nIt is called the common cold for good reason.

It is one of the most frequent illnesses in humans, and people can get it multiple times a year.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCold symptoms usually start about 2 or 3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose.\n\n* Adults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever. Young children often run a fever around 100°F to 102°F (37.7°C to 38.8°C).\n* Depending on which virus caused your cold, you may also have:\n\t+ Cough\n\t+ Decreased appetite\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Muscle aches\n\t+ Postnasal drip\n\t+ Sore throat\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost colds go away in a few days. Some things you can do to take care of yourself with a cold include:\n\n* Get plenty of rest and drink fluids.\n* Over-the-counter (OTC) cold and cough medicines may help ease symptoms in adults and older children. They do not make your cold go away faster, but can help you feel better. These OTC medicines are not recommended for children under age 4.\n* Antibiotics should not be used to treat a common cold.\n* Many alternative treatments have been tried for colds, such as vitamin C, zinc supplements, and echinacea. Talk to your health care provider before trying any herbs or supplements.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe fluid from your runny nose will become thicker over time. It may turn yellow or green within a few days. This is normal, and not a reason for antibiotics.\n\nMost cold symptoms go away within a week in most cases. If you still feel sick after 7 days, consult with your provider. Your provider may check you for a sinus infection, allergies, or other medical problem.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nColds are the most common trigger of wheezing in children with asthma.\n\nA cold may also lead to:\n\n* Bronchitis\n* Ear infection\n* Pneumonia\n* Sinusitis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nTry treating your cold at home first. Contact your provider if:\n\n* You have problems breathing.\n* Your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 7 to 10 days.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo lower your chances of getting sick:\n\n* Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.\n* Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.\n* Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.\n* Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol to stop the spread of germs.\n* Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.\n\nThe immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:\n\n* Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.\n* DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.\n* Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.\n* Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.\n* Eat yogurt that contains \"active cultures.\" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.\n* Get enough sleep.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nUpper respiratory infection - viral; Cold\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nAllergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - adult\nAllergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - child\nColds and the flu - what to ask your doctor - adult\nColds and the flu - what to ask your doctor - child\n\n**Images**\n\nThroat anatomy\nCold symptoms\nAntibodies\nCold remedies\n\n**References**\n\nBarrett B.

It is one of the most frequent illnesses in humans, with an average person experiencing 2-4 colds per year.\n\n**Causes and Transmission**\n\nThe common cold is caused by viruses, specifically rhinoviruses, which are highly contagious. These viruses can spread through:\n\n* Direct contact with an infected person\n* Touching surfaces or objects that have come into contact with the virus\n* Airborne transmission through coughing and sneezing\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a common cold typically develop within 1-3 days after exposure to the virus. They may include:\n\n* Runny nose\n* Stuffy nose\n* Sneezing\n* Coughing\n* Sore throat\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Muscle aches\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold, but there are ways to manage its symptoms. Over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers, decongestants, and cough suppressants can help alleviate symptoms.\n\nPrevention is key in avoiding the common cold. Some measures include:\n\n* Practicing good hygiene (washing hands frequently)\n* Avoiding close contact with people who are sick\n* Staying away from crowded areas during peak cold seasons\n* Getting enough sleep and maintaining a healthy diet\n\n**References**\n\nBarrett B, Turner RB.

    "content": "**Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**What is it?**\nCommon peroneal nerve dysfunction is due to damage to the peroneal nerve leading to loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg. This condition is also called common fibular nerve dysfunction.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot, and toes. Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord). This condition can affect people of any age.\n\nCommon causes of damage to the common peroneal nerve include:\n\n* Trauma or injury to the knee\n* Fracture of the fibula (a bone of the lower leg)\n* Use of a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg\n* Crossing the legs regularly\n* Regularly wearing high boots\n* Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma\n* Injury during knee surgery or from being placed in an awkward position during anesthesia\n\nCommon peroneal nerve injury is often seen in people:\n\n* Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa)\n* Who have certain autoimmune conditions, such as polyarteritis nodosa\n* Who have nerve damage from other medical problems, such as diabetes, excess alcohol use, or inherited nerve disorders\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen the nerve is injured and results in dysfunction, symptoms may include:\n\n* Decreased sensation, numbness, or tingling in the top of the foot or the outer part of the upper or lower leg\n* Foot that drops (unable to hold the foot up)\n* \"Slapping\" gait (walking pattern in which each step makes a slapping noise)\n* Toes drag while walking\n* Walking problems\n* Weakness of the ankles or feet\n* Loss of muscle mass because the nerves aren't stimulating the muscles\n\n---\n\n**Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve, supplying movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot, and toes. Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord), affecting people of any age.\n\nThis condition is a type of mononeuropathy, where nerve damage occurs to a single nerve. Certain body-wide conditions can also cause single nerve injuries.\n\nDamage to the nerve disrupts the myelin sheath that covers the axon (branch of the nerve cell). The axon can also be injured, resulting in more severe symptoms.\n\nCommon causes of damage to the common peroneal nerve include:\n\n*   Trauma or injury to the knee\n*   Fracture of the fibula (a bone of the lower leg)\n*   Use of a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg\n*   Crossing the legs regularly\n*   Regularly wearing high boots\n*   Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma\n*   Injury during knee surgery or from being placed in an awkward position during anesthesia\n\nCommon peroneal nerve injury is often seen in people:\n\n*   Who are very thin (e.g., from anorexia nervosa)\n*   Who have certain autoimmune conditions, such as polyarteritis nodosa\n*   Who have nerve damage from other medical problems, such as diabetes, excess alcohol use, or inherited nerve disorders\n\n---\n\n**Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**What is Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction?**\n\nCommon peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord) that affects the lower leg, foot, and toes. It is caused by damage to the common peroneal nerve, which supplies movement and sensation to these areas.\n\n**Causes of Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nCommon causes of damage to the common peroneal nerve include:\n\n*   **Injury during deep sleep or coma**: The knee can be bent in an awkward position, causing pressure on the nerve.\n*   **Injury during knee surgery**: The nerve can be damaged during surgery.\n*   **Being placed in an awkward position during anesthesia**: Similar to injury during deep sleep or coma.\n\n**Who is at Risk?**\n\nCommon peroneal nerve injury is often seen in people:\n\n*   Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa)\n*   Who have certain autoimmune conditions, such as polyarteritis nodosa\n*   Who have nerve damage from other medical problems, such as diabetes, excess alcohol use, or inherited nerve disorders\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen the nerve is injured and results in dysfunction, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Decreased sensation, numbness, or tingling in the top of the foot or the outer part of the upper or lower leg\n*   Foot that drops (unable to hold the foot up)\n*   \"Slapping\" gait (walking pattern in which each step makes a slapping noise)\n*   Toes drag while walking\n*   Walking problems\n*   Weakness of the ankles or feet\n*   Loss of muscle mass because the nerves aren't stimulating the muscles\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may show:\n\n*   Loss of muscle control in the lower legs and feet\n*   Atrophy (thinning or loss) of the foot or foreleg muscles\n*   Difficulty lifting up the foot and toes and making toe-out movements\n\nTests of nerve activity include:\n\n*   Electromyography (EMG), a test of electrical activity in muscles)\n*   Nerve conduction tests (to see how fast electrical signals move through a nerve)\n*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n*   Nerve ultrasound\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment aims to improve mobility and independence. Any illness or other cause of the neuropathy should be treated.\n\nIn some cases, corticosteroids injected into the area may reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve.\n\nSurgery may help reduce symptoms in some cases. It may be needed:\n\n*   To relieve pressure on the nerve if the disorder is caused by pressure on the nerve\n*   To remove tumors pressing on the nerve\n\nYou may need surgery if:\n\n*   The disorder does not go away\n*   You have problems with movement\n*   There is evidence that the nerve axon is damaged\n\n**Controlling Symptoms**\n\nYou may need over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers to control pain. Other medicines that may be used to reduce pain include:\n\n*   Gabapentin\n*   Carbamazepine\n*   Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline\n\nIf your pain is severe, a pain specialist can help you explore all options for pain relief.\n\nPhysical therapy exercises may help you maintain muscle strength.\n\nOrthopedic devices may improve your ability to walk and prevent contractures. These may include:\n\n*   Braces\n*   Splints\n*   Orthopedic shoes or other equipment\n\nVocational counseling, occupational therapy, or similar programs may help you stay as mobile and independent as possible.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome depends on the cause of the problem. Successfully treating the cause may relieve the dysfunction, but it may take several months for the nerve to improve.\n\n---\n\n**Common Peroneal Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome depends on the cause of the problem. Successfully treating the cause may relieve the dysfunction, but it may take several months for the nerve to improve.\n\nSevere nerve damage may cause permanent disability. The nerve pain may be very uncomfortable. This disorder does not usually shorten a person's expected lifespan.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nProblems that may develop with this condition include:\n\n* Decreased ability to walk\n* Permanent decrease in sensation in the legs or feet\n* Permanent weakness or paralysis in the legs or feet\n* Side effects of medicines\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of common peroneal nerve dysfunction.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoid crossing your legs or putting long-term pressure on the back or side of the knee. Treat injuries to the leg or knee right away.\n\nIf a cast, splint, dressing, or other pressure on the lower leg causes a tight feeling or numbness, call your provider.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Common fibular nerve dysfunction\n* Neuropathy - common peroneal nerve\n* Peroneal nerve injury\n* Peroneal nerve palsy\n* Fibular neuropathy\n\n**References**\n\nKatirji B.
