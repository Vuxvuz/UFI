    "content": "**Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, including infections of the ears, lungs, sinus, skin, and urinary tract. Amoxicillin is in a class of medications called penicillin-like antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Clavulanic acid is in a class of medications called beta-lactamase inhibitors. It works by preventing bacteria from destroying amoxicillin.\n\n**Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal or snack every 8 hours (three times a day) or every 12 hours (twice a day). To help you remember to take amoxicillin and clavulanate, take it around the same times every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amoxicillin and clavulanic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.**\n\nThe chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly before they are swallowed.\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking the suspension, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use a properly marked measuring device such as a medicine spoon or oral syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you need help getting or using a measuring device.\n\nTake amoxicillin and clavulanic acid until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking amoxicillin and clavulanic too soon, or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n---\n\n**Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, penicillin, cephalosporins, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in amoxicillin and clavulanic acid tablet, chewable tablet, and oral suspension.

    "content": "**Amylase Test**\n\n**What is an Amylease Test?**\n\nAn amylase test measures the amount of amylase in your blood or urine (pee). Amylase is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up chemical reactions in your body. Amylase helps you digest carbohydrates. Most of the amylase in your body is made by your pancreas and salivary (spit) glands.\n\nIt's normal to have a small amount of amylase in your blood and urine. But having too much amylase may be a sign of a disorder of the pancreas or salivary glands or another medical condition.\n\n**Other Names:**\n\nAmy test, serum amylase, urine amylase\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nTests for amylase in blood or urine are mainly used to diagnose problems with your pancreas, including pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. The test is also used to monitor chronic (long-term) pancreatitis.\n\nChanges in amylase levels show up in blood before urine, so an amylase urine test may be done with or after an amylase blood test.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Amylease Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an amylase blood and/or urine test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder. Symptoms may begin suddenly or slowly. They may include:\n\n* Pain in your upper abdomen (belly) that may spread to your back, get worse after eating, or last for several days\n* Loss of appetite\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fever\n* Fast heartbeat\n* Jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow)\n* Greasy, foul-smelling stool (poop)\n\nYour provider may also order an amylase test to monitor an existing condition that affects your pancreas, including:\n\n* Chronic pancreatitis\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Eating disorders\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Recovery after having gallstones removed because of a gallbladder attack\n\n**What Happens During an Amylease Test?**\n\nFor an amylase blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor an amylase urine test, you will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n* Open the container without touching the inside.\n* Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n\t+ For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n\t+ For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n* Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n* Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n* Finish urinating into the toilet.\n* Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\n\nIf you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.\n\nYour provider may request that you collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. That's because the amount of amylase in urine can vary throughout the day. Collecting urine from an entire day can provide more accurate information about your amylase levels. For a 24-hour urine test, you will be given a container and specific instructions on how to collect your sample at home. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully.\n\nIn certain cases, your provider may order a test for amylase in peritoneal fluid. This fluid is found between the layers of tissue that line the inside of your abdomen (belly) and cover most of your organs. To get a sample, a health care professional will numb your skin and use a needle and tubing to draw some fluid into a container.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou should not drink alcohol for 24 hours before having an amylase blood or urine test. If you are having a blood test, your provider may also tell you to fast (not eat or drink) for two hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\nBe sure to tell your provider about any prescription or over-the-counter medicines you are taking because they may affect your test results. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. During a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is no known risk to having a urine test.\n\nIf you have a peritoneal fluid test, you may feel a little dizzy or lightheaded after the procedure. There is a small risk that the needle could damage your bowel or bladder, which may lead to bleeding or infection.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nHigh levels of amylase in blood or urine may be a sign of:\n\n* Acute (sudden) pancreatitis\n* A blockage in a duct (small tube) in the pancreas\n* Cancer or a benign (not cancerous) tumor of the pancreas\n\nHigh levels of amylase in peritoneal fluid may be a sign of:\n\n* Acute (sudden) pancreatitis\n* A blocked intestine\n* Lack of blood flow to the intestines\n\nLow levels of amylase in blood or urine are uncommon, but may be a sign of:\n\n* Chronic pancreatitis causing permanent damage to the cells that make amylase\n* Kidney disease\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* Liver disease\n* Pre-eclampsia (a type of high blood pressure in pregnancy)\n\nTo learn more about your results, talk with your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Amylase Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** health\n\nThe test is also used to monitor chronic (long-term) pancreatitis.\n\nChanges in amylase levels show up in blood before urine, so an amylase urine test may be done with or after an amylase blood test.\n\nOne or both types of amylase test may also be used to help diagnose or monitor treatment for other disorders that may affect amylase levels, such as salivary gland disorders and certain digestive conditions.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Amylase Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an amylase blood and/or urine test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder.

Amylase breaks down starches into sugars.\n\n**How is an amylase test performed?**\n\nThe test involves collecting a blood sample from a vein in your arm or a urine sample. The blood sample may be sent to a laboratory for testing, while the urine sample can be tested at home using a dipstick or mailed to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**What are the risks of an amylase test?**\n\nThere is a small risk that the needle could damage your bowel or bladder, which may lead to bleeding or infection.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nHigh levels of amylase in blood or urine may be a sign of:\n\n* Acute (sudden) pancreatitis\n* A blockage in a duct (small tube) in the pancreas\n* Cancer or a benign (not cancerous) tumor of the pancreas\n\nHigh levels of amylase in peritoneal fluid may be a sign of:\n\n* Acute (sudden) pancreatitis\n* A blocked intestine\n* Lack of blood flow to the intestines\n\nLow levels of amylase in blood or urine are uncommon, but may be a sign of:\n\n* Chronic pancreatitis causing permanent damage to the cells that make amylase\n* Kidney disease\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* Liver disease\n* Pre-eclampsia (a type of high blood pressure in pregnancy)\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an amylase test?**\n\nIf your provider suspects you have pancreatitis, they may order a lipase blood test, along with an amylase blood test. Lipase is another enzyme produced by the pancreas. Lipase tests are considered to be more accurate for diagnosing pancreatitis, especially when pancreatitis is caused by alcohol use disorder.\n\n**References**\n\n* Akinfemiwa O, Muniraj T. Amylase.

These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAt first, this causes mild muscle problems. Some people notice:\n\n* Trouble walking or running\n* Trouble writing\n* Speech problems\n\nEventually, you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail, you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help, but most people with ALS die from respiratory failure.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nThe disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families, but usually it strikes at random.\n\n**Living With ALS**\n\nThere is no cure.

It is also known as Lou Gehrig disease.\n\n**Causes**\n\nOne in 10 cases of ALS is due to a genetic variant. The cause is unknown in most other cases. In ALS, motor nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nHaving a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing.\n\nWeakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow.

The physical exam may show:\n\n* Weakness, often beginning in one area of the body\n* Muscle tremors, spasms, twitching, or loss of muscle tissue\n* Twitching of the tongue (common)\n* Abnormal reflexes\n* Stiff or clumsy walk\n* Decreased or increased reflexes at the joints\n* Difficulty controlling crying or laughing (sometimes called emotional incontinence)\n* Loss of gag reflex\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Blood tests to check for other conditions\n* Breathing test to see if lung muscles are affected\n* Cervical spine CT or MRI to be sure there is no disease or injury to the neck, which can mimic ALS\n* Electromyography (EMG) to see which nerves or muscles do not work properly\n* Genetic testing, especially if there is a family history of ALS\n* Head CT or MRI to rule out other conditions\n* Swallowing studies\n* Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known cure for ALS. Two medicines are available that help slow the progression of symptoms and may help people live slightly longer:\n\n* Riluzole (Rilutek)\n* Edaravone (Radicava)\n\nTreatments to control other symptoms include:\n\n* Baclofen or diazepam for spasticity that interferes with daily activities\n* Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline for people with problems swallowing their own saliva\n\nTrials of gene therapy are now underway for some specific hereditary causes. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other measures may be needed to help with muscle function and general health. Ongoing oversight by a physical medicine provider is helpful, given continuously changing symptoms.\n\nPeople with ALS tend to lose weight due to the illness itself increasing the need for food and calories, while problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. A tube may be placed into the stomach to help with feeding. A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating. Breathing devices include machines that are considered non-invasive (such as CPAP or BiPAP).

Groups such as the ALS Association may be available to help people who are coping with the disorder.\n\nSupport for people who are caring for someone with ALS is also available, and may be very helpful.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOver time, people with ALS lose the ability to function and care for themselves. Death often occurs within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. About 1 in 4 people survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis. Some people live much longer, but they typically need help breathing from a ventilator or other device.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of ALS include:\n\n* Breathing in food or fluid (aspiration)\n* Loss of ability to care for self\n* Lung failure\n* Pneumonia\n* Pressure sores\n* Weight loss\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have symptoms of ALS, particularly if you have a family history of the disorder\n* You or someone else has been diagnosed with ALS and symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop\n\nIncreased difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and episodes of apnea are symptoms that require immediate attention.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou may want to see a genetic counselor if you have a family history of ALS.\n\n---\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**\n\n**What is ALS?**\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disease that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement.

These nerve cells are found in the spinal cord and the brain. In ALS, motor neurons die (atrophy) over time, leading to muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement.\n\n**Types of ALS**\n\nThere are many different types of ALS, distinguished by their signs and symptoms and their genetic cause or lack of clear genetic association. Most people with ALS have a form of the condition that is described as sporadic, which means it occurs in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. People with sporadic ALS usually first develop features of the condition in their late fifties or early sixties.\n\n**Familial ALS**\n\nA small proportion of people with ALS, estimated at 5 to 10 percent, have a family history of ALS or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. The signs and symptoms of familial ALS typically first appear in one's late forties or early fifties.\n\n**Juvenile ALS**\n\nRarely, people with familial ALS develop symptoms in childhood or their teenage years.

Many people with ALS experience malnutrition because of reduced food intake due to dysphagia and an increase in their body's energy demands (metabolism) due to prolonged illness.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAbout 5,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS each year. Worldwide, this disorder occurs in 2 to 5 per 100,000 individuals. Only a small percentage of cases have a known genetic cause.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in several genes can cause familial ALS and contribute to the development of sporadic ALS. Mutations in the C9orf72 gene account for 30 to 40 percent of familial ALS in the United States and Europe. Worldwide, SOD1 gene mutations cause 15 to 20 percent of familial ALS, and TARDBP and FUS gene mutations each account for about 5 percent of cases.\n\n**ALS-FTD**\n\nApproximately 20 percent of individuals with ALS also develop frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Variations in many genes increase the risk of developing ALS.\n\n**ALS Progression**\n\nMuscles become weaker as the disease progresses, and arms and legs begin to look thinner as muscle tissue atrophies. Individuals with ALS eventually lose muscle strength and the ability to walk. Affected individuals eventually become wheelchair-dependent and increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living. Over time, muscle weakness causes affected individuals to lose the use of their hands and arms. Breathing becomes difficult because the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years after the signs and symptoms of ALS first appear; however, disease progression varies widely among affected individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n**What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?**\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to loss of muscle control.\n\n**Causes of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n*   **Genetic Factors**: Mutations in several genes can cause familial ALS and contribute to the development of sporadic ALS. The C9orf72 gene accounts for 30-40% of familial ALS in the US and Europe, while SOD1 gene mutations cause 15-20% of cases worldwide.\n*   **Environmental Triggers**: While genetic variations have been associated with sporadic ALS, not all genetic factors have been identified, and it is unclear how most genetic changes influence the development of the disease. People with a gene variation that increases their risk of ALS likely require additional genetic and environmental triggers to develop the disorder.\n\n**Symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n*   **Muscle Weakness**: Muscle weakness and atrophy can occur due to impaired transmission of impulses from nerves to muscles.\n*   **Loss of Motor Function**: As the disease progresses, motor neurons die, leading to loss of motor function.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Tests**: Diagnostic tests may include electromyography (EMG), muscle biopsy, and genetic testing to identify specific gene mutations.\n*   **Treatment Options**: While there is no cure for ALS, treatment options may include riluzole, a medication that slows disease progression, as well as physical therapy and supportive care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\n**Prognosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n*   **Life Expectancy**: The average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5 years, although this can vary depending on individual factors such as age, overall health, and response to treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 5/8)**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAbout 90 to 95 percent of ALS cases are sporadic, which means they are not inherited.\n\nAn estimated 5 to 10 percent of ALS is familial and caused by mutations in one of several genes. The pattern of inheritance varies depending on the gene involved. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Some people who inherit a familial genetic mutation known to cause ALS never develop features of the condition. (This situation is known as reduced penetrance.) It is unclear why some people with a mutated gene develop the disease and other people with a mutated gene do not.\n\nLess frequently, ALS is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Because an affected person's parents are not affected, autosomal recessive ALS is often mistaken for sporadic ALS even though it is caused by a familial genetic mutation.\n\nVery rarely, ALS is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. X-linked conditions occur when the gene associated with the condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males tend to develop the disease earlier and have a decreased life expectancy compared with females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\n\n**Genes Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n*   ALS2\n*   ATXN2\n*   C9orf72\n*   CHMP2B\n*   DCTN1\n*   FUS\n*   MATR3\n*   SETX\n*   SMN1\n*   SOD1\n*   SPG11\n*   SQSTM1\n*   TARDBP\n*   VCP\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\n*   ANG\n*   CHCHD10\n*   ERBB4\n*   FIG4\n*   HNRNPA1\n*   NEFH\n*   OPTN\n*   PFN1\n*   PRPH\n*   SIGMAR1\n*   TBK1\n*   TRPM7\n*   TUBA4A\n*   UBQLN2\n*   VAPB\n\n---\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n**What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?**\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. It is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n**Types of Inheritance**\n\nThere are three types of inheritance in ALS:\n\n* Autosomal dominant: This type accounts for 25% of all ALS cases and is characterized by a single copy of the mutated gene being enough to cause the disorder.\n* Autosomal recessive: This type is rare and often mistaken for sporadic ALS, even though it is caused by a familial genetic mutation.\n* X-linked dominant: This type is very rare and occurs when the gene associated with the condition is located on the X chromosome. In females, a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

It is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ALS is still unknown, but research suggests that it may be related to genetic mutations, environmental factors, or a combination of both. Some people with a family history of the disease are more likely to develop ALS.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ALS can vary from person to person, but they typically include:\n\n* Muscle weakness or paralysis\n* Difficulty speaking or swallowing\n* Trouble walking or maintaining balance\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for ALS, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. A diagnosis is usually made through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.\n\n**Genetic Connection**\n\nResearch has shown that there is a genetic connection between ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in certain genes, such as C9ORF72, have been linked to both diseases.\n\n**Clinical Characteristics**\n\nPeople with familial ALS carrying the pathogenic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion of C9ORF72 tend to have a more severe form of the disease. They often experience rapid progression and shorter survival times.\n\n**Molecular Pathways**\n\nResearch has identified several molecular pathways that contribute to motor neuron injury in ALS, including disrupted RNA and protein homeostasis.\n\n**Genetic Analysis Methodologies**\n\nNew genetic analysis methodologies have enabled researchers to better understand the genetic causes of ALS and FTD. These advancements have opened up new opportunities for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**The ALS/PDC Syndrome of Guam**\n\nThis rare disorder has been linked to potential biomarkers, which may help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease.\n\n**Diagnostic Timelines and Delays**\n\nDelays in diagnosing ALS can lead to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes. Understanding the diagnostic timelines is crucial for improving patient care.\n\n**State of Play in ALS Genetics**\n\nRecent advances in genetics have shed light on the complex relationships between ALS, FTD, and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Overview**\n\nThis overview provides a comprehensive understanding of ALS, including its definition, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and genetic connection.\n\n---\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Understanding Genetics**\n\t+ What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n\t+ How can gene variants affect health and development?\n\t+ What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n\t+ What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n\t+ How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**\n\n* Genetics\n\t+ Mutations in FUS, an RNA processing protein, cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 6.

Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men. It is needed to develop and maintain male sex characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle growth. Women do have some testosterone in their bodies, but in much smaller amounts.\n\n**What are anabolic steroids used for?**\n\nHealth care providers use anabolic steroids to treat some hormone problems in men, delayed puberty, and muscle loss from some diseases. But some people misuse anabolic steroids by taking them in a way that's different than their provider prescribed.\n\n**Why do people misuse anabolic steroids?**\n\nSome bodybuilders and athletes use anabolic steroids to build muscles and improve athletic performance. They may take steroids by swallowing tablets or capsules, inject them into muscles, or apply them to the skin as a gel or cream. These doses may be 10 to 100 times higher than doses used to treat medical conditions. Using them this way, without a prescription from a provider, is not legal or safe.\n\n**What are the health effects of misusing anabolic steroids?**\n\nMisuse of anabolic steroids, especially over a long period of time, has been linked with many health problems, including:\n\n*   Acne\n*   Stunted growth in teens\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Changes in cholesterol\n*   Heart problems, including heart attack\n*   Liver disease, including cancer\n*   Kidney damage\n*   Mood changes such as irritability and aggressive behavior\n\nIn men, it can also cause:\n\n*   Baldness\n*   Breast growth\n*   Low sperm count/infertility\n*   Shrinking of the testicles\n*   Testicular cancer\n\nIn women, it can also cause:\n\n*   Changes in your menstrual cycle (period)\n*   Growth of body and facial hair\n*   Male-pattern baldness\n*   Voice deepening\n*   Decreased breast size\n\n**Are anabolic steroids addictive?**\n\nEven though they don't cause a high, anabolic steroids can lead to addiction. You can have withdrawal symptoms if you stop using them, including:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Restlessness\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Sleep problems\n*   Decreased sex drive\n*   Steroid cravings\n*   Depression, which can sometimes be serious and even lead to suicide attempts\n\nBehavioral therapy and medicines can be helpful in treating anabolic steroid addiction.\n\n---\n\n**Anabolic Steroids**\n\n**What are anabolic steroids?**\n\nAnabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone, the main sex hormone in men.

    "content": "**Anaerobic**\n\nThe word anaerobic indicates \"without oxygen.\" The term has many uses in medicine.\n\n**Anaerobic Bacteria**\n\nAnaerobic bacteria are germs that can survive and grow where there is no oxygen. For example, they can thrive in human tissue that is injured and does not have oxygen-rich blood flowing to it. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections typically cause abscesses (buildups of pus), and death of tissue (necrosis). Many anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes that destroy tissue or sometimes release potent toxins.\n\n**Other Anaerobic Organisms**\n\nBesides bacteria, some protozoans and worms are also anaerobic.\n\n**Illnesses and Shock**\n\nIllnesses that create a lack of oxygen in the body can force the body into anaerobic activity. This can cause harmful chemicals to form. It can happen in all types of shock.\n\n**Aerobic vs. Anaerobic**\n\nAnaerobic is the opposite of aerobic.\n\n**Exercise and Energy**\n\nIn exercise, our bodies need to perform both anaerobic and aerobic chemical reactions to supply us with energy. We need aerobic reactions for slower and more prolonged exercise like walking or jogging. Anaerobic reactions are faster. We need them during shorter, more intense activities like sprinting.\n\n**Lactic Acid Buildup**\n\nAnaerobic exercise leads to a buildup of lactic acid in our tissues. We need oxygen to remove the lactic acid. When sprinters breathe heavily after running a race, they are removing the lactic acid by providing oxygen to their bodies.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Asplund CA, Best TM. Exercise physiology.

It is usually taken with or without food two to four times a day. Take anagrelide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of anagrelide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Your doctor may change your dose during your treatment based upon your body's response to the medication. Follow these directions carefully.\n\nAnagrelide may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take anagrelide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking anagrelide without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking anagrelide, the number of platelets in your blood will increase and you may experience symptoms.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking anagrelide:\n\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to anagrelide or any other medications.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking anagrelide.

Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking anagrelide. Do not start any of these medications while taking anagrelide without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had bleeding problems; high or low blood pressure; lactose intolerance (inability to digest dairy products) or heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n* Do not take anagrelide if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should use an effective form of birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment with anagrelide. Talk to your doctor about types of birth control that are right for you. If you become pregnant while taking anagrelide, call your doctor immediately. Do not breast-feed while you are taking anagrelide.\n* If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking anagrelide.\n* You should know that anagrelide may make you dizzy, especially when you first start taking the medication. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n* You should know that anagrelide may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position.

    "content": "**Anakinra: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAnakinra is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis (condition in which the body attacks its own joints causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in adults who were not helped by other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Anakinra is also used to treat neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID; a disorder that causes inflammation and damages the nervous system, skin, and joints) in adults and children. Anakinra is also used to treat deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA; a disorder in which the body attacks its own tissues causing inflammation and damages bones, nervous system, skin, lungs, liver, and joints) in adults and children. Anakinra is authorized for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 infection) in hospitalized adults who require supplemental oxygen, a ventilator, or who need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; a device that adds oxygen to the blood).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAnakinra injection comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually given once a day. However, when anakinra is given to treat neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, it may be given once or twice daily. For the treatment of COVID-19, anakinra is given once a day for 10 days.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou will receive your first subcutaneous dose of anakinra injection in your doctor's office. After that, your doctor may decide that you or your caregiver can give the injections at home. Your doctor will show you or the person who will be giving the medication how to inject it.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use anakinra injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAnakinra has not undergone the standard review to be approved by the FDA for use. However, the FDA has approved an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow certain hospitalized adults who have COVID-19 with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and who are at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 to receive anakinra.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nAnakinra injection comes in prefilled glass syringes. There are 7 syringes in each box, one for each day of the week. Use each syringe only once. Even if there is still some solution left in the syringe after you inject, do not inject again. Dispose of used syringes in a puncture-resistant container.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nOnly limited clinical trial information is available at this time to support the use of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19. More information is needed to know how well anakinra will work for the treatment of COVID-19 and the possible adverse events from it.\n\n---\n\n**Anakinra Injection: Instructions for Use**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before You Start**\n\n*   Remove the medication from the refrigerator 30 minutes before you are ready to inject it. Place it on a flat surface and allow it to reach room temperature.\n*   When removing the prefilled syringe from the box, do not shake the syringe or remove the cap covering the needle.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Checking the Syringe**\n\n*   Check the expiration date printed on the package has not passed.\n*   Look closely at the liquid in the syringe. The liquid should be clear and should not be cloudy or discolored or contain large particles.\n*   Call your pharmacist if there are any problems with the package or the syringe and do not inject the medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Where to Inject**\n\n*   You may inject anakinra in the front of the middle thighs or in your lower stomach below your navel except for the 2-inch (5-centimeter) area around the navel.\n*   If someone else is giving you the injection, it can be injected into the outer area of your upper arms, or outer and upper areas of buttocks.\n*   Choose a different spot to inject the medication every day.\n*   Do not inject into an area where your skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or scaly, or where you have scars or stretch marks.\n*   Do not inject close to a vein you can see under the skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Anakinra Injection**\n\n*   Anakinra injection may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition.\n*   Continue to use anakinra injection even if you feel well.\n*   Do not stop using anakinra injection without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Anakinra: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n    Before using anakinra injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to anakinra, proteins made from bacterial cells (E. coli), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in anakinra injection. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\n    Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving anakinra injection.\n\n    Tell your doctor if you have or ever had kidney disease.\n\n    Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using anakinra, call your doctor.\n\n    If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using anakinra.\n\n    You should know that anakinra injection may decrease your ability to fight infection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi and increase the risk that you will get a serious infection. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you have or think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as herpes or cold sores), and chronic infections that do not go away.\n\n    If you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment with anakinra injection, call your doctor immediately: fever, sweats, or chills; sore throat; cough; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; frequent, urgent, or painful urination; or other signs of infection.\n\n    You should know that using anakinra injection increases the risk that you will develop tuberculosis (TB; a serious lung infection), especially if you are already infected with tuberculosis but do not have any symptoms of the disease. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB, if you have lived in a country where TB is common, or if you have been around someone who has TB.\n\n    Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using anakinra injection.\n\n    If you have any of the following symptoms of TB, or if you develop any of these symptoms during your treatment, call your doctor immediately: cough, coughing up blood or mucus, weakness or tiredness, weight loss, loss of appetite, chills, fever, or night sweats.\n\n    Do not have any vaccinations without talking to your doctor.\n*   **What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\n    Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n*   **What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\n    Call your doctor if you forget to inject a dose of this medication. Your doctor will tell you when to inject the missed dose and when to inject your next scheduled dose. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n*   **What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n    Anakinra may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n    *   Redness, swelling, bruising, itching, or pain at the site of injection\n    *   Headache\n    *   Nausea\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Diarrhea\n    *   Runny nose\n    *   Stomach pain\n    *   Joint pain\n\n    Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n    *   Rash\n    *   Itching\n    *   Hives\n    *   Swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth, or face\n    *   Fever\n    *   Swollen glands\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Fainting\n    *   Difficulty breathing\n    *   Wheezing\n    *   Sweating\n    *   Fast or racing heart beat\n\n    Anakinra may increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer including lymphoma (cancer that begins in the cells that fight infection) and skin cancer. People who have had severe rheumatoid arthritis for a long time may have a greater than normal risk of developing these cancers even if they do not use anakinra. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication.\n\n    Anakinra may cause other side effects.

    "content": "**Anal Fissure**\n\n_Anal fissure_ is a small split or tear in the thin moist tissue (mucosa) lining the lower rectum (anus).\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Anal fissures are very common in infants, but they may occur at any age.\n*   In adults, fissures may be caused by passing large, hard stools, or having diarrhea for a long time. Other factors may include:\n    *   Decreased blood flow to the area\n    *   Too much tension in the sphincter muscles that control the anus\n*   The condition affects males and females equally. Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and in people with Crohn disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAn anal fissure can be seen as a crack in the anal skin when the area is stretched slightly. The fissure is almost always in the middle. Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding.

    "content": "**Anaphylaxis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction.\n\nAfter being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body.\n\nTissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.\n\nSome medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.\n\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:\n\n*   **Medicine allergies**\n*   **Food allergies**\n*   **Insect bites/stings**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes.

Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately.\n\nCheck the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number.\nCalm and reassure the person.\nIf the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something firm (such as a fingernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers. Squeezing the stinger will release more venom.\nIf the person has emergency allergy medicine on hand, help them take or inject it. Do not give medicine by the mouth if the person is having difficulty breathing. An epinephrine injector should be used immediately if it is available.\nTake steps to prevent shock. Have the person lie flat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, or if it causes discomfort.\n\nDO NOT:\n\n*   Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection.\n*   Do not place a pillow under the person's head if they are having trouble breathing. This can block the airways.\n*   Do not give the person anything by mouth if they are having trouble breathing.\n\nParamedics or other providers may place a tube through the nose or mouth into the airways.

Surgery combined with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may have a significant benefit. Surgery to place a tube in the throat to help with breathing (tracheostomy) or in the stomach to help with eating (gastrostomy) may be needed during treatment. For some people, enrolling in a clinical trial of new thyroid cancer treatments based on the genetic changes in the tumor may be an option. The presence of a mutation in the BRAF gene is treatable with targeted medicines and may improve outcomes.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can often ease the stress of illness by joining a support group of people sharing common experiences and problems.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook with this disease is poor.

It occurs most often in people over age 60 and is more common in females than in males. The cause is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnaplastic cancer accounts for only about less than 1% of all thyroid cancers in the United States.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Cough\n* Coughing up blood\n* Difficulty swallowing\n* Hoarseness or changing voice\n* Loud breathing\n* Lower neck lump, which often grows quickly\n* Pain in the neck\n* Vocal cord paralysis\n* Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam almost always shows a growth in the neck region.

It is also known as undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ATC is not fully understood, but it is believed to arise from the transformation of normal thyroid cells into malignant cells. Risk factors for developing ATC include:\n\n*   **Age**: ATC typically affects people over the age of 60.\n*   **Family History**: A family history of thyroid cancer or other cancers may increase the risk of developing ATC.\n*   **Radiation Exposure**: Exposure to radiation, especially in childhood, may increase the risk of developing ATC.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ATC can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Swelling or Lump in the Neck**: A visible swelling or lump in the neck is often one of the first signs of ATC.\n*   **Difficulty Swallowing**: As the tumor grows, it may cause difficulty swallowing due to compression of the esophagus.\n*   **Hoarseness**: The tumor can also compress the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leading to hoarseness or voice changes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ATC typically involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination to check for any abnormalities in the neck.\n*   **Imaging Tests**: Imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be used to evaluate the size and location of the tumor.\n*   **Biopsy**: A biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for ATC typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery may be performed to relieve symptoms or improve quality of life, but it is often not curative.\n*   **Radiation Therapy**: Radiation therapy may be used to control local disease and alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Chemotherapy**: Chemotherapy may be used in combination with radiation therapy to treat advanced disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for ATC is generally poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. However, the exact prognosis depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the stage and location of the tumor, and the effectiveness of treatment.",

    "content": "**Anauxetic Dysplasia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n----------------\n\nAnauxetic dysplasia is a disorder characterized by extremely short stature (dwarfism) and other skeletal abnormalities, an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), dental problems, and distinctive facial features. Mild intellectual disability can also occur in this disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n-------------\n\nPeople with anauxetic dysplasia have dwarfism with unusually short limbs for their height (disproportionate short stature) beginning before birth. Dislocation of the bones at the top of the spine (atlantoaxial subluxation) can also occur in this disorder, and may cause pinching (compression) of the spinal cord. As a result, affected individuals may experience neurological symptoms including pain, tingling, numbness, coordination problems, weakness, and paralysis. In severe cases, the spinal cord compression may lead to paralysis of the muscles needed for breathing, which can be life-threatening during early childhood.\n\nOther skeletal abnormalities in anauxetic dysplasia include a barrel-shaped chest and a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis). Without surgical correction, the kyphoscoliosis can constrict the lungs and cause difficulty breathing. People with anauxetic dysplasia can also have an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (hyperlordosis), dislocation of the hips, and soles of the feet that are rounded outward (rocker-bottom feet).\n\nTypical facial features in anauxetic dysplasia include closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism), a flat or sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), an unusually large tongue (macroglossia), and a protruding chin (prognathism). Affected individuals can also have fewer teeth than normal (hypodontia).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n-------------\n\nThe frequency of anauxetic dysplasia is not well established, as it is a rare disorder. However, it is believed to occur in approximately 1 in every 100,000 births.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n----------\n\nAnauxetic dysplasia is caused by genetic mutations that affect the development of bones and cartilage. The exact cause of the disorder is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to abnormalities in the FGFR3 gene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n-------------\n\nAnauxetic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder.

    "content": "**Andermann Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\nAndermann syndrome is a disorder that damages the nerves used for muscle movement and sensation (motor and sensory neuropathy). The neuropathy in this condition is due to poor development of nerves, particularly nerves that control movement, which are half their normal size. Absence (agenesis) or malformation of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) occurs in most people with this disorder. Because of these features, Andermann syndrome is sometimes referred to as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC).\n\n**Symptoms**\nPeople affected by Andermann syndrome have abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia) and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). They experience muscle wasting (amyotrophy), severe progressive weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs, and rhythmic shaking (tremors). \n\nPeople with Andermann syndrome typically begin walking between ages 3 and 4, and worsening neuropathy causes them to lose this ability by their teenage years. As they get older, people with this disorder frequently develop joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints. Most affected individuals also develop abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), which may require surgery.\n\nAndermann syndrome also results in abnormal function of certain cranial nerves, which emerge directly from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck. Cranial nerve problems may result in facial muscle weakness, drooping eyelids (ptosis), and difficulty following movements with the eyes (gaze palsy).\n\n**Associated Features**\nIndividuals with Andermann syndrome usually have intellectual disability, which may be mild to severe, and some experience seizures. They may also develop psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, agitation, paranoia, and hallucinations, which usually appear in adolescence.\n\nSome people with Andermann syndrome have atypical physical features such as widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); a wide, short skull (brachycephaly); a high arch of the hard palate at the roof of the mouth; a big toe that crosses over the other toes; and partial fusion (syndactyly) of the second and third toes.\n\n**Prognosis**\nAndermann syndrome is associated with a shortened life expectancy related to respiratory insufficiency, but affected individuals typically live into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Andermann Syndrome**\n\n**Physical Features**\n\n* Wide, short skull (brachycephaly)\n* High arch of the hard palate at the roof of the mouth\n* Big toe that crosses over the other toes\n* Partial fusion (syndactyly) of the second and third toes\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\n* Abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia)\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n* Muscle wasting (amyotrophy)\n* Severe progressive weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs\n* Rhythmic shaking (tremors)\n\n**Developmental Features**\n\n* Typically begin walking between ages 3 and 4\n* Worsening neuropathy causes them to lose this ability by their teenage years\n* Joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints\n* Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), which may require surgery\n\n**Cranial Nerve Problems**\n\n* Facial muscle weakness\n* Drooping eyelids (ptosis)\n* Difficulty following movements with the eyes (gaze palsy)\n\n**Intellectual Disability and Psychiatric Symptoms**\n\n* Usually have intellectual disability, which may be mild to severe\n* Some experience seizures\n* May also develop psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, agitation, paranoia, and hallucinations\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Most often seen in the French-Canadian population of the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean and Charlevoix regions of northeastern Quebec\n* Occurs in almost 1 in 2,000 newborns in this population\n* Only a few individuals with this disorder have been identified in other regions of the world\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Variants (also known as mutations) in the SLC12A6 gene cause Andermann syndrome\n* The SLC12A6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called KCC3, a K-Cl co-transporter\n* Disruption of the function of the KCC3 protein interferes with the development of the corpus callosum and maintenance of the nerves that transmit signals needed for movement and sensation\n\n---\n\n**Andermann Syndrome**\n\n**What is Andermann Syndrome?**\n\nAndermann syndrome, also known as agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN), is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development and maintenance of nerve tissue. It is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres.\n\n**Causes of Andermann Syndrome**\n\nAndermann syndrome is caused by variants in the SLC12A6 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called KCC3. This protein is involved in moving charged atoms (ions) of potassium and chlorine across cell membranes. The lack of functional protein normally produced from the SLC12A6 gene disrupts the function of the KCC3 protein, leading to the signs and symptoms of Andermann syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAndermann syndrome is also known by other names, including:\n\n* Agenesis of corpus callosum with neuronopathy\n* Agenesis of corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy\n* Agenesis of corpus callosum with polyneuropathy\n* Charlevoix disease\n* Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on Andermann syndrome, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Corpus callosum agenesis-neuronopathy syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: AGENESIS OF THE CORPUS CALLOSUM WITH PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; ACCPN\n\n---\n\n**Andermann Syndrome**\n\n**What is Andermann syndrome?**\n\nAndermann syndrome, also known as agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN), is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of the corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe causes of Andermann syndrome are not fully understood, but it is believed to be caused by mutations in the KCC3 gene. The risk factors for developing this condition include family history, as it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Andermann syndrome may vary in severity and can include:\n\n* Absence or underdevelopment of the corpus callosum\n* Peripheral neuropathy, which can cause muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet\n* Seizures\n* Developmental delays\n* Intellectual disability\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing Andermann syndrome typically involves a combination of genetic testing, imaging studies (such as MRI), and clinical evaluation.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Andermann syndrome, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms. This may include:\n\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility\n* Occupational therapy to improve daily functioning\n* Medications to manage seizures and other symptoms\n* Genetic counseling to understand the risk of inheritance\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Andermann syndrome varies depending on the severity of the condition.

    "content": "**Andersen-Tawil Syndrome**\n\nAndersen-Tawil syndrome is a disorder that causes episodes of muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and developmental abnormalities. Periodic paralysis begins early in life, and episodes last from hours to days. These episodes may occur after exercise or long periods of rest, but they often have no obvious trigger. Muscle strength usually returns to normal between episodes. However, mild muscle weakness may eventually become permanent.\n\n**Heart Changes**\n\nIn people with Andersen-Tawil syndrome, the most common changes affecting the heart are ventricular arrhythmia, which is a disruption in the rhythm of the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles), and long QT syndrome. Long QT syndrome is a heart condition that causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. The irregular heartbeats can lead to discomfort, such as the feeling that the heart is skipping beats (palpitations). Uncommonly, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope), and even more rarely, sudden death.\n\n**Physical Abnormalities**\n\nPhysical abnormalities associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome typically affect the face, other parts of the head, and the limbs. These features often include a very small lower jaw (micrognathia), dental abnormalities (such as crowded teeth), low-set ears, widely spaced eyes, fusion (syndactyly) of the second and third toes, and unusual curving of the fingers or toes (clinodactyly). Some affected people also have short stature and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\n\n**Variability in Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of Andersen-Tawil syndrome vary widely, and they can be different even among affected members of the same family. About 60 percent of affected individuals have all three major features (periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and physical abnormalities).\n\n---\n\n**Andersen-Tawil Syndrome**\n\n**What is Andersen-Tawil Syndrome?**\n\nAndersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 1 million people worldwide. It is characterized by episodes of muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and developmental abnormalities.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Andersen-Tawil syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family.

When the disorder is caused by mutations in this gene, it is classified as type 1 (ATS1). The KCNJ2 gene provides instructions for making channels that transport positively charged potassium ions across the membrane of muscle cells.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAndersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, and its exact prevalence is unknown. It is estimated to affect 1 in 1 million people worldwide. About 200 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature. Researchers believe that Andersen-Tawil syndrome accounts for less than 10 percent of all cases of periodic paralysis.\n\n---\n\n**Andersen-Tawil Syndrome**\n\nAndersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by periodic episodes of abnormal heart rhythms, muscle weakness, and developmental abnormalities.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of Andersen-Tawil syndrome is usually unknown in 40% of cases not caused by KCNJ2 gene mutations. These cases are classified as type 2 (ATS2). Studies suggest that variations in at least one other potassium channel gene may underlie the disorder in some affected individuals.\n\n**Genes Associated with Andersen-Tawil Syndrome**\n\n*   **KCNJ2**: The most common cause of Andersen-Tawil syndrome, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.\n*   **KCNJ5**: Another gene associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome, although less common than KCNJ2.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAndersen-Tawil syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. When the condition results from a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene, an affected individual may inherit the mutation from one affected parent. In other cases, the condition results from a new (de novo) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene, which occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **Andersen syndrome**\n*   **ATS Long QT syndrome 7 LQT7**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**: Genetic testing can help diagnose Andersen-Tawil syndrome and identify the underlying genetic mutation.\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: A comprehensive resource providing information on rare diseases, including Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: Organizations such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) offer support and advocacy for individuals affected by rare disorders like Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Trials**: ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of publicly and privately funded clinical studies conducted around the world.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: A comprehensive catalog of genes and diseases, including information on Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: A database of scientific articles, including those related to Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n\n**References**\n\nArdissone A, Sansone V, Colleoni L, Bernasconi P, Moroni I.

    "content": "**Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. In people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, the body's cells and tissues are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty.\n\nThere are three forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome: complete, partial, and mild.\n\n* **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: This form occurs when the body does not respond to androgens at all. People with this form of the condition have external sex characteristics that are typical of females. Affected individuals do not have a uterus. They have male internal sex organs (testes) that are undescended, which means they are located in the pelvis or abdomen instead of outside the body. As such, affected individuals do not menstruate and are unable to conceive a child (infertile). People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome also have sparse or absent hair in the pubic area and under the arms.\n* **Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: This form occurs when the body's tissues are partially sensitive to the effects of androgens. People with partial androgen insensitivity can have genitalia that look typical for females, genitalia that have both male and female characteristics, or genitalia that look typical for males.\n* **Mild Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: This form occurs when the body's tissues are partially sensitive to the effects of androgens. People with mild androgen insensitivity are born with male-typical sex characteristics, but they are often infertile and tend to experience breast enlargement at puberty.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is a rare condition, affecting approximately 1 in every 20,000 to 1 in every 100,000 people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome is not fully understood. However, it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the body's response to androgens.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the condition affects males more frequently than females.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is also known as testicular feminization or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on androgen insensitivity syndrome, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n**References**\n\nPlease note that references are not provided in this cleaned output.\n\n---\n\n**Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n\n**What is Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome?**\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. In people with AIS, the body's cells and tissues are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty.\n\n**Forms of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n\nThere are three forms of AIS: complete, partial, and mild.\n\n* **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: This form occurs when the body does not respond to androgens at all.

People with mild AIS are born with male-typical sex characteristics, but they are often infertile and tend to experience breast enlargement at puberty.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: Affects 2 to 5 in 100,000 newborn females.\n* **Partial and Mild Forms of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: Partial AIS is thought to be at least as common as complete AIS. Mild AIS is much less common.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the AR gene cause AIS. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgen receptor proteins interact with androgen hormones, such as testosterone, and help direct male sexual development.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Learn more about the gene associated with Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes.\n\n* In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n* In females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that both copies of a gene would be altered, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.\n\n**Frequency of Inheritance**\n\nAbout 70 percent of all cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome are inherited from people who carry an altered copy of the AR gene on one of their two X chromosomes. The remaining 30 percent of cases result from new (de novo) variants in the gene that occur in the egg cell before the child is conceived or during early embryonic development.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AIS\n* Androgen receptor deficiency\n* Androgen resistance syndrome\n* AR deficiency\n* DHTR deficiency\n* Dihydrotestosterone receptor deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information, you can visit:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Androgen resistance syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\t+ Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n\t+ Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome\n\t+ Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME; AIS\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia is a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In men, it is also known as male pattern baldness, and in women, it is also known as female pattern hair loss.\n\n**Description**\n\nIn men, hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Over time, the hairline moves back (recedes) to form a characteristic \"M\" shape. Hair also thins at the top of the head (vertex or crown), often progressing to partial or complete baldness.\n\nThe pattern of hair loss in women differs from male-pattern baldness. In women, the hair becomes thinner at the top of the head, and the middle part widens. The hairline does not typically recede.  Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions, including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate. Additionally, prostate cancer, disorders of insulin resistance (such as diabetes and obesity), and high blood pressure (hypertension) have been related to androgenetic alopecia.\n\nIn women, this form of hair loss is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess hair elsewhere on the body (hirsutism), and weight gain.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia affects an estimated 50 million men and 30 million women in the United States. Androgenetic alopecia can start as early as a person's teens, and the risk increases with age; more than 50 percent of men over age 50 have some degree of hair loss. In women, hair loss is most likely after menopause.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   **Genetics**: Family history plays a significant role in the development of androgenetic alopecia.\n*   **Hormonal Imbalance**: An imbalance of hormones such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) contributes to hair loss.\n*   **Aging**: As people age, the risk of developing androgenetic alopecia increases.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia has a strong genetic component. If your parents or grandparents have experienced hair loss due to this condition, you may be more likely to develop it as well.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Male Pattern Baldness\n*   Female Pattern Hair Loss\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor further information on androgenetic alopecia, consult a healthcare professional or visit reputable health resources such as the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) or the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\n---\n\n**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\n**Causes**\n\nA variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing androgenetic alopecia. Although researchers are studying risk factors that may contribute to this condition, most of these factors remain unknown.\n\nResearchers have determined that this form of hair loss, particularly in men, is related to hormones called androgens, specifically an androgen called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Androgens play a role in female pattern hair loss, but other factors that are not yet known are also involved.\n\n**Androgens and Hair Growth**\n\nAndrogens are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. Androgens also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.\n\nHair growth begins under the skin in structures called follicles. Each strand of hair normally grows for 2 to 6 years, goes into a resting phase for several months, and then falls out. The cycle starts over when the follicle begins growing a new hair.\n\nAndrogens help control this cycle. However, too much stimulation of hair follicles by androgens may lead to a shorter growth period, resulting in shorter and thinner strands of hair. The growth of new hair to replace strands that are shed is also delayed. Together, these changes lead to  hair thinning or loss.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nResearchers suspect that variants (also called mutations) in several genes play a role in androgenetic alopecia. However, scientific studies have confirmed only that variations in one gene, the AR gene, are involved in this condition.\n\nThe AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to DHT and other androgens. Studies suggest that variations in the AR gene result in androgen receptors that are more easily stimulated by androgens than normal, leading to increased activity of the receptors in hair follicles.\n\nIt remains unclear, however, how these genetic changes increase the risk of hair loss in men and women with androgenetic alopecia.\n\n**Connection to Other Medical Conditions**\n\nResearchers continue to investigate the connection between androgenetic alopecia and other medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. They believe that some of these disorders may be associated with elevated androgen levels, which may help explain why they tend to occur with androgen-related hair loss.\n\n---\n\n**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\n**What is Androgenetic Alopecia?**\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia, also known as pattern hair loss, is a condition where hair loss occurs due to the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This process leads to the shrinkage of hair follicles, resulting in thinner and shorter hairs.\n\n**Connection to Other Medical Conditions**\n\nResearchers have found a connection between androgenetic alopecia and other medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men, and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. They believe that some of these disorders may be associated with elevated androgen levels, which may help explain why they tend to occur with androgen-related hair loss.\n\n**Genetic Component**\n\nThe gene associated with androgenetic alopecia is the AR gene. Research has shown that genetic variation in this gene is a major determinant of common early-onset androgenetic alopecia.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of androgenetic alopecia is unclear, as many genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved. However, having a close relative with patterned hair loss appears to be a risk factor for developing the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAndrogenic alopecia\nFemale pattern baldness\nFemale-pattern hair loss\nMale pattern alopecia\nMale pattern hair loss\nMale-pattern baldness\nPattern baldness\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Androgenetic alopecia\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials:\nClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\nALOPECIA, ANDROGENETIC, 1; AGA1\nALOPECIA, ANDROGENETIC, 2; AGA2\nALOPECIA, ANDROGENETIC, 3; AGA3\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\nPubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAmoretti A, Laydner H, Bergfeld W.

    "content": "**Anemia caused by low iron - children**\n\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.\n\nIron helps make red blood cells and helps these cells carry oxygen. A lack of iron in the body may lead to anemia. The medical name of this problem is iron deficiency anemia.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.\n\nA diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed.\n\nToddlers who drink too much cow's milk may also become anemic because too much cow's milk makes it difficult for the body to absorb iron. Also, children who drink too much cow's milk may not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.\n\nOther causes may be:\n\n* The body is not able to absorb iron well, even though the child is eating enough iron.\n* Slow blood loss over a long period, often due to menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract.\n* Iron deficiency in children can also be related to lead poisoning.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your child may:\n\n* Act irritable\n* Become short of breath\n* Crave unusual foods (pica)\n* Eat less food\n* Feel tired or weak all the time\n* Have a sore tongue\n* Have headaches or dizziness\n\nWith more severe anemia, your child may have:\n\n* Blue-tinged or very pale whites of eyes\n* Brittle nails\n* Pale skin\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.\n\nBlood tests that may be abnormal with low iron stores include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Hemoglobin\n* Serum ferritin\n* Serum iron\n* Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)\n\nA measurement called iron saturation (serum iron level divided by the TIBC value) can help diagnose iron deficiency. A value of less than 15% supports the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSince children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg of iron per day, in 1 to 2 doses per day.\n\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency.

These are taken by mouth.\n\nDo not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. Your provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child. Too much iron in children can be toxic. Supplemental iron is usually prescribed to be taken by mouth, but may also be given intravenously (through a vein).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith treatment, the outcome is likely to be good.

Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.\n\nInfants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia.

Babies under age 1 year have a difficult time digesting cow's milk. Use either breast milk or formula fortified with iron.\n* After 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid foods with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula.\n* Iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables can also be started.\n\nAfter age 1 year, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.\n\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Good sources of iron include:\n\n* Apricots\n* Chicken, turkey, fish, and other meats\n* Dried beans, lentils, and soybeans\n* Eggs\n* Liver\n* Molasses\n* Oatmeal\n* Peanut butter\n* Prune juice\n* Raisins and prunes\n* Spinach, kale and other greens\n\n**Iron Supplements**\n\nIf a healthy diet does not prevent or treat your child's low iron level and anemia, the provider will likely recommend iron supplements for your child. These are taken by mouth.\n\nDo not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. The provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child. If your child takes too much iron, it can cause poisoning.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. In most cases, the blood counts will return to normal in 2 months. It is important that the provider find the cause of your child's iron deficiency.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nA low iron level can cause decreased attention span, reduced alertness and learning problems in children.\n\nA low iron level can cause the body to absorb too much lead.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Anemia caused by low iron - infants and toddlers**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.\n\nA diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.\n\nBabies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.\n\nBreastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.\n\nInfants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:\n\nHas less iron\nCauses small amounts of blood loss from the intestines\nMakes it harder for the body to absorb iron\n\nChildren older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your infant or toddler may:\n\nAct irritable\nBecome short of breath\nCrave unusual foods (called pica)\nEat less food\nFeel tired or weak all the time\nHave a sore tongue\nHave headaches or dizziness\n\nWith more severe anemia, your child may have:\n\nBlue-tinged or pale whites of eyes\nBrittle nails\nPale skin color\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSince children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 8 to 10 mg of iron per day.\n\n*   **Diet and Iron**\n    During the first year of life:\n        Do not give your baby cow's milk until age 1 year.

Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\n\n**Types of Anemia**\n\nDifferent types of anemia include:\n\n*   Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency\n*   Anemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiency\n*   Anemia due to iron deficiency\n*   Anemia of chronic disease\n*   Hemolytic anemia\n*   Idiopathic aplastic anemia\n*   Megaloblastic anemia\n*   Pernicious anemia\n*   Sickle cell anemia\n*   Thalassemia\n\n**Iron Deficiency Anemia**\n\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.\n\n**Causes of Anemia**\n\nAlthough many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\n\nHealthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.\n\nHemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.\n\nThe body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to:\n\n*   Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease)\n*   Poor diet\n*   Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines\n\nPossible causes of anemia include:\n\n*   Iron deficiency\n*   Vitamin B12 deficiency\n*   Folate deficiency\n*   Certain medicines\n*   Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems)\n*   Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, or aplastic anemia\n*   Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers)\n*   Sudden heavy blood loss\n\n**Symptoms of Anemia**\n\nYou may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly. Symptoms that may occur first include:\n\n*   Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise\n*   Headaches\n*   Problems concentrating or thinking\n*   Irritability\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Numbness and tingling of hands and feet\n\nIf the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Blue color to the whites of the eyes\n*   Brittle nails\n*   Desire to eat ice or other non-food things (pica syndrome)\n*   Lightheadedness when you stand up\n*   Pale skin color\n*   Shortness of breath with mild activity or even at rest\n*   Sore or inflamed tongue\n*   Mouth ulcers\n*   Abnormal or increased menstrual bleeding\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination, and may find:\n\n*   A heart murmur\n*   Low blood pressure, especially when you stand up\n*   Slight fever\n*   Pale skin\n*   Rapid heart rate\n\nSome types of anemia may cause other findings on a physical exam.\n\nBlood tests used to diagnose some common types of anemia may include:\n\n*   Blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals\n*   Complete blood count\n*   Reticulocyte count\n\nOther tests may be done to find medical problems that can cause anemia.\n\n---\n\n**Anemia**\n\n_Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.

    "content": "**Anencephaly**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nAnencephaly is a condition that prevents the normal development of the brain and the bones of the skull. This condition results when a structure called the neural tube fails to close during the first few weeks of embryonic development.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe neural tube is a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord. Because anencephaly is caused by abnormalities of the neural tube, it is classified as a neural tube defect.\n\nBecause the neural tube fails to close properly, the developing brain and spinal cord are exposed to the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb. This exposure causes the nervous system tissue to break down (degenerate). As a result, people with anencephaly are missing large parts of the brain called the cerebrum and cerebellum. These brain regions are necessary for thinking, hearing, vision, emotion, and coordinating movement. The bones of the skull are also missing or incompletely formed.\n\nBecause these nervous system abnormalities are so severe, almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth or within a few hours or days after birth.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAnencephaly is one of the most common types of neural tube defect, affecting about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. However, most of these pregnancies end in miscarriage, so the prevalence of this condition in newborns is much lower. An estimated 1 in 10,000 infants in the United States is born with anencephaly.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnencephaly is a complex condition that is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown.\n\nChanges in dozens of genes in individuals with anencephaly and in their mothers may influence the risk of developing this type of neural tube defect. The best-studied of these genes is MTHFR, which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). While a shortage (deficiency) of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects, there are many factors that can contribute to folate deficiency. Changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for anencephaly. However, no genes appear to play a major role in causing the condition.\n\nResearchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. Folate deficiency plays a significant role.\n\n---\n\n**Anencephaly: Understanding the Complex Condition**\n\n**What is Anencephaly?**\n\nAnencephaly is a complex condition that affects the development of the brain and spinal cord in an embryo. It is characterized by the absence of a significant portion of the brain and skull, which can lead to severe physical and developmental disabilities.\n\n**Causes of Anencephaly**\n\nResearch suggests that anencephaly is caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown. Changes in dozens of genes in individuals with anencephaly and their mothers may influence the risk of developing this type of neural tube defect.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nThe best-studied gene associated with anencephaly is MTHFR, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in processing the vitamin folate. While a shortage of folate is an established risk factor for neural tube defects, there are many factors that can contribute to folate deficiency.\n\n**Environmental Factors**\n\nFolate deficiency plays a significant role in anencephaly. Studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, including anencephaly.\n\nOther possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include:\n\n*   Diabetes mellitus\n*   Obesity\n*   Exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy\n*   The use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of anencephaly are sporadic, meaning they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.\n\nFor parents who have had a child with anencephaly, the risk of having another affected child is increased compared with the risk in the general population.\n\n**Other Names for Anencephaly**\n\nAnencephaly has several other names, including:\n\n*   Anencephalia\n*   Anencephalus\n*   Aprosencephaly\n*   Congenital absence of brain\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on anencephaly and related topics, consider the following resources:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Anencephaly\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Neural tube defect\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Neural tube defects, folate-sensitive\n*   Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM (NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS, FOLATE-SENSITIVE; NTDFS, NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO; NTD, ANENCEPHALY 1; ANPH1)\n\n---\n\n**Anencephaly**\n\n**What is Anencephaly?**\n\nAnencephaly is a rare birth defect in which a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of anencephaly is unknown, but it's believed to be related to genetic mutations or environmental factors during pregnancy. Folate deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of neural tube defects, including anencephaly.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAnencephaly can be detected during pregnancy through ultrasound or other imaging tests. In some cases, the condition may not be apparent until after birth.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nUnfortunately, anencephaly is often fatal if left untreated. Most babies born with this condition do not survive beyond a few days or weeks without medical intervention.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nTreatment for anencephaly typically involves providing comfort care and supportive measures to ensure the baby's quality of life during their remaining time.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nResearch suggests that genetic variants, particularly those affecting folate metabolism, may play a role in the development of neural tube defects like anencephaly. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the genetic underpinnings of this condition.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Neural Tube Defects\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nIf you're concerned about your family history or want to learn more about how genetics can impact health and development, consider exploring resources like MedlinePlus' Understanding Genetics section.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nFor parents or caregivers seeking information on anencephaly, it may be helpful to explore related topics, such as folic acid in the diet, genetics, or understanding genetic conditions. By staying informed, you can better navigate your journey and make informed decisions about your family's health.\n\n---\n\n**Anencephaly**\n\n\\n\\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n*   What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n*   How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n**Folic Acid in Diet**\n\nTaking folic acid supplements before getting pregnant can help prevent neural tube defects, including anencephaly.\n\n\\n\\n**Genetics**\n\nAnencephaly is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities and genetic syndromes.
