These vary by state. Most children grow big enough to move to a regular seat belt between 8 and 12 years old.\n\n**Tips for Using a Car Safety Seat**\n\nWhen your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.\nAlways secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.\nRead the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.\nCar seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.\nEven after children are big enough to wear a seat belt, riding in the back seat is safest.\n\n**Selecting a Child Safety Seat**\n\nThe seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.\nIt is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe.\nTry the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.\nDO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.\nDO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.nhtsa.gov/recalls#car-seats.\n\n**Types of Child Safety Seats and Restraints**\n\n*   Rear-facing seats\n*   Forward-facing seats\n*   Booster seats\n*   Car beds\n*   Built-in car seats\n*   Travel vests\n\n---\n\n**Child Safety Seats**\n\nIn the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they reach certain height or weight requirements.

The seat should be installed in the back seat of your vehicle.\n\nInfant-only rear-facing seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds (10 to 13.5 kilograms), depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Many children grow out of these seats by age 8 to 9 months.\n\nConvertible seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 3 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.\n\n**Forward-Facing Seats**\n\nA forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.\n\nA combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.\n\n**Booster Seats**\n\nA booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.\n\nUse booster seats for older children until they are big enough to fit into a seat belt properly. The lap belt should fit low and tight across the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt should fit snug across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face. A child's legs must be long enough so the feet can be flat on the floor.\n\n**Car Beds**\n\nThese seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.\n\n**Built-In Seats**\n\nSome vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or contacting the vehicle manufacturer.\n\n**Travel Vests**\n\nSpecial vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.\n\n---\n\n**Child Safety Seats**\n\nIn the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they reach certain height or weight requirements. These vary by state. Most children grow big enough to move to a regular seat belt between 8 and 12 years old.\n\nTo keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat:\n\n*   When selecting a child safety seat for the first time:\n    *   **Rear-Facing Seats**: A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle.

    "content": "**Childbirth Problems**\n\n**What Are Some Common Complications During Labor and Delivery?**\n\nChildbirth is the process of giving birth to a baby. It includes labor and delivery. Usually everything goes well, but problems can happen. They may cause a risk to the mother, baby, or both.\n\nSome of the more common childbirth problems include:\n\n*   **Preterm (premature) labor**: Labor that starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.\n*   **Premature rupture of membranes (PROM)**: Water breaks too early, which can raise the risk of infection if labor doesn't start soon afterwards.\n*   **Problems with the placenta**:\n    *   The placenta covers the cervix.\n    *   The placenta separates from the uterus before birth.\n    *   The placenta is attached too firmly to the uterus.\n*   **Labor that does not progress**: Labor stalls due to:\n    *   Weakened contractions.\n    *   Insufficient or delayed cervical dilation.\n    *   Incorrect baby positioning.\n    *   Baby size exceeds pelvic capacity.\n*   **Abnormal heart rate of the baby**: A fast or slow heart rate can indicate oxygen deprivation or other issues.\n*   **Problems with the umbilical cord**:\n    *   The cord gets caught on the baby's arm, leg, or neck.\n    *   The cord comes out before the baby does.\n*   **Problems with the position of the baby**:\n    *   Breech: Baby comes out feet first.\n    *   Shoulder dystocia: Baby's head comes out, but the shoulder gets stuck.\n*   **Perinatal asphyxia**: Baby doesn't get enough oxygen in the uterus, during labor or delivery, or just after birth.\n*   **Perineal tears**: Tearing of the vagina and surrounding tissues.\n*   **Excessive bleeding**: Delivery causes tears to the uterus or failure to deliver the placenta after giving birth to the baby.\n*   **Post-term pregnancy**: Pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks.\n\nIf you have problems in childbirth, your healthcare provider may need to give you medicines to induce or speed up labor, use tools to help guide the baby out of the birth canal, or deliver the baby by Cesarean section.\n\n---\n\n**Childbirth Problems**\n\nWhen everything goes well, childbirth is a beautiful process. But problems can happen, causing risks to both mother and baby. Some common complications during labor and delivery include:\n\n*   **Uterine tears**: Tears to the uterus can occur during delivery.\n*   **Retained placenta**: If you're not able to deliver the placenta after giving birth to the baby.\n\nIf you have problems in childbirth, your healthcare provider may need to give you medicines to induce or speed up labor, use tools to help guide the baby out of the birth canal, or deliver the baby by Cesarean section.\n\n**Common Childbirth Problems**\n\nSome common childbirth problems include:\n\n*   **Post-term pregnancy**: When your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks.\n*   **Birth injury in newborns**: Injuries that can occur during delivery, such as brachial plexus injuries or fractured clavicles.\n*   **Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)**: A condition where the baby inhales meconium during delivery.\n*   **Umbilical cord conditions**: Conditions that affect the umbilical cord, such as knots or prolapse.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose childbirth problems, your healthcare provider may use various tests and procedures, including:\n\n*   **Monitoring baby's heart rate during labor**: To ensure the baby is not in distress.\n*   **Ultrasound**: To check for any issues with the placenta or umbilical cord.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nTreatment for childbirth problems depends on the specific issue. Your healthcare provider may use various treatments, including:\n\n*   **Medicines to induce or speed up labor**: To help the baby move through the birth canal.\n*   **Tools to guide the baby out of the birth canal**: Such as forceps or vacuum extractors.\n*   **Cesarean section**: A surgical delivery where the baby is born through an incision in the mother's abdomen.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nChildbirth problems can be related to other issues, such as:\n\n*   **Placenta previa**: A condition where the placenta covers the cervix.\n*   **Placental abruption**: A condition where the placenta separates from the uterus.\n*   **Cervical length**: The length of the cervix during pregnancy can affect labor and delivery.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nSome specifics to consider when it comes to childbirth problems include:\n\n*   **Birth injury in newborns**: Injuries that can occur during delivery, such as brachial plexus injuries or fractured clavicles.\n*   **Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)**: A condition where the baby inhales meconium during delivery.\n*   **Umbilical cord conditions**: Conditions that affect the umbilical cord, such as knots or prolapse.\n\n**Images**\n\nVisual aids can help illustrate childbirth problems, including:\n\n*   **Breech birth**: A position where the baby's feet are positioned to come out first.\n*   **Episiotomy**: A surgical incision made in the perineum during delivery.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nResearch and statistics can provide valuable insights into childbirth problems, including:\n\n*   **PeriStats**: A database that tracks perinatal statistics.\n*   **Clinical trials**: Studies that investigate new treatments or interventions for childbirth problems.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nAcademic articles can provide in-depth information on childbirth problems, including:\n\n*   **Knowledge of obstetric danger signs and birth preparedness and complications readiness**: A study on the importance of knowing obstetric danger signs and being prepared for complications during labor and delivery.\n*   **Incidence, management, and outcomes of prolonged second stage of labour in low-resource settings**: A study on the incidence, management, and outcomes of prolonged second stage of labour in low-resource settings.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nIf you're experiencing childbirth problems, finding a qualified healthcare provider is crucial. You can find experts in the field through:\n\n*   **Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health**: A government agency that provides resources and support for women's health.\n*   **Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development**: A research institute that focuses on child health and development.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nEducating yourself on childbirth problems can help you prepare for labor and delivery. Patient handouts can provide valuable information, including:\n\n*   **Assisted delivery with forceps**: Information on assisted delivery using forceps.\n*   **Brachial plexus injury in newborns**: Information on brachial plexus injuries that can occur during delivery.\n\nBy understanding childbirth problems, you can better prepare for labor and delivery, and ensure a healthy outcome for both mother and baby.\n\n---\n\n**Childbirth Problems**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Assisted Delivery with Forceps**\n\n*   A surgical instrument used to assist in the delivery of a baby.\n*   Forceps are typically used when the mother is unable to push the baby out on her own, or if the baby is not moving down the birth canal quickly enough.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brachial Plexus Injury in Newborns**\n\n*   A type of injury that occurs when the nerves in a newborn's shoulder or arm are stretched or torn during delivery.\n*   This can cause temporary or permanent damage to the nerves, leading to weakness or paralysis in the affected area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breech Birth**\n\n*   A birth where the baby is positioned feet-first or buttocks-first in the womb.\n*   Breech births can be more challenging for both the mother and the healthcare provider, as it may require special equipment or techniques to safely deliver the baby.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Caput Succedaneum**\n\n*   A condition that occurs when a newborn's scalp becomes swollen due to pressure from the birth process.\n*   This is usually a temporary condition that resolves on its own within a few days of birth.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Episiotomy**\n\n*   A surgical incision made in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) to widen the vaginal opening during delivery.\n*   Episiotomies are typically performed to prevent severe tears or to facilitate a faster delivery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Fetal Scalp pH Testing**\n\n*   A medical test that measures the acidity of the baby's scalp to determine if they are experiencing distress or hypoxia (lack of oxygen).\n*   This test is usually performed during labor to ensure the baby's well-being.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Fractured Clavicle in Newborns**\n\n*   A type of injury that occurs when a newborn's collarbone breaks during delivery.\n*   This can happen if the baby is pulled too hard or if there is excessive pressure on the shoulder or arm area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Meconium Aspiration Syndrome**\n\n*   A condition that occurs when a newborn inhales meconium (the baby's first stool) during delivery.\n*   This can cause respiratory problems and may require medical intervention to clear the airways.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Placenta Previa**\n\n*   A condition where the placenta implants in the lower part of the uterus, covering the cervix.\n*   Placenta previa can increase the risk of bleeding during delivery and may require a cesarean section or other medical interventions.",

Labor is the process of giving birth.\n\n**Signs of Labor**\n\nLook out for these signs that you might be going into labor:\n\n* Contractions that are regular then start to come closer together\n* Leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina\n* Low, dull backache\n* Abdominal cramps\n\nCall your health care provider if you have any of these signs, even if it's before your due date. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**Stages of Labor**\n\nLabor happens in three stages:\n\n1. **First Stage**: Begins with contractions and continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide.\n2. **Second Stage**: The active stage, where you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward, your baby is born.\n3. **Third Stage**: You deliver the placenta, the organ that supplied food and oxygen to your baby during pregnancy.\n\n**Monitoring During Labor**\n\nMothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are able to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery. If there are complications, the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.\n\n---\n\n**Childbirth**\n\nWhen you are ready to have your baby, you'll go through labor. Labor is the process of giving birth.

    "title": "Childhood Leukemia | MedlinePlus",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodleukemia.html",
    "content": "**Childhood Leukemia**\n\n**What is Childhood Leukemia?**\n\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. It starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.\n\n*   White blood cells help your body fight infection\n*   Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\n*   Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding\n\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\n\n**Types of Leukemia in Children**\n\nThere are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing). They usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Most childhood leukemias are acute:\n\n*   **Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)**: The most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children.\n*   **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.\n\nOther types of leukemia are chronic (slow growing). They usually get worse over a longer period of time. They are rare in children:\n\n*   **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: In which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children.\n*   **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: In which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children.\n\nThere are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nLeukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia.\n\n*   Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia\n*   Past treatment with chemotherapy\n*   Exposure to radiation, including radiation therapy\n*   Having certain genetic conditions, such as:\n    *   Ataxia telangiectasia\n    *   Down syndrome\n    *   Fanconi anemia\n    *   Li-Fraumeni syndrome\n    *   Neurofibromatosis type 1\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome of the symptoms of leukemia may include:\n\n*   Feeling tired\n*   Fever or night sweats\n*   Easy bruising or bleeding\n*   Weight loss or loss of appetite\n*   Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\n\nOther leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia:\n\n*   A physical exam\n*   A medical history\n*   Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\n*   Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\n\nOnce there is a diagnosis of leukemia, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n**Treatments**\n\nThe treatments for leukemia depend on which type it is, how severe the leukemia is, the child's age, and other factors. Possible treatments might include:\n\n*   Chemotherapy\n*   Radiation therapy\n*   Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\n*   Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\n\nTreatment for childhood leukemia is often successful. But the treatments can cause complications right away or later in life. Children who survived leukemia will need follow-up care the rest of their lives to watch for and treat any complications they may have.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are no surefire ways to prevent leukemia, but there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   Avoid exposure to radiation\n*   Limit your use of chemicals\n*   Get regular check-ups with your healthcare provider\n\nWhile these steps won't guarantee that you'll never get leukemia, they can help lower your risk.\n\n---\n\n**Childhood Leukemia**\n\n**What is leukemia?**\n\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. It starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow, where your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.\n\n*   White blood cells help your body fight infection\n*   Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\n*   Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding\n\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood, crowding out the healthy blood cells and making it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\n\n**Types of Leukemia in Children**\n\nThere are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing), while others are chronic (slow growing). Most childhood leukemias are acute:\n\n*   **Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)**: The most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children. In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.\n*   **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.\n\nOther types of leukemia are chronic and rare in children:\n\n*   **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: In which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children.\n*   **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: In which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children.\n\nThere are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).\n\n**What Causes Leukemia in Children?**\n\nLeukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia.\n\n**Who is at Risk for Leukemia in Children?**\n\nThe factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia include:\n\n*   Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia\n*   Past treatment with chemotherapy\n*   Exposure to radiation, including radiation therapy\n*   Having certain genetic conditions, such as:\n    *   Ataxia telangiectasia\n    *   Down syndrome\n    *   Fanconi anemia\n    *   Li-Fraumeni syndrome\n    *   Neurofibromatosis type 1\n\n**Symptoms of Leukemia in Children**\n\nSome of the symptoms of leukemia may include:\n\n*   Feeling tired\n*   Fever or night sweats\n*   Easy bruising or bleeding\n*   Weight loss or loss of appetite\n*   Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\n\nOther leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type.

    "content": "**Childhood Absence Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Childhood Absence Epilepsy?**\n\nChildhood absence epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This condition begins in childhood, usually between ages 3 and 8.\n\n**Description**\n\nAffected children have absence seizures (also known as petit mal seizures), which are brief episodes of impaired consciousness that look like staring spells. During seizures, children are not aware of and do not respond to people or activities around them. The seizures usually last several seconds and they occur often, up to 200 times each day.\n\nSome affected individuals have febrile seizures before they develop childhood absence epilepsy. Febrile seizures are involuntary muscle contractions (convulsions) brought on by a high body temperature (fever).\n\nIn most people with childhood absence epilepsy, the absence seizures disappear in adolescence. However, some affected individuals continue to have absence seizures into adulthood, or they may develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which cause muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness, or myoclonic seizures, which are characterized by rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nChildhood absence epilepsy affects 2 to 8 in 100,000 children under age 15 each year. The condition is more common in girls than in boys.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe genetics of childhood absence epilepsy are complex and not completely understood. It is thought that multiple genetic changes or a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of the condition. Most genetic changes associated with childhood absence epilepsy are rare, having been found in only a small number of affected individuals. Each genetic change appears to play a role in some populations but not others.\n\nSeveral genes associated with childhood absence epilepsy provide instructions for making pieces (subunits) of the GABAA receptor protein. The GABAA receptor acts as a channel that allows negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) to cross the cell membrane. The influx of chloride ions in nerve cells (neurons) in developed brains creates an environment that blocks (inhibits) signaling between neurons and prevents the brain from being overloaded with too many signals.\n\nMutations in GABAA receptor subunit genes lead to production of altered subunit proteins that cannot form functional receptors, so fewer GABAA receptors are available. As a result, neurons become overloaded with signals. Researchers believe that the overstimulation of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures.\n\nProblems with another type of ion channel, called a calcium channel, are also associated with childhood absence epilepsy. Calcium channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells.\n\n---\n\n**Childhood Absence Epilepsy**\n\nThese channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Mutations that result in overactive calcium channels cause certain neurons to become overstimulated, triggering seizures.\n\n*   **GABRA1**: A gene associated with childhood absence epilepsy.\n*   **CACNA1H**, **GABRB3**, **GABRG2**, and **JRK**: Other genes linked to the condition.\n\nThe genetics of childhood absence epilepsy are complex and not completely understood. It is thought that multiple genetic changes or a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of the condition.\n\n*   **GABAA Receptor Subunits**: Several genes provide instructions for making pieces (subunits) of the GABAA receptor protein.\n*   **Calcium Channels**: Problems with calcium channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms into cells, are also associated with childhood absence epilepsy.\n\nBecause childhood absence epilepsy appears to be a complex disease without a single genetic cause, it does not have a straightforward pattern of inheritance. When associated with mutations in GABAA receptor or calcium channel genes, it seems to follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Childhood Absence Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Childhood Absence Epilepsy?**\n\nChildhood absence epilepsy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain's electrical activity, causing seizures that are characterized by brief losses of consciousness. The condition typically manifests in childhood and is often associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Absence epilepsy\n* Childhood Petit mal epilepsy\n* Pykno-epilepsy\n* Pyknolepsy\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Epilepsy, childhood absence 4\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Epilepsy, childhood absence, JRK related\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Epilepsy, childhood absence, susceptibility to, 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: EPILEPSY, CHILDHOOD ABSENCE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Epilepsy, childhood absence, susceptibility to, 5\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Epilepsy, childhood absence, susceptibility to, 6\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* EPILEPSY, CHILDHOOD ABSENCE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; ECA1\n* FEBRILE SEIZURES, FAMILIAL, 8; FEB8\n* EPILEPSY, CHILDHOOD ABSENCE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 6; ECA6\n* EPILEPSY, CHILDHOOD ABSENCE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 5; ECA5\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Crunelli V, Leresche N.

But they think death is something that happens to others, not to themselves or their own families.\n*   **Teens**: Understand that death is a stop of body functions and is permanent.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nIt is normal to grieve for the death of a close family member or friend. Expect your child to show a range of emotions and behaviors that can arise at unexpected times, such as:\n\n*   Sadness and crying.\n*   Anger. Your child may explode in anger, play too rough, have nightmares, or fight with other family members. Understand that your child doesn't feel in control.\n*   Acting younger. Many children will act younger, especially after a parent dies. They may want to be rocked to sleep by an adult or refuse to be left alone.\n*   Asking the same question over and over. They ask because they don't quite believe that someone they love has died and they are trying to accept what has happened.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nKeep the following in mind:\n\n*   Don't lie about what is going on. Children are smart. They pick up on dishonesty and will wonder why you are lying.\n*   Don't force children who are afraid to go to funerals. Find other ways for your children to remember and honor the deceased. For example, you can light a candle, pray, float a balloon to the sky, or look at photos.\n*   Let your child's teachers know what has happened so the child can get support at school.\n*   Give a lot of love and support to children as they grieve. Let them tell their stories and listen. This is one way for kids to deal with grief.\n*   Give children time to grieve. Avoid telling children to return to normal activities without the time to grieve. This may cause emotional problems later.\n*   Take care of your own grief. Your children look to you to understand how to handle grief and loss.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nAsk your child's health care provider for help if you are worried about your child. Children may be having real problems with grief if they are:\n\n*   Denying that someone has died\n*   Depressed and not interested in activities\n*   Not playing with their friends\n*   Refusing to be alone\n*   Refusing to attend school or has a drop in school performance\n*   Displaying changes in appetite\n*   Having trouble sleeping\n*   Continuing to act younger for a long time\n*   Saying that they are going to join the dead person\n\n---\n\n**Children and Grief**\n\nAs a parent, it's natural to wonder how your child will react to the death of a loved one. Children process grief differently than adults, and understanding their responses can help you console them.\n\n**How Children Think About Death Depends On How Old They Are**\n\nBefore talking to your child about death, consider their age and developmental stage:\n\n*   Infants and toddlers: aware that people are sad, but lack a real understanding of death\n*   Preschool children: think death is temporary and reversible\n*   Children over 5 years old: beginning to understand that death lasts forever, but believes it only happens to others\n*   Teens: understand that death is a permanent stop of body functions\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nGrieving for the loss of a close family member or friend is normal. Expect your child to exhibit a range of emotions and behaviors, such as:\n\n*   Sadness and crying\n*   Anger (exploding in anger, playing too rough, having nightmares, or fighting with other family members)\n*   Acting younger (wanting to be rocked to sleep by an adult or refusing to be left alone)\n*   Asking the same question over and over\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nTo support your child's grief:\n\n*   Don't lie about what's happening; children are smart and will detect dishonesty\n*   Avoid forcing children who are afraid to attend funerals; find alternative ways for them to remember and honor the deceased\n*   Inform their teachers so they can receive support at school\n*   Provide love, support, and a listening ear as they process their emotions\n*   Give them time to grieve; avoid pressuring them to return to normal activities too soon\n\n**Take Care of Your Own Grief**\n\nYour children look to you for guidance on handling grief and loss. Make sure to take care of your own emotional well-being during this difficult time.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf you're concerned about your child's reaction to a loved one's passing, consult with their healthcare provider. Signs that may indicate real problems with grief include:\n\n*   Denying the death\n*   Depression and lack of interest in activities\n*   Refusal to play with friends or attend school\n*   Changes in appetite or sleep patterns\n*   Acting younger for an extended period\n*   Expressing a desire to join the deceased\n\n---\n\n**Children and Grief**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Understanding Children's Grief**: According to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, children experience grief in a way that is similar to adults, but with some differences. They may not fully understand death, and their reactions can be influenced by their age and developmental stage.\n*   **Age-Related Reactions**: The website *& Adolescent Psychiatry* notes that children's reactions to grief vary depending on their age:\n    *   Infants (0-1 year): May not fully comprehend death, but may sense the emotional changes in their caregivers.\n    *   Toddlers (1-3 years): May exhibit behaviors such as clinging, tantrums, or regression to earlier stages of development.\n    *   Preschoolers (3-5 years): May ask questions about death and the deceased person, but may not fully understand the concept.\n    *   School-age children (6-12 years): May experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and guilt, and may seek more information about death and the grieving process.\n*   **Supporting Children's Grief**: The *& Adolescent Psychiatry* website emphasizes the importance of providing emotional support to children who are experiencing grief. This can include:\n    *   Validating their feelings and emotions\n    *   Encouraging open communication about death and the grieving process\n    *   Providing reassurance and stability in times of change or uncertainty\n    *   Fostering a sense of community and connection with others who may be experiencing similar emotions\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   McCabe ME, Serwint JR.

    "content": "**Chills**\n\n**What are Chills?**\n\nChills refer to feeling cold after being in a cold environment. The word can also refer to an episode of shivering along with paleness and feeling cold.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n*   Chills (shivering) may occur at the start of an infection.\n*   They are most often associated with a fever.\n*   Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation.\n*   They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold.\n*   Chills often predict the coming of a fever or an increase in the body's core temperature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCauses may include:\n\n*   Exposure to a cold environment\n*   Viral and bacterial infections\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFever (which can accompany chills) is the body's natural response to a variety of conditions, such as infections. If the fever is mild, 102°F (38.8°C) or less, with no side effects, you do not need to see a provider for treatment. You can treat the problem at home by drinking lots of fluids and getting plenty of rest.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nMedicines such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen are helpful in fighting a fever and chills.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n*   DO NOT bundle up in blankets if you have a high temperature.\n*   DO NOT use fans or air conditioners either. These measures will only make the chills worse and may even cause the fever to rise.\n\n**Home Care for a Child**\n\nIf the child's temperature is causing the child to be uncomfortable, give pain-relieving tablets or liquid. Non-aspirin pain-relievers such as acetaminophen are recommended. Ibuprofen may also be used. Follow the dosage guidelines on the package label.\n\nNote: DO NOT give aspirin to treat fever in a child younger than 19 years old because of the risk for Reye syndrome.\n\nOther things to help the child feel more comfortable include:\n\n*   Dress the child in light clothing\n*   Provide liquids\n*   Keep the room cool but not uncomfortable\n\nDO NOT use ice water or rubbing alcohol baths to reduce a child's temperature. These can cause shivering and even shock.\n\n---\n\n**Chills**\n\n**What are Chills?**\n\nChills refer to feeling cold after being in a cold environment. The word can also refer to an episode of shivering along with paleness and feeling cold.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n*   Chills (shivering) may occur at the start of an infection.\n*   They are most often associated with a fever.\n*   Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation.\n*   They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold.\n*   Chills often predict the coming of a fever or an increase in the body's core temperature.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Exposure to a cold environment\n*   Viral and bacterial infections\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf the fever is mild, 102°F (38.8°C) or less, with no side effects, you do not need to see a provider for treatment. You can treat the problem at home by drinking lots of fluids and getting plenty of rest.\n\nEvaporation cools the skin and reduces body temperature. Sponging with lukewarm water, about 70°F (21.1°C), may help reduce a fever. Cold water may increase the fever as it can trigger chills.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall the provider if:\n\n*   Symptoms such as stiffness of the neck, confusion, irritability, or sluggishness are present.\n*   Chills are accompanied by a bad cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or burning, or frequent urination.\n*   A child younger than 3 months has a temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or more.\n*   A child 3 months to 1 year has a fever that lasts more than 24 hours.\n*   The fever remains above 103°F (39.4°C) after 1 to 2 hours of home treatment.\n*   The fever does not improve after 3 days, or has lasted more than 5 days.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on how long the chills and accompanying symptoms (especially fever) have lasted.\n\n---\n\n**Chills**\n\nEvaporation cools the skin and reduces body temperature.

Are you actually shaking?\n* What has been the highest body temperature connected with the chills?\n* Did the chills happen only once, or are there many separate episodes?\n* How long does each attack last (for how many hours)?\n* Did chills occur within 4 to 6 hours after exposure to something that you or your child is allergic to?\n* Did chills begin suddenly? Do they occur repeatedly? How often (how many days between episodes of chills)?\n\nThe physical exam will include the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, chest, and abdomen. Body temperature will likely be checked.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Blood (CBC or blood differential) and urine tests (such as urinalysis)\n* Blood culture\n* Sputum culture\n* Urine culture\n* X-ray of the chest\n\nTreatment depends on how long the chills and accompanying symptoms (especially fever) have lasted.\n\n---\n\n**Chills**\n\n**What are chills?**\n\nChills are a symptom of having a fever.

Or, you may get medicine to numb the area, along with a medicine that will make you relaxed and sleepy.\n* A cut is made, either inside the mouth or outside under the chin. A pocket is created in front of the chin bone and under the muscles. The implant is placed inside.\n* The surgeon may use real bone or fat tissue, or an implant made out of silicone, Teflon, Dacron, or newer biological inserts.\n* The implant is often attached to the bone with stitches or screws.\n* Sutures are used to close the surgical cut. When the cut is inside the mouth, the scar can barely be seen.\n\nThe surgeon may also need to move some bones:\n\n* You will likely be under general anesthesia.\n* The surgeon will make a cut inside your mouth along the lower gum. This gives the surgeon access to the chin bone.\n* The surgeon uses a bone saw or chisel to make a second cut through the jaw bone. The jaw bone is moved and wired or screwed in place with a metal plate.\n* The cut is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied. Because the surgery is performed inside your mouth, you will not see any scars.\n* The procedure takes between 1 and 3 hours.\n\n\\n\\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nChin augmentation is mostly done to balance the appearance of the face by making the chin longer or bigger compared to the nose. The best candidates for chin augmentation are people with small or receding chins (microgenia), but who have a normal bite.\n\nTalk with a plastic surgeon if you are considering chin augmentation.

    "content": "**Chiropractic Care for Back Pain**\n\nChiropractic care is a way to treat health problems that affect the nerves, muscles, bones, and joints of the body. A health care provider who provides chiropractic care is called a chiropractor.\n\n**What Happens During a Visit to a Chiropractor?**\n\nThe first visit most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Your chiropractor will ask about your goals for treatment and your health history. You will be asked about your:\n\n* Past injuries and illnesses\n* Current health problems\n* Any medicines you are taking\n* Lifestyle\n* Diet\n* Sleep habits\n* Exercise\n* Mental stresses you might have\n* Use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco\n\nTell your chiropractor about any physical problems you may have that make it hard for you to do certain things. Also tell your chiropractor if you have any numbness, tingling, weakness, or any other nerve problems.\n\nAfter asking you about your health, your chiropractor will do a physical exam. This will include testing your spinal mobility (how well your spine moves). Your chiropractor may also do some tests, such as checking your blood pressure and taking x-rays. These tests look for problems that might be adding to your back pain.\n\nTreatment begins at the first or second visit in most cases.\n\nYou may be asked to lie on a special table, where the chiropractor does the spinal manipulations.\nThe most common treatment is manipulation done by hand. It involves moving a joint in your spine to the end of its range, followed by a light thrust. This is often called an \"adjustment.\" It realigns the bones of your spine to place them in a better position.\nThe chiropractor may also do other treatments, like massage and other work on soft tissues.\n\nSome people are a little achy, stiff, and tired for a few days after their manipulations. This is because their bodies are adjusting to their new alignment. You should not feel any pain from the manipulation.\n\n**How Many Treatments Will You Need?**\n\nMore than one session is most often needed to correct a problem. Treatments generally last several weeks. Your chiropractor may suggest 2 or 3 short sessions a week at first. These would last only about 10 to 20 minutes each. Once you start improving, your treatments may be just once a week. You and your chiropractor will talk about how effective the treatment is based on the goals you discussed in your first session.\n\n**What Conditions Does Chiropractic Treat Best?**\n\nChiropractic treatment is most effective for:\n\n* Subacute back pain (pain that has been present for 3 months or less)\n* Flare-ups of chronic (long-term) back pain\n* Chronic neck pain\n\n**Who Should Not Be Treated with Chiropractic?**\n\nPeople should not have chiropractic treatment in the parts of their bodies that are affected by:\n\n* Bone fractures or bone tumors\n* Severe arthritis\n* Bone or joint infections\n* Severe osteoporosis (thinning bones)\n* Severely pinched nerves with numbness, tingling, and weakness in your arms or legs\n* Acute neck pain with symptoms of pinched nerves\n\n---\n\n**Chiropractic Care for Back Pain**\n\nA health care provider who provides chiropractic care is called a chiropractor.\n\n**Hands-on Adjustment of the Spine**\n\nSpinal manipulation, also known as spinal mobilization, is the basis of chiropractic care. Most chiropractors also use other types of treatments as well.\n\n**What Happens During a Visit to a Chiropractor?**\n\nThe first visit most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes.

The name comes from the Greek word meaning \"done by hand.\" However, the roots of the profession can be traced back to the beginning of recorded time.\n\n**Founding of Chiropractic**\n\nChiropractic was developed by Daniel David Palmer, a self-taught healer in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer wanted to find a cure for disease and illness that did not use medicines. He studied the structure of the spine and the ancient art of moving the body with the hands (manipulation). Palmer started the Palmer School of Chiropractic, which still exists today.\n\n**Education**\n\nDoctors of chiropractic must complete 4 to 5 years at an accredited chiropractic college. Their training includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory, and clinical experience.\n\nThis education provides students with an in-depth understanding of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease.\n\nThe educational program includes training in the basic medical sciences, including anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. This education allows a doctor of chiropractic to both diagnose and treat people.\n\n**Chiropractic Philosophy**\n\nThe chiropractic profession believes in using natural and conservative methods of health care, without the use of medicines or surgery.\n\n**Practice**\n\nChiropractors treat people with muscle and bone problems, such as neck pain, low back pain, osteoarthritis, and spinal disk conditions.\n\nToday, most practicing chiropractors mix spinal adjustments with other therapies. These may include physical rehabilitation and exercise recommendations, mechanical or electrical therapies, and hot or cold treatments.\n\nChiropractors take a medical history in the same way as other health care providers. They then do an exam to look at:\n\n* Muscle strength versus weakness\n* Posture in different positions\n* Spinal range of motion\n* Structural problems\n\nThey also do standard nervous system and orthopedic tests common to all medical professions.\n\n**Regulation of the Profession**\n\nChiropractors are regulated at two different levels:\n\nBoard certification is conducted by the National Board of Chiropractor Examiners, which creates national standards for chiropractic care.\nLicensure takes place at the state level under specific state laws. Licensing and the scope of practice may differ from state to state. Most states require that chiropractors complete the National Chiropractic Board examination before they get their license. Some states also require chiropractors to pass a state examination. All states recognize training from chiropractic schools accredited by the Council of Chiropractic Education (CCE).\n\nAll states require that chiropractors complete a certain number of continuing education hours every year to keep their license.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDoctor of Chiropractic (DC)\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Chiropractic Association website.

All states recognize training from chiropractic schools accredited by the Council of Chiropractic Education (CCE).\n\nAll states require that chiropractors complete a certain number of continuing education hours every year to keep their license.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**History**\n\nChiropractic care dates back to 1895. The name comes from the Greek word meaning \"done by hand.\" However, the roots of the profession can be traced back to the beginning of recorded time.\n\nChiropractic was developed by Daniel David Palmer, a self-taught healer in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer wanted to find a cure for disease and illness that did not use medicines. He studied the structure of the spine and the ancient art of moving the body with the hands (manipulation). Palmer started the Palmer School of Chiropractic, which still exists today.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Doctor of Chiropractic (DC)",

    "content": "**Chlamydia Infections**\n\n**What is Chlamydia?**\n\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. Anyone can get chlamydia, and it often doesn't cause symptoms, so people may not know they have it.\n\n**How is Chlamydia Spread?**\n\nYou can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has chlamydia. It can also be passed to the baby during childbirth. If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Get Chlamydia?**\n\nChlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get infected with chlamydia if you don't consistently use a condom or if you have multiple partners.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Chlamydia?**\n\nChlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. But even if you don't have symptoms, you can still pass the infection to others.\n\nIf you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with someone who has chlamydia.\n\n**Symptoms in Women:**\n\n* Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell\n* A burning sensation when urinating\n\nIf the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal (belly) pain, pain during sex, nausea, and fever.\n\n**Symptoms in Men:**\n\n* Discharge from your penis\n* A burning sensation when urinating (peeing)\n* Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)\n\nIf the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding.\n\n**How is Chlamydia Diagnosed?**\n\nThere are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. Or your provider may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.\n\n**Who Should be Tested for Chlamydia?**\n\nYou should go to your provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia or if you have a partner who has an STI. If you are pregnant, you should get a test when you go to your first prenatal visit.\n\nPeople at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:\n\n* Sexually active women 25 and younger\n* Older women who have new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STI\n* Men who have sex with men (MSM)\n\n**What Other Problems Can Chlamydia Cause?**\n\nIn women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.\n\nMen often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.\n\nBoth men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body.\n\nBabies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.\n\nUntreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV.\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Chlamydia?**\n\nAntibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. It is important to take all the medicine that your provider prescribed for you. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.\n\nTo prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine.\n\nIt is common to get a repeat infection, so you need to get tested again about three months after treatment.\n\n**Can Chlamydia be Prevented?**\n\nThe only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\n* Start Here: About Chlamydia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) - PDF\n* Also in Spanish\n* Diagnosis and Tests: Chlamydia Test  (National Library of Medicine)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Related Issues: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)\n* Images: Chlamydial Infections (VisualDX)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n* FastStats: Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) (National Center for Health Statistics)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov: Chlamydia Infections  (National Institutes of Health)\n* Journal Articles: References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n* Article: Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections in...\n* Article: Pathogenicity and virulence of Chlamydia trachomatis: Insights into host interactions, immune...\n* Article: Active screening significantly improves detection of chlamydia in women's health clinics...\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Also in Spanish\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\n**For You**\n\n* Children: Chlamydia (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)\n* Women: Chlamydia (Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health)\n* Patient Handouts: Chlamydia (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Also in Spanish\n\n---\n\n**Chlamydia Infections**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who Can Get Chlamydia?**\n\nAnyone can get chlamydia.

As a result, you may become infected or pass the infection to your partner without knowing it.\n\nYou are more likely to become infected with chlamydia if you:\n\n* Have sex without wearing a male or female condom\n* Have more than one sexual partner\n* Use drugs or alcohol and then have sex\n* Have been infected with chlamydia before\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn men, chlamydia may cause symptoms similar to gonorrhea. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Burning feeling during urination\n* Discharge from the penis or rectum\n* Tenderness or pain in the testicles\n* Rectal discharge or pain\n\nSymptoms that may occur in women include:\n\n* Burning feeling during urination\n* Painful sexual intercourse\n* Rectal pain or discharge\n* Symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tubes), or liver inflammation similar to hepatitis\n* Vaginal discharge or bleeding after intercourse\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection, your health care provider will collect a sample for culture or a test called a nucleic acid amplification.\n\nIn the past, testing required an exam by a provider. Today, very accurate tests can be done on urine samples or vaginal swabs. Results take 1 to 2 days to come back. Your provider may also check if you have other types of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Common STIs are:\n\n* Gonorrhea\n* HIV\n* Syphilis\n* Hepatitis\n* Herpes\n\nEven if you have no symptoms, you may need a chlamydia test if you:\n\n* Are 24 years old or younger and sexually active (get tested every year)\n* Are any age and have an increased risk for chlamydia infection such as having a new sexual partner, more than one partner or a partner with an STI\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe most common treatment for chlamydia is an antibiotic.\n\nBoth you and your sexual partners must be treated.

    "content": "**Chlamydial Infections - Male**\n\nChlamydia infection in males is usually an infection of the urethra, the tube that drains urine from the bladder and passes through the penis. This type of infection is passed from one person to another during sexual contact.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChlamydia infection is caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. Both males and females may have chlamydia without having any symptoms, making it easy to become infected or pass the infection to your partner without knowing it.\n\nYou are more likely to become infected with chlamydia if you:\n\n* Have sex without wearing a male or female condom\n* Have more than one sexual partner\n* Use drugs or alcohol and then have sex\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome common symptoms of chlamydia infection in males include:\n\n* Difficulty urinating, which may include painful urination or burning during urination\n* Discharge from the penis\n* Redness, swelling, or itching of the opening of the urethra at the tip of the penis\n* Swelling and tenderness of one or both testicles\n\nChlamydia and gonorrhea often occur together. The symptoms of chlamydia infection may be similar to symptoms of gonorrhea, but they continue even after treatment for gonorrhea is finished.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection, your health care provider may suggest a lab test called PCR. Your provider will take a sample of discharge from the penis, which is then sent to a lab to be tested. Results will take 1 to 2 days to come back. Alternatively, your provider may collect a urine sample for a test called nucleic acid amplification.\n\nYour provider may also check you for other types of infections, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV.\n\nMen who do not have symptoms of a chlamydia infection may sometimes be tested.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nChlamydia can be treated with a variety of antibiotics. Common side effects of these antibiotics include:\n\n* Nausea\n* Upset stomach\n* Diarrhea\n\nYou and your sexual partner must be treated to avoid passing the infections back and forth. Even partners without symptoms need to be treated. You and your partner should finish all of the antibiotics, even if you feel better.\n\nBecause gonorrhea often occurs with chlamydia, treatment for gonorrhea is often given at the same time.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment with antibiotics is almost always successful. If your symptoms do not improve quickly, make sure you are also being treated for gonorrhea and other infections spread through sexual contact.\n\nSevere infections or infections that are not treated quickly may rarely cause scarring of the urethra. This problem can make it harder to pass urine and may require surgery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent infection, practice safer sex. This means taking steps before and during sex that can help prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving one to your partner.\n\nBefore having sex:\n\n* Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories.\n* Don't feel forced into having sex.\n* Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner.\n\nBe sure that your sexual partner does not have any sexually transmitted infection (STI). Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs. Share the test results with each other.\n\nIf you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know before you have sex. Allow them to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.\n* Make sure that the condom is in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.\n* Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with surrounding skin areas. A condom reduces your risk but does not fully eliminate it.\n\nOther tips include:\n\n* Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.\n* Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.\n* Polyurethane condoms are less prone to breaking than latex condoms, but they cost more.\n* Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may irritate vaginal or penile tissue and thus increase the chance of HIV transmission.\n* Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSTD - chlamydia male; Sexually transmitted disease - chlamydia male; Urethritis - chlamydia\n\n**References**\n\nBabu TM, Urban MA, Augenbraun MH.

It is usually taken once a day for 3 to 6 weeks, but sometimes may be taken intermittently, as a single dose once every 2 weeks, or as a single dose once a month. The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer you have.\n\nTake chlorambucil at around the same time every day.

Talk to your doctor about this risk.\n\nChlorambucil may interfere with the normal menstrual cycle (period) in women and may stop sperm production in men.

Women who are pregnant should tell their doctors before they begin taking this drug. You should not plan to have children while receiving chemotherapy or for a while after treatments. (Talk to your doctor for further details.) Use a reliable method of birth control to prevent pregnancy. If you become pregnant while taking chlorambucil, call your doctor immediately.

    "content": "**Chloride Blood Test**\n\nA chloride blood test measures the amount of chloride in your blood. Chloride is a type of electrolyte that helps control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body.\n\nYou get chloride through the food you eat, mainly found in salt. Your body gets rid of the extra chloride in your urine. Chloride helps control the amount of fluid in your body and maintains healthy blood volume and blood pressure.\n\nMany diseases and other factors can cause abnormal chloride levels. Chloride is often measured with other electrolytes to diagnose or monitor conditions such as kidney disease, heart failure, liver disease, and high blood pressure.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nYou usually get a chloride test as part of a routine blood screening to check your general health. It's also used to help monitor or diagnose conditions related to an imbalance of acids or fluids in your body.\n\n**Why do I need a chloride blood test?**\n\nYour health care provider may have ordered a chloride blood test as part of an electrolyte panel, a routine blood test that measures chloride and other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate.\n\nYou may also need a chloride blood test if you have symptoms of an acid or fluid imbalance, including:\n\n* Vomiting over a long period of time\n* Diarrhea\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Dehydration\n* Trouble breathing\n\n**What happens during a chloride blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nHigh levels of chloride (hyperchloremia) may be a sign of:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Kidney disease\n* Metabolic acidosis\n\nLow levels of chloride (hypochloremia) may be a sign of:\n\n* Heart failure\n* Lung disease\n* Addison disease\n* Metabolic alkalosis\n\n---\n\n**Chloride Blood Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Are there any special instructions I need to follow before the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf your provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThere are many reasons why your chloride levels may not be in the normal range.\n\n* High levels of chloride (hyperchloremia) may be a sign of:\n\t+ Dehydration\n\t+ Kidney disease\n\t+ Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n* Low levels of chloride (hypochloremia) may be a sign of:\n\t+ Heart failure\n\t+ Lung disease\n\t+ Addison disease, a condition in which your body's adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain types of hormones. It can cause various symptoms, including weakness, dizziness, weight loss, and dehydration.\n\t+ Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes.\n\nIf your chloride levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Many things can affect your chloride levels, such as drinking too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines, such as antacids, can cause abnormal results. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a chloride blood test?**\n\nUrine also contains some chloride. Your provider may also recommend a urine chloride test to get more information about your chloride levels.",

This article provides information on the causes, symptoms, and treatment of chlorine poisoning.\n\n**Causes of Chlorine Poisoning**\n\nChlorine reacts with water in and out of the body to form hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid, both of which are extremely poisonous. Chlorine is present in:\n\n*   Gas released when mixing bleach with some powdered cleansing products and ammonia (chloramine gas)\n*   Gas released when opening a partially filled industrial container of chlorine tablets that have been sitting for several months\n*   Mild cleaners\n*   Some bleach products\n*   Swimming pool water (and tablets used in swimming pool water)\n\n**Symptoms of Chlorine Poisoning**\n\nChlorine poisoning can cause symptoms in many parts of the body, including:\n\n*   **AIRWAYS AND LUNGS**\n    *   Breathing difficulty (from breathing in the chlorine)\n    *   Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty)\n    *   Water filling the lungs (pulmonary edema)\n*   **BLOOD**\n    *   Severe change in acid level of the blood (pH balance), which leads to damage in all of the body organs\n*   **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n    *   Loss of vision\n    *   Severe pain in the throat\n    *   Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n*   **GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM**\n    *   Blood in the stool\n    *   Burns of the food pipe (esophagus)\n    *   Severe abdominal pain\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Vomiting blood\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nIf you or someone you are with has an exposure to chlorine, call your local emergency number (such as 911) or reach out to your local poison control center. They can provide guidance on how to treat the poisoning.\n\nTo prevent chlorine poisoning, make sure to handle chlorine-containing products safely and follow proper instructions for use.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website\n*   Hoyte C.

Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by the poison control center or a health care provider.\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a provider. Do not give water or milk if the patient is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.\n\nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen delivered through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n*   Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n*   Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n*   Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is only done when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of chlorine has been swallowed.\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The sooner a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website.

    "content": "**Chloroquine**\n\n*pronounced as (klor' oh kwin)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nChloroquine phosphate is used to prevent and treat malaria. It is also used to treat amebiasis. Chloroquine phosphate is in a class of drugs called antimalarials and amebicides. It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria and amebiasis.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nChloroquine phosphate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. For prevention of malaria in adults, one dose is usually taken once a week on exactly the same day of the week. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take for each dose. One dose is taken beginning 2 weeks before traveling to an area where malaria is common, while you are in the area, and then for 8 weeks after you return from the area. If you are unable to start taking chloroquine for 2 weeks before traveling, your doctor may tell you to take double the dose right away (for the first dose).\n\nFor treatment of sudden, severe attacks of malaria in adults, one dose is usually taken right away, followed by half the dose 6 to 8 hours later and then half the dose once a day for the next 2 days.\n\nFor prevention and treatment of malaria in infants and children, the amount of chloroquine phosphate is based on the child's weight. Your doctor will calculate this amount and tell you how much chloroquine phosphate your child should receive.\n\nFor treatment of amebiasis, one dose is usually taken for 2 days and then half the dose every day for 2 to 3 weeks. It is usually taken in combination with other amebicides.\n\nChloroquine phosphate may cause an upset stomach. Take chloroquine phosphate with food.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use chloroquine phosphate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nChloroquine has been studied for the treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nThe FDA had approved an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on March 28, 2020 to allow distribution of chloroquine for the treatment adults and adolescents who weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg) and who are hospitalized with COVID-19, but who are unable to participate in a clinical study. However, FDA canceled this on June 15, 2020 because clinical studies showed that chloroquine is unlikely to be effective for treatment of COVID-19 in these patients and some serious side effects, such as irregular heartbeat were reported.\n\nThe FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) state that chloroquine should ONLY be taken for the treatment of COVID-19 under the direction of a doctor in a clinical study. Do not buy this medication online without a prescription. If you experience irregular heartbeats, dizziness, or fainting while taking chloroquine, call 911 for emergency medical treatment. If you have other side effects, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\nDo not take chloroquine that is strictly intended for veterinary use – such as to treat fish in aquariums or for use in other animals – to treat or prevent COVID-19. The FDA reports that serious injury and death have been reported in people misusing these preparations.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nIf you experience irregular heartbeats, dizziness, or fainting while taking chloroquine, call 911 for emergency medical treatment. If you have other side effects, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\nDo not take chloroquine that is strictly intended for veterinary use – such as to treat fish in aquariums or for use in other animals – to treat or prevent COVID-19. The FDA reports that serious injury and death have been reported in people misusing these preparations.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are unable to start taking chloroquine for 2 weeks before traveling, your doctor may tell you to take double the dose right away (for the first dose).\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nChloroquine phosphate may cause an upset stomach. Take chloroquine phosphate with food.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.

Your doctor may order certain lab tests and electrocardiograms (EKG, a test to monitor your heart rate and rhythm) to check your response to chloroquine phosphate. Your doctor will also test your reflexes to see if you have muscle weakness that may be caused by the drug.\n\n---\n\n**Chloroquine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Monitoring Your Response**\n\nYour doctor will monitor your heart rate and rhythm, as well as test your reflexes, to check for muscle weakness caused by the drug.\n\n\\n\\n**Frequent Eye Exams**\n\nIf you're taking chloroquine phosphate for a long period of time, your doctor will recommend frequent eye exams. It's crucial that you keep these appointments, as the drug can cause serious vision problems. If you experience any changes in vision, stop taking the medication and call your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n**Medication Refills**\n\nDo not let anyone else take your medication.

    "content": "**Chlorothiazide**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nChlorothiazide is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Chlorothiazide is used to treat edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) caused by various medical problems, including heart, kidney, and liver disease and to treat edema caused by using certain medications including estrogen and corticosteroids.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nChlorothiazide comes as a tablet and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken once or twice a day. When used to treat hypertension, take chlorothiazide around the same time(s) every day. When used to treat edema, chlorothiazide may be taken daily or only on certain days of the week. Take this medication with meals or a snack.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nChlorothiazide may also be used to treat patients with diabetes insipidus and certain electrolyte disturbances and to prevent kidney stones in patients with high levels of calcium in their blood.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nContinue to take chlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking chlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Chlorothizide controls high blood pressure and edema but does not cure these conditions.\n*   Continue to take chlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking chlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Chlorothiazide: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking chlorothiazide, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to chlorothiazide, sulfonamide antibiotic medications, penicillin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in chlorothiazide tablets or suspension. Ask your pharmacist or check the patient information for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking chlorothiazide. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nIf you are taking cholestyramine or colestipol, take them 1 hour before or 4 hours after taking chlorothiazide.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with chlorothiazide: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking chlorothiazide. Do not start any of these medications while taking chlorothiazide without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have kidney disease. Your doctor may tell you not to take chlorothiazide.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, diabetes, high cholesterol, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, a chronic inflammatory condition), gout, or liver, or parathyroid disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking chlorothiazide, call your doctor immediately.\n\nPlan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Chlorothiazide may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nYou should know that chlorothiazide may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking chlorothiazide. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up. Alcohol can add to these side effects.\n\n\\n\\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nIf your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, or to eat or drink increased amounts of potassium-rich foods (e.g., bananas, prunes, raisins, and orange juice) in your diet, follow these instructions carefully.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nTell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* frequent urination\n* muscle spasms\n* blurred vision\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* vomiting\n* loss of appetite\n* headache\n* hair loss\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Chlorpheniramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nChlorpheniramine relieves red, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; itchy nose or throat; and runny nose caused by allergies, hay fever, and the common cold. Chlorpheniramine helps control the symptoms of cold or allergies but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Chlorpheniramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nChlorpheniramine comes as a tablet, a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet and capsule, a chewable tablet, and a liquid to take by mouth. The regular capsules and tablets, chewable tablets, and liquid are usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed. The extended-release (long-acting) tablets and capsules are usually taken twice a day in the morning and evening as needed.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chlorpheniramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nChlorpheniramine comes alone and in combination with fever and pain reducers, expectorants, cough suppressants, and decongestants. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using 2 or more products at the same time.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nNonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain chlorpheniramine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4-11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.\n\nIf you are giving chlorpheniramine or a combination product that contains chlorpheniramine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give chlorpheniramine products that are made for adults to children.\n\nBefore you give a chlorpheniramine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.\n\nIf you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake chlorpheniramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Headache\n*   Stomach upset\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore chlorpheniramine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze liquid medicine. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.\n\nDispose of chlorpheniramine properly. Do not flush prescription medications down the toilet or drain unless instructed to do so. If your local waste management company has a \"drug take-back\" program, use it to dispose of unwanted medications safely.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you have taken too much chlorpheniramine and are experiencing symptoms such as seizures, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. If you have taken an overdose of chlorpheniramine and are awake, call your doctor or pharmacist for advice on what to do.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nChlorpheniramine is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, extended-release tablets and capsules, chewable tablets, and a liquid. The dosage and administration instructions may vary depending on the form of chlorpheniramine you are taking.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about chlorpheniramine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. They can provide you with more information and help you make informed decisions about your treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Chlorpheniramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/6)**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Take Chlorpheniramine**\n\n*   If you are taking the liquid, use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication. Do not use a household spoon.\n*   If you are using the extended-release tablets or capsules, swallow them whole. Do not break, crush, chew, or open them.\n\n**Instructions for Use**\n\n*   The regular capsules and tablets, chewable tablets, and liquid are usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed.\n*   The extended-release (long-acting) tablets and capsules are usually taken twice a day in the morning and evening as needed.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n*   Do not take more or less of chlorpheniramine or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using 2 or more products at the same time.

These movements may continue if they are not treated quickly and correctly.\n\nIn rare cases, an overdose can cause more serious symptoms. Nervous system symptoms may be permanent. The most serious side effects are usually due to damage to the heart. If heart damage can be stabilized, recovery is likely. Life threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death.

Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking chlorpromazine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\n*   If you miss a dose of chlorpromazine, take it as soon as you remember.\n*   However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses of chlorpromazine at once unless directed to do so by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Side effects from chlorpromazine may include:\n    *   Dry mouth\n    *   Constipation\n    *   Weight gain\n    *   Increased appetite\n    *   Fatigue\n    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness when standing up\n    *   Muscle stiffness\n    *   Restlessness\n    *   Confusion\n    *   Difficulty speaking\n    *   Difficulty swallowing\n    *   Nausea and vomiting\n    *   Abdominal cramps\n    *   Diarrhea\n    *   Increased sweating\n    *   Hair loss\n    *   Changes in menstrual cycle\n*   If any of these side effects are severe or continue, talk to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\n*   Keep chlorpromazine out of the reach of children.\n*   Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.\n*   Do not store in the bathroom.

It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain and other parts of the body.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   Chlorpromazine comes as a tablet to take by mouth.\n*   Chlorpromazine is usually taken two to four times a day.\n*   When chlorpromazine is used to control nausea and vomiting, it is usually taken every 4-6 hours as needed.\n*   When chlorpromazine is used to relieve nervousness before surgery, it is usually taken 2-3 hours before surgery.\n*   When chlorpromazine is used to relieve hiccups, it is usually taken 3-4 times a day for up to 3 days or until the hiccups stop.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking chlorpromazine:\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to chlorpromazine; other phenothiazines such as fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine (Compazine), promethazine (Phenergan), thioridazine, and trifluoperazine; or any other medications.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking chlorpromazine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma; emphysema (a lung disease that causes shortness of breath); an infection in your lungs or bronchial tubes (tubes that bring air to the lungs); trouble keeping your balance; glaucoma (condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision); breast cancer; pheochromocytoma (tumor on a small gland near the kidneys); seizures; an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG; test that records electrical activity in the brain); any condition that affects the production of blood cells by your bone marrow; or heart, liver, or kidney disease. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had to stop taking a medication for mental illness due to severe side effects or if you plan to work with organophosphorus insecticides (a type of chemical used to kill insects).\n*   If you will be using chlorpromazine to treat nausea and vomiting, it is important to tell your doctor about any other symptoms you are experiencing, especially listlessness; drowsiness; confusion; aggression; seizures; headaches; problems with vision, hearing, speech, or balance; stomach pain or cramps; or constipation. Nausea and vomiting that is experienced along with these symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition that should not be treated with chlorpromazine.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy, or if you plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking chlorpromazine, call your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore taking chlorpromazine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to chlorpromazine; other phenothiazines such as fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine (Compazine), promethazine (Phenergan), thioridazine, and trifluoperazine; or any other medications.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking chlorpromazine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma; emphysema (a lung disease that causes shortness of breath); an infection in your lungs or bronchial tubes (tubes that bring air to the lungs); trouble keeping your balance; glaucoma (condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision); breast cancer; pheochromocytoma (tumor on a small gland near the kidneys); seizures; an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG; test that records electrical activity in the brain); any condition that affects the production of blood cells by your bone marrow; or heart, liver, or kidney disease.

Nausea and vomiting that is experienced along with these symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition that should not be treated with chlorpromazine.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy, or if you plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking chlorpromazine, call your doctor. Chlorpromazine may cause problems in newborns following delivery if it is taken during the last months of pregnancy.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking chlorpromazine.\n\nIf you are having a myelogram (x-ray examination of the spine), tell your doctor and the radiographer that you are taking chlorpromazine. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take chlorpromazine for 2 days before the myelogram and for one day after the myelogram.\n\nYou should know that this medication may make you drowsy and may affect your thinking and movements. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcohol during your treatment with chlorpromazine. Alcohol can make the side effects of chlorpromazine worse.\n\nPlan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Chlorpromazine may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nYou should know that chlorpromazine may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, and fainting, especially when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is most common at the beginning of treatment with chlorpromazine, especially after the first dose. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n\nYou should know that chlorpromazine may make it harder for your body to cool down when it gets very hot. Tell your doctor if you plan to do vigorous exercise or be exposed to extreme heat.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n---\n\n**Chlorpromazine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are taking chlorpromazine on a regular schedule and you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nChlorpromazine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* dizziness, feeling unsteady, or having trouble keeping your balance\n* blank facial expression\n* shuffling walk\n* restlessness\n* agitation\n* nervousness\n* unusual, slowed, or uncontrollable movements of any part of the body\n* difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* increased appetite\n* weight gain\n* breast milk production\n* breast enlargement\n* missed menstrual periods\n* decreased sexual ability\n* changes in skin color\n* dry mouth\n* stuffed nose\n* difficulty urinating\n* widening or narrowing of the pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes)\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while you are taking this medication.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website https://goo.gl/c4Rm4p for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. https://www.upandaway.org\n\n---\n\n**Chlorpromazine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you or someone you know has taken too much chlorpromazine, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

    "content": "**Chlorpropamide**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nChlorpropamide is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Chlorpropamide is in a class of medications called sulfonylureas. Chlorpropamide lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Chlorpropamide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).\n\n**Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nChlorpropamide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with breakfast once a day. Tell your doctor if chlorpropamide upsets your stomach. Your doctor may tell you to take smaller doses of chlorpropamide twice a day with meals. To help you remember to take chlorpropamide, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chlorpropamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of chlorpropamide and gradually increase your dose if needed. After you have taken chlorpropamide for some time, chlorpropamide may not control your blood sugar as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medication as needed so that the medication will work best for you. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and if your blood sugar test results have been higher or lower than normal at any time during your treatment.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nDo not stop taking chlorpropamide without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Chlorpropamide: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Important:** Take chlorpropamide exactly as directed by your doctor.

Typically, infants only breathe through their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying.\n\nChoanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery.

This blockage can be complete or partial.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of choanal atresia is unknown, but it is believed to occur during fetal development. It affects both sides in about 50% of cases.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants with bilateral choanal atresia will have difficulty breathing and may turn blue due to lack of oxygen. One-sided atresia may not cause symptoms, and the infant may be sent home without a diagnosis.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nChoanal atresia is generally diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital. A physical examination, imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans, and nasal endoscopy may be used to diagnose the condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for choanal atresia depends on the severity of the blockage and whether it affects one or both sides. In some cases, a small tube may be inserted into the nostril to help breathe. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to create a new passage.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for choanal atresia.\n\n**References**\n\n* Elluru RG.

    "content": "**Choking - Adult or Child Over 1 Year**\n\nChoking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway).\n\nA choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChoking can be caused by any of the following:\n\n*   Eating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that do not fit well\n*   Drinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)\n*   Being unconscious and breathing in vomit\n*   Breathing in small objects (young children)\n*   Injury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)\n*   Swallowing problems after a stroke\n*   Enlarged tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat\n*   Problems with the esophagus (food pipe or swallowing tube)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen an older child or adult is choking, they will often grab their throat with the hand. If the person does not do this, look for these danger signs:\n\n*   Inability to speak\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Noisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling\n*   Weak, ineffective coughing\n*   Bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n*   Loss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared\n\n**First Aid**\n\nFirst ask, \"Are you choking? Can you speak?\" DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can dislodge the object. Encourage the person to keep coughing to dislodge the object.\n\nIf the person cannot speak or is having a hard time breathing, you need to act fast to help the person. You can perform abdominal thrusts, back blows, or both.\n\nTo perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver):\n\n*   Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around the person's waist.\n*   Make a fist with one hand. Place the thumb side of your fist just above the person's navel, well below the breastbone.\n*   Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand.\n*   Make a quick, upward and inward thrust with your fist.\n*   Check if the object is dislodged.\n\nTo perform back blows:\n\n*   Stand behind the person. For child, you may have to kneel.\n*   Wrap one arm around to support the person's upper body. Lean the person forward until the chest is about parallel to the ground.\n*   Use the heel of your other hand to deliver a firm blow between the person's shoulder blades.\n*   Check if the object is dislodged.\n\nTo perform abdominal thrusts AND back blows (5-and-5 approach):\n\n*   Give 5 back blows, as described above.\n*   If the object is not dislodged, give 5 abdominal thrusts.\n*   Keep performing the 5-and-5 until the object is dislodged or the person loses consciousness.\n\n**IF THE PERSON FAINTS OR LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS**\n\nLower the person to the floor. Call 911 or the local emergency number or tell someone else to do so. Begin CPR. Chest compressions may help dislodge the object. Abdominal thrusts are for a conscious choking victim. Chest compressions are for an unconscious choking victim.\n\nIf you see something blocking the airway and it is loose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, DO NOT try to grasp it. This can push the object farther into the airway.\n\n**FOR PREGNANT OR OBESE PEOPLE**\n\nWrap your arms around the person's CHEST. Place your fist on the MIDDLE of the breastbone between the nipples. Make firm, backward thrusts.\n\nAfter removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help. Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. Complications can occur not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\n*   DO NOT interfere if the person is coughing forcefully, is able to speak, or is able to breathe in and out adequately.\n*   But, be ready to act right away if the person's symptoms get worse.\n*   DO NOT force open the person's mouth to try to grasp and pull out the object if the person is conscious. Perform abdominal thrusts and/or back blows to try to expel the object.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek medical help right away if you find someone unconscious.\n\nWhen the person is choking:\n\n*   Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid/CPR.\n*   If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid/CPR.\n\nAfter the object is successfully dislodged, the person should see a health care provider because complications can arise.\n\nIn the days following a choking episode, contact the provider right away if the person develops:\n\n*   A cough that does not go away\n*   Fever\n*   Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing\n\nThe above signs may indicate:\n\n*   The object entered the lung instead of being expelled\n*   Injury to the voice box (larynx)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent choking:\n\n*   Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly.\n*   Make sure dentures fit properly.\n*   Do not drink too much alcohol before or during eating.\n*   Keep small objects away from young children.\n\n---\n\n**Choking**\n\nA choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs.

This article discusses choking in infants.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChoking in infants is usually caused by breathing in a small object that the baby has placed in their mouth, such as a button, coin, balloon, toy part, or watch battery. Choking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway. A complete blockage is a medical emergency. A partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe danger signs of choking are:\n\n*   Bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n*   Difficulty breathing -- ribs and chest pull inward\n*   Loss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared\n*   Inability to cry or make much sound\n*   Weak, ineffective coughing\n*   Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling\n\n**First Aid**\n\nDO NOT perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway.\n\nIf your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Lay the infant face down, along your forearm. Use your thigh or lap for support.\n2.  Hold the infant's chest in your hand and the jaw with your fingers. Point the infant's head downward, lower than the body.\n3.  Give up to 5 quick, forceful blows between the infant's shoulder blades. Use the palm of your free hand.\n\nIf the object does not come out of the airway after 5 blows:\n\n1.  Turn the infant face-up. Use your thigh or lap for support. Support the head.\n2.  Place 2 fingers on the middle of the breastbone just below the nipples.\n3.  Give up to 5 quick thrusts down, compressing the chest one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n\nContinue 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or the infant loses alertness (becomes unconscious).\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf an infant is choking:\n\n*   Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid.\n*   If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid.\n\nAlways call your doctor after a child has been choking, even if you successfully remove the object from the airway and the infant seems fine.\n\n---\n\n**Choking in Infants**\n\n**Causes**\n\nChoking in infants is usually caused by breathing in a small object that the baby has placed in their mouth, such as a button, coin, balloon, toy part, or watch battery.\n\nChoking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway.\n\nA complete blockage is a medical emergency.\nA partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air.\n\nWhen a person does not get enough air, permanent brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes.
