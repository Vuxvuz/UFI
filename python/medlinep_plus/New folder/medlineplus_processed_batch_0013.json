They may be given by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or skin patch. They cause you to have a loss of feeling or awareness.\n\n**What is Anesthesia Used For?**\n\nAnesthesia may be used in minor procedures, such as filling a tooth. It could be used during childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies. And it is used during minor and major surgeries.\n\nIn some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia.\n\n**Types of Anesthesia**\n\nThere are several different types of anesthesia:\n\n* **Local Anesthesia**: numbs a small part of the body. It might be used on a tooth that needs to be pulled or on a small area around a wound that needs stitches. You are awake and alert during local anesthesia.\n* **Regional Anesthesia**: is used for larger areas of the body such as an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. Regional anesthesia may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries.\n* **General Anesthesia**: affects the whole body. It makes you unconscious and unable to move. It is used during major surgeries, such as heart surgery, brain surgery, back surgery, and organ transplants.\n\n**Risks of Anesthesia**\n\nAnesthesia is generally safe. But there can be risks, especially with general anesthesia, including:\n\n* Heart rhythm or breathing problems\n* Allergic reaction to the anesthesia\n* Delirium after general anesthesia. Delirium makes people confused. They may be unclear about what is happening to them.\n* Awareness when someone is under general anesthesia. This usually means that the person hears sounds. But sometimes they can feel pain.\n\n**Start Here**\n\nIf you are considering anesthesia for a procedure, it's essential to understand the different types of anesthesia and their risks. Anesthesiologists are specialized doctors who administer anesthesia.

    "content": "**Aneurysm in the Brain**\n\nAn aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. When an aneurysm occurs in a blood vessel of the brain, it is called an intracranial aneurysm. These usually occur around or under the part of the brain called the cerebrum and, when this is true, are called a cerebral aneurysm.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAneurysms around the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital). Or, it may develop later in life.\n\nThere are many types of brain aneurysms. The most common type is called a berry aneurysm. This type can vary in size from a few millimeters (mm) to over a centimeter (cm). Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 cm or 1 inch (in). These are more common in adults. Berry aneurysms, especially when there is more than one, are sometimes passed down through families.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n* Family history of cerebral aneurysms\n* Medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, and endocarditis\n* High blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamine drug use\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.\n\nA brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as \"the worst headache of my life.\" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started.\n\nSymptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn eye exam may show signs of increased pressure in the brain, including swelling of the optic nerve or bleeding into the retina of the eye. A clinical exam may show abnormal eye movement, speech, strength, or sensation.\n\nThe following tests may be used to diagnose an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm and determine the cause of bleeding in the brain:\n\n* Cerebral angiography or spiral CT angiogram (CTA) of the head to show the location and size of the aneurysm\n* Spinal tap\n* CT scan of the head\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* MRI of the head or MRI angiogram (MRA)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTwo common methods are used to repair a brain aneurysm.\n\nClipping is done during open brain surgery (craniotomy).\nEndovascular repair is most often done. It usually involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (called coiling and stenting) into or around the aneurysm. This is a less invasive and most common way to treat aneurysms.\n\nNot all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Those that are very small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in) are less likely to break open.\n\nYour health care provider will help you decide whether or not it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open. Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location.\n\nA ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve:\n\n* Being admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU)\n* Complete bed rest and activity restrictions\n* Drainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage)\n* Medicines to prevent seizures\n* Medicines to control headaches and blood pressure\n* Medicines to prevent vasospasm, which is a constriction of the arteries of your brain, leading to decreased blood flow\n\nOnce the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke from a blood vessel spasm.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do depends on many things. People who are in a deep coma after an aneurysm rupture do not do as well as those with less severe symptoms.\n\nRuptured cerebral aneurysms are often deadly. Of those who survive, some have no permanent disability. Others have moderate to severe disability.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of aneurysm in the brain may include:\n\n* Increased pressure inside the skull\n* Hydrocephalus, which is caused by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain\n* Loss of movement in one or more parts of the body\n* Loss of sensation of any part of the face or body\n* Seizures\n* Stroke\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding around the brain)\n* Intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a sudden or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, or any other nervous system symptom.\n\nAlso call if you have a headache that is unusual for you, especially if it is severe or your worst headache ever.\n\n---\n\n**Aneurysm in the Brain**\n\nAn aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out.

Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Hardening of arteries (atherosclerosis), trauma, and infection can all injure the blood vessel wall and cause cerebral aneurysms.\n\nBrain aneurysms are relatively common. One in 50 people has a brain aneurysm, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture.\n\nRisk factors include:\n\n* Family history of cerebral aneurysms\n* Medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, and endocarditis\n* High blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamine drug use\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms.

Treating high blood pressure may reduce the chance that an existing aneurysm will rupture. Controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may reduce the likelihood of some types of aneurysms.\n\nPeople who are known to have an aneurysm may need regular visits with their provider to make sure the aneurysm is not changing size or shape. If unruptured aneurysms are discovered in time, they can be treated before causing problems or monitored with regular imaging (usually yearly). The decision to repair an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is based on the size and location of the aneurysm, and the person's age and general health.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Aneurysm - cerebral\n*   Cerebral aneurysm\n*   Aneurysm - intracranial\n\n---\n\n**Aneurysm in the Brain**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a cerebral aneurysm?**\n\nA cerebral aneurysm, also known as a brain aneurysm, is a bulge or ballooning in one of the arteries that supply blood to the brain. It can be thought of as a weak spot in the artery wall where the pressure inside the artery causes it to stretch and eventually balloon out.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of cerebral aneurysms**\n\nThere are several types of cerebral aneurysms, including:\n\n*   **Saccular aneurysm**: This is the most common type of cerebral aneurysm. It is a small, rounded bulge in the artery wall.\n*   **Fusiform aneurysm**: This type of aneurysm is a long, narrow bulge in the artery wall.\n*   **Dissecting aneurysm**: This type of aneurysm occurs when there is a tear in the inner layer of the artery wall.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of cerebral aneurysms is not fully understood, but several factors can increase the risk of developing one. These include:\n\n*   **Family history**: Having a family history of cerebral aneurysms or other vascular problems may increase your risk.\n*   **Age**: Cerebral aneurysms are more common in people over 40 years old.\n*   **Hypertension**: High blood pressure can weaken the artery walls and increase the risk of a cerebral aneurysm.\n*   **Head trauma**: A severe blow to the head may cause a cerebral aneurysm.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCerebral aneurysms are often asymptomatic until they rupture, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, some people may experience symptoms such as:\n\n*   **Severe headache**: A sudden, severe headache that can be described as the worst headache of your life.\n*   **Confusion and disorientation**: A person who has experienced a cerebral aneurysm rupture may become confused and disoriented.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for cerebral aneurysms depends on several factors, including the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the individual's overall health. Treatment options include:\n\n*   **Surgical clipping**: This involves placing a small clip across the neck of the aneurysm to prevent it from rupturing.\n*   **Endovascular coiling**: This involves using a catheter to deliver coils into the aneurysm, where they become lodged and prevent further bleeding.\n*   **Observation**: In some cases, cerebral aneurysms may be small enough that they do not require treatment. Instead, the individual's doctor will monitor the aneurysm closely for any changes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent cerebral aneurysms, there are several steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Manage hypertension**: Keeping your blood pressure under control can help reduce your risk of developing a cerebral aneurysm.\n*   **Avoid head trauma**: Taking steps to avoid head trauma, such as wearing a seatbelt or helmet when necessary, can help reduce your risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nThompson BG, Brown RD Jr, Amin-Hanjani S, et al.

    "content": "**Aneurysms**\n\nAn aneurysm is a bulge or \"ballooning\" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death.\n\n**Where Do Aneurysms Occur?**\n\nMost aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain, heart, and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts, it causes a stroke.\n\n**Symptoms and Detection**\n\nAneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Often aneurysms are found by chance during tests done for other reasons.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nMedicines and surgery are the two main treatments for aneurysms.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   What Is an Aneurysm?

    "content": "**Angelman Syndrome**\n\n_A complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system._\n\n**Description**\n\nAngelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood.\n\nChildren with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity and a short attention span are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual.\n\nWith age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as \"coarse.\" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAngelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in most of the body's tissues. However, in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.\n\n---\n\n**Angelman Syndrome**\n\n**Causes of Angelman Syndrome**\n\nIf the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene variant (also known as a mutation), a person will have no active copies of the gene in most parts of the brain.\n\nSeveral different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 10 to 20 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a variant in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a variant or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene.\n\nThe causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nMany of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in most of the body's tissues. However, in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active.\n\nIn some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nRarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a variant in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next.\n\n---\n\n**Angelman Syndrome**\n\n**What is Angelman Syndrome?**\n\nAngelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 14,000 to 1 in 20,000 people worldwide. It is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and severe motor dysfunction.\n\n**Causes of Angelman Syndrome**\n\nThe causes of Angelman syndrome are complex and multifaceted. Most cases are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development.\n\nRarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a variant in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AS\n* Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Angelman syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Angelman syndrome\n\n**References**\n\n1.

It affects approximately 1 in 14,000 to 1 in 20,000 individuals worldwide.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors**: The condition is usually caused by mutations or deletions in the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15, which can occur spontaneously or be inherited from a parent. In some cases, Angelman syndrome may be associated with other genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities.\n*   **Symptoms and Characteristics**:\n    *   Developmental delays and intellectual disability\n    *   Severe motor impairment, including spasticity and tremors\n    *   Happy and affectionate personality traits\n    *   Sleep disturbances and epilepsy in some cases\n*   **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, genetic testing (such as chromosomal microarray or UBE3A gene sequencing), and family history.\n*   **Treatment and Management**: There is no cure for Angelman syndrome, but various interventions can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n    *   Physical therapy to enhance motor skills\n    *   Occupational therapy to develop daily living skills\n    *   Speech therapy to address communication challenges\n    *   Medications to control seizures or other related conditions\n*   **Prognosis**: With proper care and support, individuals with Angelman syndrome can lead fulfilling lives. While the condition is lifelong, advances in medical treatment and supportive services have improved outcomes and enhanced the overall well-being of those affected.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: Angelman syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In some cases, it may be associated with other genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities.\n*   **Gene Variants and Expression**: The UBE3A gene plays a crucial role in Angelman syndrome. Mutations or deletions in this gene can lead to the development of the condition. Understanding how gene variants affect health and development is essential for identifying and managing related conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Developmental Disabilities**: Angelman syndrome is a type of developmental disability characterized by significant cognitive, motor, and communication impairments.\n*   **Genetic Disorders**: The condition is a genetic disorder caused by mutations or deletions in the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15.\n*   **Movement Disorders**: Individuals with Angelman syndrome often experience severe motor impairment, including spasticity and tremors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nThe information provided on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

This can cause chest pain or discomfort, often referred to as \"heartburn\" or \"indigestion,\" although it has nothing to do with digestion.\n*   **What are the symptoms of angina?**\n    The main symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort, which can radiate to other areas such as the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. This pain usually occurs during physical activity and resolves within a few minutes after rest or medication.\n*   **How is angina diagnosed?**\n    Diagnosis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), stress test, and sometimes coronary angiography to visualize the heart's blood vessels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Nitroglycerin**\n    Nitroglycerin is a medication commonly used to treat angina. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, which helps improve blood flow to the heart muscle.\n*   **Other treatment options**\n    In addition to nitroglycerin, other treatment options for angina may include lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, reducing stress, and engaging in regular exercise. Medications like beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiplatelet agents may also be prescribed to manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Language Support**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Multilingual resources**\n    MedlinePlus offers health information translations in multiple languages, including Korean, Nepali, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, and Ukrainian.

If so, it's essential to ask your doctor the right questions to understand your condition and develop an effective treatment plan. In this article, we'll explore the key topics to discuss with your doctor when dealing with angina.\n\n**Understanding Angina**\n\nAngina is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart doesn't receive enough oxygen-rich blood. It's often a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), where the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. There are two main types of angina: stable and unstable.\n\n*   **Stable Angina**: This type of angina is predictable and usually occurs during physical activity or stress.\n*   **Unstable Angina**: This type of angina is more severe and can occur at any time, even when you're not active. It's a warning sign that a heart attack may be imminent.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen discussing your angina with your doctor, be sure to ask the following questions:\n\n1.  **What is the cause of my angina?**\n2.  **How can I manage my symptoms effectively?**\n3.  **Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to reduce my risk of heart disease?**\n4.  **What are the treatment options available to me, and which one is best suited for my condition?**\n5.  **How can I prevent a heart attack or further complications?**\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nYour doctor may recommend various treatment options, including:\n\n*   **Medications**: To manage symptoms, reduce risk factors, and prevent complications.\n*   **Lifestyle Changes**: Such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy diet.\n*   **Procedures**: Like angioplasty or stent placement to improve blood flow to the heart.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to bypass blocked arteries.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAngina is a serious condition that requires prompt attention. By asking the right questions and working closely with your doctor, you can develop an effective treatment plan and reduce your risk of complications. Remember, knowledge is power, and understanding your angina will help you make informed decisions about your health.",

It may be a sign of a serious problem, such as a heart attack or angina. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), which occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed and hardened due to plaque buildup.\n\n**What Is Angina?**\n\nAngina is a type of chest pain that occurs when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's usually caused by CAD, but it can also be caused by other conditions such as high blood pressure or aortic stenosis.\n\n**Types of Angina**\n\nThere are two main types of angina:\n\n*   **Stable Angina**: This is the most common type of angina and occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's usually caused by CAD and can be relieved by taking medication or making lifestyle changes.\n*   **Unstable Angina**: This type of angina is more serious and occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's often a sign of a heart attack and requires immediate medical attention.\n\n**Symptoms of Angina**\n\nThe symptoms of angina can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Chest Pain**: A squeezing or pressure sensation in the center of the chest that may radiate to the arms, back, or jaw.\n*   **Shortness of Breath**: Feeling like you can't catch your breath or that you're winded even when you're not exerting yourself.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or weak, especially after physical activity.\n*   **Pain or Discomfort in the Arms, Back, or Jaw**: Pain or discomfort in these areas may be a sign of angina.\n\n**Diagnosing Angina**\n\nTo diagnose angina, your doctor will typically perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart and can show signs of CAD.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of the heart and can show signs of CAD or other heart problems.\n*   **Stress Test**: A stress test involves exercising on a treadmill while your heart is monitored with an ECG. This test can help determine if angina is related to physical activity.\n\n**Treatment Options for Angina**\n\nThe treatment options for angina depend on the underlying cause and may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or nitrates can help relieve chest pain and improve blood flow to the heart.\n*   **Lifestyle Changes**: Making lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet can help manage angina symptoms.\n*   **Surgical Procedures**: In some cases, surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or angioplasty may be necessary to restore blood flow to the heart.\n\n**Preventing Angina**\n\nTo prevent angina, it's essential to:\n\n*   **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of developing CAD and angina.\n*   **Exercise Regularly**: Regular exercise can help improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of angina.\n*   **Eat a Healthy Diet**: Eating a healthy diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help improve cardiovascular health.\n*   **Don't Smoke**: Smoking can increase your risk of developing CAD and angina.\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prevention strategies for angina, you can take steps to manage your condition and reduce your risk of complications.",

CAD happens when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, reducing blood flow.\n\n**Types of Angina**\n\nThere are three types of angina:\n\n* **Stable Angina**: The most common type. It happens when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern. Rest and medicines usually help.\n* **Unstable Angina**: The most dangerous. It does not follow a pattern and can happen without physical exertion. It does not go away with rest or medicine. It is a sign that you could have a heart attack soon.\n* **Variant Angina**: Rare. It happens when you are resting. Medicines can help.\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n\nNot all chest pain or discomfort is angina.

You may also feel pain in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.\n\n**Types of Angina**\n\nThere are three types of angina:\n\n*   **Stable Angina**: This is the most common type of angina. It happens when you exert yourself physically.\n*   **Unstable Angina**: This type of angina can happen at any time and may be a sign that you are having a heart attack.\n*   **Variant Angina**: This rare type of angina happens when you are resting.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose angina, your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may also order tests such as:\n\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: This test measures the electrical activity of your heart.\n*   **Chest X-ray**: This test takes pictures of your chest to see if there are any problems with your lungs or heart.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: This test uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nThe goal of treatment for angina is to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. Treatment may include:\n\n*   **Medicines**: Your doctor may prescribe medicines such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or nitrates to help manage your symptoms.\n*   **Lifestyle Changes**: You can make lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet to help reduce your risk of heart disease.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat angina.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nThere are several specific types of angina that you should know about:\n\n*   **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**: This is a condition where the blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked.\n*   **Microvascular Angina**: This type of angina happens when there is a problem with the small blood vessels in your heart.\n*   **Prinzmetal's or Prinzmetal Angina, Variant Angina, and Angina Inversa**: These are all rare types of angina that can happen at any time.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, approximately 6.5 million people in the United States have angina. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting research on new treatments for angina.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nThe NIH is currently conducting clinical trials on new treatments for angina. You can find more information about these trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nThere are many journal articles available on the topic of angina. Some recent studies have looked at the safety and accuracy of the HEART pathway, the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, and the temporal dynamics and clinical correlates of ischemic J waves in the context of angina.\n\n**Reference Desk**\n\nThe Texas Heart Institute has a reference desk that provides information on heart health topics, including angina. You can also find experts in the field of cardiology through the American Heart Association's expert finder tool.\n\n**Women**\n\nAngina in women can be different than men. Women are more likely to experience symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue, rather than just chest pain.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nThere are several patient handouts available on the topic of angina. These handouts provide information on how to manage your symptoms, what to expect during a doctor's visit, and how to live with heart disease and angina.\n\n**Topic Image**\n\nThe topic image for this article is an illustration of the heart and coronary arteries.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nThere are several related health topics that you may find helpful:\n\n*   **Cardiac Rehabilitation**: This is a program that helps people who have had a heart attack or other heart problems to recover and prevent future problems.\n*   **Chest Pain**: This is a symptom of angina, as well as other heart conditions.\n*   **Coronary Artery Disease**: This is the most common type of heart disease, which can cause angina.\n\n**Other Languages**\n\nYou can find health information on angina in languages other than English through the MedlinePlus website.\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

These can result in bleeding and blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract._\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Angiodysplasia of the colon is mostly related to the aging and breakdown of the blood vessels. It is more common in older adults. It is almost always seen on the right side of the colon._\n\n_Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions._\n\n_Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults._\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_The symptoms vary._\n\n_Older people may have symptoms such as:_\n\n_* Weakness_\n* Fatigue\n* Shortness of breath due to anemia_\n\n_They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon._\n\n_Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum._\n\n_There is no pain associated with angiodysplasia._\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n_Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:_\n\n_* Angiography (only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon)._\n* CT angiography (CTA).

Older people may experience weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath due to anemia. They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon. Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done to diagnose angiodysplasia of the colon include:\n\n* Angiography (only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon)\n* CT angiography (CTA) - a special type of CT scan that shows active bleeding into the intestine\n* Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia\n* Colonoscopy\n* Stool test for occult (hidden) blood\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for angiodysplasia of the colon depends on the severity of the bleeding and the underlying cause. In most cases, the bleeding stops on its own without treatment. If treatment is needed, it may involve:\n\n* Angiography to help block the blood vessel that is bleeding or to deliver medicine to help cause the blood vessels to tighten\n* Burning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope\n* Medicines: A medicine called octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem\n\nIn some cases, surgery may be necessary. The entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy) may need to be removed if heavy bleeding continues despite other treatments.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for angiodysplasia of the colon.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nVascular ectasia of the colon; Colonic arteriovenous malformation; Hemorrhage - angiodysplasia; Bleed - angiodysplasia; Gastrointestinal bleeding - angiodysplasia; G.I. bleed - angiodysplasia; AVM\n\n---\n\n**Angiodysplasia of the Colon**\n\n**What is Angiodysplasia?**\n\nAngiodysplasia is a condition where abnormal blood vessels form in the lining of the colon, leading to bleeding.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Rectal bleeding\n* Anemia (due to repeated episodes of bleeding)\n* Death from excessive blood loss\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of angiodysplasia is unknown, but it's more common in people over 60 years old.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through:\n\n* Colonoscopy: A flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted into the colon to visualize the abnormal blood vessels.\n* Angiography: A special x-ray that uses dye to highlight the abnormal blood vessels.\n* Blood tests: To check for anemia.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the severity of bleeding:\n\n* For mild bleeding, treatment may involve:\n\t+ Medicines: Octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem.\n\t+ Endoscopic procedures: Burning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope.\n* For severe bleeding, surgery may be necessary:\n\t+ Removing the entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy)\n\t+ Medicines (thalidomide) may rarely be used to help control the disease in some people.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nPeople who have bleeding related to this condition despite having had colonoscopy, angiography, medicine, or surgery are likely to have more bleeding in the future. The outlook remains good if the bleeding is controlled.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Anemia\n* Death from excessive blood loss\n* Side effects from treatment\n* Severe loss of blood from the GI tract\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if rectal bleeding occurs.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nVascular ectasia of the colon; Colonic arteriovenous malformation; Hemorrhage - angiodysplasia; Bleed - angiodysplasia; Gastrointestinal bleeding - angiodysplasia; G.I. bleed - angiodysplasia; AVM",

In this article, we'll explore what angioplasty is, its benefits and risks, and what to expect during the procedure.\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure used to widen narrowed or blocked arteries. The procedure involves inserting a small balloon into the affected artery through an incision in the leg or arm. Once inside, the balloon is inflated to push plaque buildup out of the way, restoring blood flow.\n\n**Benefits of Angioplasty**\n\nThe benefits of angioplasty include:\n\n*   Reduced risk of heart attack and stroke\n*   Improved quality of life\n*   Minimally invasive procedure with quick recovery time\n\n**Risks of Angioplasty**\n\nWhile rare, potential risks of angioplasty include:\n\n*   Bleeding or bruising at the incision site\n*   Infection or inflammation\n*   Damage to the affected artery\n\n**What to Expect During Angioplasty**\n\nDuring the procedure, you'll be given local anesthesia to numb the area. The doctor will then insert a catheter into the affected artery and guide it to the blockage. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push plaque out of the way.\n\n**Language Support**\n\nAngioplasty information is available in multiple languages, including Arabic, Bosnian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information on angioplasty, you can visit MedlinePlus or consult with your healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty**\n\n\\n\\n* **What is angioplasty?**\n\t+ A procedure used to open up blocked or narrowed arteries\n\t+ Helps improve blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body\n* **How does angioplasty work?**\n\t+ A small balloon is inserted into the blocked artery through a tiny cut in the skin\n\t+ The balloon is inflated to push plaque (fatty deposits) out of the way\n\t+ The artery is then widened to allow for better blood flow\n\n\\n\\n**Heart Cath and Heart Angioplasty - Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) Bilingual PDF**\n\n* Available as a bilingual PDF document\n* Provides detailed information on heart catheterization and angioplasty procedures in Vietnamese\n* Can be accessed online or downloaded for offline reference",

    "content": "**Angioplasty and Stent - Heart - Discharge**\n\nYou had angioplasty when you were in the hospital. You may have also had a stent placed. Both of these were done to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart. You may have had a heart attack or angina (chest pain) before the procedure.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may have pain in your groin area, arm, or wrist. This is from the catheter (flexible tube) that was inserted to do the procedure. You may also have some bruising around and below the incision.\n\nThe chest pain and shortness of breath you likely had before the procedure should be much better now.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nIn general, people who have angioplasty can walk around within 6 hours after the procedure. You may be able to be up and walking earlier if the procedure was performed through the wrist. Complete recovery takes a week or less. Keep the area where the catheter was inserted dry for 24 to 48 hours.\n\nIf the provider put the catheter in through your groin:\n\n* Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK.\n* Limit going up and down stairs to around 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days.\n* Don't do yard work, drive, squat, carry heavy objects, or play sports for at least 2 days, or until your health care provider tells you it is safe.\n\nIf the provider put the catheter in your arm or wrist:\n\n* Don't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) (a little more than a gallon of milk) with the arm that had the catheter.\n* Don't do any heavy pushing, pulling, or twisting with that arm.\n\nFor a catheter in your groin, arm, or wrist:\n\n* Avoid sexual activity for 2 to 5 days. Ask your provider when it will be OK to start again.\n* Don't take a bath or swim for the first week. You may take showers, but make sure the area where the catheter was inserted does not get wet for the first 24 to 48 hours.\n\nYou should be able to return to work in 2 to 3 days if you do not do heavy work.\n\n**Caring for Your Incision**\n\nYour provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes.\n\n**Long-term Care**\n\nAngioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to help lower your chances of having a blocked artery again. Your provider may give you medicine to help lower your cholesterol.\n\nMost people take aspirin together with another antiplatelet medicine such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) after this procedure. These medicines are blood thinners. They keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack. Take the medicines exactly as your provider tells you. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Follow-up Care**\n\nMake sure you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your heart care provider (cardiologist).\n\nYour provider may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. This will help you learn how to slowly increase your exercise. You will also learn how to take care of your angina and care for yourself after a heart attack.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure.\n* There is swelling at the catheter site.\n* Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb.\n* The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.\n* You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.\n* Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute.\n* You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired.\n* You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.\n* You have problems taking any of your heart medicines.\n* You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C).\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent - Heart - Discharge**\n\nYou had angioplasty when you were in the hospital.

Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in your groin after using some numbing medicine.\n2.  You will also be given medicine to relax you.\n3.  The surgeon places a catheter (a flexible tube) through the cut into an artery.\n4.  It is carefully moved up to your neck to the blockage in your carotid artery.\n5.

You have a carotid artery on each side of your neck.\n\n**What is Carotid Artery Disease?**\n\nThe blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. A partial blockage is called carotid artery stenosis (narrowing). A blockage in your carotid artery can reduce the blood supply to your brain. Sometimes part of a plaque can break off, travel downstream and block a brain artery. A stroke can occur if your brain does not get enough blood.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTwo procedures can be used to treat a carotid artery that is narrowed or blocked. These are:\n\n*   Surgery to remove plaque buildup (endarterectomy)\n*   Carotid artery angioplasty with stent placement\n\n**Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting (CAS)**\n\nCarotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is done using a small surgical cut.\n\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut in your groin after using some numbing medicine. You will also be given medicine to relax you.\nThe surgeon places a catheter (a flexible tube) through the cut into an artery. It is carefully moved up to your neck to the blockage in your carotid artery. Moving x-ray pictures (fluoroscopy) are used to see the artery and guide the catheter to the correct position.\nNext, the surgeon will move a wire through the catheter to the blockage. Another catheter with a very small balloon on the end will be pushed over this wire and into the blockage. Then the balloon is inflated.\nThe balloon presses against the inside wall of your artery. This opens the artery and allows more blood to flow to your brain. A stent (a wire mesh tube) may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands with the balloon. The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open.\nThe surgeon then removes the balloon and catheters.\n\n**Why Choose Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting?**\n\nCarotid artery surgery (endarterectomy) is a well-established and effective way to treat narrowed or blocked arteries. This procedure is very safe.\n\nCAS has developed as a good alternative to surgery in some cases, when done by experienced surgeons. Certain factors may favor stenting, such as:\n\n*   The person is too ill to have carotid endarterectomy.\n*   The location of the narrowing in the carotid artery makes surgery harder.\n*   The person has had neck or carotid surgery in the past.\n*   The person has had radiation to the neck.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of CAS, which depend on factors such as age, are:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to dye\n*   Blood clots or bleeding at the site of surgery\n*   Brain damage\n*   Clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis)\n*   Heart attack\n*   Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\n*   More blockage of the carotid artery over time\n*   Seizures (this is rare)\n*   Stroke\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and perform several medical tests.\n\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your procedure:\n\nDays before the surgery, you may have to stop taking blood thinner such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), prasugrel (Effient), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other medicines like these.\nAsk your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\nAlways let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\nDO NOT drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery, including water.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter surgery, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight so that you can be watched for any signs of bleeding, stroke, or poor blood flow to your brain. You may be able to go home the same day if your procedure is done early in the day and you are doing well. Your provider will talk to you about how to care for yourself at home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCarotid artery angioplasty and stenting may help lower your chance of having a stroke. But you may need to make lifestyle changes, such as change in diet and regular exercise, to help prevent plaque buildup, blood clots, and other problems in your carotid arteries over time. In addition, your provider will recommend medicines to further reduce your chance of a stroke.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting; CAS; Angioplasty - carotid artery; Carotid artery stenosis - angioplasty\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Carotid Artery**\n\n**What is Angioplasty and Stent Placement?**\n\nCarotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat narrowed or blocked carotid arteries. The procedure involves making a small surgical cut in the groin, where a catheter is inserted into an artery and guided up to the neck to the blockage.\n\n**How is CAS Performed?**\n\nThe surgeon will make a surgical cut in your groin after using some numbing medicine. You will also be given medicine to relax you. A catheter (a flexible tube) is placed through the cut into an artery, carefully moved up to your neck to the blockage in your carotid artery. Moving x-ray pictures (fluoroscopy) are used to see the artery and guide the catheter to the correct position.\n\nNext, a wire is moved through the catheter to the blockage. Another catheter with a very small balloon on the end is pushed over this wire and into the blockage. The balloon is then inflated, pressing against the inside wall of your artery, opening it and allowing more blood to flow to your brain. A stent (a wire mesh tube) may also be placed in the blocked area.\n\n**Why is CAS Performed?**\n\nCAS has developed as a good alternative to surgery in some cases, when done by experienced surgeons. Certain factors may favor stenting, such as:\n\n*   The person is too ill to have carotid endarterectomy.\n*   The location of the narrowing in the carotid artery makes surgery harder.\n*   The person has had neck or carotid surgery in the past.\n*   The person has had radiation to the neck.\n\n**Risks of CAS**\n\nThe risks of CAS, which depend on factors such as age, are:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to dye\n*   Blood clots or bleeding at the site of surgery\n*   Brain damage\n*   Clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis)\n*   Heart attack\n*   Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\n*   More blockage of the carotid artery over time\n*   Seizures (this is rare)\n*   Stroke\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and perform several medical tests. Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your procedure:\n\n*   Days before the surgery, you may have to stop taking blood thinner such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), prasugrel (Effient), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other medicines like these.\n*   Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n*   Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\nDO NOT drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery, including water.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n*   Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\n*   You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Carotid Artery**\n\n**Preparation**\n\n*   You will need to stay in the hospital overnight for observation.\n*   Your provider may recommend lifestyle changes, such as a change in diet and regular exercise, to help prevent plaque buildup, blood clots, and other problems in your carotid arteries over time.\n*   In addition, your provider will recommend medicines to further reduce your chance of a stroke.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n*   **Angina - discharge**\n*   **Angina - what to ask your doctor**\n*   **Angina - when you have chest pain**\n*   **Angioplasty and stent - heart - discharge**\n*   **Antiplatelet medicines - P2Y12 inhibitors**\n*   **Aspirin and heart disease**\n*   **Butter, margarine, and cooking oils**\n*   **Cholesterol and lifestyle**\n*   **Cholesterol - drug treatment**\n*   **Controlling your high blood pressure**\n*   **Dietary fats explained**\n*   **Fast food tips**\n*   **Heart attack – discharge**\n*   **Heart attack - what to ask your provider**\n*   **Heart disease - risk factors**\n*   **How to read food labels**\n*   **Low-salt diet**\n*   **Mediterranean diet**\n*   **Surgical wound care - open**\n\n**Images**\n\n*   **Atherosclerosis of internal carotid artery**\n*   **Carotid stenosis - X-ray of the right artery**\n*   **Cholesterol producers**\n\n**References**\n\n*   Deery SE, Hicks CW.

    "content": "**Angioplasty and Stent Placement**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\n\nA small, metal mesh tube called a stent is placed inside a coronary artery. The stent helps prevent the artery from closing up again.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nBefore the angioplasty procedure begins, you will receive some pain medicine and possibly other medications to relax you and prevent blood clots. You will lie on a padded table while your doctor inserts a flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. The catheter may be placed in your arm or wrist, or in your upper leg (groin) area.\n\nThe doctor will use live x-ray pictures to guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Liquid contrast is injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. A guide wire is moved into and across the blockage, followed by a balloon catheter that is blown up (inflated) to open the blocked vessel.\n\nA stent may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter and expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.\n\n**Why Is This Procedure Performed?**\n\nArteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque, which is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of artery walls. Angioplasty may be used to treat blockage in a coronary artery during or after a heart attack, blockage or narrowing of one or more coronary arteries that may lead to poor heart function (heart failure), or narrowings that reduce blood flow and cause persistent chest pain (angina) that medicines do not control.\n\n**Risks**\n\nAngioplasty is generally safe, but risks include allergic reactions to the drug used in a drug-eluting stent, bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted, blood clots, clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis), damage to a heart valve or blood vessel, heart attack, kidney failure, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), and stroke.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYou will be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. You should also inform your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking, including those bought without a prescription. If you have allergies or are pregnant, you should notify your provider as well.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe average hospital stay is 2 days or less. Some people may not even need to stay overnight in the hospital. You will be given information on how to care for yourself after angioplasty.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor most people, angioplasty greatly improves blood flow through the coronary artery and the heart. It may help you avoid the need for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). However, your arteries may become narrow again, so it's essential to follow a heart-healthy diet, exercise regularly, stop smoking if applicable, and reduce stress to lower your chances of having another blocked artery.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n* Angioplasty\n* Coronary Artery Disease\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. These blood vessels are called the coronary arteries.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nBefore the angioplasty procedure begins, you will receive some pain medicine. You may also be given medicine that relaxes you, and blood-thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\nYou will lie on a padded table. Your doctor (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) will insert a flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist, or in your upper leg (groin) area. You will be awake during the procedure.\n\nThe doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Liquid contrast (sometimes called \"dye\") will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.\n\nA guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart.\n\nA wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.\n\nThe stent is almost always coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future.\n\n**Why is Angioplasty Performed?**\n\nArteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque. Plaque is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of artery walls. This condition is called hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\nAngioplasty may be used to treat:\n\n*   Blockage in a coronary artery during or after a heart attack\n*   Blockage or narrowing of one or more coronary arteries that may lead to poor heart function (heart failure)\n*   Narrowings that reduce blood flow and cause persistent chest pain (angina) that medicines do not control\n\n**Risks**\n\nAngioplasty is generally safe, but ask your doctor about the possible complications. Risks of angioplasty and stent placement are:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to the drug used in a drug-eluting stent, the stent material (very rare), or the x-ray dye.\n*   Bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted.\n*   Blood clot.\n*   Clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis). This can be life threatening.\n*   Damage to a heart valve or blood vessel.\n*   Heart attack.\n*   Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems).\n*   Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias).\n*   Stroke (this is rare).\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAngioplasty is often performed when you go to the hospital or emergency room for chest pain, or after a heart attack. If you are admitted to the hospital for angioplasty:\n\n*   Tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n*   You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\n*   Take the mediciness your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Tell your provider if you are allergic to seafood, you have had a bad reaction to contrast material or iodine in the past, you are taking sildenafil (Viagra) or similar medicines, or you are or might be pregnant.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe average hospital stay is 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight in the hospital.\n\nIn general, people who have angioplasty are able to walk around within a few hours after the procedure, depending on how the procedure went and where the catheter was placed. Complete recovery takes a week or less. You will be given information how to care for yourself after angioplasty.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor most people, angioplasty greatly improves blood flow through the coronary artery and the heart. It may help you avoid the need for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).\n\nAngioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again.\n\nFollow your heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to lower your chances of having another blocked artery. Your provider may prescribe medicine to help lower your cholesterol or control your blood pressure. Taking these steps can help reduce your chances of complications from atherosclerosis.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   PCI\n*   Percutaneous coronary intervention\n*   Balloon angioplasty\n*   Coronary angioplasty\n*   Coronary artery angioplasty\n*   Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty\n*   Heart artery dilatation\n*   Angina - stent placement\n*   Acute coronary syndrome - stent placement\n*   Coronary artery disease - stent placement\n*   CAD - stent placement\n*   Coronary heart disease - stent placement\n*   ACS - stent placement\n*   Heart attack - stent placement\n*   Myocardial infarction - stent placement\n*   MI - stent placement\n*   Coronary revascularization - stent placement\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Heart**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nBefore the angioplasty procedure begins, you will receive some pain medicine.

    "content": "**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Peripheral Arteries**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nYour doctor inserted a catheter (flexible tube) into your blocked artery through a cut in your groin. X-rays were used to guide the catheter up to the area of the blockage. A wire was then passed through the catheter to the blockage, and a balloon catheter was pushed over it. The balloon on the end of the catheter was blown up, opening the blocked vessel and restoring proper blood flow to the affected area.\n\n**A Stent May Be Placed**\n\nA stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. A stent is very often placed at the site to prevent the vessel from closing up again.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nThe cut in your groin may be sore for several days. You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest, but you should take it easy at first. It may take 6 to 8 weeks to recover fully. Your leg on the side of the procedure may be swollen for a few days or weeks.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nYou will need to increase your activity slowly while the incision heals.\n\n*   Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK.\n*   Try to walk a little bit 3 or 4 times a day. Slowly increase how far you walk each time.\n*   Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days.\n*   Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your health care provider tells you to wait.\n\n**Caring for Your Incision**\n\nYour provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. If the bleeding or swelling does not stop or gets worse, contact your provider and return to the hospital or else go to the closest emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**When You Are Resting**\n\nTry to keep your legs raised above the level of your heart. Place pillows or blankets under your legs to raise them.\n\n**Lowering Your Chances of Blockage**\n\nAngioplasty does not cure the cause of blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To lower your chances of this happening:\n\n*   Eat a heart-healthy diet.\n*   Exercise.\n*   Stop smoking (if you smoke).\n*   Reduce your stress level.\n*   Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your provider prescribes it.\n*   If you are taking medicines for blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way your provider has asked you to take them.\n\n**Medicines You May Need to Take**\n\nYour provider may recommend that you take aspirin or another medicine, called clopidogrel (Plavix), when you go home. These medicines keep blood clots from forming in your arteries and in the stent. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   There is swelling at the catheter site.\n*   There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when pressure is applied.\n*   Your leg below where the catheter was inserted changes color or becomes cool to the touch, pale, or numb.\n*   The small incision from your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.\n*   Your legs are swelling excessively.\n*   You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.\n*   You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired.\n*   You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.\n*   You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C).\n*   You develop weakness in your body, your speech is slurred, or you are unable to get out of bed.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty - peripheral artery - discharge; PTA - peripheral artery - discharge; Angioplasty - peripheral artery - discharge; Balloon angioplasty - peripheral artery- discharge; PAD - PTA discharge; PVD - PTA discharge\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Peripheral Arteries - Discharge**\n\nYou had a procedure that used a balloon catheter to open a narrowed vessel (angioplasty) that supplies blood to the arms or legs (peripheral artery). You may have also had a stent placed.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\n* The cut in your groin may be sore for several days.\n* You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest, but you should take it easy at first.\n* It may take 6 to 8 weeks to recover fully.\n* Your leg on the side of the procedure may be swollen for a few days or weeks. This will improve as the blood flow to the limb becomes normal.\n\n**Self-care**\n\n* Increase your activity slowly while the incision heals.\n* Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Try to walk a little bit 3 or 4 times a day. Slowly increase how far you walk each time.\n* Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days.\n* Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your health care provider tells you to wait.\n\n**Caring for Your Incision**\n\n* Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing.\n* If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes.\n* If the bleeding or swelling does not stop or gets worse, contact your provider and return to the hospital or else go to the closest emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**When You're Resting**\n\n* Try to keep your legs raised above the level of your heart. Place pillows or blankets under your legs to raise them.\n\n**Lowering Your Chances of Blockage**\n\n* Eat a heart-healthy diet.\n* Exercise regularly.\n* Stop smoking (if you smoke).\n* Reduce your stress level.\n* Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your provider prescribes it.\n* If you are taking medicines for blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way your provider has asked you to take them.\n\n**Medicines You May Need to Take**\n\n* Your provider may recommend that you take aspirin or another medicine, called clopidogrel (Plavix), when you go home.

    "content": "**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Peripheral Arteries**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow.\n\n**How Does Angioplasty Work?**\n\nA stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. Angioplasty uses a medical \"balloon\" to widen blocked arteries. The balloon presses against the inside wall of the artery to open the space and improve blood flow. A metal stent is often placed across the artery wall to keep the artery from narrowing again.\n\n**Locations Where Angioplasty Can Be Done**\n\nTo treat a blockage, angioplasty can be done in the following locations:\n\n*   Aorta, the main artery that comes from your heart\n*   Artery in your hip or pelvis\n*   Artery in your thigh\n*   Artery behind your knee\n*   Artery in your lower leg\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYou will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake, but sleepy. You may also be given blood-thinning medicine to keep a blood clot from forming.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon will then place a tiny needle into the blood vessel in your groin. A tiny flexible wire will be inserted through this needle. Your surgeon will be able to see your artery with live x-ray pictures. Dye will be injected into your body to show blood flow through your arteries. The dye will make it easier to see the blocked area.\n\n**Risks of Angioplasty and Stent Placement**\n\nRisks include:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to the drug used in a stent that releases medicine into your body\n*   Allergic reaction to the x-ray dye\n*   Bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted\n*   Blood clot in the legs or the lungs\n*   Damage to a blood vessel\n*   Damage to a nerve, which could cause pain or numbness in the leg\n*   Heart attack\n*   Infection in the surgical cut\n*   Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\n*   Misplacement of the stent\n*   Stroke (this is rare)\n*   Failure to open the affected artery\n*   Loss of limb\n\n**Before Having Angioplasty**\n\nYou will have special tests to see the extent of the blockage in your blood vessels. Symptoms of a blocked peripheral artery are pain, achiness, or heaviness in your leg that starts or gets worse when you walk.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAngioplasty improves artery blood flow for most people. Results will vary, depending on where your blockage was, the size of your blood vessel, and how much blockage there is in other arteries.\n\nYou may not need open bypass surgery if you have angioplasty. If the procedure does not help, your surgeon may need to do open bypass surgery, or even amputation.\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement for Peripheral Arteries**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow.\n\n**How Does Angioplasty Work?**\n\nDuring angioplasty, a medical \"balloon\" is used to widen blocked arteries. The balloon presses against the inside wall of the artery to open the space and improve blood flow.

You should also tell your provider about any allergies or medications you are taking.\n\n**Risks of Angioplasty**\n\nThe risks of angioplasty and stent placement include:\n\n*   Allergic reaction to the drug used in a stent that releases medicine into your body\n*   Allergic reaction to the x-ray dye\n*   Bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted\n*   Blood clot in the legs or the lungs\n*   Damage to a blood vessel\n*   Damage to a nerve, which could cause pain or numbness in the leg\n*   Heart attack\n*   Infection in the surgical cut\n*   Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\n*   Misplacement of the stent\n*   Stroke (this is rare)\n*   Failure to open the affected artery\n*   Loss of limb\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMany people are able to go home from the hospital in 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight. You should be able to walk around within 6 to 8 hours after the procedure.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAngioplasty improves artery blood flow for most people.

Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow.\n\n**A Stent is a Small, Metal Mesh Tube That Keeps the Artery Open**\n\nAngioplasty and stent placement are two ways to open blocked peripheral arteries.\n\n**Description**\n\nAngioplasty uses a medical \"balloon\" to widen blocked arteries. The balloon presses against the inside wall of the artery to open the space and improve blood flow. A metal stent is often placed across the artery wall to keep the artery from narrowing again.\n\nTo treat a blockage, angioplasty can be done in the following locations:\n\n*   Aorta, the main artery that comes from your heart\n*   Artery in your hip or pelvis\n*   Artery in your thigh\n*   Artery behind your knee\n*   Artery in your lower leg\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYou will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake, but sleepy.\n\nYou may also be given blood-thinning medicine to keep a blood clot from forming.\n\nYou will lie down on your back on a padded operating table. Your surgeon will inject some numbing medicine into the area that will be treated, so that you do not feel pain. This is called local anesthesia.\n\nYour surgeon will then place a tiny needle into the blood vessel in your groin. A tiny flexible wire will be inserted through this needle.\n\nYour surgeon will be able to see your artery with live x-ray pictures. Dye will be injected into your body to show blood flow through your arteries. The dye will make it easier to see the blocked area.\n\nYour surgeon will guide a thin tube called a catheter through your artery to the blocked area.\n\nNext, your surgeon will pass a guide wire through the catheter to the blockage.\n\nThe surgeon will push another catheter with a very small balloon on the end over the guide wire and into the blocked area.\n\nThe balloon is then filled with contrast fluid to inflate the balloon. This opens the blocked vessel and restores blood flow to your heart.\n\nA stent may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is blown up. The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. The balloon and all the wires are then removed.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nSymptoms of a blocked peripheral artery are pain, achiness, or heaviness in your leg that starts or gets worse when you walk.\n\nYou may not need this procedure if you can still do most of your everyday activities. Your health care provider may have you try medicines and other treatments first.\n\nReasons for having this surgery are:\n\n*   You have symptoms that keep you from doing daily tasks that do not get better with other treatment.\n*   You have skin ulcers or wounds on the leg that do not get better.\n*   You have an infection or gangrene on the leg.\n*   You have pain in your leg caused by narrowed arteries, even when you are resting.\n\nBefore having angioplasty, you will have special tests to see the extent of the blockage in your blood vessels.\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty and Stent Placement - Peripheral Arteries**\n\n**Risks of Angioplasty and Stent Placement**\n\nAllergic reaction to the drug used in a stent that releases medicine into your body\nAllergic reaction to the x-ray dye\nBleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted\nBlood clot in the legs or the lungs\nDamage to a blood vessel\nDamage to a nerve, which could cause pain or numbness in the leg\nDamage to the artery in the groin, which may need urgent surgery\nHeart attack\nInfection in the surgical cut\nKidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\nMisplacement of the stent\nStroke (this is rare)\nFailure to open the affected artery\nLoss of limb\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before surgery:\n\n* Tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n* Tell your provider if you are allergic to seafood, if you have had a bad reaction to contrast material (dye) or iodine in the past, or if you are or could be pregnant.\n* Tell your provider if you are taking sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis).\n* Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol (more than 1 or 2 drinks a day).\n* You may need to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot 2 weeks before surgery. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), Naprosyn (Aleve, Naproxen), and other medicines like these.\n* Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help.\n* Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\nDo not drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery, including water.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\n* Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMany people are able to go home from the hospital in 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight.

Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n\n**What conditions does Angioplasty treat?**\n\nDoctors use angioplasty to:\n\n* Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries.\n* Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack.\n\n**What happens during Angioplasty?**\n\nMost people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line.\n\nAngioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:\n\n* Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.\n* Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide.\n* Inject contrast dye inside your arteries.\n* Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.\n* Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall.\n\n**What happens after an Angioplasty?**\n\nIf you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week.\n\n**Are there any risks from Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Drug-Eluting Stents: Do They Increase Heart Attack Risk?\n* Heart Procedures and Surgeries\n* What Is Cardiac Catheterization?\n\n**Images**\n\n* Coronary artery balloon angioplasty - series\n\n**Videos and Tutorials**\n\n* Balloon angioplasty - short segment\n\n---\n\n**Angioplasty**\n\n**What is Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n\n**How Does Angioplasty Work?**\n\nPlaque, a sticky material made of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in your blood, builds up in your coronary arteries over time. This can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through.\n\n**What Happens During an Angioplasty?**\n\nYou'll be awake and lying down in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab.

The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.\n* Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.\n* Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall.\n\n**What Happens After an Angioplasty?**\n\nIf you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week.\n\nIf you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days.\n\n**Are There Any Risks from Angioplasty?**\n\nAngioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.\n\n**What is a Stent?**\n\nA stent is a small, mesh tube that is placed in your artery to help keep it open.

    "content": "**Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nAnhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID) is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. In addition, immune system function is reduced in people with EDA-ID.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of EDA-ID are evident soon after birth. They include:\n\n* Dry, wrinkled, or darker areas of skin\n* Sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis)\n* Missing teeth (hypodontia) or small, pointed teeth\n* Reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) due to fewer sweat glands or poorly functioning sweat glands\n* An inability to sweat (anhidrosis), which can lead to a dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia)\n\n**Immune Deficiency**\n\nThe immune deficiency in EDA-ID varies among individuals. Children with EDA-ID often produce abnormally low levels of antibodies or immunoglobulins, making it difficult for them to fight off infections. Immune system cells called T cells and B cells have a decreased ability to recognize and respond to foreign invaders.\n\n**Infections**\n\nChildren with EDA-ID commonly get infections in the lungs (pneumonia), ears (otitis media), sinuses (sinusitis), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), skin, bones, and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately one quarter of individuals with EDA-ID have disorders involving abnormal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**Forms of Inheritance**\n\nThere are two forms of EDA-ID distinguished by the modes of inheritance: X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant.\n\n---\n\n**Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency (EDA-ID)**\n\n**What is Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency?**\n\nAnhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues, including the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. In addition, individuals with EDA-ID have a reduced ability to fight off infections due to an impaired immune system.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of EDA-ID are evident soon after birth and include:\n\n* Dry, wrinkled, or darker-colored skin\n* Sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis)\n* Missing teeth (hypodontia) or small, pointed teeth\n* Reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) due to fewer sweat glands or impaired gland function\n* An inability to sweat (anhidrosis), which can lead to a dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia)\n\n**Immune Deficiency**\n\nChildren with EDA-ID often produce abnormally low levels of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins, making it difficult for them to fight off infections. The immune system cells called T cells and B cells have a decreased ability to recognize and respond to foreign invaders that have sugar molecules attached to their surface (glycan antigens). Other key aspects of the immune system may also be impaired, leading to recurrent infections.\n\n**Common Infections**\n\nChildren with EDA-ID commonly get infections in:\n\n* Lungs (pneumonia)\n* Ears (otitis media)\n* Sinuses (sinusitis)\n* Lymph nodes (lymphadenitis)\n* Skin\n* Bones\n* Gastrointestinal tract\n\n**Frequency and Causes**\n\nThe prevalence of the X-linked recessive type of EDA-ID is estimated to be 1 in 250,000 individuals. Variants in the IKBKG gene cause X-linked recessive EDA-ID, while variants in the NFKBIA gene cause autosomal dominant EDA-ID. These gene variants result in the production of proteins with altered function, which reduces activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B and disrupts certain signaling pathways within immune cells.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nDue to the severity of the immune system problems, most people with EDA-ID survive only into childhood. There is no cure for EDA-ID, but treatment may involve antibiotics to prevent or treat infections, as well as other supportive care measures to manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n---\n\n**Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency**\n\n**How Gene Variants Alter Development**\n\nGene variants alter the development of the skin, teeth, sweat glands, and other tissues. It is likely caused by abnormal nuclear factor-kappa-B signaling in other types of cells.\n\n**Genes Associated with Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency**\n\n*   **IKBKG**: Variants (also known as mutations) in the IKBKG gene cause X-linked recessive EDA-ID.\n*   **NFKBIA**: Variants (also known as mutations) in the NFKBIA gene cause autosomal dominant EDA-ID.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nWhen EDA-ID is caused by variants in the IKBKG gene, it is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males are affected more frequently than females because they have only one X chromosome. Females would need to have two altered copies of the IKBKG gene to cause the disorder.\n\nWhen EDA-ID is caused by variants in the NFKBIA gene, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. One copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new variants in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Ectodermal dysplasia, hypohidrotic, with immune deficiency\n*   EDA-ID\n*   HED-ID\n*   Hyper-IgM immunodeficiency with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia\n*   Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Ectodermal dysplasia and immune deficiency\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA AND IMMUNODEFICIENCY 1; EDAID1\n\n---\n\n**Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency**\n\n**What is Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immune Deficiency?**\n\nAnhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of sweat glands, impaired immune function, and other developmental abnormalities.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the NEMO gene, which plays a crucial role in the development and functioning of the immune system. The risk factors for this condition include family history, as it can be inherited in an X-linked pattern.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe symptoms and signs of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency may include:\n\n* Absence of sweat glands\n* Impaired immune function, leading to recurrent infections\n* Developmental abnormalities of the skin, hair, teeth, and other ectodermal structures\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the NEMO gene. Other diagnostic tools may include:\n\n* Physical examination to assess developmental abnormalities\n* Laboratory tests to evaluate immune function and detect infections\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nTreatment and management of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency focus on addressing the underlying genetic mutation, managing symptoms, and preventing complications. This may involve:\n\n* Genetic counseling for families affected by the condition\n* Immunoglobulin replacement therapy to support immune function\n* Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections\n* Regular monitoring of immune function and overall health\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency is generally poor, as the condition can lead to severe and life-threatening complications if left untreated or poorly managed. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to improving outcomes.\n\n**References**\n\n* Boisson B, Puel A, Picard C, Casanova JL.

    "content": "**Animal Bites - Self-Care**\n\nAn animal bite can break, puncture, or tear the skin. Bites that break the skin put you at risk for infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost animal bites come from pets. Dog bites are common and most often happen to children. Compared with adults, children are much more likely to be bitten on the face, head, or neck.\n\nCat bites are less common but have a higher risk for infection. Cat teeth are longer and sharper, which can cause deeper puncture wounds. Most other animal bites are caused by stray or wild animals, such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, and bats.\n\nBites that cause a puncture wound are more likely to become infected. Some animals are infected with a virus that can cause rabies. Rabies is rare but is often deadly.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPain, bleeding, numbness and tingling may occur with any animal bite.\n\nThe bite may also result in:\n\n* Breaks or major cuts in the skin, with or without bleeding\n* Bruising (discoloration of the skin)\n* Crushing injuries that can cause severe tissue tears and scarring\n* Puncture wounds\n* Tendon or joint injury resulting in decreased motion and function of the injured tissue\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou should get medical attention within 24 hours for any bite that breaks the skin:\n\n* You may need stitches for deeper wounds.\n* You may need to get a tetanus shot.\n* You may need to take antibiotics due to the risk for infection or receive antibiotics through a vein (IV) if the infection has spread.\n* You may need surgery to repair the damage from a bad bite.\n\nIf you are caring for someone who was bitten:\n\n* Calm and reassure the person.\n* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before treating the wound.\n* If the wound is bleeding, put on latex gloves if you have them.\n* Wash your hands again afterward.\n\nTo care for a bite wound:\n\n* Stop the wound from bleeding by applying direct pressure with a clean, dry cloth.\n* Wash the wound. Use mild soap and warm, running water. Rinse the bite for 3 to 5 minutes.\n* Apply an antibacterial ointment to the wound. This may help reduce the risk for infection.\n* Put on a dry, sterile bandage.\n\nContact your health care provider right away if the bite is on your neck, head, face, hand, fingers, or feet.\n\n**When to Call Animal Control**\n\nYou should contact animal control or your local police if you are bitten by:\n\n* An animal that behaves in an odd way\n* An unknown pet or a pet that has not had a rabies vaccination\n* A stray or wild animal\n\nTell them what the animal looks like and where it is. They will decide whether the animal needs to be captured and isolated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nMost animal bites will heal without developing infection or decreased tissue function. Ask your provider if you should take an antibiotic to reduce the chance of an infection.\n\nSome wounds will require surgery to properly clean and close, and even some minor bites may need stitches. Deep or extensive wounds may result in significant scarring.\n\nComplications from bite wounds include:\n\n* An infection that spreads quickly\n* Damage to tendons or joints\n\nAn animal bite is more likely to become infected in people who have:\n\n* Weakened immune systems due to medicines or disease\n* Diabetes\n* Peripheral arterial disease (arteriosclerosis, or poor circulation)\n\nGetting a rabies shot right after you are bitten can protect you from the disease.\n\n**How to Prevent Animal Bites**\n\nTo prevent animal bites:\n\n* Teach children not to approach strange animals.\n* Do not provoke or tease animals.\n* Do not go near an animal that is acting strangely or aggressively. It may have rabies. Do not try to catch the animal yourself.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nWild animals and unknown pets could be carrying rabies.

    "content": "**Anion Gap Blood Test**\n\nWhat is an Anion Gap Blood Test?\n\nAn anion gap blood test gives a measurement of the acid-base balance (pH balance) in your blood. This lets you know whether your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. The test also checks for an electrolyte imbalance in your blood.\n\nElectrolytes are minerals that have an electrical charge when they are dissolved in water or body fluids. You get them from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink. You have electrolytes in your blood, urine, tissues, and other body fluids. They help control the acid-base balance of your blood. A few of your body's electrolytes that are often measured in your blood include sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate.\n\nSome electrolytes have a positive electric charge. Others have a negative electric charge. The anion gap measures the difference—or gap—between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes in your blood. If the anion gap is too high, your blood is more acidic than normal. If the anion gap is too low, your blood isn't acidic enough. Both high and low results may be signs of a serious disorder that needs attention.\n\nOther names: Serum anion gap\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nThe anion gap blood test shows whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. Too much acid in the blood is called acidosis. Too little acid in your blood is called alkalosis. Both conditions can be serious.\n\nWhy do I need an anion gap blood test?\n\nYour health care provider may order an anion gap blood test if you have symptoms of acidosis or alkalosis. Symptoms may vary depending on the underlying disease or condition.\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Vomiting\n* Confusion\n* Fatigue\n* Tachycardia (very fast heartbeat)\n* Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n* Irritability\n* Hand tremor\n* Muscle twitching\n* Nausea, vomiting\n* Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet\n\nWhat happens during an anion gap blood test?\n\nThe anion gap test is a calculation that's done with the results of an electrolyte panel, which is a blood test.\n\nDuring a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nNo special preparation is necessary for an anion gap blood test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having this test. You may feel slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nNormal results may vary by lab. Your anion gap results may be based on the results of an electrolyte panel, a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), or a renal function panel (RFP).\n\nSeveral types of medical conditions can cause abnormal anion gap test results. Your provider will use the results of this test, your medical history, and other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nA high anion gap test result may mean that you may have acidosis, which may be caused by:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Diarrhea\n* Too much exercise\n* Kidney diseases\n* Diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis\n* Salicylate poisoning, for example from too much aspirin\n* Antifreeze poisoning\n\nA low anion gap test result may mean you have alkalosis. But this result is so rare that your provider will usually have you tested again to make sure the results are accurate.\n\nThe most common cause of a low anion gap is a low level of albumin, a protein in the blood. Low albumin may be a sign of not eating enough protein, kidney problems, liver disease, heart disease, or some types of cancer.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about an anion gap blood test?\n\nThe anion gap blood test provides information about the acid-base balance of your blood. This tells you about the health of many of your body functions. But there is a wide range of normal results and many possible causes of abnormal results. So, talk with your provider about what your test results mean and whether you need additional testing to make a diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Anion Gap Blood Test**\n\n**What is an Anion Gap Blood Test?**\n\nAn anion gap blood test measures the difference between the concentrations of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) in your blood. This test helps determine if you have too much or too little acid in your blood.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Anion Gap Blood Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an anion gap blood test if you have symptoms of acidosis or alkalosis, such as:\n\n* Acidosis:\n\t+ Shortness of breath\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Confusion\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Tachycardia (very fast heartbeat)\n* Alkalosis:\n\t+ Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n\t+ Irritability\n\t+ Hand tremor\n\t+ Muscle twitching\n\t+ Nausea, vomiting\n\t+ Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet\n\n**What Happens During an Anion Gap Blood Test?**\n\nThe anion gap test is a calculation that's done with the results of an electrolyte panel, which is a blood test.

This test is used to diagnose acid-base disorders, such as metabolic acidosis or alkalosis.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal anion gap is typically less than 12 mmol/L. However, this value can vary slightly depending on the laboratory's reference range.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn abnormal anion gap can indicate various conditions, including:\n\n* Metabolic acidosis: a condition characterized by excessive production of acidic substances in the body\n* Metabolic alkalosis: a condition characterized by excessive loss of acidic substances or excessive production of alkaline substances in the body\n\nOther possible causes of an abnormal anion gap include:\n\n* Hypoalbuminemia: a condition characterized by low levels of albumin in the blood\n* Diarrhea: a condition characterized by frequent bowel movements\n* Dehydration: a condition characterized by insufficient fluid intake or excessive fluid loss\n* Kidney diseases: conditions that affect the kidneys' ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood\n* Liver diseases: conditions that affect the liver's ability to detoxify substances and regulate acid-base balance in the body\n\n**Interpretation of Test Results**\n\nThe anion gap blood test is a useful tool for diagnosing acid-base disorders. However, it should not be used as the sole diagnostic criterion. Instead, it should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings and laboratory results.\n\n**References**\n\n* Brubaker RH, Vashisht R, Meseeha M. High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis.

    "content": "**Aniridia**\n\nAniridia is an eye disorder characterized by a complete or partial absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris). These iris abnormalities may cause the pupils to be abnormal or misshapen. Aniridia can cause reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).\n\nPeople with aniridia can also have other eye problems. Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) typically appears in late childhood or early adolescence. Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), occur in 50 percent to 85 percent of people with aniridia. In about 10 percent of affected people, the structures that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) are underdeveloped. Individuals with aniridia may also have involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) or underdevelopment of the region at the back of the eye responsible for sharp central vision (foveal hypoplasia). Many of these eye problems contribute to progressive vision loss in affected individuals. The severity of symptoms is typically the same in both eyes.\n\nRarely, people with aniridia have behavioral problems, developmental delay, and problems detecting odors.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAniridia occurs in 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 newborns worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAniridia is caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene. The PAX6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), and the pancreas. Within the brain, the PAX6 protein is involved in the development of a specialized group of brain cells that process smell (the olfactory bulb). The PAX6 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes.\n\nMutations in the PAX6 gene result in the production of a nonfunctional PAX6 protein that is unable to bind to DNA and regulate the activity of other genes. A lack of functional PAX6 protein disrupts the formation of the eyes during embryonic development.\n\n---\n\n**Aniridia**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAniridia is caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene.\n\n**PAX6 Gene**\n\nThe PAX6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), and the pancreas.

A lack of functional PAX6 protein disrupts the formation of the eyes during embryonic development.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAniridia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In approximately two-thirds of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The remaining one-third of cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAbsent iris\nCongenital aniridia\nIrideremia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Aniridia 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital aniridia\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n* Isolated aniridia\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n* ANIRIDIA 1; AN1\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n* PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Aniridia**\n\nCan aniridia be inherited?\n\nYes, aniridia can be inherited. It is usually caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene, which is responsible for eye development. These mutations can be passed down from parents to children.\n\nHow are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\nThere is no cure for aniridia, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* *Surgery*: To repair or replace damaged tissues\n* *Contact lenses*: To protect the eyes and improve vision\n* *Low vision therapy*: To help individuals with aniridia adapt to their visual limitations\n\n**Important Note**\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Ankle Arthroscopy**\n\nAnkle arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows your surgeon to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou may receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. This means your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.\n\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon does the following:\n\n* Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.\n* Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n* Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nArthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:\n\n* Ankle pain -- Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.\n* Ligament tears -- A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired or cleaned up with this type of surgery.\n* Ankle impingement -- Tissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint.\n* Scar tissue -- This can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue.\n* Arthritis -- Arthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement.\n* Cartilage injuries -- This surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries.\n* Loose fragments -- These are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up. During arthroscopy these fragments can be removed.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clot, or infection\n\nRisks of ankle arthroscopy are:\n\n* Failure of surgery to relieve symptoms\n* Failure of repair to heal\n* Weakness of the ankle\n* Injury to tendons, blood vessels, or nerves\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Arthroscopy**\n\nArthroscopy is a surgical procedure that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle.

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your health care provider who treats you for these conditions.\n* Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\n* If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.\n* Tell your surgeon if you develop a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. If you do get sick, the procedure may need to be postponed.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.\n\nTake any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water.\n\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou can usually go home the same day after you recover from the anesthesia. You should have someone drive you home.\n\nFollow any discharge instructions you're given. These may include:\n\n* Keep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain.\n* Keep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing.\n* You can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your provider says it is safe to do so.\n* You will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot unless your provider says it is OK to put weight on your foot.\n* You may need to wear a splint or boot for a few weeks or longer to keep the ankle stable as it heals.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nArthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin. Compared to open surgery, you may have:\n\n* Less pain and stiffness\n* Fewer complications\n* Faster recovery\n\nThe small cuts will heal quickly, and you may be able to resume your normal activities in a few days. But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was.\n\nYou may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your surgeon may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Arthroscopy**\n\n**What to Expect During the Procedure**\n\nYou will not feel any pain during the procedure.

To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.\n\nYour surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nArthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:\n\n* Ankle pain -- Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.\n* Ligament tears -- A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone.

    "content": "**Ankle Fracture - Aftercare**\n\nAn ankle fracture is a break in 1 or more ankle bones. These fractures may:\n\n* Be partial (the bone is only partially cracked, not all the way through)\n* Be complete (the bone is broken through and is in 2 parts)\n* Occur on one or both sides of the ankle\n* Occur where the ligament was injured or torn\n\n**When Surgery Is Needed**\n\nSome ankle fractures may require surgery when:\n\n* The ends of the bone are out of line with each other (displaced).\n* The fracture extends into the ankle joint (intra-articular fracture).\n* Tendons or ligaments (tissues that hold muscles and bones together) are torn.\n* Your health care provider thinks your bones may not heal properly without surgery.\n* Your provider thinks that surgery can allow faster and more reliable healing.\n* In children, the fracture involves the part of the ankle bone where bone is growing.\n\nWhen surgery is needed, it may require metal pins, screws, or plates to hold the bones in place as the fracture heals. The hardware may be temporary or permanent.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYou may be referred to an orthopedic (bone) doctor. Until that visit:\n\n* You will need to keep your cast or splint on at all times and keep your foot raised as much as possible.\n* Do not put any weight on your injured ankle or try to walk on it.\n\nWithout surgery, your ankle will be placed in a cast or splint for 4 to 8 weeks. The length of time you must wear a cast or splint depends on the type of fracture you have.\n\nYour cast or splint may be changed more than once, as your swelling goes down. In most cases, you will not be allowed to bear weight on your injured ankle at first. You may also wear a boot, which will allow you to put some weight on your ankle for walking.\n\nAt some point, you will use a special walking boot as the healing progresses.\n\nYou will need to learn:\n\n* How to use crutches\n* How to take care of your cast or splint\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nTo reduce pain and swelling:\n\n* Sit with your foot elevated higher than your knee at least 4 times a day\n* Apply an ice pack 20 minutes of every hour, you are awake, for the first 2 days\n* After 2 days, use the ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes, 3 times a day as needed\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others). You can buy these medicines without a prescription.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n* Not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take.\n* Not give aspirin to children.\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol and others) is a pain medicine that is safe for most people. If you have liver disease, ask your provider if this medicine is safe for you.\n\nYou may need prescription pain medicines (opioids or narcotics) to keep your pain under control at first.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYour provider will tell you when it is OK to place any weight on your injured ankle. Most of the time, this will be at least 6 to 10 weeks. Putting weight on your ankle too soon may mean the bones do not heal properly.\n\nYou may need to have your duties at work changed if your job requires walking, standing, or climbing stairs.\n\nAt a certain point, you will be switched to a weight-bearing cast or splint. This will allow you to start walking. When you start walking again:\n\n* Your muscles will likely be weaker and smaller, and your foot will feel stiff.\n* You will begin learning exercises to help you rebuild your strength.\n* You may be referred to a physical therapist to help with this process.\n\nYou will need to have full strength in your calf muscle and full range of motion back in your ankle before returning to sports or work activities.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nYour provider will do x-rays periodically after your injury to see how your ankle is healing.\n\nYour provider will let you know when you can return to regular activities and sports. Most people need at least 6 to 10 weeks to fully heal.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Your cast or splint is damaged.\n* Your cast or splint is too loose or too tight.\n* You have severe pain.\n* Your foot or leg is swollen above or below your cast or splint.\n* You have numbness, tingling, or coldness in your foot, or your toes look dark.\n* You cannot move your toes.\n* You have increased swelling in your calf and foot.\n* You have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n\nAlso contact your provider if you have questions about your injury or your recovery.\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Fracture - Aftercare**\n\nIf you have an ankle fracture, it's essential to follow proper aftercare to ensure a smooth and successful recovery. Here are some guidelines to help you manage your condition:\n\n**Pain Management**\n\n* Apply an ice pack for 20 minutes every hour for the first two days\n* After two days, use the ice pack for 10-20 minutes, three times a day as needed\n* For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others). However, consult your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n\n**Medicine Use**\n\n* Remember not to take more than the recommended amount on the bottle or exceed your provider's advice.\n* Do not give aspirin to children.\n* Check with your provider about taking anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen or naproxen after a fracture. Sometimes, they will not want you to take the medicines as it can affect healing.\n\n**Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)**\n\n* Acetaminophen is a pain medicine that is safe for most people. However, if you have liver disease, ask your provider if this medicine is safe for you.\n\n**Prescription Pain Medicines**\n\n* You may need prescription pain medicines (opioids or narcotics) to keep your pain under control at first.\n\n**Activity**\n\n* Your provider will tell you when it's okay to place any weight on your injured ankle.

In most cases, the ankle is twisted inward, causing small tears in the ligaments.\n* Damage or swelling of tendons (which join muscles to bone) or cartilage (which cushions joints)\n* Infection in the ankle joint\n* Osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, and other types of arthritis\n* Problems in areas near the ankle that can cause you to feel pain in the ankle, such as:\n\t+ Blockage of blood vessels in the leg\n\t+ Heel pain or injuries\n\t+ Tendinitis around the ankle joint\n\t+ Nerve injuries (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or sciatica)\n\n**Home Care**\n\n* Rest your ankle for several days. Try to NOT put much weight on your ankle.\n* Put on an ACE bandage. You also can buy a brace that supports your ankle.\n* Use crutches or a cane to help take the weight off a sore or unsteady ankle.\n* Keep your foot raised above the level of your heart. When you are sitting or sleeping, place two pillows under your ankle.\n* Ice the area right away. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day. Then, apply ice every 3 to 4 hours for 2 more days.\n* Try acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other pain relievers made by the store.\n* You may need a brace to support the ankle or a boot to rest your ankle.\n\n**Recovery and Prevention**\n\n* The injury may take a few weeks to many months to fully heal. Once the pain and swelling are mostly gone, the injured ankle will still be a little weaker and less stable than the uninjured ankle.\n* You will need to start exercises to strengthen your ankle and avoid injury in the future. DO NOT begin these exercises until a health care professional tells you it is safe to start.\n* You will also need to work on your balance and agility to avoid another injury or sprain.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n* Go to the hospital if:\n\t+ You have severe pain even when you are NOT bearing weight.\n\t+ You suspect a broken bone (the joint looks deformed or you cannot put any weight on the leg).\n\t+ You can hear a popping sound and have immediate pain in the joint.\n\t+ You can't move your ankle back and forth.\n* Contact your provider if:\n\t+ Swelling does not go down within 2 to 3 days.\n\t+ You have symptoms of infection. The area becomes red, more painful, or warm, or you have a fever over 100°F (37.7°C).\n\t+ The pain does not go away after several weeks.\n\t+ Other joints are also involved.\n\t+ You have a history of arthritis and are having new symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Pain: Causes and Home Care**\n\nAnkle pain can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Ankle sprains: an injury to the ligaments that connect bones to each other\n* Damage or swelling of tendons or cartilage\n* Infection in the ankle joint\n* Osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, and other types of arthritis\n* Problems in areas near the ankle, such as blockage of blood vessels in the leg, heel pain or injuries, tendinitis around the ankle joint, and nerve injuries\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFor ankle pain, home care may involve:\n\n* Resting your ankle for several days and avoiding putting much weight on it\n* Applying an ACE bandage or using a brace to support your ankle\n* Using crutches or a cane to help take the weight off a sore or unsteady ankle\n* Keeping your foot raised above the level of your heart, with two pillows under your ankle when sitting or sleeping\n* Applying ice to the area for 10-15 minutes every hour for the first day, and then every 3-4 hours for 2 more days\n* Taking pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\n\n**Preventing Future Injuries**\n\nTo prevent future ankle injuries, it's essential to:\n\n* Avoid putting on extra weight, which can increase strain on your ankles\n* Warm up before exercising and stretch the muscles and tendons that support your ankle\n* Avoid sports and activities for which you are not properly conditioned\n* Make sure your shoes fit properly and avoid high-heeled shoes\n* Use ankle support braces if you're prone to ankle pain or twisting your ankle during certain activities\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, seek medical attention:\n\n* Severe pain even when not bearing weight\n* Suspected broken bone (deformed joint or inability to put weight on the leg)\n* Popping sound and immediate pain in the joint\n* Inability to move your ankle back and forth\n\nContact your provider if you experience:\n\n* Swelling that doesn't go down within 2-3 days\n* Symptoms of infection, such as redness, increased pain, warmth, or fever over 100°F (37.7°C)\n* Pain that doesn't go away after several weeks\n* Other joints involved\n* History of arthritis and new symptoms\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Pain**\n\nYou may need a brace to support the ankle or a boot to rest your ankle.\n\nAs the swelling and pain improve, you may still need to keep extra weight and stress off your ankle for a period of time.\n\nThe injury may take a few weeks to many months to fully heal.

Be sure to check with your health care providers before you return to any of these activities. You will need to keep weight off of the foot for 10 to 12 weeks. Recovery can take 3 to 6 months. It may take up to 6 months before you return to normal activity levels.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYour provider will ask you to rest when you first go home. Keep your leg propped up on one or two pillows. Place the pillows below your foot or calf muscle. This helps reduce swelling.\n\nIt is very important to elevate your leg. Keeping it above heart level will reduce swelling.

    "content": "**Ankle Replacement**\n\nAnkle replacement is surgery to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. There are different types of ankle replacement surgeries.\n\n**Description**\n\nAnkle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain.\n\nYou may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.\n\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side. After this, your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage.\n\n**What Happens During Surgery**\n\nYour surgeon will remove the damaged part of:\n\n* The lower end of your shin bone (tibia).\n* The top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on.\n\nThe metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place. A piece of plastic is inserted between the two metal parts. Screws may be placed to stabilize your ankle.\n\n**After Surgery**\n\nThe surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving. You will also be instructed to not put weight on the leg until the implant has healed into the ankle.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis surgery may be done if the ankle joint is badly damaged. Your symptoms may be pain and loss of movement of the ankle. Some causes of damage are:\n\n* Arthritis caused by ankle injuries or surgery in the past\n* Bone fracture\n* Infection\n* Osteoarthritis\n* Osteonecrosis\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Tumor\n\nYou may not be able to have a total ankle replacement if you have had ankle joint infections in the past.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any surgery and anesthesia are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding\n* Blood clot\n* Infection\n\nRisks of ankle replacement surgery are:\n\n* Ankle weakness, stiffness, or instability\n* Loosening of the artificial joint over time\n* Skin not healing after surgery\n* Nerve damage\n* Blood vessel damage\n* Bone break during surgery\n* Dislocation of the artificial joint\n* Allergic reaction to the artificial joint (extremely uncommon)\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), blood thinners (such as Warfarin or Clopidogrel) and other medicines.\n\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your provider who treats you for these conditions.\n\nTell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men.\n\nIf you smoke, you should stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing. It will significantly increase your complications after surgery.\n\nAlways let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\nYou may want to visit the physical therapist to learn some exercises to do before surgery. The physical therapist can also teach you how to correctly use crutches and a walker.\n\n**On the Day of Your Surgery**\n\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\n\nTake the medicines you were told to take with a small sip of water.\n\nYour provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter surgery, you will most likely need to stay in the hospital for at least one night. You may have received a nerve block that controls pain for the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery.\n\nYour ankle will be in a cast or a splint after surgery. A small tube that helps drain blood from the ankle joint may be left in your ankle for 1 or 2 days. During your early recovery period, you should focus on keeping the swelling down by having your foot raised higher than your heart while you are sleeping or resting.\n\nYou will see a physical therapist, who will teach you exercises that will help you move more easily. You most likely will not be able to put any weight on the ankle for a few months.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nA successful ankle replacement will likely:\n\n* Decrease or get rid of your pain\n* Allow you to move your ankle up and down\n\nIn most cases, total ankle replacements last 10 or more years. How long yours lasts will depend on your activity level, overall health, and the amount of damage to your ankle joint before surgery.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAnkle arthroplasty - total; Total ankle arthroplasty; Endoprosthetic ankle replacement; Ankle surgery\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Replacement Surgery**\n\nAnkle replacement surgery is a procedure to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in the ankle joint with artificial joint parts (prosthetics).\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis surgery may be done if the ankle joint is badly damaged due to various causes such as:\n\n* Arthritis caused by ankle injuries or surgery in the past\n* Bone fracture\n* Infection\n* Osteoarthritis\n* Osteonecrosis\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Tumor\n\nYou may not be able to have a total ankle replacement if you have had ankle joint infections in the past.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any surgery and anesthesia are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding\n* Blood clot\n* Infection\n\nRisks of ankle replacement surgery are:\n\n* Ankle weakness, stiffness, or instability\n* Loosening of the artificial joint over time\n* Skin not healing after surgery\n* Nerve damage\n* Blood vessel damage\n* Bone break during surgery\n* Dislocation of the artificial joint\n* Allergic reaction to the artificial joint (extremely uncommon)\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot.\n* Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your provider who treats you for these conditions.\n* Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men.\n* If you smoke, you should stop.

    "content": "**Ankle Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nLigaments are strong, flexible tissues that attach your bones to one another. They keep your joints stable and help them move in the right ways.\n\n**More about Your Injury**\n\nThere are 3 grades of ankle sprains:\n\n* **Grade I sprains**: Your ligaments are stretched, and there may be slight or microscopic tearing of the ligament tissues. It is a mild injury that can improve with some light stretching.\n* **Grade II sprains**: Your ligaments are partially torn. You may need to wear a splint or other immobilization device.\n* **Grade III sprains**: Your ligaments are fully torn. You will likely need to wear a brace, splint, or cast for several weeks, and you may need surgery for this severe injury, especially for younger or more active people.\n\nThe last 2 kinds of sprains are often associated with tearing of small blood vessels. This allows blood to leak into tissues and cause black and blue color (as with bruising) in the area. The blood may not appear for several days. Most of the time, it is absorbed from the tissues within 2 weeks.\n\nIf your sprain is more severe:\n\n* You may feel strong pain and have a lot of swelling.\n* You may not be able to walk, or walking may be painful.\n\nSome ankle sprains may become chronic (long-lasting). If this happens to you, your ankle may continue to be:\n\n* Painful and swollen\n* Weak or giving way easily\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYour health care provider may order an x-ray to look for a bone fracture, or an MRI scan to look for an injury to the ligament.\n\nTo help your ankle heal, your provider may treat you with a brace, a cast, or a splint, and may give you crutches to walk on. You may be asked to place only part or none of your weight on the bad ankle. You will also need to do physical therapy or exercises to help you recover from the injury.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nYou can decrease swelling by:\n\n* Resting and not putting weight on your foot\n* Elevating your foot on a pillow at or above the level of your heart\n\nApply ice every hour while you are awake, 20 minutes at a time and covered by a towel or bag, for the first 24 hours after the injury. After the first 24 hours, apply ice 20 minutes 3 to 4 times per day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. You should wait at least 30 minutes in between ice applications.\n\nPain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help to ease pain and swelling. You can buy these medicines without a prescription.\n\n**Getting Active**\n\nThe pain and swelling of an ankle sprain most often gets better within 48 hours. After that, you can begin to put weight back on your injured foot.\n\nPut only as much weight on your foot as is comfortable at first. Slowly work your way up to your full weight.\nIf your ankle begins to hurt, stop and rest.\n\nYour provider will give you exercises to strengthen your foot and ankle. Doing these exercises can help prevent future sprains and chronic ankle pain.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your provider if you notice any of the following:\n\n* You cannot walk, or walking is very painful.\n* The pain does not get better after ice, rest, and pain medicine.\n* Your ankle does not feel any better after 5 to 7 days.\n* Your ankle continues to feel weak or gives away easily.\n* Your ankle is increasingly discolored (red or black and blue), or it becomes numb or tingly, feels cold, or has changes in sensation.\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Sprain - Aftercare**\n\n**Waiting Period for Ice Applications**\n\nYou should wait at least 30 minutes in between ice applications.\n\n**Pain Medicines**\n\nPain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help to ease pain and swelling. You can buy these medicines without a prescription.\n\n*   Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n*   Do not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take.

Doing these exercises can help prevent future sprains and chronic ankle pain.\n\n**Returning to Activities**\n\nFor less severe sprains, you may be able to go back to your normal activities after a few days. For more severe sprains, it may take several weeks.\n\n*   Talk to your provider before returning to more intense sports or work activities.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your provider if you notice any of the following:\n\n*   You cannot walk, or walking is very painful.\n*   The pain does not get better after ice, rest, and pain medicine.\n*   Your ankle does not feel any better after 5 to 7 days.\n*   Your ankle continues to feel weak or gives away easily.\n*   Your ankle is increasingly discolored (red or black and blue), or it becomes numb or tingly, feels cold, or has changes in sensation.\n\n---\n\n**Ankle Sprain - Aftercare**\n\nYou can decrease swelling by:\n\n* Resting and not putting weight on your foot\n* Elevating your foot on a pillow at or above the level of your heart\n\nApply ice every hour while you are awake, 20 minutes at a time and covered by a towel or bag, for the first 24 hours after the injury.

    "content": "**Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nAnkyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, a group of about 180 conditions characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, ears, and sweat glands.\n\n**Common features**\n\nAmong the most common features of AEC syndrome are missing patches of skin (erosion). In affected infants, skin erosion most commonly occurs on the scalp. It tends to recur throughout childhood and into adulthood, frequently affecting the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. Skin erosion ranges from mild to severe and can lead to life-threatening infection in infancy, scarring, and hair loss.\n\nOther ectodermal abnormalities in AEC syndrome include:\n\n* Changes in skin coloring\n* Brittle, sparse, or missing hair\n* Misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails\n* Malformed or missing teeth\n\nAffected individuals may also have an inability to control their body temperature because of missing or nonfunctioning sweat glands causing overheating or hypothermia.\n\n**Birth defects**\n\nMany infants with AEC syndrome are born with an eyelid condition known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, in which strands of tissue partially or completely fuse the upper and lower eyelids. Most people with AEC syndrome are also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a split in the lip (a cleft lip), or both.\n\nCleft lip or cleft palate can make it difficult for affected infants to suck, so these infants often have trouble feeding and do not grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive).\n\n**Additional features**\n\nAdditional features of AEC syndrome can include:\n\n* Limb abnormalities, most commonly fused fingers and toes (syndactyly)\n* Permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly)\n* Deep split in the hands or feet with missing fingers or toes and fusion of the remaining digits (ectrodactyly)\n\nHearing loss is common, occurring in more than 90 percent of children with AEC syndrome. Some affected individuals have distinctive facial features, such as small jaws that cannot open fully and a narrow space between the upper lip and nose (philtrum).\n\nOther signs and symptoms can include:\n\n* Opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in affected males\n* Digestive problems\n* Absent tear duct openings in the eyes\n* Chronic sinus or ear infections\n\n**Relationship to Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome**\n\nA condition known as Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome has signs and symptoms that overlap considerably with those of AEC syndrome. These two syndromes were classified as separate disorders until it was discovered that they both result from mutations in the same part of the same gene.\n\nMost researchers now consider Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and AEC syndrome to be part of the same disease spectrum.\n\n---\n\n**Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome**\n\n**What is Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome?**\n\nAnkyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a rare condition that affects the development of ectodermal tissues, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, ears, and sweat glands.\n\n**Common features of AEC syndrome:**\n\n* Missing patches of skin (erosion), which can occur on the scalp, neck, hands, and feet\n* Changes in skin coloring\n* Brittle, sparse, or missing hair\n* Misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails\n* Malformed or missing teeth\n* Inability to control body temperature due to missing or nonfunctioning sweat glands\n\n**Additional features of AEC syndrome:**\n\n* Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, a condition where strands of tissue fuse the upper and lower eyelids\n* Cleft lip or cleft palate, which can make it difficult for affected infants to suck and lead to failure to thrive\n* Limb abnormalities, such as fused fingers and toes (syndactyly), permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), or a deep split in the hands or feet with missing fingers or toes and fusion of the remaining digits (ectrodactyly)\n* Hearing loss, occurring in more than 90 percent of children with AEC syndrome\n* Distinctive facial features, such as small jaws that cannot open fully and a narrow space between the upper lip and nose (philtrum)\n* Other signs and symptoms can include the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in affected males, digestive problems, absent tear duct openings in the eyes, and chronic sinus or ear infections.\n\n**Causes of AEC syndrome:**\n\nAEC syndrome is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the TP63 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as p63, which plays an essential role in early development. The p63 protein is a transcription factor that attaches to DNA and controls the activity of particular genes.\n\n**Frequency of AEC syndrome:**\n\nAEC syndrome is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown. All forms of ectodermal dysplasia together occur in about 1 in 70,000 newborns worldwide.\n\n---\n\n**Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome**\n\n**What is Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome?**\n\nAnkyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome, also known as AEC syndrome or Hay-Wells syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal structures. The condition affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails, and other organs and tissues.\n\n**Causes of Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome**\n\nThe TP63 gene variants responsible for AEC syndrome interfere with the ability of p63 to turn target genes on and off at the right times. It is unclear how these changes lead to abnormal ectodermal development and the specific features of AEC syndrome.\n\n**Symptoms of Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of AEC syndrome include:\n\n* Abnormal skin, hair, teeth, nails, and other organs and tissues\n* Cleft lip and/or palate\n* Ankyloblepharon (fused eyelids)\n* Skin erosions and wound healing problems\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome**\n\nAEC syndrome\nAnkyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip and palate syndrome\nHay-Wells syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\n* Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* ANKYLOBLEPHARON-ECTODERMAL DEFECTS-CLEFT LIP/PALATE; AEC\n* RAPP-HODGKIN SYNDROME; RHS\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* McGrath JA, Duijf PH, Doetsch V, Irvine AD, de Waal R, Vanmolkot KR, Wessagowit V, Kelly A, Atherton DJ, Griffiths WA, Orlow SJ, van Haeringen A, Ausems MG, Yang A, McKeon F, Bamshad MA, Brunner HG, Hamel BC, van Bokhoven H.

The syndrome is caused by mutations in the TP63 gene and affects various aspects of health and development.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome varies depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of associated complications. In general, the syndrome is considered a severe form of ectodermal dysplasia, and affected individuals may experience significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nThere is no cure for ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome, but various treatments can help manage its symptoms. These may include:\n\n*   **Surgical interventions**: To correct cleft lip and palate, as well as other congenital anomalies.\n*   **Dermatologic care**: To manage skin-related complications, such as skin erosions and wound healing issues.\n*   **Nutritional support**: To ensure adequate nutrition and prevent related health problems.\n*   **Gastrointestinal management**: To address potential gastrointestinal issues.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAnkyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated TP63 gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to their offspring.\n\n**Gene variants and health**\n\nMutations in the TP63 gene can affect various aspects of health and development, including:\n\n*   **Skin and hair**: Individuals with ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome may experience skin-related complications, such as skin erosions and wound healing issues.\n*   **Cleft lip and palate**: The syndrome is characterized by cleft lip and palate, which can impact oral health and development.\n*   **Growth and nutrition**: Affected individuals may experience growth and nutritional challenges due to associated gastrointestinal issues.\n\n**Family history**\n\nIf a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component. In the case of ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome, a family history of the condition can suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n**Understanding genetics**\n\nGenetic conditions are caused by mutations in genes that can affect various aspects of health and development. Understanding genetics can help individuals and families affected by these conditions make informed decisions about treatment and management.\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis of the spine. It causes inflammation (swelling) between your vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) and the joints between your spine and pelvis. AS inflammation can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\nSymptoms of AS can range from mild to severe back pain. Over time, AS can fuse (grow together) your vertebrae, limiting movement and causing a hunched posture. In some people, AS can affect other joints or body parts.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is More Likely to Get Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis usually starts before age 45. Early symptoms may begin between the ages of 15 and 30. Your chance of developing AS can also increase if:\n\n* You're a man. AS is more common and severe in men.\n* You have a family history. If a member of your family has AS, you're more likely to get the disease.\n* You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting AS. These include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or psoriasis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nNo one knows what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but the environment and genes likely play a role. Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting the disease, but not everyone with these genes gets AS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAS affects people differently. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the lower back and/or hips. The pain is usually worse during the night or after sitting for a long time.\n\nOver time, AS may progress to other areas of your spine or body. Symptoms may depend on which areas of your body the disease affects. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others may have severe, ongoing pain.\n\nOther symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis may include:\n\n* Pain, stiffness, and inflammation of the joints.\n* Difficulty taking a deep breath. This could occur if the joints connecting the ribs are affected.\n* Changes in vision.\n* Fatigue.\n* Loss of appetite.\n* Weight loss.\n* Skin rashes, such as psoriasis.\n* Abdominal (belly) pain and loose stools (poop).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is Ankylosing Spondylitis Diagnosed?**\n\nThere is no single test for ankylosing spondylitis. To find out if you have AS your health care provider may:\n\n* Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms.\n* Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had AS.\n* Do a physical exam.\n* Order blood tests or imaging studies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAS has no cure, but treatment may help relieve symptoms, maintain posture, and slow down the disease. Since other parts of your body can be affected by AS, you will likely work with a team of health care professionals for tests, diagnosis, and care.\n\nTreatment usually includes medicine to help relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse, as well as physical therapy to improve mobility. If AS is severe, surgery may be needed.\n\nYou can help manage your AS symptoms if you:\n\n* Exercise\n* Monitor your symptoms\n* Manage your stress\n* Use assistive devices as needed\n* Follow a healthy diet\n* Stop smoking, or don't start\n\n---\n\n**Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\n**What is Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that affects the spine, causing inflammation and stiffness in the joints between the vertebrae.\n\n**Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\n* Pain and stiffness in the lower back and/or hips\n* Difficulty taking a deep breath if the joints connecting the ribs are affected\n* Changes in vision\n* Fatigue\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n* Skin rashes, such as psoriasis\n* Abdominal pain and loose stools\n\n**Diagnosing Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\nThere is no single test for AS.

Most commonly, affected individuals first experience chronic back pain and stiffness. This pain worsens with rest or inactivity, and tends to be relieved with physical activity or exercise.\n\nPain in ankylosing spondylitis results from inflammation of the joints between the pelvic bones (the ilia) and the base of the spine (the sacrum). These joints are called sacroiliac joints, and inflammation of these joints is known as sacroiliitis. The inflammation gradually spreads to the joints between the vertebrae, eventually involving the whole spine, causing a condition called spondylitis.\n\nOver time, back movement gradually becomes limited as the bones of the spine (vertebrae) fuse together. This progressive bony fusion is called ankylosis. These fused bones are prone to fracture.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Affected Joints and Complications**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis can involve other joints as well, including the shoulders, hips, and, less often, the knees. As the disease progresses, it can affect the joints between the spine and ribs, restricting movement of the chest and making it difficult to breathe deeply.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis affects the eyes in more than 30 percent of cases, leading to episodes of eye inflammation called acute iritis. Acute iritis typically affects one eye at a time and causes eye pain and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rarely, ankylosing spondylitis can also cause serious complications involving the heart, lungs, and nervous system.\n\nSix to 10 percent of people with ankylosing spondylitis have additional inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, which affects the skin, or ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, which both affect the digestive tract.\n\n---\n\n**Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\n**What is Ankylosing Spondylitis?**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a form of painful, ongoing joint inflammation (chronic inflammatory arthritis) that primarily affects the spine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30.

Six to 10 percent of people with ankylosing spondylitis have additional inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, which affects the skin, or ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, which both affect the digestive tract.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is part of a group of related diseases known as spondyloarthritis. In the United States, spondyloarthritis affect 3.5 to 13 per 1,000 people. Ankylosing spondylitis appears to be more common in certain indigenous populations in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. However, researchers have found variations in several genes that influence the risk of developing this disorder.\n\nThe HLA-B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. The HLA-B gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria).\n\nThe HLA-B gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A normal variant of the HLA-B gene called HLA-B27 significantly increases the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nVariations in several additional genes, including ERAP1, IL1A, and IL23R, have also been associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Although many of these genes play critical roles in the immune system, it is not fully known how variations in these genes affect a person's risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nChanges in genes that have not yet been identified also likely affect the chances of developing ankylosing spondylitis and influence the progression of the disorder. Researchers are working to identify these genes and clarify their role in ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n---\n\n**Ankylosing Spondylitis: Understanding the Genetic Factors**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a complex disorder that is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While researchers have identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing this condition, many of these genetic variations do not guarantee its occurrence.\n\n**The HLA-B Gene: A Key Player in the Immune System**\n\nOne of the most significant genetic variations linked to ankylosing spondylitis is the HLA-B27 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in the immune system, helping it distinguish between the body's own proteins and those produced by foreign invaders. The HLA-B27 variant has been shown to significantly increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, although not all individuals with this variant will develop the condition.\n\n**Additional Genes Associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\nSeveral other genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, including ERAP1, IL1A, and IL23R. While these genes play critical roles in the immune system, the exact mechanisms by which they contribute to the development of this condition are not yet fully understood.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns: A Complex Picture**\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis can occur in multiple family members, but it is not a purely genetic disease. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining an individual's risk of developing this disorder. Inheriting a genetic variation linked to ankylosing spondylitis does not guarantee its occurrence, even within families where the condition has been diagnosed.\n\n**Other Names for Ankylosing Spondylitis**\n\nThis condition is also known by several other names, including:\n\n* Axial spondylarthritis\n* Bechterew disease\n* Marie-Struempell disease\n* SpA (Spondyloarthritis)\n* Spondylarthritis ankylopoietica\n* Spondylitis ankylopoietica\n* Spondyloarthritis ankylopoietica\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor those interested in learning more about ankylosing spondylitis and its genetic factors, the following resources may be helpful:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Spondyloarthropathy, susceptibility to, 1\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM (SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; SPDA1, etc.)\n\n---\n\n**Ankylosing Spondylitis: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Part 4/5**\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Spondyloarthropathy, susceptibility to, 1\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; SPDA1\n*   SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2; SPDA2\n*   SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3; SPDA3\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Akkoc N, Yarkan H, Kenar G, Khan MA.

    "content": "**Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome is associated with a variety of heart problems related to disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). Heart rhythm is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. In ankyrin-B syndrome, disruption of different steps of electrical signaling can lead to arrhythmia, and the resulting heart problems vary among affected individuals.\n\n**Heart Problems**\n\nIndividuals with ankyrin-B syndrome may have problems with the sinoatrial (SA) node, which generates the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. If the SA node is not functioning properly, the heartbeat can be too slow (bradycardia). In a small number of people with ankyrin-B syndrome, the heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats, which is known as a prolonged QT interval (long QT). Some affected individuals have impaired progression (conduction) of electrical impulses between the chambers of the heart, which can cause a problem called heart block. Other heart problems that occur in ankyrin-B syndrome include irregular and uncoordinated electrical activity in the heart's upper chambers (atrial fibrillation) or lower chambers (ventricular fibrillation) and an abnormality called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), in which an increase in the heart rate can trigger an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia. In people with ankyrin-B syndrome, arrhythmia can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death.\n\n**Long QT Syndrome 4**\n\nWhen associated with a prolonged QT interval, the condition is sometimes classified as long QT syndrome 4. However, because additional heart problems can result from changes in the same gene, long QT syndrome 4 is usually considered part of ankyrin-B syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\n**What is Ankyrin-B Syndrome?**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the heart's electrical signaling system, leading to various heart problems.\n\n**Heart Problems Associated with Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\nIndividuals with ankyrin-B syndrome may experience:\n\n*   **Abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat**: called ventricular tachycardia\n*   **Fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death**\n*   **Problems with the sinoatrial (SA) node**, which generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat\n*   **Impaired progression of electrical impulses** between the chambers of the heart, causing a problem called heart block\n*   **Irregular and uncoordinated electrical activity** in the heart's upper chambers (atrial fibrillation) or lower chambers (ventricular fibrillation)\n*   **Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)**, an abnormality that can trigger an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia\n\n**Causes of Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome is caused by mutations in the ANK2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin-B. This protein inserts ion channels into their proper locations in cardiac muscle cells.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered ANK2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Some people who have an altered ANK2 gene never develop heart problems, a situation known as reduced penetrance.\n\n---\n\n**Ankyrin-B Syndrome**\n\n**What is Ankyrin-B Syndrome?**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome, also known as cardiac arrhythmia, ankyrin-B-related, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system.

    "content": "**Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery**\n\n**What is Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery?**\n\nAnomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a heart defect where the left coronary artery, which carries blood to the heart muscle, begins from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta.\n\n**Causes**\n\nALCAPA occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy and the developing blood vessel does not attach correctly to the heart muscle. In the normal heart, the left coronary artery originates from the aorta, supplying oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart as well as the mitral valve.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of ALCAPA in an infant include:\n\n* Crying or sweating during feeding\n* Irritability\n* Pale skin\n* Poor feeding\n* Rapid breathing\n* Symptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic)\n\nThese symptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTypically, ALCAPA is diagnosed during infancy. In rare cases, this defect is not diagnosed until someone is a child or adult. During an exam, your health care provider will likely find signs of ALCAPA, including:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythm\n* Enlarged heart\n* Heart murmur (rare)\n* Rapid pulse\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound that views the heart structures and blood flow inside the heart\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart\n* Chest x-ray, which produces an image of the heart and large arteries\n* MRI, which provides a detailed image of the heart\n* Cardiac catheterization, a procedure in which a thin tube (catheter) is placed into the heart to see blood flow and take accurate measurements of blood pressure and oxygen levels\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is needed to correct ALCAPA. Only one surgery is needed in most cases. However, the surgery will depend on the baby's condition and the size of the involved blood vessels.\n\nIf the heart muscle supporting the mitral valve is seriously damaged from decreased oxygen, the baby may also need surgery to repair or replace the valve. The mitral valve controls blood flow between the chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nA heart transplant can be done in case the baby's heart is severely damaged due to lack of oxygen.\n\nMedicines used include:\n\n* Water pills (diuretics)\n* Medicines that make the heart muscle pump harder (inotropic agents)\n* Medicines that lower the workload on the heart (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, most babies do not survive their first year. Children who do survive without treatment may have serious heart problems. Babies with this problem who aren't treated could die suddenly during the following years.\n\nWith early treatment such as surgery, most babies do well and can expect a normal life. Routine follow-ups with a heart specialist (cardiologist) will be needed.\n\n---\n\n**Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery**\n\nALCAPA is a congenital heart defect where the left coronary artery (LCA) originates from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta.\n\n**Causes**\n\nALCAPA occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy, and the developing blood vessel does not attach correctly to the heart muscle. In children with ALCAPA, the LCA supplies oxygen-poor blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart, leading to tissue death due to lack of oxygen.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Pale skin\n* Poor feeding\n* Rapid breathing\n* Symptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic)\n\nThese symptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTypically, ALCAPA is diagnosed during infancy.

    "content": "**Anonychia Congenita**\n\nAnonychia congenita is a rare condition that affects the development of fingernails and toenails. Individuals with this condition are typically born without any nails on their fingers or toes, a condition known as anonychia. In some cases, only part of the nail may be missing, or not all fingers and toes may be affected.\n\n**Description**\n\nAnonychia congenita is characterized by the absence of fingernails and toenails from birth. The other tissues at the tips of the fingers and toes, including structures that support nail growth, are normal. Individuals with anonychia congenita do not have any other health problems related to the condition.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAnonychia congenita is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the RSPO4 gene cause anonychia congenita. The RSPO4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called R-spondin-4, which plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway affects cell division, adhesion, migration, and other cellular activities important for nail development.\n\nRSPO4 gene mutations lead to the production of a protein with little or no function, preventing R-spondin-4 from participating in the Wnt signaling pathway and resulting in improper or absent nail development.\n\nAnonychia congenita can also be part of syndromes that affect multiple parts of the body, including Coffin-Siris syndrome and nail-patella syndrome. When anonychia congenita is part of a syndrome, it is caused by mutations in the gene associated with that syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAnonychia congenita resulting from RSPO4 gene mutations is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n---\n\n**Anonychia Congenita**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAnonychia congenita resulting from RSPO4 gene mutations is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

Genetic factors may be involved in some cases.\n\nThis condition should not be confused with bilateral undescended testes, in which the testes are located in the abdomen or groin rather than the scrotum.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Normal outside genitals before puberty\n* Failure to start puberty at the correct time\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* Signs include:\n\t+ Empty scrotum\n\t+ Lack of male sex characteristics (penis and pubic hair growth, deepening of the voice, and increase in muscle mass)\n* Tests include:\n\t+ Anti-Müllerian hormone levels\n\t+ Bone density\n\t+ Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels\n\t+ Surgery to look for male reproductive tissue\n\t+ Testosterone levels (low)\n\t+ Ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for testes in the abdomen\n\t+ XY karyotype\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* Artificial (prosthetic) testicle implants\n* Male hormones (androgens)\n* Psychological support\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook is good with treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n* Face, neck, or back abnormalities in some cases\n* Infertility\n* Psychological issues\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if a male child:\n\n* Appears to have extremely small or absent testicles\n* Does not seem to be starting puberty during his early teens\n\n---\n\n**Anorchia**\n\n**What is Anorchia?**\n\nAnorchia, also known as vanishing testes syndrome, is a rare condition where one or both testes fail to develop in a male embryo. This occurs between 8 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nThe cause of anorchia is unknown, but genetic factors may be involved in some cases. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Normal outside genitals before puberty\n* Failure to start puberty at the correct time\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nSigns of anorchia include:\n\n* Empty scrotum\n* Lack of male sex characteristics (penis and pubic hair growth, deepening of the voice, and increase in muscle mass)\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Anti-Müllerian hormone levels\n* Bone density\n* Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels\n* Surgery to look for male reproductive tissue\n* Testosterone levels (low)\n* Ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for testes in the abdomen\n* XY karyotype\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment includes:\n\n* Artificial (prosthetic) testicle implants\n* Male hormones (androgens)\n* Psychological support\n\n**Outlook and Complications**\n\nThe outlook is good with treatment. However, complications may include:\n\n* Face, neck, or back abnormalities in some cases\n* Infertility\n* Psychological issues\n\n---\n\n**Anorchia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nAnorchia, also known as vanishing testis syndrome, is a rare condition where one or both testes fail to develop in the womb. The exact cause of anorchia is often unknown, but it may be associated with genetic mutations, hormonal imbalances, or environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of anorchia can vary depending on the individual, but common signs include undescended testes, infertility, low sperm count, and reduced testosterone levels. Diagnosing anorchia typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Evaluation and Medical Management**\n\nEvaluating and managing anorchia requires a multidisciplinary approach involving urologists, endocrinologists, and geneticists. Treatment options may include hormone replacement therapy, fertility medications, and surgical interventions to correct undescended testes or restore testosterone production.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Testicular Disorders\n*   Male Reproductive Anatomy\n*   Male Reproductive System",

    "content": "**Anorectal Abscess**\n\nAn anorectal abscess is a collection of pus in the area of the anus and rectum.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Blocked glands in the anal area\n* Infection of an anal fissure\n* Sexually transmitted infection (STD)\n* Trauma\n* Deep rectal abscesses may be caused by intestinal disorders such as Crohn disease or diverticulitis\n\nThe following factors increase the risk for an anorectal abscess:\n\n* Anal sex\n* Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer\n* Diabetes\n* Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)\n* Use of corticosteroid medicines\n* Weakened immune system (such as from HIV/AIDS)\n\nThe condition affects men more than women. The condition may occur in infants and toddlers who are still in diapers and who have a history of anal fissures.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms are swelling around the anus and a constant, throbbing pain with swelling. Pain may be severe with bowel movements, coughing and sitting.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Constipation\n* Discharge of pus from the rectum or in the area of the anus\n* Fatigue, fever, night sweats, and chills\n* Redness, painful and hardened tissue in the area of the anus\n* Tenderness\n\nIn infants, the abscess often appears as a swollen, red, tender lump at the edge of the anus. The infant may be fussy and irritable from discomfort. There are usually no other symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA rectal examination may confirm an anorectal abscess. A proctosigmoidoscopy may be done to check for other diseases.\n\nIn some cases, a CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound is needed to help locate the collection of pus.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess.\n\nTreatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess.\n\nSurgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with medicine to make you sleepy. Sometimes, spinal or general anesthesia is used.\n\nAfter surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling.\n\nDrained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed.\n\nThe surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics.\n\nAvoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith prompt treatment, people with this condition usually do well. Infants and toddlers usually recover quickly.\n\nComplications can occur when treatment is delayed.\n\nPossible Complications\n\n* Anal fistula (abnormal connection between the anus and another structure)\n* Infection that spreads to the blood (sepsis)\n* Continuing pain\n* Problem keeps coming back (recurrence)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you:\n\n* Notice rectal discharge, pain, or other symptoms of anorectal abscess\n* Have fever, chills, or other new symptoms after being treated for this condition\n* Have diabetes and your blood glucose becomes difficult to control\n\n---\n\n**Anorectal Abscess**\n\nAn anorectal abscess is a collection of pus in the area of the anus and rectum.
