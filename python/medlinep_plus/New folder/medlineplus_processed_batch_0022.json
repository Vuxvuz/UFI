    "content": "**Bed Rest During Pregnancy**\n\nYour health care provider may recommend you to stay in bed for a few days or weeks. This is called bed rest.\n\n**Reasons for Bed Rest**\n\nBed rest used to be recommended routinely for a number of pregnancy problems, including:\n\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Premature or preterm changes in the cervix\n*   Problems with the placenta\n*   Vaginal bleeding\n*   Early labor\n*   More than one baby\n*   History of early birth or miscarriage\n*   Baby is not growing well\n*   Baby has medical problems\n\n**Current Recommendations**\n\nNow, though, most providers have stopped recommending bed rest except in rare circumstances. The reason is that studies have not shown that being on bed rest can prevent preterm birth or other pregnancy problems. And some complications may also occur due to bed rest.\n\n**Discussing Bed Rest with Your Provider**\n\nIf your provider recommends bed rest, discuss the pros and cons carefully with them.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Gregory KD, Ramos DE, Jauniaux ERM.

    "content": "**Bedaquiline**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBedaquiline is used along with at least three other medications to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; a serious infection that affects the lungs and other parts of the body and that cannot be treated with other medications that are usually used to treat the condition) in adults and children 5 years and older who weigh at least 33 lbs (15 kg) that has affected the lungs. Bedaquiline should not be used to treat TB that mainly affects other parts of the body. Bedaquiline is in a class of medications called anti-mycobacterials. It works by killing the bacteria that cause MDR-TB.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBedaquiline may cause serious or life-threatening changes in your heart rhythm. You will need to have an electrocardiogram (ECG; a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) before your treatment and several times during your treatment to see how this medication affects your heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has prolonged QT syndrome (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death) and if you have or have ever had a slow or irregular heartbeat, an underactive thyroid gland, low levels of calcium, magnesium, or potassium in your blood, heart failure, or a recent heart attack. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fast or irregular heartbeat or if you dizzy or faint. Certain medications may interact with bedaquiline and cause changes in your heart rhythm. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before receiving bedaquiline with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nYour doctor will give you instructions on how to handle missed doses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nSide effects may include fast or irregular heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, tiredness, muscle weakness, and changes in your heart rhythm. Talk to your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore bedaquiline at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Dispose of unused medicine properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nCall your doctor immediately if you experience any symptoms of a heart problem or overdose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBedaquiline is available only with a prescription. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests before you begin treatment and during your treatment to check your response to bedaquiline.\n\n---\n\n**Bedaquiline: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBedaquiline comes as a tablet to take by mouth with water. It is usually taken with food once a day for 2 weeks and then three times a week for at least 22 weeks. When you are taking bedaquiline three times a week, allow at least 48 hours between doses. Take bedaquiline at the same time of day and on the same days of the week every week.\n\nIf you or your child are unable to swallow the 20 mg tablet whole, you may break them in half on the score mark. If you or your child are unable to swallow the 20 mg tablets whole or in half, the tablets can be dissolved in 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of water in a drinking cup (no more than 5 tablets). You can drink this mixture immediately or add at least 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of additional water, milk product, apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, or a carbonated beverage.\n\nAlternatively, to make it easier to swallow, you can also crush the 20 mg tablets and add to a soft food such as yogurt, applesauce, mashed banana, or oatmeal. If you have a nasogastric (NG) tube, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to prepare bedaquiline to give through an NG tube.\n\nContinue to take bedaquiline until you finish the prescription and do not miss doses, even if you feel better. If you stop taking bedaquiline too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n---\n\n**Bedaquiline: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Part 3/4**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking bedaquiline, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bedaquiline, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in bedaquiline tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take.

Do not start this medication while taking bedaquiline without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had HIV, or liver or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are taking bedaquiline, call your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You should not breastfeed while you are taking bedaquiline and for 27.5 months (2 years, 3 months, and 2 weeks) after your final dose, unless formula is not available. If you have to breastfeed because formula is not available, tell your doctor if your infant has yellow eyes or skin or if there are any changes in the color of their urine or stool.\n\nAvoid drinking alcoholic beverages while you are taking bedaquiline. Drinking alcohol increases the risk that you will experience serious side effects from bedaquiline.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking bedaquiline, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bedaquiline, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in bedaquiline tablets.

Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\nIf you miss a dose from week 3 throughout the remaining weeks of your treatment, take the missed dose with food as soon as you remember it and continue your 3 times a week dosing schedule. Make sure that there is at least 24 hours between taking the missed dose and the next scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one or take more than your weekly dose in a 7-day period.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBedaquiline may cause side effects.

    "content": "**Bedtime Habits for Infants and Children**\n\nSleep patterns are often learned as children. When these patterns are repeated, they become habits. Helping your child learn good bedtime habits may help make going to bed a pleasant routine for you and your child.\n\n**Your New Baby (Less than 2 Months) and Sleep**\n\nAt first, your new baby is on a 24-hour feeding and sleep-wake cycle. Newborns may sleep between 10 and 18 hours a day. They stay awake only 1 to 3 hours at a time.\n\nSigns that your baby is becoming sleepy include:\n\n* Crying\n* Eye rubbing\n* Fussiness\n\nTry putting your baby to bed sleepy, but not yet asleep.\n\nTo encourage your newborn to sleep more at night rather than during the day:\n\n* Expose your newborn to light and noise during the daytime\n* As evening or bedtime approaches, dim the lights, keep things quiet, and reduce the amount of activity around your baby\n* When your baby wakes up at night to eat, keep the room dark and quiet.\n\nSleeping with a baby younger than 12 months may increase the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n**Your Infant (3 to 12 Months) and Sleep**\n\nBy age 4 months, your child might sleep for up to 6 to 8 hours at a time. Between ages 6 and 9 months, most children will sleep for 10 to 12 hours. During the first year of life, it is common for babies to take 1 to 4 naps a day, each lasting 30 minutes to 2 hours.\n\nWhen putting an infant to bed, make the bedtime routine consistent and pleasant.\n\n* Give the last nighttime feeding shortly before putting the baby to bed. Never put your baby to bed with a bottle, as it can cause baby bottle tooth decay.\n* Spend quiet time with your child by rocking, walking, or simple cuddling.\n* Put your child in bed before they are deeply asleep. This will teach your child to go to sleep on their own.\n\n**Your Toddler (1 to 3 Years) and Sleep**\n\nA toddler will most often sleep for 12 to 14 hours a day. By around 18 months, children only need one nap each day. The nap should not be close to bedtime.\n\nMake the bedtime routine pleasant and predictable.\n\n* Keep activities such as taking a bath, brushing teeth, reading stories, saying prayers, and so forth in the same order every night.\n* Choose activities that are calming, such as taking a bath, reading, or giving a gentle massage.\n* Keep the routine to a set amount of time each night. Give your child a warning when it is almost time for lights-out and sleep.\n\nSome other tips are:\n\n* Establish a rule that your child cannot leave the bedroom.\n* If your child starts screaming, shut the door to their bedroom and say, \"I am sorry, but I have to shut your door. I will open it when you are quiet.\"\n* If your child comes out of their room, avoid lecturing them. Using good eye contact, tell your child that you will open the door again when they are in bed. If your child says they are in bed, open the door.\n* If your child tries to climb into your bed at night, unless they are afraid, return them to their bed as soon as you discover their presence. Avoid lectures or sweet conversation. If your child simply cannot sleep, tell them they may read or look at books in their room, but they are not to disturb other people in the family.\n\nPraise your child for learning to self-soothe and fall asleep alone.\n\nRemember that bedtime habits can be disrupted by changes or stresses, such as moving to a new home or gaining a new brother or sister. It may take time to reestablish previous bedtime practices.\n\n---\n\n**Bedtime Habits for Infants and Children**\n\nHelping your child learn good bedtime habits may make going to bed a pleasant routine for you and your child.\n\n**Your New Baby (Less than 2 months) and Sleep**\n\n*   At first, your new baby is on a 24-hour feeding and sleep-wake cycle.\n*   Newborns may sleep between 10 and 18 hours a day.\n*   Signs that your baby is becoming sleepy include crying, eye rubbing, and fussiness.\n\n**Tips for Encouraging Your Newborn to Sleep More at Night**\n\n*   Expose your newborn to light and noise during the daytime\n*   As evening or bedtime approaches, dim the lights, keep things quiet, and reduce the amount of activity around your baby\n*   When your baby wakes up at night to eat, keep the room dark and quiet.\n\n**Your Infant (3 to 12 months) and Sleep**\n\nBy age 4 months, your child might sleep for up to 6 to 8 hours at a time.

Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Your New Baby (Less Than 2 Months) and Sleep**\n\nNewborns are on a 24-hour feeding and sleep-wake cycle. They may sleep between 10 and 18 hours a day, staying awake only 1 to 3 hours at a time.\n\nSigns that your baby is becoming sleepy include:\n\n* Becoming less active\n* Losing interest in play\n* Becoming more relaxed\n\nTry putting your baby to bed sleepy, but not yet asleep.\n\nTo encourage your newborn to sleep more at night rather than during the day:\n\n* Establish a consistent bedtime routine\n* Create a dark, quiet sleep environment\n* Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime\n\nSleeping with a baby younger than 12 months may increase the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n**Your Infant (3 to 12 Months) and Sleep**\n\nBy age 4 months, your child might sleep for up to 6 to 8 hours at a time.

This is called separation anxiety. Simply go in, speak in a calm voice, and rub your baby's back or head. Don't take your baby out of the bed. Once they have calmed down, leave the room.\n\nIf your baby awakens in the night for feeding, don't turn on the lights.\n\nBy age 9 months, if not sooner, most infants are able to sleep for at least 8 to 10 hours without needing a nighttime feeding. Infants will still wake up during the night. However, over time, your infant will learn to self-soothe and fall back asleep.\n\nSleeping with a baby younger than 12 months of age may increase the risk for SIDS.\n\n**Your Toddler (1 to 3 Years) and Sleep**\n\nA toddler will most often sleep for 12 to 14 hours a day. By around 18 months, children only need one nap each day. The nap should not be close to bedtime.\n\nMake the bedtime routine pleasant and predictable.\n\nSome other tips are:\n\n* Praise your child for learning to self-soothe and fall asleep alone.\n* Remember that bedtime habits can be disrupted by changes or stresses, such as moving to a new home or gaining a new brother or sister.

    "content": "**Bedwetting**\n\n_Bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis is when a child wets the bed at night more than twice a month after age 5 or 6._\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe last stage of toilet training is staying dry at night. To stay dry at night, your child's brain and bladder must work together so your child wakes up to go to the bathroom. Some children develop this ability later than others.\n\nBedwetting is very common. Millions of children in the United States wet the bed at night. By age 5, over 90% of children are dry during the day, and over 80% stay dry through the night. The problem usually goes away over time, but some children still wet the bed at age 7, or even older. In some cases, children and even a small number of adults, continue to have bedwetting episodes.\n\nBedwetting also runs in families. Parents who wet the bed as children are more likely to have children who wet the bed.\n\nThere are 2 types of bedwetting.\n\n* **Primary enuresis**: Children who have never been consistently dry at night. This most often occurs when the body makes more urine overnight than the bladder can hold, and the child does not wake up when the bladder is full.\n* **Secondary enuresis**: Children who were dry for at least 6 months, but started bedwetting again.\n\nWhile less common, physical causes of bedwetting may include:\n\n* Lower spinal cord lesions\n* Birth defects of the genitourinary tract\n* Urinary tract infections\n* Diabetes\n\n**Self-care at Home**\n\nRemember that your child has no control over bedwetting. So, try to be patient. Your child also may feel embarrassed and ashamed about it, so tell your child that many children wet the bed. Let your child know you want to help. Above all, do not punish your child or ignore the problem. Neither approach will help.\n\nTake these steps to help your child overcome bedwetting:\n\n* Help your child understand not to hold urine for a long time.\n* Make sure your child goes to the bathroom at normal times during the day and evening.\n* Be sure your child goes to the bathroom before going to sleep.\n* It is OK to reduce the amount of fluid your child drinks a few hours before bedtime. Just do not overdo it.\n* Reward your child for dry nights.\n\nYou might also try using a bedwetting alarm. These alarms are small and easy to buy without a prescription. The alarms work by waking children when they start to urinate. Then they can get up and use the bathroom.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nAlways notify your child's provider of any bedwetting episodes. A child should have a physical exam and a urine test to rule out urinary tract infection or other causes.\n\nContact your child's provider right away if your child is having pain with urination, fever, or blood in the urine. These may be signs of an infection that will need treatment.\n\nYou should also contact your child's provider:\n\n* If your child was dry for 6 months, then started bedwetting again.\n* If you have tried self-care at home and your child is still wetting the bed.\n\nYour child's provider may prescribe a medicine called DDAVP (desmopressin) to treat bedwetting. It will decrease the amount of urine produced at night.\n\n---\n\n**Bedwetting: Understanding and Overcoming the Problem**\n\nAs a parent, it's essential to approach bedwetting with empathy and understanding. Let your child know that you want to help them overcome this issue. Above all, avoid punishing or ignoring the problem, as these approaches won't provide any solutions.\n\n**Helping Your Child Overcome Bedwetting**\n\nTo assist your child in staying dry at night, follow these steps:\n\n*   Help your child understand the importance of not holding urine for an extended period.\n*   Ensure your child visits the bathroom regularly during the day and evening.\n*   Encourage your child to use the restroom before going to sleep.\n*   It's acceptable to reduce your child's fluid intake a few hours before bedtime, but avoid overdoing it.\n\n**Rewarding Progress**\n\nConsider implementing a reward system to motivate your child. For each dry night, offer praise or small incentives to encourage continued progress.\n\n**Using Bedwetting Alarms**\n\nYou might also want to explore using a bedwetting alarm. These devices are designed to detect the onset of urination and wake the child, allowing them to respond promptly. Alarms work best when used consistently every night.\n\n**Alarm Training and Maintenance**\n\nKeep in mind that alarm training can take several months to yield optimal results. Once your child has achieved 3 weeks of consecutive dry nights, continue using the alarm for an additional 2 weeks before gradually phasing it out. Be prepared to retrain your child if needed.\n\n**Tracking Progress with Charts or Diaries**\n\nMaintaining a chart or diary can help you identify patterns in your child's habits and provide valuable insights for their healthcare provider. This approach is particularly beneficial for children between the ages of 5 and 8.\n\n**When to Consult a Healthcare Provider**\n\nDon't hesitate to notify your child's healthcare provider about any bedwetting episodes. A physical exam and urine test may be necessary to rule out underlying urinary tract infections or other causes.\n\n**Contact Your Child's Provider in These Situations:**\n\n*   If your child was previously dry for 6 months but has started wetting the bed again.\n*   If you've attempted self-care at home without success.\n\nYour child's provider may prescribe medication, such as DDAVP (desmopressin), to help manage bedwetting. This medication can be used short-term for sleepovers or long-term for several months. Some parents find that combining bedwetting alarms with medication yields the best results.\n\n**Understanding Bedwetting**\n\nBedwetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis, is a common issue affecting millions of children in the United States. By age 5, over 90% of children are dry during the day, and more than 80% stay dry through the night. The problem usually resolves on its own, but some children may continue to experience bedwetting episodes.\n\n**Causes of Bedwetting**\n\nBedwetting can be attributed to various factors, including:\n\n*   Primary enuresis: Children who have never been consistently dry at night due to their brain and bladder not working together.\n*   Secondary enuresis: Children who were previously dry for at least 6 months but started wetting the bed again. This can be caused by physical, emotional, or sleep-related changes.\n\nWhile less common, physical causes of bedwetting may include lower spinal cord lesions, birth defects of the genitourinary tract, urinary tract infections, and diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Bedwetting: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/4)**\n\n**What Causes Bedwetting?**\n\nBedwetting can be caused by physical, emotional, or a change in sleep. This is less common, but still not the fault of the child or parent.\n\nWhile less common, physical causes of bedwetting may include:\n\n*   Lower spinal cord lesions\n*   Birth defects of the genitourinary tract\n*   Urinary tract infections\n*   Diabetes\n\n**The Last Stage of Toilet Training**\n\nThe last stage of toilet training is staying dry at night. To stay dry at night, your child's brain and bladder must work together so your child wakes up to go to the bathroom. Some children develop this ability later than others.\n\n**How Common Is Bedwetting?**\n\nBedwetting is very common. Millions of children in the United States wet the bed at night. By age 5, over 90% of children are dry during the day, and over 80% stay dry through the night. The problem usually goes away over time, but some children still wet the bed at age 7, or even older.\n\n**Bedwetting Runs in Families**\n\nBedwetting also runs in families. Parents who wet the bed as children are more likely to have children who wet the bed.\n\n**Types of Bedwetting**\n\nThere are 2 types of bedwetting.\n\n*   **Physical causes**: These include lower spinal cord lesions, birth defects of the genitourinary tract, urinary tract infections, and diabetes.\n*   **Emotional or sleep-related causes**: This is less common, but still not the fault of the child or parent.\n\n---\n\n**Bedwetting**\n\nIf your child has tried self-care at home and is still wetting the bed, their provider may prescribe a medicine called DDAVP (desmopressin) to treat bedwetting. It will decrease the amount of urine produced at night. It can be prescribed short-term for sleepovers, or used long-term for months. Some parents find that bedwetting alarms combined with medicine work best.\n\n**When to Contact a Provider**\n\nYou should contact your child's provider:\n\n* If your child is having pain with urination, fever, or blood in the urine. These may be signs of an infection that will need treatment.\n* Always notify your child's provider of any bedwetting episodes.\n* A child should have a physical exam and a urine test to rule out urinary tract infection or other causes.\n\n**References**\n\nElder JS.

    "content": "**Bee Pollen**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBee pollen is flower pollen that's collected by worker bees, mixed with nectar and bee saliva, and then packed into honeycomb cells in the hive.\n\nIt might help stimulate the immune system, but it's not clear how bee pollen causes these effects.\n\nPeople take bee pollen for athletic performance, hay fever, eczema, constipation, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using bee pollen for COVID-19.\n\nBee pollens come from many different plants, so the contents of bee pollen can vary significantly. Don't confuse bee pollen with beeswax, bee venom, honey, propolis, or royal jelly. These other bee products are not the same.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BEE POLLEN are as follows:\n\nPossibly ineffective for...\n\n* Athletic performance. Taking bee pollen by mouth doesn't seem to improve athletic performance.\n* There is interest in using bee pollen for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Bee pollen is possibly safe when used for up to 30 days. It's usually well-tolerated, but some people might experience allergic reactions.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: Taking bee pollen by mouth is possibly unsafe during pregnancy. It might stimulate the uterus and threaten the pregnancy. Don't use it.\n* Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if bee pollen is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Pollen allergy: Bee pollen can cause serious allergic reactions in people who are allergic to certain types of pollen. Symptoms can include itching, swelling, shortness of breath, light-headedness, and a severe reaction called anaphylaxis.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nModerate\n\nBe cautious with this combination:\n\n* Warfarin (Coumadin): Bee pollen might increase the effects of warfarin. Taking bee pollen with warfarin might result in an increased chance of bruising or bleeding.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nThere isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of bee pollen might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.\n\n**Other names**\n\nBee Pollen Extract, Buckwheat Pollen, Extrait de Pollen d'Abeille, Honeybee Pollen, Honey Bee Pollen, Maize Pollen, Pine Pollen, Polen de Abeja, Pollen, Pollen d'Abeille, Pollen d'Abeille de Miel, Pollen de Sarrasin.\n\n---\n\n**Bee Pollen: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Pollen, Extrait de Pollen d'Abeille, Honeybee Pollen, Honey Bee Pollen, Maize Pollen, Pine Pollen, Polen de Abeja, Pollen, Pollen d'Abeille, Pollen d'Abeille de Miel, Pollen de Sarrasin.**\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n* Leang ZX, Thalayasingam M, O'Sullivan M.

    "content": "**Bee, Wasp, Hornet, or Yellow Jacket Sting**\n\nThis article describes the effects of a sting from a bee, wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket.\n\n**Important Note:** This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poisoning from a sting. If you or someone you are with is stung, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nBee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket stings contain a substance called venom. The venom from each type of insect contains several chemicals. Bee and hornet venom contain histamine.\n\nOf these insects, Africanized bee colonies are very sensitive to being disturbed. When they are disturbed, they respond faster and in greater numbers than other types of bees. They are also much more likely to sting than European bees.\n\nYou are also at risk for stings if you disturb a wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket nest.\n\n**Where Found**\n\nBee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket venom can cause an allergic reaction in some people.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBelow are symptoms of a bee, wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket sting in different parts of the body.\n\n* **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n\t+ Swelling in the throat, lips, tongue, and mouth\n* **HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS**\n\t+ Rapid heart rate\n\t+ Severe decrease in blood pressure\n\t+ Collapse (shock)\n* **LUNGS**\n\t+ Difficulty breathing\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Hives\n\t+ Itching\n\t+ Swelling and pain at site of the sting\n* **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n\t+ Abdominal cramping\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf you have an allergy to stings from a bee, wasp, yellow jacket, or similar insect you should always carry an insect sting kit and know how to use it. These kits require a prescription. They contain a medicine called epinephrine, which you should take right away if you get a bee, wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket sting.\n\nCall poison control or a hospital emergency room if the person who is stung has an allergy to the insect or was stung inside the mouth or throat. People with severe reactions may need to go to the hospital.\n\nTo treat the sting:\n\nTry to remove the stinger from the skin (if it is still present). To do this, carefully scrape the back of a knife or other thin, blunt, straight-edged object (like a credit card) across the stinger if the person can keep still and it is safe to do so. If you are pulling the stinger out, it is important to not pinch the venom sac at the end of the stinger. If this sac is squeezed or broken, more venom will be released.\n\nClean the area thoroughly with soap and water.\n\nPlace ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has problems with blood circulation, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\n\nKeep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading.\n\nLoosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\n\nGive the person diphenhydramine (Benadryl and other brands) by mouth if they can swallow. This antihistamine drug may be used alone for mild symptoms.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* Type of insect, if possible\n* Time of the sting\n* Location of the sting\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests.\n* Breathing support, including oxygen. Severe allergic reactions may require a tube down the throat and breathing machine (ventilator).\n* Chest x-ray.\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).\n* Intravenous fluids (IV, through a vein).\n* Medicine to treat symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on how allergic they are to the insect sting and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster they get medical help, the better the chance for recovery. The chances of future total body reactions increase when local reactions become more and more severe.\n\nPeople who are not allergic to bees, wasps, hornets, or yellow jackets usually get better within 1 week.\n\n**DO NOT put your hands or feet in nests or hives or other preferred hiding places. Avoid wearing bright colored-clothing and perfumes or other fragrances if you will be in an area where these insects are known to gather.**\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nApitoxin; Apis venenum purum; Insect sting; Insect bite; Wasp sting; Hornet sting; Yellow jacket sting\n\n**References**\n\nCurtis AM, Erickson TB.

The health problems associated with Behçet disease result from widespread inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). This inflammation most commonly affects small blood vessels in the mouth, genitals, skin, and eyes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Behçet Disease**\n\nPainful mouth sores called aphthous ulcers are usually the first sign of Behçet disease. These sores can occur on the lips, tongue, inside the cheeks, the roof of the mouth, the throat, and the tonsils. The ulcers look like common canker sores, and they typically heal within one to two weeks. About 75 percent of all people with Behçet disease develop similar ulcers on the genitals. These ulcers occur most frequently on the scrotum in men and on the labia in women.\n\nBehçet disease can also cause painful bumps and sores on the skin. Most affected individuals develop pus-filled bumps that resemble acne. These bumps can occur anywhere on the body. Some affected people also have red, tender nodules called erythema nodosum. These nodules usually develop on the legs but can also occur on the arms, face, and neck.\n\nAn inflammation of the eye called uveitis is found in more than half of people with Behçet disease. Eye problems are more common in younger people with the disease and affect men more often than women. Uveitis can result in blurry vision and an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rarely, inflammation can also cause eye pain and redness. If untreated, the eye problems associated with Behçet disease can lead to blindness.\n\nJoint involvement is also common in Behçet disease. Often this affects one joint at a time, with each affected joint becoming swollen and painful and then getting better.\n\nLess commonly, Behçet disease can affect the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), gastrointestinal tract, large blood vessels, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Central nervous system abnormalities can lead to headaches, confusion, personality changes, memory loss, impaired speech, and problems with balance and movement. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to a hole in the wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation), which can cause serious infection and may be life-threatening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Behçet Disease**\n\nBehçet disease is most common in Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Japan, and other parts of Asia. However, it has been found in populations worldwide. The highest prevalence of Behçet disease has been reported in northern Turkey, where the disorder affects up to 420 in 100,000 people. The disorder is rare in northern European countries and the United States, where it generally affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 people.\n\n---\n\n**Behçet Disease**\n\n**What is Behçet disease?**\n\nBehçet disease is a rare disorder that affects the blood vessels throughout the body. It is characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation, particularly in the mouth and genital areas.\n\n**Where does Behçet disease occur?**\n\nBehçet disease has been found in populations worldwide, but it is most prevalent in northern Turkey, where it affects up to 420 people per 100,000 population. It is rare in northern European countries and the United States, where it generally affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 people.\n\n**Causes of Behçet disease**\n\nThe cause of Behçet disease is unknown, but it probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A particular variation in the HLA-B gene has been associated with the risk of developing Behçet disease. The HLA-B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system.\n\n**HLA-B gene**\n\nThe HLA-B gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders. A variation of the HLA-B gene called HLA-B51 increases the risk of developing Behçet disease by about a factor of six.\n\n**Other genetic and environmental factors**\n\nOther genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the risk of Behçet disease. Researchers are studying several genes related to immune system function, and it appears likely that environmental factors, such as certain bacterial or viral infections, play a role in triggering the disease in people who are at risk.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nMost cases of Behçet disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.\n\n**Other names for this condition**\n\nBehçet disease is also known as Adamantiades-Behcet disease, Behcet syndrome, Behcet triple symptom complex, Behcet's syndrome, Malignant aphthosis, Old Silk Route disease, and Triple symptom complex.\n\n---\n\n**Behçet Disease**\n\n**What is Behçet disease?**\n\nBehçet disease is a rare disorder characterized by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   The exact cause of Behçet disease is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder.\n*   Genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disease.\n*   HLA-B51/B5 genotype has been associated with an increased risk of developing Behçet's disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBehçet disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including:\n\n*   Oral and genital ulcers\n*   Inflammation of the eyes (uveitis)\n*   Inflammation of the joints (arthritis)\n*   Inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of Behçet disease is typically made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for Behçet disease, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n*   Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation\n*   Immunosuppressive medications to suppress the immune system\n*   Pain relief medication to manage pain and discomfort\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Behçet disease varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with Behçet disease can lead active and productive lives.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nBehçet disease is a complex disorder that involves multiple genetic and environmental factors. Research has identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing the disease.\n\n*   HLA-B51/B5 genotype\n*   Other genetic variants\n\n**References**\n\n*   de Menthon M, Lavalley MP, Maldini C, Guillevin L, Mahr A.

Talk with your provider before you start a new exercise program. Also ask if it is OK before you do a harder activity.\n\nAerobic activity uses your heart and lungs for a long period of time. It also helps your heart use oxygen better and improves blood flow. You want to make your heart work a little harder every time, but not too hard.\n\nStart slowly. Choose an aerobic activity such as walking, swimming, light jogging, or biking. Do this at least 3 to 4 times a week.\n\nAlways do 5 minutes of stretching or moving around to warm up your muscles and heart before exercising. Allow time to cool down after you exercise. Do the same activity but at a slower pace.\n\nTake rest periods before you get too tired. If you feel tired or have any heart symptoms, stop. Wear comfortable clothing for the exercise you are doing.\n\n**During Hot Weather**\n\nExercise in the morning or evening. Be careful not to wear too many layers of clothes.

Rest often.\n\n**Pace Yourself and Know Your Limits**\n\nIf exercise puts too much strain on your heart, you may have pain and other symptoms, such as:\n\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Chest pain\n*   Irregular heartbeat or pulse\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Nausea\n\nIt is important that you pay attention to these warning signs.

    "content": "**Belching**\n\nBelching is the act of bringing up air from the stomach.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Belching is a normal process. The purpose of belching is to release air from the stomach.\n* Every time you swallow, you also swallow air, along with fluid or food.\n* The buildup of air in the upper stomach causes the stomach to stretch, triggering the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus to relax and allow air to escape up the esophagus and out the mouth.\n* Depending on the cause of the belching, it may occur more often, last longer, or be more forceful.\n* Symptoms such as nausea, dyspepsia, and heartburn may be relieved by belching.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAbnormal belching may be due to:\n\n* Acid reflux disease (also called gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD)\n* Digestive system disease\n* Pressure caused by the unconscious swallowing of air (aerophagia)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nYou can get relief by lying on your side or in a knee-to-chest position until the gas passes.\n\nAvoid chewing gum, eating quickly, and eating gas-producing foods and beverages.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nMost of the time belching is a minor problem. Contact a health care provider if the belching does not go away, or if you also have other symptoms such as abdominal pain or fever.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms, including:\n\n* Is this the first time this has occurred?\n* Is there a pattern to your belching? For example, does it happen when you are nervous or after you have been consuming certain foods or drinks?\n* What other symptoms do you have?\n\nYou may need more tests based on what the provider finds during your exam and your other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Belching**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of Belching**: Avoid chewing gum, eating quickly, and eating gas-producing foods and beverages.\n*   **Relief from Belching**: You can get relief by lying on your side or in a knee-to-chest position until the gas passes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nMost of the time belching is a minor problem.

    "content": "**Bell's Palsy**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nBell's palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and include:\n\n* Twitching\n* Weakness\n* Paralysis\n* Drooping eyelid or corner of mouth\n* Drooling\n* Dry eye or mouth\n* Excessive tearing in the eye\n* Impaired ability to taste\n\n**What causes it?**\n\nScientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. You are most likely to get Bell's palsy if you are pregnant, diabetic or sick with a cold or flu.\n\n**How is it treated?**\n\nThree out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without treatment, most people begin to get better within 2 weeks and recover completely within 3 to 6 months.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Bell's Palsy (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Bell's Palsy  (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\n* What Is Bell's Palsy?

    "content": "**Belladonna**\n\n**What is it?**\nBelladonna (Atropa belladonna) is a plant that grows from Western Europe to the Himalayas. It's also grown in the US. All parts of the plant are poisonous.\n\nBelladonna has chemicals that can alter the function of the body's nervous system and cause changes to saliva, sweat, pupil size, urination, digestive functions, and others. Belladonna can also cause increased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nDespite known safety concerns, people use belladonna for asthma, the common cold, hemorrhoids, Parkinson disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nSince 2010, the FDA has issued several warnings about homeopathic teething tablets and gels for infants that contain belladonna. Serious side effects including seizures, breathing problems, and agitation have been reported in infants taking these products, and some have died.\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using belladonna for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Belladonna is likely unsafe. It contains chemicals that can be poisonous even at low doses. Serious side effects might include blurred vision, fever, fast heartbeat, inability to urinate or sweat, hallucinations, spasms, mental problems, convulsions, coma, and others.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Belladonna is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information available to know if the poisonous chemicals in belladonna can be absorbed through the skin.\n\nWhen given as a suppository (rectally): Belladonna is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information available to know if the poisonous chemicals in belladonna can be absorbed from the rectum.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: Belladonna is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy.\n* Breast-feeding: Belladonna is likely unsafe when taken by mouth while breast-feeding.\n* Children: Belladonna is likely unsafe when taken by mouth. Consuming as few as 2 berries can be fatal in small children.\n* Heart disease: Belladonna might cause rapid heartbeat and might make some heart conditions worse.\n* Down syndrome: People with Down syndrome might be extra-sensitive to the chemicals in belladonna and their harmful effects.\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions: Belladonna might slow down the stomach and intestines, which could make some GI conditions worse.\n* Narrow-angle glaucoma: Belladonna might make narrow-angle glaucoma worse.\n\n---\n\n**Belladonna: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Sensitive to the chemicals in belladonna and their harmful effects.**\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions:** Belladonna might slow down the stomach and intestines, which could make some GI conditions worse.\n\n**Narrow-angle glaucoma:** Belladonna might make narrow-angle glaucoma worse.\n\n**Interactions with medications:**\n\n*   **Cisapride (Propulsid):** Belladonna contains atropine. Atropine can reduce the effects of cisapride. Taking belladonna with cisapride might reduce the effects of cisapride.\n*   **Drying medications (Anticholinergic drugs):** Belladonna can block a chemical in the body called acetylcholine, which has many important functions. Some medications, called anticholinergic drugs, also block acetylcholine. There is some concern that taking them together might increase the risk for confusion, blurred vision, increased sweating, and increased heart rate.\n\n**Interactions with herbs and supplements:** There are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Interactions with foods:** There are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**Typical use:** Despite known safety concerns, belladonna is found in some herbal supplements and homeopathic products. The FDA has issued several warnings about homeopathic teething tablets and gels for infants that contain belladonna. Taking belladonna is unsafe and can cause serious side effects.\n\n**Other names:**\n\n*   Atropa belladonna\n*   Atropa acuminata\n*   Baccifère\n*   Belladona\n*   Belladone\n*   Belle-Dame\n*   Belle-Galante\n*   Bouton Noir\n*   Cerise du Diable\n*   Cerise Enragée\n*   Cerise d'Espagne\n*   Deadly Nightshade\n*   Devil's Cherries\n*   Devil's Herb\n*   Divale\n*   Dwale\n*   Dwayberry\n*   Grande Morelle\n*   Great Morel\n*   Guigne de la Côte\n*   Herbe à la Mort\n*   Herbe du Diable\n*   Indian Belladonna\n*   Morelle Furieuse\n*   Naughty Man's Cherries\n*   Poison Black Cherries\n*   Suchi\n\n**Methodology:** To learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References:**\n\n*   Schmoll S, Romanek K, Zorn G, et al.

    "content": "**Benazepril and Hydrochlorothiazide**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Benazepril: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBenazepril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBenazepril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take benazepril, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take benazepril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of benazepril and gradually increase your dose.\n\nBenazepril controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take benazepril even if you feel well. Do not stop taking benazepril without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Benazepril: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking benazepril, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to benazepril; other ACE inhibitors such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec, in Vaseretic), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (in Prinzide, in Zestoretic), moexipril (Univasc, in Uniretic), perindopril (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril, in Accuretic, in Quinaretic), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik, in Tarka); any other medications; or any ingredients in benazepril tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking valsartan and sacubitril (Entresto) or if you have stopped taking it within the last 36 hours. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take benazepril, if you are also taking valsartan and sacubitril. Also, tell your doctor if you have diabetes and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take benazepril if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with benazepril. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with benazepril. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting benazepril with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking benazepril, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with benazepril: aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve); potassium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking benazepril. Do not start any of these medications while taking benazepril without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have recently had severe diarrhea or vomiting and if you have diabetes, heart failure, kidney disease, lupus, or scleroderma (a condition in which extra tissue grows on the skin and some organs).\n\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking benazepril.\n\nYou should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nTalk to your doctor before using salt substitutes containing potassium. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBenazepril may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* cough\n* headache\n* dizziness\n* drowsiness\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* lightheadedness\n* fainting\n* rash\n* yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* fever, sore throat, chills, and other signs of infection\n\nBenazepril may cause other side effects.

    "content": "**Benefits of Quitting Tobacco**\n\nIf you smoke, you should quit. But quitting can be hard. Most people who have quit smoking have tried at least once, and often several times, without long-term success in the past. View any past attempts to quit as a learning experience, not a failure.\n\nThere are many reasons to quit using tobacco. Long-term use of tobacco can increase your risk of many serious health problems.\n\n**The Benefits of Quitting**\n\nYou may enjoy the following when you quit smoking:\n\n* Your breath, clothes, and hair will smell better.\n* Your sense of smell will return. Food will taste better.\n* Your fingers and fingernails will slowly appear less yellow.\n* Your stained teeth may slowly become whiter.\n* Your children will be healthier and will be less likely to start smoking.\n* It will be easier and cheaper to find an apartment or hotel room.\n* You may have an easier time getting a job.\n* Friends may be more willing to be in your car or home.\n* It may be easier to socialize. Many people do not smoke and do not like to be around people who smoke.\n* You will save money. If you smoke a pack a day, you spend about $2000 a year on cigarettes.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nSome health benefits begin almost immediately. Every week, month, and year without tobacco further improves your health.\n\n* Within 20 minutes of quitting: Your blood pressure and heart rate drop to normal.\n* Within 12 hours of quitting: Your blood carbon monoxide level drops to normal.\n* Within 2 weeks to 3 months of quitting: Your circulation improves and your lung function increases.\n* Within 1 to 9 months of quitting: Coughing and shortness of breath decrease. Your lungs and airways are more able to handle mucus, clean the lungs, and reduce the risk of infection.\n* Within 1 year of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone still using tobacco. Your heart attack risk drops dramatically.\n* Within 5 years of quitting: Your risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers are reduced by half. Cervical cancer risk falls to that of a non-smoker. Your stroke risk can fall to that of a non-smoker after 2 to 5 years.\n* Within 10 years of quitting: Your risk of dying from lung cancer is about one half that of a person who still smokes.\n* Within 15 years of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is the same as that of a non-smoker.\n\nOther health benefits of quitting smoking include:\n\n* Lower chance of blood clots in the legs, which may travel to the lungs\n* Lower risk of erectile dysfunction\n* Fewer problems during pregnancy, such as babies born at low birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and cleft lip\n* Lower risk of infertility due to damaged sperm\n* Healthier teeth, gums, and skin\n\n**Making the Decision**\n\nLike any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult, especially if you do it alone. There are a lot of ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you. Talk to your health care provider about nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medicines.\n\nIf you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites.\n\n---\n\n**Benefits of Quitting Tobacco**\n\nQuitting tobacco is one of the best decisions you can make for your health. The benefits begin almost immediately and continue to improve with each passing year.\n\n**Immediate Benefits**\n\n*   Within 20 minutes of quitting: Your blood pressure and heart rate drop to normal.\n*   Within 12 hours of quitting: Your blood carbon monoxide level drops to normal.\n*   Within 2 weeks to 3 months of quitting: Your circulation improves and your lung function increases.\n\n**Short-Term Benefits**\n\n*   Within 1 to 9 months of quitting: Coughing and shortness of breath decrease. Your lungs and airways are more able to handle mucus, clean the lungs, and reduce the risk of infection.\n*   Within 1 year of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone still using tobacco.

    "content": "**Benign Ear Cyst or Tumor**\n\nBenign ear cysts are lumps or growths in the ear. They are not cancerous.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSebaceous cysts are the most common type of cysts seen in the ear. These sack-like lumps are made up of dead skin cells and oils produced by oil glands in the skin.\n\nPlaces they are likely to be found include:\n\n* Behind the ear\n* In the ear canal\n* In the earlobe\n* On the scalp\n\nThe exact cause of the problem is unknown. Cysts may occur when oils are produced in a skin gland faster than they can be released from the gland. They can also occur if the oil gland opening has become blocked and a cyst forms under the skin.\n\nBenign bony tumors of the ear canal (exostoses and osteomas) are caused by excess growth of bone. Repeated exposure to cold water may increase the risk for benign bony tumors of the ear canal.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cysts include:\n\n* Pain (if cysts are in the outside ear canal or if they get infected)\n* Small soft skin lumps on, behind, or in front of the ear\n\nThe symptoms of benign tumors include:\n\n* Ear discomfort\n* Gradual hearing loss in one ear\n* Repeated outer ear infections\n\nNote: There may be no symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBenign cysts and tumors are most often found during a routine ear exam. This type of exam may include hearing tests (audiometry) and middle ear testing (tympanometry). When looking into the ear, the healthcare provider may see cysts or benign tumors in the ear canal.\n\nSometimes, a CT scan is needed.\n\nThis disease may also affect the results of the following tests:\n\n* Caloric stimulation\n* Electronystagmography\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is not needed if the cyst does not cause pain or affect hearing.\n\nIf a cyst becomes painful, it may be infected. Treatment may include antibiotics or removal of the cyst.\n\nBenign bony tumors may increase in size over time. Surgery may be needed if a benign tumor is painful, interferes with hearing, or leads to frequent ear infections.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBenign ear cysts and tumors are slow-growing. They may sometimes shrink or may disappear on their own.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Hearing loss, if the tumor is large\n* Infection of the cyst\n* Infection of the ear canal\n* Wax trapped in the ear canal\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Symptoms of a benign ear cyst or tumor\n* Discomfort, pain, or hearing loss\n\n---\n\n**Benign Ear Cyst or Tumor**\n\n**What is it?**\nA benign ear cyst or tumor is a slow-growing lump in the ear that can cause pain, discomfort, and hearing loss.\n\n**Where are they likely to be found?**\nBehind the ear\nIn the ear canal\nIn the earlobe\nOn the scalp\n\n**What causes them?**\nThe exact cause of the problem is unknown.

There are several types of benign ear tumors, including:\n\n*   **Chondromas**: These are benign cartilaginous tumors that can occur on the external auditory canal.\n*   **Glomus tumors**: These are benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, a specialized structure in the middle ear.\n*   **Hemangiomas**: These are benign tumors made up of blood vessels that can occur in the middle ear or mastoid bone.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a benign ear cyst or tumor can vary depending on the type and location of the growth. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Hearing loss**: A benign ear cyst or tumor can cause hearing loss by blocking sound waves from reaching the inner ear.\n*   **Ear fullness**: Some people with benign ear tumors may experience a feeling of fullness in the ear, which can be accompanied by discomfort or pain.\n*   **Tinnitus**: Benign ear tumors can also cause ringing or other sounds in the ear.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing a benign ear cyst or tumor typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Your doctor may use one or more of the following tests to diagnose a benign ear tumor:\n\n*   **Computed tomography (CT) scan**: A CT scan uses X-rays and computer technology to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.\n*   **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: An MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.\n*   **Auditory brainstem response (ABR) test**: This test measures the electrical activity in the auditory nerve as sound is presented to the ear.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for a benign ear cyst or tumor depends on the type and location of the growth, as well as the individual's overall health. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Observation**: In some cases, a benign ear tumor may not require treatment other than regular monitoring by your doctor.\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery may be necessary to remove a benign ear tumor, especially if it is causing symptoms or is located in a critical area of the ear.\n*   **Radiation therapy**: Radiation therapy may be used to treat certain types of benign ear tumors, such as glomus tumors.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there are no surefire ways to prevent benign ear cysts or tumors, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Avoid exposure to carcinogens**: Certain chemicals and substances have been linked to an increased risk of developing benign ear tumors.\n*   **Get regular check-ups**: Regular health check-ups can help detect any potential problems early on.\n*   **Practice good ear hygiene**: Keeping the ears clean and free of wax can help prevent infections that may lead to benign ear tumors.",

    "content": "**Benign Positional Vertigo - Aftercare**\n\nYou may have seen your health care provider because you have had benign positional vertigo. It is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo and the easiest to treat.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYour provider may have treated your vertigo with the Epley maneuver. These are head movements that very often correct the inner ear problem that causes BPPV. After you go home:\n\n*   For the rest of the day, do not bend over.\n*   For several days after treatment, do not sleep on the side that triggers symptoms.\n*   Follow any other specific instructions your provider gave you.\n\nMost of the time, treatment will cure BPPV. Sometimes, vertigo may return after a few weeks. About half the time, BPPV will come back later on. If this happens, you will need to be treated again. Your provider may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations. But, these medicines often do not work well for treating the actual vertigo.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nIf vertigo returns, remember that you can easily lose your balance, fall, and hurt yourself. To help keep symptoms from getting worse and to help keep you safe:\n\n*   Sit down right away when you feel dizzy.\n*   To get up from a lying position, slowly sit up and stay seated for a few moments before standing.\n*   Make sure you hold on to something when standing.\n*   Avoid sudden movements or position changes.\n*   Ask your provider about using a cane or other walking aid when you have a vertigo attack.\n*   Avoid bright lights, TV, and reading during a vertigo attack. They may make symptoms worse.\n*   Avoid activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing while you are having symptoms.\n\nTo keep your symptoms from getting worse, avoid the positions that trigger it.

    "content": "**Benign Positional Vertigo**\n\nBenign positional vertigo is the most common type of vertigo. It's a feeling that you're spinning or that everything around you is spinning. This sensation can occur when you move your head in a certain position.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBenign positional vertigo, also known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), is caused by a problem in the inner ear. The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes, and the canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. This sensation helps your brain understand the position of your body, which is essential for balance.\n\nBPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) break free and float inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nThere are no major risk factors for BPPV. However, your risk may increase if you have:\n\n* Family members with BPPV\n* Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)\n* Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBPPV symptoms include:\n\n* Feeling like you're spinning or moving\n* Feeling like the world is spinning around you\n* Loss of balance\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Hearing loss\n* Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving\n\nThe spinning sensation:\n\n* Is usually triggered by moving your head\n* Often starts suddenly\n* Lasts a few seconds to minutes\n\nCertain positions can trigger the spinning feeling:\n\n* Rolling over in bed\n* Tilting your head up to look at something\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history. To diagnose BPPV, your provider may perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n\nThis test involves holding your head in a certain position and then lying quickly backward over a table. As you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements (called nystagmus) and ask if you feel like you're spinning.\n\nIf this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests, such as:\n\n* Electronystagmography (ENG)\n* Head CT scan\n* Head MRI scan\n* Hearing test\n* Magnetic resonance angiography of the head\n* Warming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements (caloric stimulation)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider may perform a procedure called the Epley maneuver. It's a series of head movements to reposition the canaliths in your inner ear. The procedure may need to be repeated if symptoms come back, but this treatment works best to cure BPPV.\n\nYour provider may teach you other repositioning exercises that you can do at home, but may take longer than the Epley maneuver to work. Other exercises, such as balance therapy, may help some people.\n\nSome medicines can help relieve spinning sensations:\n\n* Antihistamines\n* Anticholinergics\n* Sedative-hypnotics\n\n**Follow-Up Care**\n\nTo keep your symptoms from getting worse, avoid the positions that trigger it.

One such condition is benign positional vertigo, also known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of BPPV is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the movement of small calcium particles called otoliths in the inner ear. These particles can become displaced and cause the symptoms of BPPV.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of BPPV is a feeling of spinning or vertigo that occurs when you move your head in certain ways. This can include rolling over in bed, getting up from lying down, or making sudden movements with your head. The vertigo can be severe and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing BPPV is typically done through a physical examination and medical history. Your doctor may perform the Dix-Hallett test to check for the presence of BPPV. This involves moving your head in different positions while you are seated on an exam table.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for BPPV usually involves a series of maneuvers that help to move the otoliths back into place. These can include the Epley maneuver, which involves a series of movements with your head and body. Your doctor may also recommend exercises to help improve your balance and reduce the frequency and severity of your symptoms.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n* Dizziness and Vertigo\n\nNote: The original content included multiple instances of the same text, which have been removed in the cleaned output above.",

    "content": "**Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC)**\n\n**What is Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis?**\n\nBenign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is a condition characterized by episodes of liver dysfunction called cholestasis. During these episodes, the liver cells have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe first episode of cholestasis usually occurs in an affected person's teens or twenties. An attack typically begins with severe itchiness (pruritus), followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include:\n\n*   Vague feeling of discomfort (malaise)\n*   Irritability\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Lack of appetite\n\nA common feature of BRIC is the reduced absorption of fat in the body, which leads to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea). Because of a lack of fat absorption and loss of appetite, affected individuals often lose weight during episodes of cholestasis.\n\n**Types of BRIC**\n\nBRIC is divided into two types, BRIC1 and BRIC2, based on the genetic cause of the condition. The signs and symptoms are the same in both types.\n\n**Is BRIC a Benign Condition?**\n\nThis condition is called benign because it does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, episodes of liver dysfunction occasionally develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity.\n\n---\n\n**Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC)**\n\n**What is Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis?**\n\nBenign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is a rare disorder characterized by episodes of liver dysfunction called cholestasis. During these episodes, the liver cells have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile.\n\n**Causes of BRIC**\n\nMutations in the ATP8B1 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), and mutations in the ABCB11 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). These two genes are involved in the release (secretion) of bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps digest fats.\n\n**Symptoms of BRIC**\n\nThe first episode of cholestasis usually occurs in an affected person's teens or twenties. An attack typically begins with severe itchiness (pruritus), followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include:\n\n*   Vague feeling of discomfort (malaise)\n*   Irritability\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Lack of appetite\n\n**Types of BRIC**\n\nBRIC is divided into two types, BRIC1 and BRIC2, based on the genetic cause of the condition. The signs and symptoms are the same in both types.\n\n**Frequency of BRIC**\n\nBRIC is a rare disorder. Although the prevalence is unknown, this condition is less common than the related disorder PFIC, which affects approximately 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nThis condition is called benign because it does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, episodes of liver dysfunction occasionally develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity.\n\n**Unknown Factors**\n\nThe factors that trigger episodes of BRIC are unknown. Some people with BRIC do not have a mutation in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC)**\n\n**What is BRIC?**\n\nBRIC is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of intrahepatic cholestasis, which is a decrease in bile salt secretion.\n\n**Causes and Triggers**\n\nThe factors that trigger episodes of BRIC are unknown. Some people with BRIC do not have a mutation in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nBoth types of BRIC are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nSome people with BRIC have no family history of the disorder. These cases arise from mutations in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene that occur in the body's cells after conception and are not inherited.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ABCB11-related intrahepatic cholestasis\n* ATP8B1-related intrahepatic cholestasis\n* BRIC\n* Low gamma-GT familial intrahepatic cholestasis\n* Recurrent familial intrahepatic cholestasis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\t+ Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1\n\t+ Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ CHOLESTASIS, BENIGN RECURRENT INTRAHEPATIC, 1; BRIC1\n\t+ CHOLESTASIS, BENIGN RECURRENT INTRAHEPATIC, 2; BRIC2\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Folmer DE, van der Mark VA, Ho-Mok KS, Oude Elferink RP, Paulusma CC.

The condition affects the liver's ability to process bile, leading to its buildup in the body.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nBRIC is caused by genetic mutations that affect the liver's function. The exact cause of these mutations is often unknown, but they can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of BRIC typically begin in childhood or adolescence and may include:\n\n* Recurring episodes of jaundice\n* Itching (pruritus)\n* Fatigue\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing BRIC involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These tests may include:\n\n* Blood tests to measure liver enzymes and bilirubin levels\n* Imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI to evaluate the liver's structure and function\n* Genetic testing to identify specific mutations associated with BRIC\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for BRIC, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Medications to reduce itching and inflammation\n* Dietary changes to minimize bile buildup in the body\n* Regular monitoring of liver function and overall health\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with BRIC varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and their response to treatment. With proper management, many people with BRIC can lead normal lives, although they may experience recurring episodes of jaundice.\n\n\\n\\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nBRIC is a genetic disorder that can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development. Understanding genetics and the inheritance patterns of BRIC can help individuals and families affected by this condition make informed decisions about their health and well-being.",

Benralizumab injection is also used to treat eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; a condition that involves asthma, high levels of white blood cells, and blood vessel swelling) in adults.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBenralizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). To treat asthma, it is usually given once every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then given once every 8 weeks. To treat eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. Your doctor will determine the length of your treatment based on your condition and how well you respond to the medication.\n\nBenralizumab injection comes in a prefilled syringe to be given by a doctor or nurse in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen at a clinic or office. If you are an adult or a child over the age of 11 years, your doctor may allow you or a caregiver to give benralizumab injection at home using an autoinjector (Fasenra Pen).

This happens because:\n\n*   Permanent brain damage occurs\n*   The heart stops\n*   The lungs stop working\n\nPeople who have regular exposure to low levels of benzene can also become sick. The most common problems are blood diseases, including:\n\n*   Leukemia\n*   Lymphoma\n*   Severe anemia\n\nPeople who work with benzene products should only do so in areas with good air flow. They should also wear protective gloves and eye glasses.\n\n**References**\n\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website. ATSDR Toxic Substances Portal.

    "content": "**Benzgalantamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/3)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBenzgalantamine is used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD; a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and the ability to think, learn, communicate and handle daily activities). Benzgalantamine is in a class of medications called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It works by increasing the amount of a certain natural substance in the brain that is needed for memory and thought. Benzgalantamine may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities in people who have AD. However, benzgalantamine will not cure AD or prevent the loss of mental abilities at some time in the future.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBenzgalantamine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take benzgalantamine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take benzgalantamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n*   Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n*   Drink plenty of water while receiving benzgalantamine.\n*   Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of benzgalantamine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.\n*   Continue to take benzgalantamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking benzgalantamine without talking to your doctor. If you do stop taking benzgalantamine for a few days or longer, call your doctor before you start to take benzgalantamine again. Your doctor will probably tell you to start with the lowest dose of benzgalantamine and gradually increase your dose to the dose you had been taking.\n*   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Benzgalantamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking benzgalantamine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to benzgalantamine, galantamine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in benzgalantamine tablet. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking benzgalantamine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with benzgalantamine: diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, brompheniramine, doxylamine, loperamide, ibuprofen and naproxen. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking benzgalantamine. Do not start any of these medications while taking benzgalantamine without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma or any other lung disease; an enlarged prostate; ulcers; seizures; irregular heartbeat; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking benzgalantamine, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking benzgalantamine.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking benzgalantamine. Alcohol may cause benzgalantamine to not work as well.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you miss more than 3 doses, call your doctor before restarting.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBenzgalantamine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* Decreased appetite\n* Depression\n* Dizziness\n* Headache\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Weight loss\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately {or get emergency medical treatment}:\n\n* Rash, blistering or peeling of the skin, skin pain, swelling of lips, mouth, throat, tongue or face\n* Fever, sore throat, cough, joint pain, fatigue\n* Feeling weak, confusion, fainting, shortness of breath, chest pain, slowed heart beat\n* Bloody or black, tarry stools, vomiting blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds, severe abdominal pain\n* Difficulty urinating or weak urine flow, painful urination, blood in urine\n* Seizures\n* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n\nBenzgalantamine may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nCleaned output:\n\n---\n\n**Benzgalantamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Storage and Disposal of This Medication**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.\n\nSymptoms of overdose may include:\n\n*   abdominal cramping\n*   nausea\n*   vomiting\n*   salivation\n*   lacrimation\n*   urination\n*   defecation\n*   sweating\n*   feeling weak, confusion, fainting, shortness of breath, chest pain, slowed heart beat\n*   difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n*   seizures\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor.\n\nDo not let anyone else take your medication.

It should not be used in children less than 6 months of age. Benzyl alcohol is in a class of medications called pediculicides. It works by killing the lice.

You should use a timer or clock to track the time.\n*   After 10 minutes, rinse the lotion from your scalp and hair with water in a sink. You should not use a shower or bathtub to rinse the lotion away because you do not want to get the lotion over the rest of your body.\n*   You and anyone who helped you apply the lotion should wash your hands carefully after the application and rinsing steps.\n*   You may shampoo your hair after rinsing the lotion from your scalp and hair.\n*   A lice comb may also be used to remove the dead lice and nits (empty egg shells) after this treatment. You may also need to have an adult help you to do this.\n*   You will need to repeat this entire process in one week to kill the lice that hatch from eggs.\n\nAfter using benzyl alcohol lotion, sanitize all the clothing, underwear, pajamas, hats, sheets, pillowcases, and towels you have used recently.

If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nTo use the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n*   Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and dropper must be kept clean.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n*   Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n*   If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n*   Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nWhen you use bepotastine eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of bepotastine eye drops, use it as soon as you remember. Then, continue with your regular schedule.

    "content": "**Berberine**\n\n**What is it?**\nBerberine is a chemical found in some plants like European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric. It's a bitter-tasting and yellow-colored chemical that might help strengthen the heartbeat, kill bacteria, regulate blood sugar levels, and reduce swelling.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Canber sores: Applying a gel containing berberine can reduce pain, redness, oozing, and the size of canker sores.\n\t+ Diabetes: Taking berberine by mouth seems to slightly reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.\n\t+ A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori): Adding berberine by mouth to multiple medications might work as well as other accepted treatments for this condition.\n\t+ High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia): Taking berberine by mouth, alone or with other ingredients, might help lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol.\n\t+ High blood pressure: Taking 0.9 grams of berberine by mouth daily along with the blood pressure-lowering drug amlodipine reduces blood pressure better than taking amlodipine alone in people with high blood pressure.\n\t+ A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS): Taking berberine by mouth might lower blood sugar, improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, reduce testosterone levels, and lower waist-to-hip ratio in people with PCOS.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* When taken by mouth: Berberine is possibly safe for most adults. It's been used safely in doses up to 1.5 grams daily for 6 months. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, gas, and upset stomach.\n* When applied to the skin: Berberine is possibly safe for most adults when used short-term.\n* Special precautions & warnings:\n\t+ Pregnancy: It's likely unsafe to take berberine by mouth if you are pregnant. Berberine can cross the placenta and might cause harm to the fetus.\n\t+ Breast-feeding: It's likely unsafe to take berberine if you are breast-feeding. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk, and it might cause harm.\n\t+ Children: It's likely unsafe to give berberine to newborns. It can cause kernicterus, a rare type of brain damage that can occur in newborns who have severe jaundice. There isn't enough reliable information to know if berberine is safe in older children.\n\t+ High bilirubin levels in the blood in infants: Bilirubin is a chemical that is produced when old red blood cells break down. It is normally removed by the liver. Berberine may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough. This can cause brain problems, especially in infants with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Avoid using.\n\n---\n\n**Berberine: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breast-feeding**\n\nIt's likely unsafe to take berberine if you are breast-feeding.

Avoid using.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Major: Do not take this combination.**\n    *   Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)\n        Berberine might decrease how quickly the body breaks down cyclosporine. This might increase the effects and side effects of cyclosporine.\n*   **Moderate: Be cautious with this combination.**\n    *   Dextromethorphan (Robitussin DM, others)\n        Berberine might decrease how quickly the body breaks down dextromethorphan. This might increase the effects and side effects of dextromethorphan.\n    *   Losartan (Cozaar)\n        The liver activates losartan to make it work. Berberine might decrease how quickly the body activates it, which might decrease the effects of losartan.\n*   **Medications changed by the liver**\n    *   Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates\n        Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Berberine might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n    *   Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) substrates\n        Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Berberine might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n    *   Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates\n        Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Berberine might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n*   **Medications for diabetes**\n    *   Antidiabetes drugs\n        Berberine might lower blood sugar levels. Taking berberine along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n*   **Medications for high blood pressure**\n    *   Antihypertensive drugs\n        Berberine might lower blood pressure. Taking berberine along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low. Monitor your blood pressure closely.\n*   **Medications that slow blood clotting**\n    *   Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs\n        Berberine might slow blood clotting. Taking berberine along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n*   **Metformin (Glucophage)**\n    *   Berberine might increase the amount of metformin in the body. This may increase its effects and side effects. This interaction seems to occur when berberine is taken around 2 hours before metformin. Taking berberine and metformin at the same time doesn't appear to increase the amount of metformin in the body.\n*   **Midazolam (Versed)**\n    *   The body breaks down midazolam to get rid of it. Berberine can decrease how quickly the body breaks it down. This might increase the effects and side effects of midazolam.\n*   **Pentobarbital (Nembutal)**\n    *   Pentobarbital is a medication that can cause sleepiness. Berberine might also cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Taking berberine with pentobarbital might cause too much sleepiness.\n*   **Sedative medications (CNS depressants)**\n    *   Berberine might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking berberine with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n*   **Tacrolimus (Prograf)**\n    *   Tacrolimus is removed from the body by the liver. Berberine might slow down the body's ability to remove tacrolimus. This might increase the effects and side effects of tacrolimus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   **Cannabidiol (CBD)**\n    *   Taking berberine and CBD together might cause heart rhythm problems at high doses. CBD might also slow down the body's ability to remove berberine. This might increase the effects and side effects of berberine.\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure**\n    *   Berberine might lower blood pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Berberine: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure**\n\n*   Berberine might lower blood pressure. Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much.\n*   Examples of supplements with this effect include:\n    *   Andrographis\n    *   Casein peptides\n    *   L-arginine\n    *   Niacin\n    *   Stinging nettle\n\n**Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar**\n\n*   Berberine might lower blood sugar.
