    "content": "**Fainting**\n\nFainting is a brief loss of consciousness due to a drop in blood flow to the brain. The episode most often lasts less than a couple of minutes and you usually recover from it quickly. The medical name for fainting is syncope.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nWhen you faint, you not only lose consciousness, you also lose muscle tone and the color in your face. Before fainting, you may feel weak, sweaty, or nauseated. You may have the sense that your vision is constricting (tunnel vision) or noises are fading into the background.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFainting may occur while or after you:\n\n* Cough very hard\n* Have a bowel movement, especially if you are straining\n* Have been standing in one place for too long\n* Urinate, especially at night or after lying down for a prolonged period\n\nFainting can also be related to:\n\n* Emotional distress\n* Fear\n* Severe pain\n\nOther causes of fainting, some of which may be more serious, include:\n\n* Certain medicines, including those used for anxiety, depression, and high blood pressure. These medicines may cause a drop in blood pressure.\n* Drug or alcohol use.\n* Heart disease, such as abnormal heart rhythm or heart attack and stroke.\n* Rapid and deep breathing (hyperventilation).\n* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n* Seizures.\n* Sudden drop in blood pressure, such as from bleeding or being severely dehydrated.\n* Standing up suddenly from a lying position.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf you have a history of fainting, follow your health care provider's instructions for how to prevent fainting. For example, if you know the situations that cause you to faint, avoid or change them.\n\nGet up from a lying or seated position slowly. If having blood drawn makes you faint, tell your provider before having a blood test. Make sure that you are lying down when the test is done.\n\n**Immediate Treatment Steps**\n\nYou can use these immediate treatment steps when someone has fainted:\n\n* Check the person's airway and breathing. If necessary, call 911 or the local emergency number and begin rescue breathing and CPR.\n* Loosen tight clothing around the neck.\n* Raise the person's feet above the level of their heart (about 12 inches or 30 centimeters).\n* If the person has vomited, turn them on their side to prevent choking.\n* Keep the person lying down for at least 10 to 15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet space. If this is not possible, sit the person forward with their head between their knees.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if the person who fainted:\n\n* Fell from a height, especially if injured or bleeding\n* Does not become alert quickly (within a couple of minutes)\n* Is pregnant\n* Is over age 50\n* Has diabetes (check for medical identification bracelets)\n* Feels chest pain, pressure, or discomfort\n* Has a pounding or irregular heartbeat\n* Has a loss of speech, vision problems, or is unable to move one or more limbs\n* Has convulsions, a tongue injury, or a loss of bladder or bowel control\n\n---\n\n**Fainting: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Causes**\n\nFainting may occur while or after you:\n\n* Cough very hard\n* Have a bowel movement, especially if you are straining\n* Have been standing in one place for too long\n* Urinate, especially at night or after lying down for a prolonged period\n\nFainting can also be related to:\n\n* Emotional distress\n* Fear\n* Severe pain\n\nOther causes of fainting, some of which may be more serious, include:\n\n* Certain medicines, including those used for anxiety, depression, and high blood pressure.

Call for an appointment to be seen as soon as possible.\n\n---\n\n**Fainting**\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will ask questions to determine whether you simply fainted, or if something else happened (such as a seizure or heart rhythm disturbance), and to figure out the cause of the fainting episode. If someone saw the fainting episode, their description of the event may be helpful.\n\nThe physical exam will focus on your heart, lungs, and nervous system. Your blood pressure may be checked while you are in different positions, such as lying down and standing. People with a suspected arrhythmia may need to be admitted to a hospital for testing.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n*   Blood tests for anemia or body chemical imbalances\n*   Cardiac rhythm monitoring\n*   Echocardiogram\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n*   Cardiac event monitor\n*   X-ray of the chest\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of fainting.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if the person who fainted:\n\n*   Fell from a height, especially if injured or bleeding\n*   Does not become alert quickly (within a couple of minutes)\n*   Is pregnant\n*   Is over age 50\n*   Has diabetes (check for medical identification bracelets)\n*   Feels chest pain, pressure, or discomfort\n*   Has a pounding or irregular heartbeat\n*   Has a loss of speech, vision problems, or is unable to move one or more limbs\n*   Has convulsions, a tongue injury, or a loss of bladder or bowel control\n\nEven if it is not an emergency situation, you should be seen by your provider if you have never fainted before, if you faint often, or if you have new symptoms with fainting.

    "content": "**Fall Risk Assessment**\n\nFalls are common in adults 65 years of age and older. In the United States, about a third of older adults who live at home and about half of people living in nursing homes fall at least once a year. There are many factors that increase the risk of falling in older adults.\n\n*   Mobility problems (e.g., trouble walking or standing up)\n*   Balance disorders\n*   Chronic (long-term) illnesses\n*   Impaired vision\n*   Taking certain medicines\n*   Foot problems and wearing unsafe shoes\n*   Mild cognitive impairment or certain types of dementia\n\nMany falls cause at least some injury. These range from mild bruising to broken bones, head injuries, and even death. In fact, falls are a leading cause of death in older adults.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA fall risk assessment is used to find out if you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. If the assessment shows you are at an increased risk, your health care provider and/or caregiver may recommend strategies to prevent falls and reduce the chance of injury.\n\n**Why do I need a fall risk assessment?**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Geriatrics Society recommend yearly fall assessment screening for all adults 65 years of age and older. If the screening shows you are at risk, you may need an assessment. The assessment includes performing a series of tasks called fall assessment tools.\n\nYou also may need an assessment if you have certain symptoms. Falls often come without warning, but if you have any of the following symptoms, you may be at higher risk:\n\n*   Dizziness\n*   Irregular or rapid heartbeats (arrhythmia)\n*   Blood pressure that drops too much when you stand up\n\n**What happens during a fall risk assessment?**\n\nA fall risk assessment checks to see how likely it is that you will fall. It is mostly done for older adults. The assessment usually includes:\n\nAn initial screening. This includes a series of questions about your overall health and if you've had previous falls or problems with balance, standing, and/or walking.\n\nA set of tasks known as fall assessment tools. These tools test your strength, balance, and gait (the way you walk).\n\nMany providers use an approach developed by the CDC called STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries). STEADI includes screening, assessing, and intervention. Interventions are recommendations that may reduce your risk of falling. STEADI includes three steps:\n\nScreening you for your risk of falling\n\nAssessing for your risk factors that can be improved to try to prevent falls (for example, balance problems, impaired vision)\n\nIntervening to reduce your risk of falling by using effective strategies (for example, providing education and resources)\n\nDuring the screening, you may be asked several questions including:\n\n*   Have you fallen in the past year?\n*   Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking?\n*   Are you worried about falling?\n\nDuring an assessment, your provider will test your strength, balance, and gait, using the following fall assessment tools:\n\n*   Timed Up-and-Go (Tug). This test checks your gait. You'll start in a chair, stand up, and then walk for about 10 feet at your regular pace. Then you'll sit down again. Your provider will check how long it takes you to do this. If it takes you 12 seconds or more, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall.\n*   30-Second Chair Stand Test. This test checks strength and balance. You'll sit in a chair with your arms crossed over your chest. When your provider says \"go,\" you'll stand up and sit down again. You'll repeat this for 30 seconds. Your provider will count how many times you can do this. A lower number may mean you are at higher risk for a fall. The specific number that indicates a risk depends on your age.\n*   4-Stage Balance Test. This test checks how well you can keep your balance. You'll stand in four different positions, holding each one for 10 seconds. The positions will get harder as you go.\n\nIf you can't hold position 2 or position 3 for 10 seconds or you can't stand on one leg for 5 seconds, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall.\n\nDuring the assessment, your provider may also:\n\n*   Identify any medicines you take that could increase your risk of falling\n*   Ask about possible safety hazards in your home, such as throw rugs you could trip on, a slippery tub floor, etc.\n*   Measure your blood pressure when lying and standing\n*   Do an eye test that checks your ability to see small details (the Snellen test)\n*   Check your feet and footwear\n*   Measure your vitamin D levels\n*   Identify other conditions you may have that could affect your risk of falls such as depression and osteoporosis\n*   Do a cognitive test to check for problems with cognition thinking, learning, remembering, being aware of surroundings, and using judgment\n\nThere are many other fall assessment tools. If your provider recommends other assessments, he or she will let you know what to expect.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for a fall risk assessment?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a fall risk assessment.\n\n**Are there any risks to a fall risk assessment?**\n\nThere is a small risk that you might fall while you are doing the assessment.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results may show you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. They also may show which areas may be increasing your risk for falls (e.g., gait, strength, and/or balance). Based on your results, your provider may make recommendations to reduce your risk of falling. They may include:\n\n*   Exercising to improve your strength and balance. You may be given instructions on specific exercises or be referred to a physical therapist.\n*   Changing or reducing the dose of medicines that may be affecting your gait or balance. Some medicines have side effects that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or confusion.\n*   Taking vitamin D to strengthen your bones.\n*   Getting your vision checked by an eye doctor.\n*   Switching to safer footwear to lower your risk of falling.\n*   Getting a referral to a podiatrist (foot doctor) if you are having problems with balance or gait.\n*   Getting rid of any safety hazards in your home. These may include poor lighting, loose rugs, and/or cords on the floor.\n*   Treating any medical conditions that could increase your risk of falls.\n\nIf you have questions about your results and/or recommendations, talk to your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Fall Risk Assessment**\n\nMany falls cause at least some injury.

    "content": "**Falls: A Serious Risk for Older Adults**\n\nFalls can be dangerous at any age, but they are especially serious for older adults. They are at higher risk of falling and more likely to fracture a bone when they do fall, especially if they have osteoporosis. A broken bone, particularly in the hip, may lead to disability and a loss of independence.\n\n**Common Causes of Falls**\n\nSome common causes of falls include:\n\n*   **Balance problems**: Difficulty with balance can increase the risk of falling.\n*   **Medicines**: Certain medications can make you feel dizzy, confused, or slow, increasing the risk of falls.\n*   **Vision problems**: Poor eyesight can make it difficult to navigate and increase the risk of falls.\n*   **Alcohol**: Consuming alcohol can affect balance and reflexes, making it more likely to fall.\n*   **Muscle weakness**: Weakness in the legs can make it harder to get up from a chair or maintain balance on uneven surfaces.\n*   **Certain illnesses**: Conditions like low blood pressure, diabetes, and neuropathy can increase the risk of falls.\n*   **Slow reflexes**: Slower reaction times can make it difficult to respond to hazards and increase the risk of falls.\n*   **Tripping or slipping**: Loss of footing or traction can lead to falls.\n\n**Preventing Falls**\n\nAt any age, people can take steps to lower their risk of falling. This includes:\n\n*   **Taking care of your health**: Regular eye exams can help identify vision problems early on.\n*   **Regular exercise**: Strengthening muscles, improving balance, and keeping bones strong can reduce the risk of falls.\n*   **House safety**: Removing tripping hazards, installing rails on stairs and in the bath, and making other modifications can help prevent falls.\n\n**Reducing the Risk of Broken Bones**\n\nIf you do fall, getting enough calcium and vitamin D can help reduce the chances of breaking a bone. By taking these steps, you can lower your risk of falling and related injuries.\n\n---\n\n**Falls: A Serious Threat to Older Adults**\n\nAs we age, our risk of falling increases, and the consequences can be devastating. According to the National Institute on Aging, falls are a leading cause of injury and death among older adults. In this article, we'll explore the causes of falls, how to prevent them, and what to do if you or a loved one experiences a fall.\n\n**Causes of Falls**\n\nFalls can happen at any age, but they're more common among older adults. Some common causes of falls include:\n\n*   **Tripping hazards**: Remove clutter, secure rugs, and install handrails on stairs.\n*   **Balance problems**: Regular exercise, such as tai chi or walking, can improve balance and reduce the risk of falling.\n*   **Vision problems**: Get regular eye exams to detect and correct vision issues that may contribute to falls.\n\n**Preventing Falls**\n\nTo reduce your risk of falling, focus on these key areas:\n\n1.  **Exercise regularly**: Strengthen your muscles, improve your balance, and keep your bones strong with activities like walking, tai chi, or weightlifting.\n2.  **Improve your home safety**: Remove tripping hazards, install handrails, and ensure good lighting in hallways and stairways.\n3.  **Get regular eye exams**: Detect and correct vision problems that may contribute to falls.\n\n**What to Do If You Fall**\n\nIf you experience a fall, seek medical attention immediately if you:\n\n*   Have severe pain or difficulty moving\n*   Notice any signs of injury, such as swelling, bruising, or bleeding\n*   Experience dizziness or confusion\n\nEven if you don't require immediate medical attention, it's essential to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss ways to prevent future falls.\n\nBy understanding the causes of falls and taking proactive steps to prevent them, we can reduce the risk of injury and promote healthy aging.",

    "content": "**Famciclovir**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFamciclovir is used to treat herpes zoster (shingles; a rash that can occur in people who have had chickenpox in the past). It is also used to treat repeat outbreaks of herpes virus cold sores or fever blisters in people with a normal immune system. Famciclovir is used to treat repeat outbreaks and to prevent further outbreaks of genital herpes (a herpes virus infection that causes sores to form around the genitals and rectum from time to time) in people with a normal immune system. Famciclovir is also used to treat returning herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucus membranes (mouth, anus) in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFamciclovir comes as a tablet to take by mouth with or without food. When famciclovir is used to treat shingles, it is usually taken every 8 hours (three times a day) for 7 days, starting within 3 days after the rash begins to appear. When famciclovir is used to treat cold sores and fever blisters, it is usually taken as one dose at the earliest sign or symptom (tingling, itching, or burning) of a cold sore. When famciclovir is used to treat repeat outbreaks of genital herpes, it is usually taken twice a day for one day, starting within 6 hours of the first sign or symptom of the condition. To keep genital herpes from returning, famciclovir is usually taken twice a day for up to 1 year. When famciclovir is used to treat herpes infection in people infected with HIV, it is usually taken twice a day for 7 days.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nContinue to take famciclovir even if you feel well.

    "content": "**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder characterized by cancer of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. People with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their teenage years. Unless the colon is removed, these polyps will become malignant (cancerous). The average age at which an individual develops colon cancer in classic familial adenomatous polyposis is 39 years. Some people have a variant of the disorder, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, in which polyp growth is delayed. The average age of colorectal cancer onset for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis is 55 years.\n\nIn people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon. Also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid tumors. These fibrous tumors usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. Desmoid tumors tend to recur after they are surgically removed. In both classic familial adenomatous polyposis and its attenuated variant, benign and malignant tumors are sometimes found in other places in the body, including the duodenum (a section of the small intestine), stomach, bones, skin, and other tissues. People who have colon polyps as well as growths outside the colon are sometimes described as having Gardner syndrome.\n\nA milder type of familial adenomatous polyposis, called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis, has also been identified. People with the autosomal recessive type of this disorder have fewer polyps than those with the classic type. Fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or thousands. The autosomal recessive type of this disorder is caused by mutations in a different gene than the classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Classic familial adenomatous polyposis: affects approximately 1 in 100,000 people\n* Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis: affects approximately 1 in 500,000 people\n\n**Causes**\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis is caused by mutations in the APC gene.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Familial polyposis\n* Gardner syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* American Cancer Society (ACS)\n\nNote: The cleaned output is a rewritten version of the original text, with minor changes to improve clarity and readability.

People with the classic type of FAP may begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their teenage years.\n\n**Types of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**\n\nThere are three types of familial adenomatous polyposis:\n\n*   **Classic Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**: This is the most common type, characterized by hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon.\n*   **Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**: This type is characterized by a delayed onset of polyp growth, with an average age of colorectal cancer onset of 55 years.\n*   **Autosomal Recessive Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**: This is a milder type, caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene. People with this type have fewer than 100 polyps.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nMutations in the APC gene cause both classic and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. These mutations affect the ability of the cell to maintain normal growth and function. Cell overgrowth resulting from mutations in the APC gene leads to the colon polyps seen in FAP.\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis can have different inheritance patterns:\n\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Pattern**: When FAP results from mutations in the APC gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n*   **Autosomal Recessive Pattern**: When FAP results from mutations in the MUTYH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe reported incidence of familial adenomatous polyposis varies from 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 22,000 individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**\n\nWhen familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the MUTYH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis can have different inheritance patterns.\n\nWhen familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the APC gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n\nWhen familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the MUTYH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Adenomatous familial polyposis\n* Adenomatous familial polyposis syndrome\n* Adenomatous polyposis coli\n* Familial multiple polyposis syndrome\n* FAP\n* MYH-associated polyposis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information:\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Desmoid disease, hereditary\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Familial adenomatous polyposis 1\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Familial multiple polyposis syndrome\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Familial adenomatous polyposis 2\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\t+ Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis\n\t+ Familial adenomatous polyposis\n\t+ Gardner syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY; DESMD\n\t+ FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1; FAP1\n\t+ FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 2; FAP2\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Desmoid disease, hereditary\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Familial adenomatous polyposis 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Familial multiple polyposis syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Familial adenomatous polyposis 2\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Gardner syndrome\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY; DESMD\n* FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1; FAP1\n* FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 2; FAP2\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Attard TM, Cuffari C, Tajouri T, Stoner JA, Eisenberg MT, Yardley JH, Abraham SC, Perry D, Vanderhoof J, Lynch H.

We will discuss the latest research on the genetics of FAP and its relationship to other intestinal polyposis syndromes.\n\n**Genetic Basis of FAP**\n\nFAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene, which is located on chromosome 5. The APC gene plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and division, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of colorectal polyps. In FAP, the APC gene is mutated, resulting in the formation of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum.\n\n**Relationship to Other Intestinal Polyposis Syndromes**\n\nRecent studies have shown that FAP is related to other intestinal polyposis syndromes, including attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) and MYH-associated polyposis (MAP). AFAP is characterized by a milder form of the disease, with fewer polyps and a later age of onset. MAP, on the other hand, is caused by mutations in the MYH gene, which is involved in base excision repair.\n\n**Prognosis and Treatment**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with FAP is generally poor, as the development of colorectal cancer is almost inevitable if left untreated. However, with early detection and treatment, it is possible to prevent cancer from developing. Treatment typically involves the removal of all or most of the colon and rectum, followed by a permanent ileostomy.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify individuals who are at risk of developing FAP. Testing for mutations in the APC gene can detect carriers of the disease, allowing for early intervention and prevention of cancer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis is a rare inherited disorder that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. The genetic basis of FAP involves mutations in the APC gene, which regulates cell growth and division. Recent studies have shown a relationship between FAP and other intestinal polyposis syndromes, including AFAP and MAP. Early detection and treatment can prevent cancer from developing, making genetic testing an important tool for identifying at-risk individuals.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Cancer--Living with Cancer\n* Colonic Polyps\n* Colorectal Cancer\n* Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nFamilial atrial fibrillation is an inherited abnormality of the heart's normal rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by episodes of uncoordinated electrical activity (fibrillation) in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), which cause a fast and irregular heartbeat.\n\n**Description**\n\nAtrial fibrillation can lead to dizziness, chest pain, a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, or fainting (syncope). Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of stroke and sudden death. Complications of atrial fibrillation can occur at any age, although some people with this heart condition never experience any health problems associated with the disorder.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common type of recurrent arrhythmia, affecting more than 3 million people in the United States. The risk of developing this irregular heart rhythm increases with age. The incidence of the familial form of atrial fibrillation is unknown; however, recent studies suggest that up to 30 percent of all people who have atrial fibrillation without an identified cause have a history of the condition in their family.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChanges in some genes can cause atrial fibrillation on their own, while changes in other genes affect a person's risk of developing this condition in combination with a variety of environmental and lifestyle factors. Familial atrial fibrillation often results from rare mutations in single genes. However, these cases represent only a small fraction of all individuals with atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe first single gene found to be associated with familial atrial fibrillation was KCNQ1, which provides instructions for making a channel that is embedded in the outer membrane of heart (cardiac) muscle cells. This channel transports positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium out of cells. In cardiac muscle, this ion transport plays a critical role in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm.\n\nSince that discovery, rare genetic variants in other ion channel genes have been found to cause familial atrial fibrillation. Mutations in ion channel genes lead to the production of altered channels, which may either increase or decrease the flow of ions across the outer cell membrane and alter the way the heart beats.\n\nMutations in other types of genes have also been found to cause familial atrial fibrillation. Some of these genes provide instructions for making cardiac transcription factors, which regulate the activity of certain genes involved in the formation and development of the heart before birth. Other genes provide instructions for making parts of structural elements of cardiac muscle, such as sarcomeres.\n\nThese structures are necessary for cardiac muscle to contract and produce the heart's pumping action. Mutations in these non-ion channel genes have a variety of effects on the structure and function of cardiac muscle, all of which can lead to an abnormal heartbeat.\n\nMost cases of atrial fibrillation are not caused by inherited mutations in single genes. However, relatively common variations (polymorphisms) in more than two dozen genes appear to influence the likelihood of developing the condition. Each of these polymorphisms on its own has a small effect on a person's overall risk, but an individual may have multiple polymorphisms that together have a significant effect.\n\nIn addition to these common genetic variations, risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, a previous stroke, or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n---\n\n**Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nResearchers are working to determine how a combination of genetic changes, environmental influences, and lifestyle factors contribute to a person's risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Genes Associated with Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n\n*   **ABCC9**\n*   **KCNH2**\n*   **KCNJ2**\n*   **KCNQ1**\n*   **LMNA**\n*   **PRKAG2**\n*   **RYR2**\n*   **SCN5A**\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\n*   **GJA5**\n*   **KCNA5**\n*   **KCNE2**\n*   **MYL4**\n*   **NKX2-5**\n*   **NPPA**\n*   **NUP155**\n*   **SCN1B**\n*   **SCN2B**\n*   **SCN3B**\n*   **SCN4B**\n\n**How Genetic Changes Contribute to Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nChanges in some genes can cause atrial fibrillation on their own, while changes in other genes affect a person's risk of developing this condition in combination with a variety of environmental and lifestyle factors.

It is often caused by genetic mutations that affect the heart's electrical system.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe causes of familial atrial fibrillation are not yet fully understood, but research suggests that it may be related to a combination of genetic changes, environmental influences, and lifestyle factors. Some risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, a previous stroke, or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nResearch has identified several genes that are associated with familial atrial fibrillation. These include:\n\n*   **ABCC9**\n*   **KCNH2**\n*   **KCNJ2**\n*   **KCNQ1**\n*   **LMNA**\n*   **PRKAG2**\n*   **RYR2**\n*   **SCN5A**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nWhen familial atrial fibrillation is caused by mutations in a single gene (such as KCNQ1), it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAtrial fibrillation, familial is also known as Auricular fibrillation.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic testing information is available through the Genetic Testing Registry, which includes:\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 1**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 10**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 11**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 12**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 13**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 14**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 15**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 16**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 17**\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 18**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\nThe National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) provides support and advocacy resources for individuals with rare disorders, including familial atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinical trials are available through ClinicalTrials.gov to investigate the causes and treatments of familial atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\nThe Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM includes information on familial atrial fibrillation, including:\n\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 1; ATFB1**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 3; ATFB3**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 4; ATFB4**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 5; ATFB5**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 2; ATFB2**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 6; ATFB6**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 7; ATFB7**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 13; ATFB13**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 14; ATFB14**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 10; ATFB10**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 18; ATFB18**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 8; ATFB8**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11; ATFB11**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 12; ATFB12**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 9; ATFB9**\n*   **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 15; ATFB15**\n\n---\n\n**Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 1\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 10\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 11\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 12\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 13\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 14\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 15\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 16\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 17\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 18\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 3\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 4\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 6\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 7\n    *   Genetic Testing Registry: Atrial fibrillation, familial, 9\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   Familial atrial fibrillation\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 1; ATFB1\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 3; ATFB3\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 4; ATFB4\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 5; ATFB5\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 2; ATFB2\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 6; ATFB6\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 7; ATFB7\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 13; ATFB13\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 14; ATFB14\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 10; ATFB10\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 18; ATFB18\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 8; ATFB8\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11; ATFB11\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 12; ATFB12\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 9; ATFB9\n*   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 15; ATFB15\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Chen YH, Xu SJ, Bendahhou S, Wang XL, Wang Y, Xu WY, Jin HW, Sun H, Su XY, Zhuang QN, Yang YQ, Li YB, Liu Y, Xu HJ, Li XF, Ma N, Mou CP, Chen Z, Barhanin J, Huang W.

    "content": "**Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome Type 2**\n\nFamilial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is a very rare condition that causes episodes of fever, skin rash, and joint pain. These episodes can be triggered by exposure to cold temperatures or may arise without warning, lasting a few hours to several days. They typically begin in childhood and persist throughout life.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nFamilial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is a very rare condition. More than 60 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe condition is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the NLRP12 gene. The NLRP12 gene provides instructions for making the protein monarch-1, which belongs to a family of proteins called intracellular \"NOD-like\" receptor (NLR) proteins. These proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation.\n\nIn familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2, most variants in the NLRP12 gene appear to reduce the ability of the monarch-1 protein to stop inflammation, resulting in an unusually long inflammatory response. Research shows that other variants increase the protein's ability to trigger inflammatory responses, even when there is no injury or disease.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nFamilial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is also known as FCAS2.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2, contact the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) or the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD).\n\n---\n\n**Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome Type 2**\n\n**Causes**\n\nFamilial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the NLRP12 gene. The NLRP12 gene provides instructions for making the protein monarch-1.\n\n**Inflammation and Immune Response**\n\nInflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, the body stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.\n\n**Monarch-1 Protein**\n\nThe monarch-1 protein is primarily involved in stopping the inflammatory response, but it can trigger inflammation in certain situations.\n\n**Impact of NLRP12 Gene Variants**\n\nMost variants in the NLRP12 gene appear to reduce the ability of the monarch-1 protein to stop inflammation, resulting in an unusually long inflammatory response. Research shows that other variants increase the protein's ability to trigger inflammatory responses, even when there is no injury or disease.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nIn most cases, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most affected individuals have one parent with the condition.\n\n**Reduced Penetrance and Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**\n\nIn some families, individuals with an NLRP12 gene variant may develop familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 but others with the variant do not, which is a situation known as reduced penetrance. In rare cases, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have variants.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nFamilial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 (FCAS2)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 2\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Familial cold urticaria\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 2; FCAS2\n\n---\n\n**Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome Type 2**\n\n**What is Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome Type 2?**\n\nFamilial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 2 (FCAS2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, inflammation, and skin rash in response to cold temperatures. It is caused by mutations in the NLRP12 gene.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Recurrent episodes of fever\n* Inflammation of various organs, including the skin, joints, and gastrointestinal tract\n* Skin rash in response to cold temperatures\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Mutations in the NLRP12 gene\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* There is no specific treatment for FCAS2, but symptoms can be managed with medications such as corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n**Prognosis**\n\n* The prognosis for individuals with FCAS2 varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\n* FCAS2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n* Genetic testing can be used to diagnose FCAS2 and identify carriers of the mutated gene.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ayla AY, Eren H, Zare J, Calhan SS, Karacan I, Seven M, Ugurlu S.

Diabetes, alcohol use, and hypothyroidism worsen the condition. Risk factors include a family history of high cholesterol and early coronary artery disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn the early years, there may be no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may be due to impaired blood flow to parts of the body and include:\n\n* Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease at a young age\n* Cramping of one or both calves when walking\n* Sores on the toes that do not heal\n* Sudden stroke-like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance\n\nPeople with this condition may develop high cholesterol or triglyceride levels as teenagers. The condition may also be diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBlood tests will show:\n\n* Increased LDL cholesterol\n* Decreased HDL cholesterol\n* Increased triglycerides\n* Increased apolipoprotein B100\n\nGenetic testing is available for one type of familial combined hyperlipidemia.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nChange your diet by lowering saturated fat and refined sugar. Consider the following changes:\n\n* Eat less beef, chicken, pork, and lamb\n* Substitute low-fat dairy products for full-fat ones\n* Avoid packaged cookies and baked goods with trans fats\n* Limit egg yolks and organ meats\n\nWeight loss and regular exercise may also help lower your cholesterol level.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nIf lifestyle changes are not enough or you're at high risk, your provider may recommend medicines to lower blood cholesterol levels. Statins, such as lovastatin (Mevacor) and simvastatin (Zocor), are commonly used and effective in treating high LDL cholesterol. Other options include bile acid-sequestering resins, ezetimibe, fibrates, nicotinic acid, and PCSK9 inhibitors.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nHow well you do depends on:\n\n* Early diagnosis\n* Starting treatment\n* Following your treatment plan\n\nWithout treatment, heart attack or stroke may cause early death.

The condition may also be diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The levels remain high all during life. Those with familial combined hyperlipidemia have an increased risk of early coronary artery disease and heart attacks. They also have higher rates of obesity and are more likely to have glucose intolerance.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nBlood tests will be done to check your levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Tests will show:\n\n* Increased LDL cholesterol\n* Decreased HDL cholesterol\n* Increased triglycerides\n* Increased apolipoprotein B100\n\nGenetic testing is available for one type of familial combined hyperlipidemia.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. Lifestyle changes can help lower your cholesterol level:\n\n* Eat a low-fat diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n* Choose lean protein sources like poultry, fish, and beans instead of pork, lamb, and organ meats.\n* Substitute low-fat dairy products for full-fat ones.\n* Avoid packaged cookies and baked goods that contain trans fats.\n* Reduce the cholesterol you eat by limiting egg yolks.\n\nIt may help to talk to a dietitian who can give you advice about changing your eating habits. Weight loss and regular exercise may also help lower your cholesterol level.\n\nIf lifestyle changes do not change your cholesterol levels enough, or you are at very high risk for atherosclerotic heart disease, your provider may recommend that you take medicines. There are several types of medicines to help lower blood cholesterol levels. The most commonly used, and most effective medicines for treating high LDL cholesterol are called statins.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do depends on:\n\n* How early the condition is diagnosed\n* When you start treatment\n* How well you follow your treatment plan\n\nWithout treatment, heart attack or stroke may cause early death. Even with medicine, some people may continue to have high lipid levels that increase their risk for heart attack.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Early atherosclerotic heart disease\n* Heart attack\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia**\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing is available for one type of familial combined hyperlipidemia.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nThe first step is to change what you eat. Most of the time, you will try diet changes for several months before your health care provider recommends medicines. Diet changes include lowering the amount of saturated fat and refined sugar.\n\nHere are some changes you can make:\n\n* Eat less beef, chicken, pork, and lamb\n* Substitute low-fat dairy products for full-fat ones\n* Avoid packaged cookies and baked goods that contain trans fats\n* Reduce the cholesterol you eat by limiting egg yolks and organ meats\n\nIt may help to talk to a dietitian who can give you advice about changing your eating habits. Weight loss and regular exercise may also help lower your cholesterol level.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nIf lifestyle changes do not change your cholesterol levels enough, or you are at very high risk for atherosclerotic heart disease, your provider may recommend that you take medicines. There are several types of medicines to help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n\nThe medicines work in different ways to help you achieve healthy lipid levels. Some are better at lowering LDL cholesterol, some are good at lowering triglycerides, while others help raise HDL cholesterol.\n\nThe most commonly used, and most effective medicines for treating high LDL cholesterol are called statins. They include lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and pitivastatin (Livalo).\n\nOther cholesterol-lowering medicines include:\n\n* Bile acid-sequestering resins\n* Ezetimibe\n* Fibrates (such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate)\n* Nicotinic acid\n* PCSK9 inhibitors, such as alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha)\n\n**Outlook**\n\nHow well you do depends on:\n\n* How early the condition is diagnosed\n* When you start treatment\n* How well you follow your treatment plan\n\nWithout treatment, heart attack or stroke may cause early death.\n\nEven with medicine, some people may continue to have high lipid levels that increase their risk for heart attack.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Early atherosclerotic heart disease\n* Heart attack\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia**\n\nIf someone in your family has this condition, you may want to consider genetic screening for yourself or your children. Sometimes, younger children may have mild hyperlipidemia.\n\n*   Control other risk factors for early heart attacks, such as smoking.\n*   A diet that is low in cholesterol and saturated fat may help to control LDL levels in people at high risk.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMultiple lipoprotein-type hyperlipidemia\n\n**Images**\n\nCoronary artery blockage\nHealthy diet\n\n**References**\n\nGenest J, Mora S, Libby P.

    "title": "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/familial-glucocorticoid-deficiency/",
    "content": "**Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nFamilial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar (glucose) levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.\n\nA shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop low blood glucose (hypoglycemia). These hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation).\n\nThere are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of familial glucocorticoid deficiency is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the MC2R, MRAP, and NNT genes account for the majority of cases of familial glucocorticoid deficiency; mutations in other genes, some known and some unidentified, can also cause this condition. The MC2R gene provides instructions for making a protein called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor, which is found primarily in the adrenal glands. The protein produced from the MRAP gene transports the ACTH receptor from the interior of the cell to the cell membrane. When the ACTH receptor is embedded within the cell membrane, it is turned on (activated) by the MRAP protein.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency**\n\n**Understanding the Condition**\n\nFamilial glucocorticoid deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to produce sufficient glucocorticoids, leading to various symptoms and complications. The condition is caused by mutations in specific genes that regulate the production of glucocorticoids.\n\n**The Role of Genes in Glucocorticoid Production**\n\nThree main genes are associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency:\n\n*   **MC2R**: Provides instructions for making a protein called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor, which is found primarily in the adrenal glands.\n*   **MRAP**: Transports the ACTH receptor from the interior of the cell to the cell membrane. When the ACTH receptor is embedded within the cell membrane, it is turned on (activated) by the MRAP protein.\n*   **NNT**: Provides instructions for making an enzyme called nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, which helps produce a substance called NADPH involved in removing potentially toxic molecules.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   ACTH resistance\n*   Adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH\n*   Glucocorticoid deficiency\n*   Hereditary unresponsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone\n*   Isolated glucocorticoid deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify the underlying cause of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. The Genetic Testing Registry provides information on various genetic tests related to this condition.\n\nBy understanding the genetic basis of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, individuals and families affected by this condition can better navigate their treatment options and make informed decisions about their care.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency**\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Primary immunodeficiency with natural-killer cell deficiency and adrenal insufficiency\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Glucocorticoid deficiency 2\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   Familial glucocorticoid deficiency\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 1; GCCD1\n*   GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2; GCCD2\n*   GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 3; GCCD3\n*   IMMUNODEFICIENCY 54; IMD54\n*   GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 4 WITH OR WITHOUT MINERALOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY; GCCD4\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Glucocorticoid deficiency 1\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Glucocorticoid deficiency 4\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Primary immunodeficiency with natural-killer cell deficiency and adrenal insufficiency\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Glucocorticoid deficiency 2\n\n**References**\n\n*   Chung TT, Chan LF, Metherell LA, Clark AJ.

    "content": "**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n**What is Familial Hypercholesterolemia?**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). The body needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce compounds that aid in fat digestion. In people with familial hypercholesterolemia, the body is unable to get rid of extra cholesterol, and it builds up in the blood. Too much cholesterol increases a person's risk of developing heart disease.\n\n**Causes of Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nPeople with familial hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease at a young age. This condition occurs when excess cholesterol in the bloodstream is deposited on the inner walls of blood vessels, particularly the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). The abnormal buildup of cholesterol forms clumps (plaques) that narrow and harden artery walls. As the plaques get bigger, they can clog the arteries and restrict the flow of blood to the heart. The buildup of plaques in coronary arteries causes a form of chest pain called angina and greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.\n\n**Symptoms of Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia can also cause health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in tissues other than the heart and blood vessels. If cholesterol accumulates in the tissues that attach muscles to bones (tendons), it causes characteristic growths called tendon xanthomas. These growths most often affect the Achilles tendons, which attach the calf muscles to the heels, and tendons in the hands and fingers. Yellowish cholesterol deposits can develop under the skin of the eyelids and are known as xanthelasmata. Cholesterol can also accumulate at the edges of the clear, front surface of the eye (the cornea), leading to a gray-colored ring called an arcus cornealis.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition, meaning it is passed down from parents to their children through genes. The inheritance pattern of familial hypercholesterolemia is autosomal dominant, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to express the condition.\n\n**Other Names for Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n* Hereditary hyperlipidemia\n* High cholesterol disease\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on familial hypercholesterolemia, please refer to the following references:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* American Heart Association (AHA)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n**What is Familial Hypercholesterolemia?**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood.

The body needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce compounds that aid in fat digestion.\n\n**Causes of Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nMutations in the APOB, LDLR, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia. Changes in the LDLR gene are the most common cause of this condition. The LDLR gene provides instructions for making a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor. This type of receptor binds to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood.\n\n**Symptoms and Health Problems**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia can also cause health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in tissues other than the heart and blood vessels. If cholesterol accumulates in the tissues that attach muscles to bones (tendons), it causes characteristic growths called tendon xanthomas. These growths most often affect the Achilles tendons, which attach the calf muscles to the heels, and tendons in the hands and fingers.\n\n**Frequency of Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia affects an estimated 1 in 200 to 1 in 250 people in most countries and is thought to be the most common inherited condition affecting the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease). The condition occurs even more frequently in certain populations, including Afrikaners in South Africa, Lebanese, and Tunisians.\n\n**Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors**\n\nBoth genetic and environmental risk factors play roles in familial hypercholesterolemia. Lifestyle choices including diet, exercise, and tobacco smoking strongly influence the amount of cholesterol in the blood and the risk of coronary artery disease. Additional factors that impact the outcome of the condition include a person's sex, age, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a serious genetic disorder that can lead to premature heart disease if left untreated. Understanding the causes and symptoms of this condition is crucial for early detection and treatment. By identifying the genetic mutations responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia, researchers can develop targeted therapies to reduce cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular complications.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n**What is Familial Hypercholesterolemia?**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder characterized by very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. This condition increases the risk of premature coronary artery disease.\n\n**Causes of Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nMutations in the APOB, LDLR, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia. Changes in the LDLR gene are the most common cause of this condition.\n\n*   **LDLR Gene**: The LDLR gene provides instructions for making a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor. This type of receptor binds to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood.\n*   **APOB, LDLRAP1, and PCSK9 Genes**: Less commonly, familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutations in the APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene. Proteins produced from these genes are essential for the normal function of low-density lipoprotein receptors.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia resulting from mutations in the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 gene have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**: An affected person typically inherits one altered copy of the gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent.\n*   **Rare Cases**: Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia has a mutation in both copies of the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 gene. This situation occurs when both parents have familial hypercholesterolemia, and each passes on one altered copy of the gene.\n\n**Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Environmental Risk Factors**\n\nBoth genetic and environmental risk factors play roles in familial hypercholesterolemia. Lifestyle choices including diet, exercise, and tobacco smoking strongly influence the amount of cholesterol in the blood and the risk of coronary artery disease.\n\n*   **Lifestyle Choices**: Additional factors that impact the outcome of the condition include a person's sex, age, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia accounts for only a small percentage of all cases of high cholesterol. Researchers are working to identify and characterize additional genes that may influence cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease in people with other forms of hypercholesterolemia.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\n*   Mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene result in an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\n*   The condition is caused by two altered copies of the gene in each cell, and parents typically have normal blood cholesterol levels.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Familial hypercholesterolemia\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Hypercholesterolemia, autosomal dominant, 3\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Hypercholesterolemia, autosomal dominant, type B\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Hypercholesterolemia, familial, 4\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL, 1; FHCL1\n*   HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2; FHCL2\n*   HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4; FHCL4\n*   HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL, 3; FHCL3\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Austin MA, Hutter CM, Zimmern RL, Humphries SE.

It is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene or the apolipoprotein B gene, leading to impaired clearance of LDL from the bloodstream.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Pathogenesis and Genetic Determinants**\n\nThe pathogenesis of FH involves a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Research has identified several genetic determinants that contribute to the development of FH, including mutations in the LDL receptor gene and the apolipoprotein B gene. A comprehensive literature review has highlighted the importance of understanding these genetic determinants in order to develop effective strategies for preventing and managing FH.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Autosomal Recessive Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nAutosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is a rare form of FH that is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene. It is characterized by extremely high levels of LDL cholesterol and often presents with xanthomas, a type of skin lesion.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clinical, Diagnostic, and Therapeutic Aspects**\n\nFH is a treatable condition, but early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent cardiovascular complications. Clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of FH have been extensively studied, and researchers have identified several key factors that influence the prognosis and management of the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a common form of FH that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals. It is caused by mutations in one copy of the LDL receptor gene, leading to high levels of LDL cholesterol and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis and Management**\n\nThe prognosis of FH depends on several factors, including the severity of the disorder, the presence of comorbidities, and the effectiveness of treatment. Management strategies for FH typically involve a combination of lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and pharmacological interventions to lower LDL cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Cholesterol\n* Genetic Disorders\n* High Cholesterol in Children and Teens\n* Lipid Metabolism Disorders",

    "content": "**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a disorder that is passed down through families, causing LDL (bad) cholesterol levels to be very high. The condition begins at birth and can cause heart attacks at an early age.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a gene variant on chromosome 19. This defect makes the body unable to remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol from the blood, resulting in high levels of LDL and increasing the risk of heart disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn the early years, there may be no symptoms. However, symptoms that may occur include:\n\n* Fatty skin deposits called xanthomas over parts of the hands, elbows, knees, ankles, and around the cornea of the eye\n* Cholesterol deposits in the eyelids (xanthelasmas)\n* Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age\n* Cramping of one or both calves when walking\n* Sores on the toes that do not heal\n* Sudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show fatty skin growths called xanthomas and cholesterol deposits in the eye (corneal arcus). The healthcare provider will ask questions about your personal and family medical history. There may be:\n\n* A strong family history of familial hypercholesterolemia or early heart attacks\n* High levels of LDL cholesterol in either or both parents\n\nPeople from families with a strong history of early heart attacks should have blood tests done to determine lipid levels.\n\nBlood tests may show:\n\n* High levels of total cholesterol\n* High LDL levels\n* Normal triglyceride levels\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n* Studies of cells called fibroblasts to see how the body absorbs LDL cholesterol\n* Genetic test for the variant associated with this condition\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. People who get only one copy of the defective gene from their parents may do well with diet changes and statin drugs.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nThe first step is to change what you eat. Most of the time, the provider will recommend that you try this for several months before prescribing medicines. Diet changes include lowering the amount of fat you eat so that it is less than 30% of your total calories. If you are overweight, losing weight is very helpful.\n\nHere are some ways to cut saturated fat out of your diet:\n\n* Eat less beef, chicken, pork, and lamb\n* Replace full-fat dairy products with low-fat products\n* Eliminate trans fats\n\nYou can lower the amount of cholesterol you eat by eliminating egg yolks and organ meats such as liver. It may help to talk to a dietitian who can give you advice about changing your eating habits. Weight loss and regular exercise may also help lower your cholesterol level.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nIf lifestyle changes do not change your cholesterol level, your provider may recommend that you take medicines. There are several types of drugs available to help lower blood cholesterol levels, and they work in different ways. Some are better at lowering LDL cholesterol, some are good at lowering triglycerides, while others help raise HDL cholesterol. Many people will be on several medicines.\n\nStatin medicines are commonly used and are very effective. These medicines help lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThey include:\n\n* Lovastatin (Mevacor)\n* Pravastatin (Pravachol)\n* Simvastatin (Zocor)\n* Fluvastatin (Lescol)\n* Atorvastatin (Lipitor)\n* Pitivastatin (Livalo)\n* Rosuvastatin (Crestor)\n\nOther cholesterol-lowering medicines include:\n\n* Bile acid-sequestering resins\n* Ezetimibe\n* Fibrates (such as gemfibrozil or fenofibrate)\n* Nicotinic acid\n* PCSK9 inhibitors, such as alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha)\n\nPeople with a severe form of the disorder may need a treatment called apheresis. Blood or plasma is removed from the body. Special filters remove the extra LDL cholesterol, and the blood plasma is then returned to the body.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do depends on how closely you follow your provider's treatment advice and how well you respond to the recommended treatment. Making diet changes, exercising, and taking your medicines correctly can lower cholesterol levels. These changes can help delay a heart attack, especially for people with a milder form of the disorder.\n\nMen and women with familial hypercholesterolemia typically are at increased risk of early heart attacks. The risk of death varies among people with familial hypercholesterolemia. If you inherit two copies of the variant gene, you have a poorer outcome. That type of familial hypercholesterolemia does not respond well to treatment and may cause an early heart attack.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Heart attack at an early age\n* Heart disease\n* Stroke\n* Peripheral vascular disease\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek medical care right away if you have chest pain or other warning signs of a heart attack. Contact your provider if you have a personal or family history of high cholesterol levels.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nA diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat and rich in unsaturated fat may help control LDL levels. People with a family history of this condition, particularly if both parents carry the variant gene, may want to seek genetic counseling.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a gene variant on chromosome 19. The defect makes the body unable to remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol from the blood, resulting in a high level of LDL in the blood. This increases the likelihood of narrowing the arteries due to atherosclerosis at an early age.\n\nThe condition is typically passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning you only need to inherit the abnormal gene from one parent to develop the disease.\n\nIn rare cases, a child may inherit the gene from both parents, leading to a more severe increase in cholesterol levels. This can result in a high risk of heart attacks and heart disease, even in childhood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly symptoms may be absent, but they can include:\n\n*   Fatty skin deposits called xanthomas over parts of the hands, elbows, knees, ankles, and around the cornea of the eye\n*   Cholesterol deposits in the eyelids (xanthelasmas)\n*   Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age\n*   Cramping of one or both calves when walking\n*   Sores on the toes that do not heal\n*   Sudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show fatty skin growths called xanthomas and cholesterol deposits in the eye (corneal arcus).\n\nThe healthcare provider will ask questions about your personal and family medical history.

    "content": "**Familial Hypertriglyceridemia**\n\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is a common disorder passed down through families. It causes a higher-than-normal level of triglycerides (a type of fat) in a person's blood.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is most likely caused by genetic variants combined with environmental factors. As a result, the condition clusters in families. How severe the disorder is can vary based on sex, age, hormone use, and dietary factors.\n\nPeople with this condition also have high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are often low.\n\nIn most cases, familial hypertriglyceridemia is not noticeable until puberty or early adulthood. Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often present as well. These factors may cause even higher triglyceride levels. Alcohol, a diet high in carbohydrates, and estrogen use can make the condition worse.\n\nYou are more likely to have this condition if you have a family history of hypertriglyceridemia or heart disease before age 50.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not notice any symptoms. Some people with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your family history and symptoms.\n\nIf you have a family history of this condition, you should have blood tests to check very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride levels. Blood tests most often show a mild to moderate increase in triglycerides (about 200 to 500 mg/dL).\n\nA coronary risk profile may also be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control conditions that can raise triglyceride levels. These include obesity, hypothyroidism, and diabetes.\n\nYour provider may tell you not to drink alcohol. Certain birth control pills can raise triglyceride levels. Talk to your provider about your risk when deciding whether to take these medicines.\n\nTreatment also involves avoiding excess calories and foods high in saturated fats and carbohydrates.\n\nYou may need to take medicine if your triglyceride levels stay high, even after making diet changes. Nicotinic acid, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate will lower triglyceride levels in people with this condition.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nLosing weight and keeping diabetes under control helps improve the outcome.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Pancreatitis\n* Coronary artery disease\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypertriglyceridemia**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is a condition where the body produces high levels of triglycerides in the blood. It's often inherited and can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of familial hypertriglyceridemia is not fully understood, but it's believed to be caused by genetic variants combined with environmental factors. This means that people with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not notice any symptoms at first, but some people with the condition may experience coronary artery disease at an early age.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf you have a family history of this condition, your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your family history and symptoms. Blood tests will be done to check very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride levels. A coronary risk profile may also be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control conditions that can raise triglyceride levels, such as obesity, hypothyroidism, and diabetes. Your provider may recommend avoiding excess calories and foods high in saturated fats and carbohydrates. In some cases, medication may be necessary to lower triglyceride levels.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nLosing weight and keeping diabetes under control can help improve the outcome of familial hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include pancreatitis and coronary artery disease.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nScreening family members for high triglycerides may detect the disease early, which can help prevent complications.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Hypertriglyceridemia**\n\n\\n\\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of triglycerides in the blood. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in lipid metabolism, leading to an overproduction of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its remnants.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of familial hypertriglyceridemia are similar to those of other forms of hypertriglyceridemia. They include:\n\n*   High levels of triglycerides in the blood\n*   Pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests, including:\n\n*   Blood tests to measure triglyceride levels\n*   Imaging studies to evaluate the pancreas and other organs\n*   Genetic testing to identify mutations in genes involved in lipid metabolism\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nTreatment for familial hypertriglyceridemia typically involves lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes may include:\n\n*   A healthy diet, low in fat and sugar\n*   Regular exercise\n*   Weight loss, if necessary\n\nMedications may be prescribed to lower triglyceride levels and prevent complications. These medications may include:\n\n*   Fibrates, which work by reducing the production of VLDL and its remnants\n*   Omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce triglyceride levels\n*   Statins, which can also help lower cholesterol levels\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with familial hypertriglyceridemia is generally good, especially if treatment is initiated early. With proper management, most people can lead normal lives without experiencing significant complications.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n*   Libby P, Bonow RO, Mann DL, Tomaselli GF, Bhatt DL, Solomon SD, eds.

It is part of a group of conditions called the COL4A1-related disorders, which involve fragile blood vessels.\n\n**Description**\n\nFluid-filled cysts develop in the brain during fetal development or soon after birth. These cysts typically occur in only one side of the brain and vary in size. The cysts are thought to be the result of bleeding within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). People with this condition also have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDuring infancy, people with familial porencephaly typically have paralysis affecting one side of the body (infantile hemiplegia).

    "content": "**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\n_Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart._\n\n**Description**\n\nIn familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nFamilial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of familial TAAD is not fully understood and may vary depending on the specific genetic cause.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection\n* Familial TAAD\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information, please consult with a qualified healthcare professional.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\n**What is Familial TAAD?**\n\nFamilial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of familial TAAD is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the structure and function of the aorta.

Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital).\n\n**Complications**\n\nDepending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scans. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and may include surgery to repair or replace the affected aorta.\n\nNote: The text has been cleaned up to remove duplicates and improve readability, while keeping the medical information intact.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\n**What is Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection?**\n\nFamilial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a condition where the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, becomes weakened and prone to tearing or bursting. This can lead to severe bleeding and even death.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in any of several genes are associated with familial TAAD. Mutations in the ACTA2 gene have been identified in 14 to 20 percent of people with this disorder, and TGFBR2 gene mutations have been found in 2.5 percent of affected individuals. Mutations in several other genes account for smaller percentages of cases.\n\n**Genetic Causes**\n\n*   **ACTA2 Gene**: The ACTA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is found in vascular smooth muscle cells. Layers of these cells are found in the walls of the aorta and other arteries.\n*   **TGFBR2 Gene**: The TGFBR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor type 2.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with familial TAAD may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   **Ruptured Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**: Ruptured aortic aneurysms and dissections are estimated to cause almost 30,000 deaths in the United States each year.\n*   **Blockages in Smaller Arteries**: Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for familial TAAD, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms and prevent complications. These may include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged aorta.\n*   **Medications**: Medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms and prevent further complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for people with familial TAAD depends on various factors, including the severity of the condition, the presence of any underlying health conditions, and the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, familial TAAD can lead to severe bleeding and even death if left untreated or if treatment is delayed.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\n**Causes of Familial TAAD**\n\n*   Mutations in the ACTA2 gene have been identified in 14 to 20 percent of people with familial TAAD.\n*   TGFBR2 gene mutations have been found in 2.5 percent of affected individuals.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\n### Genes Associated with Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection\n\n*   **ACTA2**: Provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is found in vascular smooth muscle cells.\n*   **TGFBR2**: Provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor type 2.\n\n### Additional Genes Associated with Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection\n\n*   **FBN1**\n*   **MYH11**\n*   **SMAD3**\n*   **TGFBR1**\n*   **MYLK**\n*   **PRKG1**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Familial TAAD**\n\n*   Familial TAAD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell can be sufficient to cause the condition.\n*   In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. However, some people who inherit an altered gene never develop the aortic abnormalities associated with the condition; this situation is known as reduced penetrance.\n\n**Other Names for Familial TAAD**\n\n*   Annuloaortic ectasia\n*   Congenital aneurysm of ascending aorta\n*   FAA (Familial Aortic Aneurysm)\n*   Familial aortic dissection\n*   Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm\n*   FTAAD (Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection)\n*   TAA (Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm)\n*   TAAD (Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n### Genetic Testing Information\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry: Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Aortic Dissection**\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Aortic Dissection**\n\n### Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n\n### Clinical Trials\n\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov**\n\n### Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4; AAT4**\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 1; AAT1**\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 2; AAT2**\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 6; AAT6**\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 7; AAT7**\n*   **AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 8; AAT8**\n\n---\n\n**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\nThis condition is characterized by the presence of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections in families with a history of the disease.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Brautbar A, LeMaire SA, Franco LM, Coselli JS, Milewicz DM, Belmont JW.

Families have many factors in common, including their genes, environment, and lifestyle. Looking at these factors can help you figure out whether you have a higher risk for certain health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer.\n\nHaving a family member with a disease raises your risk, but it does not mean that you will definitely get it. Knowing that you are at risk gives you a chance to reduce that risk by following a healthier lifestyle and getting tested as needed.\n\nYou can get started by talking to your relatives about their health.

The condition is more common among certain populations including people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, the Afrikaner population of South Africa, and the Japanese population.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in more than 20 genes can cause Fanconi anemia. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in a process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FA pathway turns on when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage. The FA pathway triggers DNA repair so DNA replication can continue.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nEighty to 90 percent of cases of Fanconi anemia are due to variants in one of three genes: FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG.\n\n---\n\n**Fanconi Anemia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The FA Pathway**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in more than 20 genes can cause Fanconi anemia. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in a process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FA pathway turns on (activates) when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage. The FA pathway triggers DNA repair so DNA replication can continue.\n\n**Interstrand Cross-links (ICLs)**\n\nThe FA pathway prevents a certain type of DNA damage known as interstrand cross-links (ICLs). ICLs are abnormal connections between two DNA building blocks (nucleotides) on opposite strands of DNA. These cross-links stop the process of DNA replication and can be caused by a buildup of toxic substances produced in the body or by treatment with certain cancer therapy drugs (sometimes known as DNA cross-linking agents).\n\n**The FA Core Complex**\n\nEight proteins associated with Fanconi anemia group together to form part of a complex known as the FA core complex. The FA core complex activates two proteins, called FANCD2 and FANCI. The activation of these two proteins brings DNA repair proteins to the area of the ICL so the cross-link can be removed and DNA replication can continue.\n\n**Genes Associated with Fanconi Anemia**\n\nEighty to 90 percent of cases of Fanconi anemia are due to variants in one of three genes: FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG. These genes provide instructions for producing components of the FA core complex. Variants in any of the genes associated with the FA core complex prevent the complex from functioning properly and disrupt the FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time.\n\n**Consequences of Disrupted DNA Replication**\n\nThe ICLs impair DNA replication, which leads to either abnormal cell death due to an inability to make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly sensitive to problems with DNA replication. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical differences that are seen in people with Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop acute myeloid leukemia or other cancers.\n\n---\n\n**Fanconi Anemia**\n\n**What is Fanconi anemia?**\n\nFanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage.

The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical differences that are seen in people with Fanconi anemia.\n\n**Genes associated with Fanconi anemia**\n\n*   BRCA1\n*   BRCA2\n*   FANCA\n*   FANCC\n*   FANCG\n*   RAD51\n*   Additional Information from NCBI Gene:\n    *   BRIP1\n    *   ERCC4\n    *   FAAP100\n    *   FANCB\n    *   FANCD2\n    *   FANCE\n    *   FANCF\n    *   FANCI\n    *   FANCL\n    *   FANCM\n    *   MAD2L2\n    *   PALB2\n    *   RAD51C\n    *   RFWD3\n    *   SLX4\n    *   UBE2T\n    *   XRCC2\n\n**Inheritance pattern of Fanconi anemia**\n\nFanconi anemia is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nVery rarely, Fanconi anemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern or in an X-linked pattern. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. X-linked inheritance means the altered gene is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell.\n\n**Other names for Fanconi anemia**\n\n*   FA\n*   Fanconi hypoplastic anemia\n*   Fanconi pancytopenia\n*   Fanconi panmyelopathy\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Fanconi anemia\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP A; FANCA\n\n---\n\n**Fanconi Anemia**\n\n**What is Fanconi anemia?**\n\nFanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells, leading to aplastic anemia or leukemia.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nFanconi anemia is caused by mutations in the FANCA gene, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of Fanconi anemia can vary widely, but may include:\n\n* Aplastic anemia or leukemia\n* Short stature\n* Skeletal abnormalities\n* Skin pigmentation changes\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can detect mutations in the FANCA gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Fanconi anemia, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Bone marrow transplantation\n* Chemotherapy\n* Supportive care to manage related health issues\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Fanconi anemia varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. Some people may experience a good response to bone marrow transplantation, while others may require ongoing management of their symptoms.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nFanconi anemia is caused by mutations in the FANCA gene, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair.

    "content": "**Faricimab-svoa Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFaricimab-svoa injection is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD; an ongoing disease of the eye that causes loss of the ability to see straight ahead and may make it more difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities). Faricimab-svoa injection is also used to treat diabetic macular edema (DME; an eye disease caused by diabetes that can lead to vision loss). Faricimab-svoa injection is also used to treat macular edema after retinal vein occlusion (an eye disease caused by blockage of blood flow from the eye that leads to blurry vision and vision loss).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFaricimab-svoa injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into the eye by a doctor. If you are receiving faricimab-svoa injection to treat wet AMD or diabetic macular edema, it is usually given in a doctor's office once a month for the first 4 or 6 doses, and then once every 1 to 4 months thereafter. If you are receiving faricimab-svoa injection to treat retinal vein occlusion, it is usually given in a doctor's office once every 4 weeks for 6 months. Your doctor will give you injections on a schedule that is best for you and your condition.\n\nBefore you receive a faricimab-svoa injection, your doctor will clean your eye to prevent infection and numb your eye to reduce discomfort during the injection. You may feel pressure in your eye when the medication is injected. After your injection, your doctor will need to examine your eyes before you leave the office.\n\nFaricimab-svoa controls certain eye conditions, but does not cure them. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well faricimab-svoa works for you.

    "content": "**Farsightedness**\n\nFarsightedness is having a harder time seeing objects that are close than things that are far away.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFarsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak. It can also be a combination of both.\n\n* The eyeball being too small\n* The focusing power being too weak\n\nFarsightedness is often present from birth. However, children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to correct the vision. If you have family members who are farsighted, you are also more likely to become farsighted.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Aching eyes\n* Blurred vision when looking at close objects\n* Crossed eyes (strabismus) in some children\n* Eye strain\n* Headache while reading\n\nMild farsightedness may not cause any problems. However, you may need reading glasses sooner than people who do not have this condition.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA general eye exam to diagnose farsightedness may include the following tests:\n\n* Eye movement testing\n* Glaucoma testing\n* Refraction test\n* Retinal examination\n* Slit-lamp examination\n* Visual acuity\n* Cycloplegic refraction, a refraction test done with the eyes dilated\n\nThis list is not all-inclusive.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nFarsightedness is easily corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Surgery is available for correcting farsightedness in adults. This is an option for those who do not wish to wear glasses or contacts.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome is expected to be good.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nFarsightedness can be a risk factor for glaucoma and crossed eyes.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider or eye doctor if you have symptoms of farsightedness and you have not had a recent eye exam. Also, contact your provider if vision begins to get worse after you have been diagnosed with farsightedness.

It occurs when the eyeball is too short or the cornea is too flat, causing light to focus behind the retina instead of directly on it.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of farsightedness is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetics, age, and nearsighted parents. Other risk factors include:\n\n*   Family history\n*   Age (more common in older adults)\n*   Nearsighted parents\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of farsightedness include:\n\n*   Blurry vision at close range\n*   Difficulty reading or performing tasks that require near vision\n*   Headaches or eye strain from trying to focus\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nTreatment for farsightedness typically involves corrective lenses, such as glasses or contact lenses. In some cases, surgery may be an option. To prevent farsightedness, regular eye exams are crucial, especially for children whose vision is still developing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Refractive Errors\n*   Visual Acuity Test\n*   Normal Vision\n*   Lasik Eye Surgery",

    "content": "**Fasting for a Blood Test**\n\nIf your health care provider has told you to fast before a blood test, it means you should not eat or drink anything, except water, for several hours before your test. While you're fasting for a blood test, you also should not:\n\n* Chew gum\n* Smoke\n* Exercise\n\n**How Long Do I Have to Fast Before the Test?**\n\nYou usually need to fast for 8 to 12 hours before a test, but your provider will tell you exactly how long to fast. For certain tests, you may be asked not to drink alcohol for a longer period of time.\n\nIf your blood test requires fasting, you can usually schedule the test early in the morning. That way, most of your fasting time will be while you are sleeping.\n\n**Why Do I Need to Fast Before My Blood Test?**\n\nWhen you eat and drink, your bloodstream absorbs sugar, fat, protein, and other nutrients in those foods and beverages. That could affect the results of certain blood tests and lead to the wrong diagnosis.\n\n**What Types of Blood Tests Require Fasting?**\n\nSome examples of common blood tests that usually require fasting are:\n\n* Blood sugar (glucose) tests\n* Cholesterol levels tests (lipid panel)\n* Basic metabolic panel (BMP)\n\nOther types of tests may require fasting, so always ask your provider if you aren't sure whether you should fast before your test.\n\n**Can I Drink Anything Besides Water During a Fast?**\n\nNo. Juice, coffee, soda, and other beverages can get in your bloodstream and affect your results. But you can drink water. It's good to drink water before a blood test. It helps keep more fluid in your veins, which can make it easier to get a sample of your blood.\n\n**Can I Continue Taking Medicine During a Fast?**\n\nAsk your provider whether it's okay to take your usual prescription medicines and/or over-the-counter medicines. But don't stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to stop.\n\n---\n\n**Fasting for a Blood Test**\n\nAre you wondering what to do before a blood test? Fasting, or not eating or drinking anything besides water, may be required for certain tests. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of fasting for a blood test.\n\n**Do I Need to Fast Before My Blood Test?**\n\nBefore your blood test, ask your provider if you need to fast. This will ensure that you have enough time to prepare and avoid any mistakes. If you don't know whether you should fast, it's always better to err on the side of caution and ask your provider at least a day before your test.\n\n**What Should I Do Before Fasting?**\n\nBefore fasting, let your provider know about any prescription medicines or over-the-counter medicines you take. Also, inform them about any vitamins and supplements you consume, as these may affect your test results. Your provider will guide you on whether it's okay to take your usual medications during the fast.\n\n**What If I Make a Mistake During My Fast?**\n\nIf you eat or drink something besides water during your fast, tell your provider immediately. You may need to reschedule your test for another time when you can properly fast to ensure accurate results.\n\n**When Can I Eat and Drink Normally Again?**\n\nAfter your blood test, you'll be able to eat as soon as the test is over. Consider bringing a snack with you so you can eat right away.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Fasting Before a Blood Test?**\n\nAlways ask your provider any questions you have about how to prepare for your test. Taking the right steps before a blood test helps ensure accurate results. If you're unsure whether you should fast, it's better to be safe than sorry and consult with your provider.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Allina Health.

In some cases, fatigue can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as anemia, diabetes, or hypothyroidism.\n\n**Causes of Fatigue**\n\nThere are many potential causes of fatigue, including:\n\n*   **Lack of sleep**: Not getting enough restful sleep can lead to feelings of tiredness and fatigue.\n*   **Poor nutrition**: A diet that is lacking in essential nutrients, such as iron or B vitamins, can contribute to fatigue.\n*   **Medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as anemia, diabetes, or hypothyroidism, can cause fatigue.\n*   **Medications**: Some medications, such as sedatives or antidepressants, can cause fatigue as a side effect.\n\n**Symptoms of Fatigue**\n\nThe symptoms of fatigue can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   **Tiredness**: Feeling exhausted or drained, even after getting enough rest.\n*   **Lethargy**: A lack of energy or motivation to engage in activities.\n*   **Difficulty concentrating**: Trouble focusing or paying attention due to feelings of fatigue.\n*   **Mood changes**: Irritability, anxiety, or depression can be symptoms of fatigue.\n\n**Treatment for Fatigue**\n\nThe treatment for fatigue will depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In some cases, making lifestyle changes, such as getting more sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in regular exercise, may help to alleviate symptoms. In other cases, medical treatment may be necessary to address an underlying medical condition.\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you are experiencing fatigue, there are many resources available to help you manage your symptoms.

    "content": "**Fatigue**\n\nAlso called: Tiredness, Weariness\n\n**What is fatigue?**\n\nFatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy. It can interfere with your usual daily activities. Fatigue can be a normal response to physical activity, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. But sometimes it can be a sign of a mental or physical condition. If you have been feeling tired for weeks, contact your health care provider. They can help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.\n\n**What causes fatigue?**\n\nFatigue itself is not a disease; it's a symptom. It can have many different causes, including pregnancy and various medical problems, treatments, and lifestyle habits such as:\n\n* Medical problems:\n\t+ Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as diabetes, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart, liver, kidney and thyroid diseases\n\t+ Untreated pain and diseases like fibromyalgia\n\t+ Anemia\n\t+ Infections\n\t+ Parkinson's disease\n\t+ Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders\n\t+ Recent stroke\n\t+ Mental disorders such as depression and anxiety\n* Treatments:\n\t+ Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and bone marrow transplants\n\t+ Recovering from major surgery\n\t+ Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain\n* Lifestyle habits:\n\t+ Not getting enough sleep\n\t+ Staying up too late\n\t+ Drinking too much alcohol\n\t+ Substance use\n\t+ Having too much caffeine (which can keep you from getting a good night's sleep)\n\t+ Getting too little or too much exercise\n\nOverwhelming fatigue is part of a disorder called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The fatigue caused by this disorder is different from a tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, the fatigue in ME/CFS lasts a long time, does not get better with rest, and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.\n\n**What can I do to manage fatigue?**\n\nIf you've had fatigue that does not get better after several weeks, call your provider. They will ask questions about your sleep, daily activities, appetite, and exercise. They will likely do a physical exam and order lab tests. Once they decide on a diagnosis, they can tell you what treatments might help.\n\nYou can also make some lifestyle changes to feel less tired:\n\n* Get regular physical activity\n* Improve your sleep habits\n* Stop smoking (if you smoke), since smoking is linked to many diseases that can cause fatigue\n* Manage stress\n* Eat a healthy diet and avoid alcohol\n\nIt also may be helpful for you to keep a fatigue diary. This can help you find patterns throughout the day, such as when you feel more tired and when you have more energy. It can also help you plan for activities that may give you more energy.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* IBD and Fatigue (Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America)\n* Cancer Fatigue  (National Cancer Institute)\n* Fatigue and Multiple Sclerosis (National Multiple Sclerosis Society)\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* Corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n---\n\n**Fatigue**\n\nFatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy that can interfere with your usual daily activities.

    "content": "**Fatty Liver Disease**\n\nAlso called: Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, NAFLD, NASH, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is fatty liver disease?**\n\nYour liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:\n\n*   Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\n*   Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?**\n\nNAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:\n\n*   Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.\n*   Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?**\n\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver. Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is at risk for fatty liver disease?**\n\nThe cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers do know that it is more common in people who:\n\n*   Have type 2 diabetes and prediabetes\n*   Have obesity\n*   Are middle aged or older (although children can also get it)\n*   Are Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic Whites. It is less common in African Americans.\n*   Have high levels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides\n*   Have high blood pressure\n*   Take certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugs\n*   Have certain metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome\n*   Have rapid weight loss\n*   Have certain infections, such as hepatitis C\n*   Have been exposed to some toxins\n\nNAFLD affects about 25% of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.\n\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?**\n\nBoth NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is fatty liver disease diagnosed?**\n\nBecause there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use:\n\n*   Your medical history\n*   A physical exam\n*   Various tests, including blood and imaging tests, and sometimes a biopsy\n\nAs part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.\n\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as:\n\n*   An enlarged liver\n*   Signs of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow\n\nYou will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?**\n\nDoctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine. But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.\n\nThere are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed.\n\nThe most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.\n\nBoth alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?**\n\nIf you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help:\n\n*   Lose weight if you're overweight or obese\n*   Exercise regularly\n*   Eat a healthy diet\n*   Avoid certain drugs and toxins\n*   Get enough sleep\n*   Manage stress\n\n---\n\n**Fatty Liver Disease**\n\nYour liver is the largest organ inside your body.

    "content": "**Febrile Seizures**\n\nA febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or above may cause febrile seizures in children.\n*   Febrile seizures occur most often in otherwise healthy children between ages 6 months and 5 years.\n*   Toddlers are most commonly affected.\n*   Febrile seizures often run in families.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA febrile seizure may be as mild as the child's eyes rolling or limbs stiffening. A simple febrile seizure stops by itself within a few seconds to 10 minutes. It is often followed by a brief period of drowsiness or confusion.\n\n*   Sudden tightening (contraction) of muscles on both sides of a child's body.\n*   The muscle tightening may last for several seconds or longer.\n*   The child may cry or moan.\n*   If standing, the child will fall.\n*   The child may vomit or bite their tongue.\n*   Sometimes, children do not breathe and may begin to turn blue.\n*   The child's body may then begin to jerk rhythmically. The child will not respond to the parent's voice.\n*   Urine may be passed.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nWith a typical febrile seizure, the examination usually is normal, other than symptoms of the illness causing the fever. Often, the child will not need a full seizure workup, which includes an EEG, head CT, and lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n\nFurther testing may be needed if the child:\n\n*   Is younger than 9 months or older than 5 years\n*   Has a brain, nerve, or developmental disorder\n*   Had the seizure in only one part of the body\n*   Had the seizure last longer than 15 minutes\n*   Had more than one febrile seizure in 24 hours\n*   Has an abnormal finding when examined\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe aim of treatment is to manage the underlying cause. The following measures help keep the child safe during a seizure:\n\n*   Do not hold down the child or try to stop the seizure movements.\n*   Do not leave the child alone.\n*   Lay the child on the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects.\n*   Slide a blanket under the child if the floor is hard.\n*   Move the child only if they are in a dangerous location.\n*   Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck. If possible, open or remove clothes from the waist up.\n*   If the child vomits or if saliva and mucus build up in the mouth, turn the child to the side or on the stomach. This is also important if it looks like the tongue is getting in the way of breathing.\n*   Do not force anything into the child's mouth to prevent biting the tongue. This increases the risk for injury.\n\nIf the seizure lasts several minutes, call 911 or the local emergency number to have an ambulance take your child to the hospital.\n\nContact your child's provider as soon as possible to describe your child's seizure.\n\nAfter the seizure, the most important step is to identify the cause of the fever. The focus is on bringing the fever down. The provider may tell you to give your child medicines to reduce the fever. Follow instructions exactly on how much and how often to give your child the medicine. These medicines, however, do not reduce the chance of having febrile seizures in the future.\n\nIt is normal for children to sleep or be drowsy or confused for a short time right after a seizure.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe first febrile seizure can be frightening for parents. Most parents are afraid that their child will die or have brain damage. However, simple febrile seizures are harmless. There is no evidence that they cause death, brain damage, epilepsy, or learning problems.\n\nMost children outgrow febrile seizures by age 5.\n\nFew children have more than 3 febrile seizures in their lifetime. The number of febrile seizures is not related to future risk for epilepsy.\n\nChildren who would develop epilepsy anyway will sometimes have their first seizures during fevers. These seizures most often do not appear like a typical febrile seizure.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf the seizure lasts several minutes, call 911 or the local emergency number to have an ambulance bring your child to the hospital.\n\nIf the seizure ends quickly, drive the child to an emergency room when it is over.\n\nTake your child to their provider if:\n\n*   Repeated seizures occur during the same illness.\n*   This looks like a new type of seizure for your child.\n\nContact their provider if other symptoms occur before or after the seizure, such as:\n\n*   Abnormal movements, tremors, or problems with coordination\n*   Agitation or confusion\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Nausea\n*   Rash\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause febrile seizures can be the first sign of illness, it is often not possible to prevent them. A febrile seizure does not mean that your child is not getting the proper care.\n\nOccasionally, a provider will prescribe a medicine called diazepam to prevent or treat febrile seizures that occur more than once. However, no drug is completely effective in preventing febrile seizures.\n\n---\n\n**Febrile Seizures**\n\nA febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or above may cause febrile seizures in children.\n*   A cold or viral illness may trigger a febrile seizure.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA febrile seizure may be as mild as the child's eyes rolling or limbs stiffening.

Most of the time, a febrile seizure does not cause any harm. The child usually does not have a more serious long-term health problem.\n\n**Who is Affected?**\n\nFebrile seizures occur most often in otherwise healthy children between ages 6 months and 5 years. Toddlers are most commonly affected. Febrile seizures often run in families.\n\n**When Do They Occur?**\n\nMost febrile seizures occur in the first 24 hours of an illness. It may not occur when the fever is highest. A cold or viral illness may trigger a febrile seizure.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA febrile seizure may be as mild as the child's eyes rolling or limbs stiffening. A simple febrile seizure stops by itself within a few seconds to 10 minutes. It is often followed by a brief period of drowsiness or confusion.\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Sudden tightening (contraction) of muscles on both sides of a child's body. The muscle tightening may last for several seconds or longer.\n* The child may cry or moan.\n* If standing, the child will fall.\n* The child may vomit or bite their tongue.\n* Sometimes, children do not breathe and may begin to turn blue.\n* The child's body may then begin to jerk rhythmically. The child will not respond to the parent's voice.\n* Urine may be passed.\n\nA seizure lasting longer than 15 minutes, is in just one part of the body, or that occurs again during the same illness is not a normal febrile seizure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nWith a typical febrile seizure, the examination usually is normal, other than symptoms of the illness causing the fever.

They are usually harmless and do not indicate any underlying neurological disorder.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to the sudden increase in temperature that occurs during a fever. Children with a family history of febrile seizures or those who have had previous febrile seizures are at a higher risk of experiencing them again.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of febrile seizures can vary, but they usually involve a seizure-like episode that lasts from a few seconds to several minutes. During this time, the child may lose consciousness and experience muscle stiffness or spasms.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures is typically done through a physical examination and a review of the child's medical history. In some cases, a fever may be present at the time of the seizure.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nSince febrile seizures are usually harmless, treatment is often focused on managing the underlying cause of the fever, such as a bacterial or viral infection. In some cases, antipyretics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be prescribed to help reduce the child's fever.\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for children who experience febrile seizures is generally good, with most recovering fully from the episode. However, in rare cases, repeated febrile seizures can increase the risk of developing epilepsy or other neurological disorders.\n\n\\n\\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf your child experiences a febrile seizure, it's essential to remain calm and follow these steps:\n\n*   Call 911 or your local emergency number if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if your child shows signs of distress.\n*   Keep your child safe by clearing the area around them of any breakable objects.\n*   Turn your child onto their side to help prevent choking on their tongue or food.\n*   Loosen any tight clothing around your child's neck.\n\n\\n\\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\nSeizures",

    "content": "**Febuxostat**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFebuxostat is used to treat gout in adults who were not treated successfully with or who are not able to take allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim). Gout is a type of arthritis in which uric acid, a naturally occurring substance in the body, builds up in the joints and causes sudden attacks of redness, swelling, pain, and heat in one or more joints. Febuxostat is in a class of medications called xanthine oxidase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of uric acid that is made in the body. Febuxostat is used to prevent gout attacks but not to treat them once they occur.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFebuxostat comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take febuxostat at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take febuxostat exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may increase your dose of febuxostat after 2 weeks if a laboratory test shows that you still have too much uric acid in your blood.\n\nIt may take several months before febuxostat begins to prevent gout attacks. Febuxostat may increase the number of gout attacks during the first few months of your treatment. Your doctor may prescribe another medication such as colchicine (Colcyrs, Mitigare) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to prevent gout attacks during the first 6 months of your treatment. Continue to take febuxostat even if you have gout attacks during your early treatment.\n\nFebuxostat controls gout but does not cure it. Continue to take febuxostat even if you feel well. Do not stop taking febuxostat without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nPeople who take febuxostat may be at a higher risk of heart-related death than people who take other medications for treatment of gout. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease or a heart attack or stroke. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, numbness or weakness on one side of your body, dizziness, fainting, slurred speech, sudden blurry vision, or sudden severe headache.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with febuxostat and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking febuxostat.\n\n---\n\n**Febuxostat: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Taking Febuxostat**\n\n*   Continue to take febuxostat even if you have gout attacks during your early treatment.\n*   Take febuxostat at around the same time every day.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**Dose**\n\n*   Your doctor may increase your dose of febuxostat after 2 weeks if a laboratory test shows that you still have too much uric acid in your blood.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n*   Febuxostat may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if either of these symptoms is severe or does not go away:\n    *   nausea\n    *   joint pain\n*   Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately:\n    *   rash; skin redness or pain; blistering of lips, eyes or mouth; skin peeling; or fever and other flu-like symptoms\n    *   swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat\n    *   yellow eyes or skin; dark urine; or pain or discomfort in right upper stomach area\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Before taking febuxostat, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to febuxostat, allopurinol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in febuxostat tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Some medications should not be taken with febuxostat. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with febuxostat. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting febuxostat with your doctor and pharmacist.\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\n*   Store febuxostat at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.\n*   Do not keep medicine that is out of date or no longer needed. Ask your pharmacist about the proper disposal of unused medicine.\n\n---\n\n**Febuxostat: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Storage and Disposal**\n    Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature, away from light, and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n    Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant.

    "content": "**Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)**\n\nA fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for blood in a sample of your stool. It's called occult (hidden) blood because you can't see it just by looking at it. And fecal means that it is in your stool.\n\nBlood in your stool means there is bleeding in the digestive tract. The bleeding can be caused by:\n\n*   Polyps, abnormal growths on the lining of your colon or rectum\n*   Hemorrhoids, swollen veins in your anus or rectum\n*   Diverticulosis, a condition in which you have small pouches in the inside wall of your colon\n*   Ulcers, sores in the lining of your digestive tract\n*   Ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease\n*   Colorectal cancer, a type of cancer that starts in your colon or rectum\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States. A fecal occult blood test can screen for colorectal cancer to help find the disease early, when treatment may be most effective.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA fecal occult blood test is commonly used as a screening test to help find colorectal cancer before you have symptoms. The test may also be used to check for other conditions that can cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.\n\nIn certain cases, the test is used to help find the cause of anemia. It can also help tell the difference between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually doesn't cause bleeding, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is likely to cause bleeding.\n\nBut a fecal occult blood test alone cannot diagnose any condition. If your test results show blood in your stool, you will likely need other tests to find the exact cause.\n\n**Why do I need a fecal occult blood test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a fecal occult blood test if you have symptoms of a condition that could involve bleeding in your digestive tract. Or you may have the test to screen for colorectal cancer when you don't have any symptoms.\n\nRegular screening tests for colorectal cancer can detect colon polyps and colorectal cancer. If you aren't at higher risk for colorectal cancer, your provider will likely recommend you start screenings at age 45. If you are at higher risk, you may need to start getting screened for colorectal cancer earlier. Talk with your provider about when to start, how often to get screened, and which type of test you should have.\n\n**What happens during a fecal occult blood test?**\n\nUsually, your provider will give you a kit to collect samples of your stool at home. The kit will include instructions on how to do the test.\n\nThere are two main types of fecal occult blood tests:\n\n*   The guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) uses a chemical (guaiac) to find blood in stool. It usually requires stool samples from two or three separate bowel movements.\n*   The fecal immunochemical test (iFOBT or FIT) uses an antibody, a type of protein that attaches to hemoglobin (blood) in stool. FIT is considered better at finding blood in your stool than gFOBT testing. A FIT test requires stool samples from one to three separate bowel movements, depending on the brand of the test.\n\nDifferent test kits have different instructions, so it's very important to follow the specific instructions that come with your kit. The typical process for gathering a stool sample usually includes these general steps:\n\n*   Collecting a bowel movement. Your kit may include special paper to place over your toilet to catch your bowel movement. You may also use plastic wrap or a clean, dry container.\n*   Taking a stool sample from the bowel movement. Your kit will include a wooden stick or applicator brush for scraping the stool sample from your bowel movement.\n*   Preparing the stool sample. You will either smear the stool on a special test card or insert the applicator with the stool sample into a tube that came with your kit.\n*   Labeling and sealing the sample as directed.\n*   Repeating the test on your next bowel movement as directed if more than one sample is needed.\n*   Returning the samples as directed. This might be mailing them or taking them to your provider's office or a lab.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou do not need any special preparations for many fecal occult blood tests. But for some guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs), certain foods, supplements, and medicines may affect the results of the test. If you are having one of these tests, your provider will tell you what you need to avoid and for how long.\n\nFor example, you might need to avoid:\n\n*   Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.\n*   Vitamin C in amounts over 250 mg a day. This includes vitamin C from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit.\n*   Red meat, such as beef, lamb, and liver. Traces of blood from these meats may show up in your stool.\n*   Certain raw fruits and vegetables.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a fecal occult blood test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results from a fecal occult blood test show that you have blood in your stool, it means you likely have bleeding somewhere in your digestive tract. But that doesn't always mean you have cancer. Other conditions that may cause blood in your stool include ulcers, hemorrhoids, polyps, and benign (not cancer) tumors.\n\nIf you have blood in your stool, your provider will likely recommend more tests to figure out the exact location and cause of your bleeding. The most common follow-up test is a colonoscopy. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a fecal occult blood test?**\n\nRegular colorectal cancer screenings, such as fecal occult blood tests, are an important tool in the fight against cancer. Studies show that screening tests can help find cancer early and may reduce deaths from the disease.\n\nIf you decide to use fecal occult blood testing for your colorectal cancer screening, you will need to do the test every year.\n\nYou can buy gFOBT and FIT stool collection kits without a prescription. Most of these tests require you to send a sample of your stool to a lab. But some tests can be done completely at home for quick results. If you're considering buying your own test, ask your provider which one is best for you.\n\n---\n\n**Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)**\n\nA fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for blood in a sample of your stool.

    "content": "**Fecal Fat Test**\n\nThe fecal fat test measures the amount of fat in the stool, helping to gauge the percentage of dietary fat that the body does not absorb.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nTo collect a sample, you can:\n\n*   Catch stool on plastic wrap loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat for adults and children.\n*   Use special toilet tissue provided in one test kit to collect the sample, then put it in a clean container.\n*   Line the diaper with plastic wrap for infants and children wearing diapers, preventing mixing of urine and stool.\n\nCollect all stool released over a 24-hour period (or sometimes 3 days) in containers provided. Label the containers with name, time, and date, and send them to the lab. In some cases, you may be asked to provide a single stool sample to be examined under a microscope for stool fat.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nEat a normal diet containing about 100 grams (g) of fat per day for 3 days before starting the test. Your healthcare provider may ask you to stop using medicines or food additives that could affect the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test evaluates fat absorption to tell how well the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestines are working. Fat malabsorption can cause a change in your stools called steatorrhea. The body needs bile from the gallbladder (or the liver if the gallbladder has been removed), enzymes from the pancreas, and a normal small intestine to absorb fat normally.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nLess than 7 g of fat per 24 hours.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nDecreased fat absorption may be caused by:\n\n*   Biliary tumor\n*   Biliary stricture\n*   Celiac disease (non-tropical sprue)\n*   Chronic pancreatitis\n*   Crohn disease\n*   Cystic fibrosis\n*   Gallstones (cholelithiasis)\n*   Pancreatic cancer\n*   Pancreatitis\n*   Radiation enteritis\n*   Short bowel syndrome (for example from surgery or an inherited problem)\n*   Small bowel bacterial overgrowth\n*   Whipple disease\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nFactors that interfere with the test are:\n\n*   Enemas\n*   Laxatives\n*   Mineral oil\n*   Inadequate fat in diet prior to and during the stool collection\n\n---\n\n**Fecal Fat Test**\n\nThis test evaluates fat absorption to tell how well the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestines are working.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   Eat a normal diet containing about 100 grams (g) of fat per day for 3 days before starting the test.\n*   The health care provider may ask you to stop using medicines or food additives that could affect the test.\n\n**The Test**\n\n*   Collect all stool that is released over a 24-hour period (or sometimes 3 days) in the containers provided.\n*   Label the containers with name, time, and date, and send them to the lab.\n*   Sometimes you will be asked to provide a single stool sample to be examined under a microscope for stool fat.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\n*   The test involves only normal bowel movements. There is no discomfort.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n*   This test evaluates fat absorption to tell how well the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestines are working.\n*   Fat malabsorption can cause a change in your stools called steatorrhea.

    "content": "**Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)**\n\nThe fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a screening test for colon cancer that detects hidden blood in the stool, an early sign of cancer. FIT only detects human blood from the lower intestines and does not interfere with medicines or food, making it more accurate and having fewer false positive results than other tests.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nFor colon cancer screening, you will be given the test to use at home. Follow the instructions provided:\n\n*   Flush the toilet before having a bowel movement.\n*   Put the used toilet paper in the waste bag provided. Do not put it into the toilet bowl.\n*   Use the brush from the kit to brush the surface of the stool and then dip the brush into the toilet water.\n*   Touch the brush on the space indicated on the test card.\n*   Add the brush to the waste bag and throw it away.\n*   Send the sample to the lab for testing.\n    Your health care provider may ask you to test more than one stool sample before sending it in.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou do not need to do anything to prepare for the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSome people may be squeamish about collecting the sample.

There are several screening tests available:\n\n*   A stool-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year\n*   A stool sDNA test every 1 to 3 years\n*   Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or every 10 years with stool testing by FIT done every year\n*   CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years\n*   Colonoscopy every 10 years\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means the test did not detect any blood in the stool. However, because cancers in the colon may not always bleed, you may need to do the test a few times to confirm that there is no blood in your stool.\n\n**What Abnormal Test Results Mean**\n\nIf the FIT results come back positive for blood in the stool, your provider will want to perform other tests, usually including a colonoscopy. The FIT test does not diagnose cancer. Screening tests such as a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can also help detect cancer. Both the FIT test and other screenings can catch colon cancer early, when it is easier to treat.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks from using the FIT.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nImmunochemical fecal occult blood test; iFOBT; Colon cancer screening - FIT\n\n**References**\n\n*   Garber JJ, Chung DC.

    "content": "**Fecal Microbiota Transplant**\n\nFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) helps to replace some of the \"bad\" bacteria of your colon with \"good\" bacteria. The procedure helps to restore the good bacteria that have been killed off or limited by the use of antibiotics. Restoring this balance in the colon makes it easier to fight infection.\n\n**Description**\n\nFMT involves collecting stool from a healthy donor. Your health care provider will ask you to identify a donor. Most people choose a family member or close friend. The donor must not have used antibiotics for the previous 2 to 3 days. They will be screened for any infections in the blood or stool.\n\nOnce collected, the donor's stool is mixed with saline water and filtered. The stool mixture is then transferred into your digestive tract (colon) through a tube that goes through a colonoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a small camera). The good bacteria can also be introduced into the body by way of a tube that goes into the stomach through the mouth. Another method is to swallow a capsule that contains freeze-dried donor stool.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe large intestine has a large number of bacteria. These bacteria that live in your intestines are important for your health, and grow in a balanced manner.\n\nOne of these bacteria is called Clostridioides difficile (C difficile). In small amounts, it does not cause problems.\n\nHowever, if a person receives repeated or high doses of antibiotics for an infection elsewhere in the body, most of the normal bacteria in the intestine may be wiped out. Bacteria grow and release a toxin.\nThe result may be that there is too much of the C difficile.\nThis toxin causes the lining of large intestine to become swollen and inflamed, causing fever, diarrhea, and bleeding.\n\nCertain other antibiotics can sometimes bring the C difficile bacteria under control. If these do not succeed, FMT is used to replace some of the C difficile with \"good\" bacteria and restore the balance.\n\nFMT also may be used to treat conditions such as:\n\n* Irritable bowel syndrome\n* Crohn disease\n* Constipation\n* Ulcerative colitis\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for FMT may include the following:\n\n* Reactions to the medicine you are given during the procedure\n* Heavy or ongoing bleeding during the procedure\n* Breathing problems\n* Spread of disease from the donor (if the donor is not screened properly, which is rare)\n* Infection during colonoscopy (very rare)\n* Blood clots (very rare)\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nThe donor will likely take a laxative the night before the procedure so they can have a bowel movement the next morning. They will collect a stool sample in a clean cup and bring it with them the day of the procedure.\n\nTalk to your provider about any allergies and all medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine without talking to your provider. You will need to stop taking any antibiotics for 2 to 3 days before the procedure.\n\nYou may need to follow a liquid diet. You may be asked to take laxatives the night before the procedure. You will need to prepare for a colonoscopy the night before FMT. Your doctor will give you instructions.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will lie on your side for about 2 hours after the procedure with the solution in your bowels. You may be given loperamide (Imodium) to help slow down your bowels so the solution remains in place during this time.\n\nYou will go home the same day of the procedure once you pass the stool mixture. You will need a ride home, so be sure to arrange it ahead of time. You should avoid driving, drinking alcohol, or any heavy lifting.\n\nYou may have a low-grade fever the night after the procedure. You may have bloating, gas, flatulence, and constipation for a few days after the procedure.\n\nYour provider will instruct you about the type of diet and medicines you need to take after the procedure.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThis life-saving treatment is highly safe, effective and, low cost. FMT helps by bringing back normal flora through donor stool.

This will prevent them from becoming overly full and achy. It will also allow you to continue producing milk.\n* If you feed your baby formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 times per day, or every 2 to 4 hours. Start your newborn with 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) at every feeding and gradually increase the feedings.\n\n**Signs of Hunger**\n\n* Smacking lips\n* Making suckling movements\n* Rooting (moving their head around to find your breast)\n\n**Do Not Wait Until Your Baby Cries to Feed Them**\n\nThis means they are very hungry. Your baby should not sleep more than 4 hours at night without feeding (4 to 5 hours if you are feeding formula).

Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.\n* Do not feed your baby any solid food until 4 to 6 months old. Your baby will not be able to digest it and may choke.\n* Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your baby's provider if you are concerned because your baby:\n\n* Is not eating enough\n* Is eating too much\n* Is gaining too much or too little weight\n* Has an allergic reaction to food\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Patterns and Diet - Babies and Infants**\n\n**During the First 6 Months of Life**\n\nYour baby needs only breast milk or formula for proper nutrition.\n\n*   If you breastfeed, your newborn may need to nurse 8 to 12 times per day, or every 2 to 3 hours.\n*   Be sure to empty your breasts regularly by feeding or using a breast pump.

It's essential to note that these recommendations are based on the baby's age and developmental stage.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breastfeeding and Formula Feeding**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding along with solid foods until at least 12 months of age. For babies who are not breastfed or need supplementation, formula feeding is a suitable alternative. It's crucial to choose a high-quality formula that meets the baby's nutritional needs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Solid Foods and Complementary Feeding**\n\nAround 6 months of age, babies typically start showing interest in solid foods. Parents can introduce single-ingredient, iron-rich foods like pureed meat, poultry, or fish, followed by other fruits and vegetables. The key is to gradually introduce new foods while monitoring for signs of allergy or intolerance.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Meek JY, Noble L.
