Not only are you filled with worry and concern, but you also have to keep track of your child's treatments, medical visits, insurance, and more.\n\nYou and your partner are used to managing your family life on your own, but cancer adds an extra burden. Learn how to get help and support so you can cope more easily. That way you will have more time and energy to be there for your child.\n\n**Involve Family, Friends, and Your Community**\n\nChildhood cancer is tough on a family, but it is also hard on relatives and friends of the family. Let them know that your child is being treated for cancer. Ask trusted family members and close friends for help with household chores or caring for siblings. Having a child with cancer is a crisis in your family, and other people can and will want to help.\n\nYou may also want to tell people in your community, at work, school, and religious community. It helps when those around you understand what you are going through. Also, people can help you in different ways. They may have a similar story and can offer support, or they may be able to help you run errands or cover a work shift.\n\nIt can be hard to keep everyone updated on what is going on. Repeating news can be tiring. Online e-mails or social networks are a great way to update the people in your life. You can also receive kind words of support this way.

This will allow you to get support without having to manage it.\n\nOnce you let people know, do not be afraid to set boundaries. You may feel grateful that people want to help.

Private companies and community organizations can also help with insurance filing and finding money to pay for expenses.\n\n**Take Care of Yourself**\n\nBy taking care of yourself, you will show your child how to enjoy what life has to offer.\n\n* Exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Taking care of your body can give you energy to work with your child and providers.\n* Take special time alone with your spouse or partner and other children and friends. Talk about things other than your child's cancer.\n* Make time for yourself to do things you liked to do before your child got sick. Doing things you enjoy will help keep you balanced and reduce stress.\n\nDo not feel guilty about taking delight in life. It is healthy for your child to see you smile and hear you laugh.

    "content": "**Getting Yourself Healthy Before Surgery**\n\nEven if you've been to many healthcare providers, you know more about your symptoms and health history than anyone else. Your surgeon depends on you to tell them things they need to know.\n\nBeing healthy for surgery helps make sure the operation and your recovery go smoothly. Below are tips and reminders.\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctors Before Surgery**\n\nTell your surgeon about:\n\n* Any reactions or allergies you have had to medicines, foods, skin tapes, adhesive, iodine or other skin cleansing solutions, or latex\n* Your use of alcohol (especially if you're drinking more than 1 or 2 drinks a day) or illicit drugs\n* Problems you had before with surgery or anesthesia\n* Blood clots or bleeding problems you have had\n* Recent dental problems, such as infections or dental surgery\n* Your use of cigarettes or tobacco\n* Medicines that you take\n\nIf you get a cold, the flu, a fever, herpes breakout or another illness in the few days before surgery, call your surgeon right away. Your surgery may need to be rescheduled.\n\n**Preoperative Exam**\n\nBefore your surgery, you may need to have a medical assessment. Ask your surgeon if this is needed.\n\nThis may be done by your surgeon or your primary care provider (PCP).\nYou may need to visit a specialist who takes care of problems such as diabetes, lung disease, or heart disease. Your PCP can tell you if this is necessary.\nYour surgeon or PCP will schedule an appointment, usually a few weeks before surgery. That way, your providers can take care of any medical problems you might have well before your surgery.\n\nMost hospitals will also have you visit with an anesthesia provider at the hospital or have a phone call from the anesthesia nurse before surgery.\n\nYou will be asked many questions about your medical history.\nYou may also have a chest x-ray, lab tests, or an electrocardiogram (ECG) ordered by the anesthesia provider, your surgeon, or your PCP before surgery.\n\n**Should Manage Your Medicines**\n\nBring a list of medicines you are taking with you every time you see any provider. This includes medicines you bought without a prescription and medicines you do not take every day. Include information on the dose and how often you take your medicines.\n\nAlso tell your providers about any vitamins, supplements, minerals, or natural medicines you are taking.\n\nTwo weeks before surgery, you may need to stop taking medicines that put you at risk of bleeding during surgery. Medicines include:\n\n* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)\n* Blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), clopidogrel (Plavix)\n* Vitamin E\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n\n**Manage Your Medical Problems**\n\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon or PCP may have you see the providers who treat you for these problems. Your risk for problems after surgery will be lower if your diabetes and other medical conditions are under control before surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Getting Yourself Healthy Before Surgery**\n\nAs you prepare for surgery, it's essential to focus on getting your overall health in order. This will not only improve the success of your operation but also ensure a smoother recovery.\n\n**Managing Your Diabetes and Other Medical Conditions**\n\nIf you have diabetes or other chronic medical conditions, such as lung disease or heart disease, it's crucial to get them under control before surgery. This will help reduce your risk of complications during and after the procedure.\n\n**Scheduling Dental Work**\n\nIf you're planning to undergo joint replacement or heart valve surgery, be sure to schedule any necessary dental work at least three months in advance. This will prevent any potential issues that may arise from combining these procedures.\n\n**Quitting Smoking**\n\nSmoking can significantly slow down your healing process after surgery. If you're a smoker, it's essential to quit at least four weeks before your operation. Your healthcare provider can offer guidance and support to help you overcome this habit.\n\n**Informing Your Providers About Medications**\n\nMake sure to inform all your healthcare providers about any medications you're taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, supplements, and natural medicines. This will help prevent any potential interactions or complications during surgery.\n\n**Preoperative Exam**\n\nBefore your surgery, you may need to undergo a preoperative exam, which can be conducted by your surgeon, primary care provider (PCP), or other specialists. This assessment will help identify any underlying medical issues that need to be addressed before the procedure.\n\n**Managing Your Medicines**\n\nTwo weeks before surgery, you may need to stop taking certain medications that increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Be sure to discuss this with your surgeon and bring a list of all your medications to each healthcare appointment.\n\nBy following these tips and being proactive about your health, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with surgery and ensure a smoother recovery.\n\n---\n\n**Getting Yourself Healthy Before Surgery**\n\nIf you're about to undergo surgery, it's essential to get your health in check before the procedure. This includes managing any underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, and stopping smoking if you're a smoker.\n\n**Medicines You Take**\n\nBe sure to inform your surgeon about all the medicines you take, including:\n\n*   **Blood thinners**: warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), clopidogrel (Plavix)\n*   **Pain relievers**: acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)\n*   **Vitamin E**\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. It's also a good idea to bring a list of all your medicines with you every time you see any provider.\n\n**Managing Your Medical Problems**\n\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon or primary care physician (PCP) may recommend that you see the providers who treat these conditions. This is because managing these conditions before surgery can help reduce the risk of complications after the procedure.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to have dental work done, be sure to schedule it at least three months before certain surgeries, such as joint replacement or heart valve surgery. Smoking can also slow down your healing process after surgery, so consider quitting if you smoke.\n\n**Tell Your Providers About Your Surgery**\n\nFinally, don't forget to inform all your providers that you're about to undergo surgery. They may suggest changes to your medicines before the operation to ensure a smooth and safe procedure for you.",

It typically occurs in people over 50 years old and can cause symptoms such as headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and fever.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors**: The exact cause of GCA is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain risk factors include age, female sex, and European ancestry.\n*   **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis of GCA is typically made based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends a diagnosis of GCA when there are at least two of the following: age over 50 years, new headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n*   **Treatment**: Treatment for GCA typically involves corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. In some cases, immunosuppressive drugs may be used in addition to steroids.\n*   **Prognosis**: The prognosis for patients with GCA is generally good, especially if treated promptly and appropriately. However, delayed treatment can lead to complications such as visual loss or stroke.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n*   Stone JH, Tuckwell K, Dimonaco S, et al.

    "content": "**Giant Congenital Nevus**\n\nA congenital pigmented or melanocytic nevus is a dark-colored, often hairy, patch of skin. It is present at birth or appears in the first year of life.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThese marks are thought to be caused by a localized increase in melanocytes as a baby grows in the womb. Melanocytes are the skin cells that produce melanin, which gives skin its color. A nevus has an increased amount of melanocytes.\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a gene defect.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA nevus will appear as a dark-colored patch with any of the following:\n\n* Brown to bluish-black color\n* Hair\n* Regular or uneven borders\n* Smaller affected areas near the larger nevus (maybe)\n* Smooth, irregular, or wart-like skin surface\n\nNevi are commonly found on the upper or lower parts of the back or the abdomen. They may also be found on the:\n\n* Arms\n* Legs\n* Mucus membranes\n* Palms or soles\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou should have all birthmarks looked at by a health care provider. A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis or check for cancer cells.\n\nAn MRI of the brain or spine might be done if the nevus is over the spine. A giant nevus on the spine may be linked to brain or spinal cord problems.\n\nYour provider will measure the dark skin area every year and may take pictures to check if the spot is getting larger.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou will need to have regular exams to check for skin cancer.\n\nSurgery to remove the nevus can be done for cosmetic reasons or if your provider thinks it may become skin cancer. Skin grafting is also done when needed. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages.\n\nLasers and dermabrasion (rubbing them off) can also be used to improve appearance. These treatments may not remove the whole birthmark, so it may be harder to detect skin cancer (melanoma). Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of surgery for you.\n\nTreatment may be helpful if the birthmark causes emotional problems because of how it looks.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSkin cancer may develop in some people with large or giant nevi. The cancer risk is higher for nevi that are larger in size. However, it isn't known if removing the nevus reduces that risk.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHaving a giant nevus may lead to:\n\n* Depression and other emotional problems if the nevi affect appearance\n* Skin cancer (melanoma)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nThis condition is usually diagnosed at birth. Talk to your child's provider if your child has a large, pigmented area anywhere on their skin.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCongenital giant pigmented nevus; Giant hairy nevus; Giant pigmented nevus; Bathing trunk nevus; Congenital melanocytic nevus - large\n\n---\n\n**Giant Congenital Nevus**\n\nA giant congenital nevus is smaller in infants and children, but it usually continues to grow as the child grows. A giant pigmented nevus is larger than 15 inches (40 centimeters) once it stops growing.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThese marks are thought to be caused by a localized increase in melanocytes as a baby grows in the womb. Melanocytes are the skin cells that produce melanin, which gives skin its color. A nevus has an increased amount of melanocytes.\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a gene defect.\n\nThe condition may occur with:\n\n* Other nevi (moles)\n* Involvement of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord when the nevus affects a very large area\n\nSmaller congenital pigmented or melanocytic nevi are common in children and do not cause problems most of the time. Larger or giant nevi are rare.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA nevus will appear as a dark-colored patch with any of the following:\n\n* Brown to bluish-black color\n* Hair\n* Regular or uneven borders\n* Smaller affected areas near the larger nevus (maybe)\n* Smooth, irregular, or wart-like skin surface\n\nNevi are commonly found on the upper or lower parts of the back or the abdomen. They may also be found on the:\n\n* Arms\n* Legs\n* Mucus membranes\n* Palms or soles\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou should have all birthmarks looked at by a health care provider. A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis or check for cancer cells.\n\nAn MRI of the brain or spine might be done if the nevus is over the spine. A giant nevus on the spine may be linked to brain or spinal cord problems.\n\nYour provider will measure the dark skin area every year and may take pictures to check if the spot is getting larger.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou will need to have regular exams to check for skin cancer.\n\nSurgery to remove the nevus can be done for cosmetic reasons or if your provider thinks it may become skin cancer. Skin grafting is also done when needed. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages.\n\nLasers and dermabrasion (rubbing them off) can also be used to improve appearance. These treatments may not remove the whole birthmark, so it may be harder to detect skin cancer (melanoma). Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of surgery for you.\n\nTreatment may be helpful if the birthmark causes emotional problems because of how it looks.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSkin cancer may develop in some people with large or giant nevi. The cancer risk is higher for nevi that are larger in size. However, it isn't known if removing the nevus reduces that risk.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHaving a giant nevus may lead to:\n\n* Depression and other emotional problems if the nevi affect appearance\n* Skin cancer (melanoma)\n\n---\n\n**Giant Congenital Nevus**\n\n**What is a giant congenital nevus?**\n\nA giant congenital nevus is a large birthmark that appears on a newborn's skin. It is usually present at birth and can be up to 20 cm in diameter.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nHaving a giant congenital nevus may lead to:\n\n* Depression and other emotional problems if the nevi affect appearance\n* Skin cancer (melanoma)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nThis condition is usually diagnosed at birth. Talk to your child's provider if your child has a large, pigmented area anywhere on their skin.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCongenital giant pigmented nevus; Giant hairy nevus; Giant pigmented nevus; Bathing trunk nevus; Congenital melanocytic nevus - large\n\n**Images**\n\n* Congenital nevus on the abdomen\n\n**References**\n\nDinulos JGH.

In most affected individuals, part of the iris is missing (partial aniridia) in both eyes. The irises have a characteristic uneven pattern known as \"scalloping\" at the inner (pupillary) edge. The pupils are enlarged (dilated) and are fixed, which means they do not get smaller (constrict) in response to light.\n\nThese abnormalities can cause blurry vision (reduced visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) can also occur in Gillespie syndrome.\n\nThe balance and movement problems in Gillespie syndrome result from hypoplasia of the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. This abnormality can cause hypotonia and delayed development of motor skills such as walking. Difficulty controlling the muscles of the mouth can lead to delayed speech development.\n\nPeople with Gillespie syndrome usually continue to have an unsteady pattern of walking (gait) and speech problems throughout life. Other features of the condition can include abnormalities in the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and malformations of the heart.\n\n---\n\n**Gillespie Syndrome**\n\n**What is Gillespie syndrome?**\n\nGillespie syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye abnormalities, weak muscle tone from birth (congenital hypotonia), problems with balance and coordinating movements (ataxia), and mild to moderate intellectual disability.\n\n**Eye Abnormalities**\n\nThe eye abnormalities in Gillespie syndrome include:\n\n* Underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the colored part of the eye (the iris)\n* Part of the iris is missing (partial aniridia) in both eyes\n* A characteristic uneven pattern known as \"scalloping\" at the inner (pupillary) edge of the irises\n* Enlarged (dilated) pupils that do not get smaller (constrict) in response to light\n\n**Other Features**\n\nOther features of Gillespie syndrome can include:\n\n* Abnormalities in the bones of the spine (vertebrae)\n* Malformations of the heart\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of Gillespie syndrome is unknown, with only a few dozen affected individuals described in the medical literature. It has been estimated that Gillespie syndrome accounts for about 2 percent of cases of aniridia.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGillespie syndrome is caused by mutations in the ITPR1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a channel that controls the flow of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) within cells. Four ITPR1 protein molecules join together to form the channel, and proper regulation of calcium ion concentration inside cells is important for the development and function of various tissues and organs.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nGillespie syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. In some cases, the condition occurs in an autosomal dominant pattern, where one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Gillespie Syndrome**\n\n**What is Gillespie syndrome?**\n\nGillespie syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental retardation.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nGillespie syndrome can be inherited in three different patterns:\n\n* **Autosomal Recessive**: Both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n* **Autosomal Dominant**: One copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some affected individuals inherit the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental retardation\n* Aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability\n* Aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-mental deficiency\n* Partial aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-oligophrenia\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Gillespie syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: GILLESPIE SYNDROME; GLSP\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Dentici ML, Barresi S, Nardella M, Bellacchio E, Alfieri P, Bruselles A, Pantaleoni F, Danieli A, Iarossi G, Cappa M, Bertini E, Tartaglia M, Zanni G.

    "content": "**Gingivitis**\n\n_Gum disease; Periodontal disease_\n\n**What is Gingivitis?**\n\nGingivitis is inflammation of the gums.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGingivitis is an early form of periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth. This can include the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and bone.\n\nGingivitis is due to the short-term effects of plaque deposits on your teeth. Plaque is a sticky material made up of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that builds up on the teeth both above, and below the gums. It is also a major cause of tooth decay.\n\nIf you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar (or calculus) that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. An excess of bacteria in the mouth, and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become swollen, and tender. This is called an inflammatory response, which is part of the body's natural immune response to invading organisms.\n\nThese things raise your risk for gingivitis:\n\n* Certain infections and body-wide (systemic) diseases\n* Poor dental hygiene\n* Pregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums)\n* Uncontrolled diabetes\n* Smoking\n* Misaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns)\n* Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, bismuth, and some birth control pills\n\nMany people have some amount of gingivitis. It often develops during puberty or early adulthood because of hormonal changes. It may last a long time or come back often, depending on the health of your teeth and gums.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of gingivitis include:\n\n* Bleeding gums (when brushing or flossing)\n* Bright red or reddish-purple gums\n* Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless\n* Mouth sores\n* Swollen gums\n* Shiny appearance to gums\n* Bad breath\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour dentist will examine your mouth and teeth and look for soft, swollen, reddish-purple gums.\n\nThe gums are most often painless or mildly tender when gingivitis is present.\n\nPlaque and tartar may be seen at the base of the teeth.\n\nYour dentist will use a probe to closely examine your gums to determine if you have gingivitis or periodontitis. Periodontitis is an advanced form of gingivitis that involves bone and attachment loss.\n\nMost of the time, more tests are not needed. However, dental x-rays may be done to see if the disease has spread to the supporting structures of the teeth.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation by removing dental plaque or tartar.\n\nYour dentist or dental hygienist will clean your teeth. They may use different tools to loosen and remove deposits from your teeth.\n\nCareful oral hygiene is necessary after professional teeth cleaning. Your dentist or dental hygienist will show you how to brush and floss properly.\n\nIn addition to brushing and flossing at home, your dentist may recommend:\n\n* Having professional teeth cleaning twice a year, or three to four times a year for more severe cases of gum disease\n* Using antibacterial mouth rinses or other aids\n* Getting misaligned teeth straightened\n* Replacing dental and orthodontic appliances\n* Having any other related illnesses or conditions treated\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSome people have discomfort when plaque and tartar are removed from their teeth. Bleeding and tenderness of the gums should lessen within 1 or 2 weeks after professional cleaning and with good oral care at home.\n\nWarm salt water or antibacterial rinses can reduce gum swelling. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines may also be helpful.\n\nYou must maintain good oral care throughout your life to keep gum disease from returning.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications can occur:\n\n* Gingivitis returns\n* Periodontitis\n* Infection or abscess of the gums or the jaw bones\n* Trench mouth\n* Recession\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your dentist if you have red, swollen gums, especially if you have not had a routine cleaning and exam in the last 6 months.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGood oral hygiene is the best way to prevent gingivitis.\n\nBrush your teeth at least twice a day. Floss at least once a day.\n\nYour dentist may recommend brushing and flossing after every meal and at bedtime. Ask your dentist or dental hygienist to show you how to properly brush and floss your teeth.\n\nYour dentist may suggest devices to help remove plaque deposits. These include special toothpicks, electric and manual toothbrushes, water irrigation, or other devices. You still must brush and floss your teeth.\n\nAnti-plaque or anti-tartar toothpastes or mouth rinses may also be recommended.\n\nMany dentists recommend having teeth professionally cleaned at least every 6 months.

    "content": "**Gingivostomatitis**\n\n_Gingivostomatitis is an infection of the mouth and gums that leads to swelling and sores. It may be due to a virus or bacteria._\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Gingivostomatitis is common among children.\n* It may occur after infection with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which also causes cold sores.\n* The condition may also occur after infection with a coxsackie virus.\n* It may occur in people with poor oral hygiene.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:\n\n* Bad breath\n* Fever\n* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\n* Sores on the inside of the cheeks or gums\n* Very sore mouth with no desire to eat\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will check your mouth for small ulcers. These sores are similar to mouth ulcers caused by other conditions. Cough, fever, or muscle aches may indicate other conditions.\n\nMost of the time, no special tests are needed to diagnose gingivostomatitis. However, the provider may take a swab from the sore to check for a viral or bacterial infection. This is called a culture. A biopsy may be done to rule out other types of mouth ulcers.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.\n\nThings you can do at home include:\n\n* Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your gums well to reduce the risk of getting another infection.\n* Use mouth rinses that reduce pain if your provider recommends them.\n* Rinse your mouth with salt water (1/2 tsp (3 g) salt in 1 cup (240 mL) of water) or mouthwashes with hydrogen peroxide or Xylocaine to ease discomfort.\n* Eat a healthy diet. Soft, bland (non-spicy) foods may reduce discomfort during eating.\n\nYou may need to take antibiotics.\n\nYou may need to have the infected tissue removed by the dentist (called debridement).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nGingivostomatitis infections range from mild to severe and painful. The sores often get better in 2 or 3 weeks with or without treatment. Treatment may reduce discomfort and speed healing.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nGingivostomatitis may disguise other, more serious mouth ulcers.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have mouth sores and fever or other signs of illness\n* Mouth sores get worse or do not respond to treatment within 3 weeks\n* You develop swelling in the mouth\n\n---\n\n**Gingivostomatitis**\n\n**What is Gingivostomatitis?**\n\nGingivostomatitis is a condition that affects the mouth and gums. It can be caused by infection with certain viruses, such as coxsackie virus or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which also causes cold sores.\n\n**Who is Affected by Gingivostomatitis?**\n\nGingivostomatitis is common among children. It may occur in people with poor oral hygiene.\n\n**Symptoms of Gingivostomatitis**\n\nThe symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:\n\n* Bad breath\n* Fever\n* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\n* Sores on the inside of the cheeks or gums\n* Very sore mouth with no desire to eat\n\n**Exams and Tests for Gingivostomatitis**\n\nYour health care provider will check your mouth for small ulcers. These sores are similar to mouth ulcers caused by other conditions. Cough, fever, or muscle aches may indicate other conditions.\n\nMost of the time, no special tests are needed to diagnose gingivostomatitis. However, the provider may take a swab from the sore to check for a viral or bacterial infection. This is called a culture. A biopsy may be done to rule out other types of mouth ulcers.\n\n**Treatment for Gingivostomatitis**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.\n\nThings you can do at home include:\n\n* Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your gums well to reduce the risk of getting another infection.\n* Use mouth rinses that reduce pain if your provider recommends them.\n* Rinse your mouth with salt water (1/2 tsp (3 g) salt in 1 cup (240 mL) of water) or mouthwashes with hydrogen peroxide or Xylocaine to ease discomfort.\n* Eat a healthy diet. Soft, bland (non-spicy) foods may reduce discomfort during eating.\n\nYou may need to take antibiotics. You may need to have the infected tissue removed by the dentist (called debridement).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Gingivostomatitis**\n\nGingivostomatitis infections range from mild to severe and painful.

    "content": "**Give Your Heart a Workout**\n\nBeing physically active is one of the best things you can do for your heart. Regular exercise helps reduce your risk for heart disease and adds years to your life.\n\nYou don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to see benefits. Moving your body just 30 minutes a day is enough to improve your heart health.\n\nIf you have diabetes or heart disease, talk to your healthcare provider before starting an exercise program.\n\n**The Benefits of Exercise**\n\nExercise helps your heart in several ways:\n\n*   Burns calories: This can help you lose extra pounds (kilograms) or stay at a healthy weight. Being overweight is a major risk factor for heart disease.\n*   Lowers blood pressure: Doing some type of moderate aerobic exercise, for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week, can help lower blood pressure. High blood pressure is another major risk factor for heart disease.\n*   Reduces stress: Regular exercise is a proven stress buster. Experts are not sure if stress plays a direct role in heart disease. But it may contribute to other risk factors.\n*   Lowers cholesterol: Exercise can lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level. A high LDL level is a major risk factor for heart disease.\n\n**The Best Activities for Your Heart**\n\nWhen done properly, any kind of exercise can be good for your body. But aerobic exercise is the best type for your heart. Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses the large muscles in your body and gets your heart beating faster.\n\nTo benefit your heart, experts recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise on most days with a target of 150 minutes per week. This is 2.5 hours a week. You can also break this up into a few 10- or 15-minute sessions each day. Moderate aerobic exercises include:\n\n*   Dancing\n*   Hiking on flat ground\n*   Bicycling at less than 10 mph\n*   Moderate walking (2.5 to 3.5 mph)\n*   Golf (not using a cart)\n*   Downhill skiing\n*   Tennis (doubles)\n*   Softball\n*   Swimming\n*   Gardening\n*   Light yard work\n\nFor even more heart benefits, consider adding some vigorous activity to your week. If all your exercise is vigorous, aim to get at least 75 minutes each week. Vigorous aerobic exercises include:\n\n*   Brisk walking (3.5 to 4.0 mph)\n*   Bicycling at more than 10 mph\n*   Hiking uphill\n*   Cross-country skiing\n*   Stair climbing\n*   Soccer\n*   Jogging\n*   Jumping rope\n*   Tennis (singles)\n*   Basketball\n*   Heavy yard work\n\n**Track the Intensity of Your Workout**\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the talk test is a simple way to measure relative intensity. In general, if you're doing moderate-intensity activity, you can talk but not sing during the activity. If you're doing vigorous-intensity activity, you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.\n\n**Track Your Target Heart Rate**\n\nTo see the direct effects of exercise on your heart, track your target heart rate, which is about 50% to 85% of your maximum heart rate, based on your age. This range gives your heart the most benefit.\n\nTo find your target heart rate:\n\n1.  Take a brief break from exercising to take your pulse.\n2.  Count the number of beats you feel for 10 seconds.\n3.  Multiply this number by 6 to give you the beats per minute.\n\nFind your age and target heart rate:\n\n*   20 years old -- 100 to 170 beats per minute\n*   30 years old -- 95 to 162 beats per minute\n*   35 years old -- 93 to 157 beats per minute\n*   40 years old -- 90 to 153 beats per minute\n*   45 years old -- 88 to 149 beats per minute\n*   50 years old -- 85 to 145 beats per minute\n*   55 years old -- 83 to 140 beats per minute\n*   60 years old -- 80 to 136 beats per minute\n*   65 years old -- 78 to 132 beats per minute\n*   70 years old -- 75 to 128 beats per minute\n\nTo find your approximate maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220.\n\nFor moderate intensity exercise, your target heart rate should be 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate.\n\nFor vigorous exercise, your target heart rate should be 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate.\n\nWhen you first start exercising, aim for the lower number for your age range. As you get fitter, you can slowly work towards the higher number.\n\nIf your heart rate is lower than your target heart rate, you may not be exercising hard enough to benefit your heart. If your heart rate is higher than your target, you may be exercising too hard.\n\nSome blood pressure medicines can lower your target heart rate. If you take medicine for high blood pressure, ask your provider what range is healthy for you.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf it's been a while since you were active, you should check with your provider before starting any new activity. Also, to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise, check with your provider if you have:\n\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Diabetes\n*   A heart condition\n*   Another health problem\n\n---\n\n**Give Your Heart a Workout**\n\nBeing physically active is one of the best things you can do for your heart.

This range gives your heart the most benefit.\n\nTo find your target heart rate:\n\n1.  Take a brief break from exercising to take your pulse.\n2.  To measure your pulse at the wrist, place your index and middle fingers on the inside of your opposite wrist, below the base of the thumb. To measure your pulse at the neck, place your index and middle fingers to the side of the Adam's apple.\n3.  Count the number of beats you feel for 10 seconds.\n4.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000935.htm",
    "content": "**Giving an IM (Intramuscular) Injection**\n\nSome medicines need to be given into a muscle to work correctly. An IM injection is a shot of medicine given into a muscle (intramuscular).\n\n**What You Need**\n\n* One alcohol wipe\n* One sterile 2 x 2 gauze pad\n* A new needle and syringe -- the needle needs to be long enough to get deep into the muscle\n* A cotton ball\n\n**Where to Give the Injection**\n\nWhere you give the injection is very important. The medicine needs to go into a muscle. You do not want to hit a nerve or a blood vessel. So show your health care provider how you will choose where you will put the needle, to make sure you can find a safe spot.\n\n* **Thigh**: The thigh is a good place to give an injection to yourself or a child less than 3 years old.\n\t+ Look at the thigh, and imagine it in 3 equal parts.\n\t+ Put the injection in the middle of the thigh.\n* **Hip**: The hip is a good place to give an injection to adults and children older than 7 months.\n\t+ Have the person lie on the side. Put the heel of your hand where the thigh meets the buttocks. Your thumb should point to the person's groin and your fingers point to the person's head.\n\t+ Pull your first (index) finger away from the other fingers, forming a V. You may feel the edge of a bone at the tips of your first finger.\n\t+ Put the injection in the middle of the V between your first and middle finger.\n* **Upper Arm**: You can use the upper arm muscle if you can feel the muscle there. If the person is very thin or the muscle is very small, do not use this site.\n\t+ Uncover the upper arm. This muscle forms an upside down triangle that starts at the bone going across the upper arm.\n\t+ The point of the triangle is at the level of the armpit.\n\t+ Put the injection in the center of the triangle of the muscle. This should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) below that bone.\n* **Buttocks**: DO NOT use this site for a child under 3 years old, because there is not enough muscle here yet. Measure this site carefully, because an injection given in the wrong place could hit a nerve or blood vessel.\n\t+ Uncover one buttock. Imagine a line from the bottom of the buttocks to the top of the hip bone. Imagine another line from the top of the crack of the buttock to the side of the hip. These two lines form a box divided into 4 parts.\n\t+ Put the injection in the upper outer part of the buttocks, below the curved bone.\n\n**How to Give the IM Injection**\n\nTo give an IM injection:\n\n1. Make sure you have the right amount of the right medicine in the syringe.\n2. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Dry them.\n3. Carefully find the spot where you will give the injection.\n4. Clean the skin at that spot with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry.\n5. Take the cap off the needle.\n6. Hold the muscle around the spot with your thumb and index finger.\n7. With a quick firm thrust, put the needle into the muscle straight up and down, at a 90 degree angle.\n8. Push the medicine into the muscle.\n9. Pull the needle straight out.\n10. Press the spot with the cotton ball.\n\nIf you have to give more than one injection, DO NOT put it in the same spot. Use the other side of the body or another site.\n\n**How to Get Rid of Used Syringes and Needles**\n\n* DO NOT put the cap back on the needle. Put the syringe in the sharps container right away.\n* It is not safe to put needles or syringes into the trash. If you do not get a hard plastic container for used syringes and needles, you may use a milk jug or coffee can with a lid. The opening has to fit the syringe, and the container needs to be strong enough so a needle cannot break through. Ask your provider or pharmacist how to get rid of this container safely.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if:\n\n* After getting the injection the person:\n\t+ Gets a rash.\n\t+ Feels very itchy.\n\t+ Has trouble breathing (shortness of breath).\n\t+ Has swelling of the mouth, lips, or face.\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have questions about how to give the injection.\n* After getting the injection, the person gets a fever or gets sick.\n* A lump, bruise, or swelling at the injection site does not go away.\n\n---\n\n**Giving an IM (Intramuscular) Injection**\n\n**What You Need**\n\n* One alcohol wipe\n* One sterile 2 x 2 gauze pad\n* A new needle and syringe -- the needle needs to be long enough to get deep into the muscle\n* A cotton ball\n\n**Where to Give the Injection**\n\nThe thigh is a good place to give an injection to yourself or a child less than 3 years old.

Imagine a line from the bottom of the buttocks to the top of the hip bone. Imagine another line from the top of the crack of the buttock to the side of the hip. These two lines form a box divided into 4 parts. Put the injection in the upper outer part of the buttocks, below the curved bone.\n\n**How to Give the IM Injection**\n\nTo give an IM injection:\n\n1. Make sure you have the right amount of the right medicine in the syringe.\n2. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Dry them.\n3. Carefully find the spot where you will give the injection.\n4. Clean the skin at that spot with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry.\n5. Take the cap off the needle.\n6. Hold the muscle around the spot with your thumb and index finger.\n7. With a quick firm thrust, put the needle into the muscle straight up and down, at a 90 degree angle.\n8. Push the medicine into the muscle.\n9. Pull the needle straight out.\n10. Press the spot with the cotton ball.\n\nIf you have to give more than one injection, DO NOT put it in the same spot. Use the other side of the body or another site.\n\n---\n\n**Giving an IM (intramuscular) injection**\n\nIf you have to give more than one injection, **DO NOT put it in the same spot. Use the other side of the body or another site.**\n\n**How to Give the IM Injection**\n\nTo give an IM injection:\n\n1. Make sure you have the right amount of the right medicine in the syringe.\n2.

Put the syringe in the sharps container right away.**\n2. It is not safe to put needles or syringes into the trash. If you do not get a hard plastic container for used syringes and needles, you may use a milk jug or coffee can with a lid. The opening has to fit the syringe, and the container needs to be strong enough so a needle cannot break through. Ask your provider or pharmacist how to get rid of this container safely.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if:\n\n* After getting the injection the person:\n\t+ Gets a rash.\n\t+ Feels very itchy.\n\t+ Has trouble breathing (shortness of breath).\n\t+ Has swelling of the mouth, lips, or face.\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have questions about how to give the injection.\n* After getting the injection, the person gets a fever or gets sick.\n* A lump, bruise, or swelling at the injection site does not go away.",

    "content": "**Giving an Insulin Injection**\n\nTo give an insulin injection, you need to fill the right syringe with the right amount of insulin, decide where to give the injection, and know how to give the injection.\n\n**Getting Ready**\n\nKnow the name and dose of each medicine to give. The type of insulin should match the type of syringe:\n\n* Standard insulin contains 100 units in 1 milliliter (mL). This is also called U-100 insulin.\n* More concentrated insulins are available, such as U-500 and U-300.\n\n**Filling the Syringe - one Type of Insulin**\n\nTo fill a syringe with one type of insulin:\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n2. Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin. Make sure it is not expired.\n3. The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n4. Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. Do not shake the bottle.\n5. Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.\n6. Take off any plastic cover on the vial. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Do not blow on it.\n7. Know the dose of insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile.\n8. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.\n9. Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.\n10. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.\n11. With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.\n12. Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand.\n\n**Filling the Syringe - two Types of Insulin**\n\nTo fill a syringe with two types of insulin:\n\n1. Never mix two types of insulin in one syringe unless you are told to do this.\n2. Your doctor will tell you how much of each insulin you will need. Add these two numbers together. This is the amount of insulin you should have in the syringe before injecting it.\n3. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n4. Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin.\n5. The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n6.

Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile.\n10. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of the longer-acting insulin.\n11. Put the needle into the rubber top of that insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle. Remove the needle from the bottle.\n12. Repeat steps 10 and 11 for the short-acting insulin.\n\n**Giving the Injection**\n\nChoose where to give the injection. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you do not inject the insulin in the same place all the time. Ask your provider or CDCES for a chart.\n\n* Keep your shots 1 inch (2.5 centimeters, cm) away from scars and 2 inches (5 cm) away from your navel.\n* Do not put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender.\n* Do not put a shot in a spot that is lumpy, firm, or numb.\n\nThe site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. Do not use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.\n\nPinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45º angle. Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until it is all in. Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting. Pull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down. There is no need to recap it.\n\n---\n\n**Giving an Insulin Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Getting Ready**\n\nKnow the name and dose of each medicine to give.

Keep a chart of places you've used, so you don't inject in the same place all the time. Ask your provider or CDCES for a chart.\n\n*   **Avoid certain areas**: Keep your shots 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from scars and 2 inches (5 cm) away from your navel.\n*   **Check for bruising, swelling, or tenderness**: Don't put a shot in a spot that's visibly dirty, swollen, or tender.\n*   **Be aware of lumpy, firm, or numb areas**: If you have lumps, firmness, or numbness under the skin, it may be a sign that insulin isn't working correctly. In this case, consult your provider.\n\nBefore injecting, ensure the site is clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. Do not use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.\n\n**The Injection Process**\n\n1.  **Pinch the skin**: Pinch the skin to create a small fold.\n2.  **Insert the needle**: Insert the needle at a 45º angle, making sure it goes into the fat layer under the skin.\n3.  **Inject slowly and steadily**: Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until all of it is in.\n4.  **Leave the syringe in place**: Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting.\n\n**After the Injection**\n\n1.  **Pull out the needle**: Pull the needle out at the same angle it went in.\n2.  **Dispose of the syringe**: Place the needle and syringe in a safe hard container, close it, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.\n\nIf you're injecting more than 50 to 90 units of insulin in one injection, your provider may advise splitting the doses or using different sites for the same injection. This is because bigger volumes of insulin may get weakened without being absorbed. Your provider may also discuss switching to a more concentrated type of insulin with you.",

    "content": "**Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**\n\n**What is Glanzmann thrombasthenia?**\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a bleeding disorder characterized by prolonged or spontaneous bleeding starting from birth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with Glanzmann thrombasthenia tend to bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds (epistaxis), and may bleed from the gums. They may also develop red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding underneath the skin (petechiae) or swelling caused by bleeding within tissues (hematoma). Glanzmann thrombasthenia can also cause prolonged bleeding following injury, trauma, or surgery (including dental work). Women with this condition can have prolonged and sometimes abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. Affected women also have an increased risk of excessive blood loss during pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nAbout a quarter of individuals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia have bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which often occurs later in life. Rarely, affected individuals have bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) or joints (hemarthrosis).\n\n**Variability**\n\nThe severity and frequency of the bleeding episodes in Glanzmann thrombasthenia can vary greatly among affected individuals, even in the same family. Spontaneous bleeding tends to become less frequent with age.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is estimated to affect 1 in one million individuals worldwide, but may be more common in certain groups, including those of Romani ethnicity, particularly people within the French Manouche community.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ITGA2B or ITGB3 gene cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia. These genes provide instructions for making the two parts (subunits) of a receptor protein called integrin alphaIIb/beta3 (αIIbβ3). This protein is abundant on the surface of platelets. Platelets are small cells that circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. During clot formation, integrin αIIbβ3 helps platelets bind together. Blood clots protect the body after injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.\n\nITGA2B or ITGB3 gene mutations result in a shortage (deficiency) of functional integrin αIIbβ3.\n\n---\n\n**Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**\n\n**What is Glanzmann thrombasthenia?**\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. It is caused by mutations in the ITGA2B or ITGB3 gene, which provides instructions for making the integrin αIIbβ3 protein on the surface of platelets.\n\n**How does it affect the body?**\n\nIn people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, platelets cannot clump together to form a blood clot, leading to prolonged bleeding. This is because the integrin αIIbβ3 protein is either deficient or nonfunctional.\n\n**Types of Glanzmann thrombasthenia**\n\nThree types of Glanzmann thrombasthenia have been classified according to the amount of integrin αIIbβ3 that is available:\n\n* Type I: less than 5 percent of normal integrin αIIbβ3 levels\n* Type II: between 5 and 20 percent of normal integrin αIIbβ3 levels\n* Variant type: adequate integrin αIIbβ3 levels but produce only nonfunctional integrin\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other names for this condition**\n\n* Deficiency of glycoprotein complex IIb-IIIa\n* Deficiency of platelet fibrinogen receptor\n* Glanzmann disease\n* Glanzmann-Naegeli disorder\n* Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa defect\n* Hereditary hemorrhagic thrombasthenia\n* Hereditary thrombasthenia\n* Platelet fibrinogen receptor deficiency\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nFor more information, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Glanzmann thrombasthenia\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Glanzmann thrombasthenia\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: GLANZMANN THROMBASTHENIA 1; GT1\n\n---\n\n**Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n**Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**\n\n* **Definition**: A rare bleeding disorder characterized by impaired platelet aggregation and clot formation.\n* **Causes**: Mutations in the ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes, which code for the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin receptor on platelets.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* GLANZMANN THROMBASTHENIA 1; GT1\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Nurden AT, Fiore M, Nurden P, Pillois X.

    "content": "**Glaucoma Tests**\n\n**What are Glaucoma Tests?**\n\nGlaucoma tests are eye tests that help diagnose glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can damage a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. This nerve connects your eyes to your brain, allowing you to see. Damage to the optic nerve can cause vision loss and blindness.\n\n**What Causes Glaucoma?**\n\nResearchers aren't sure exactly what causes the most common types of glaucoma. But having high fluid pressure in one or both eyes increases your risk for the disease. Your eyes are always making fluid that nourishes the tissues inside the eye. The fluid leaves your eyes through a drainage system with openings in the space where your iris (the colored part of your eyes) and your cornea (the clear front layer of your eyes) meet.\n\n**Types of Glaucoma**\n\nThere are several types of glaucoma. The main types are:\n\n* **Open-angle glaucoma**, also called primary open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type.\n* **Closed-angle glaucoma**, also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma.\n\n**Why Do I Need Glaucoma Testing?**\n\nAnyone can get glaucoma. To protect your vision, it's essential to be tested for glaucoma before symptoms start. When to start testing and how often to get tested will depend on your risk for glaucoma.\n\nYour risk for glaucoma may be high if you:\n\n* Are over age 60.\n* Are an African American over age 40.\n* Are an Asian American.\n* Have a family history of glaucoma.\n* Have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n**What Happens During a Glaucoma Test?**\n\nGlaucoma tests are done as part of a comprehensive (complete) eye exam. A complete eye exam checks both your vision and your eye health. These exams can be done by:\n\n* An ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specializes in preventing, diagnosing, and treating all types of eye disease.\n* An optometrist, a healthcare professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating vision problems and certain eye disorders.\n\nGlaucoma tests check different parts of your eyes and vision, including:\n\n* Your eye pressure using tonometry tests.\n* The thickness of your corneas using pachymetry test.\n* Your optic nerves using dilated eye exam (ophthalmoscopy).\n* Your peripheral (side) vision using visual field test (perimetry).\n* The canals where fluid drains out of your eyes using gonioscopy.\n\nSome eye care specialists may use other tests to check for glaucoma, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma Tests**\n\n\\n\\nIf you wear glasses or contact lenses, bring them with you. Bring sunglasses to wear after your exam in case your eyes are sensitive to light. Also, plan to have someone take you home because your vision may be blurry.\n\n**Are there any risks to the tests?**\n\nThere is no risk to having glaucoma testing. Some of the tests may feel a bit uncomfortable. If your eyes were dilated, you may have blurry vision and be light sensitivity for a few hours.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your test results aren't normal, you may have glaucoma or a high risk for developing glaucoma.\n\nIf your eye care specialist diagnoses glaucoma, your treatment will depend on the type of condition you have. Treatment won't cure the disease or restore any vision you have already lost. But it can prevent more vision loss. Your eye care specialist may recommend one or more treatments, such as:\n\n*   Medicines to lower eye pressure or reduce the amount of fluid your eye makes.\n*   Eye surgery or laser therapy to improve fluid drainage from the eye.\n\nIf an optometrist examined your eyes, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist for more testing and/or treatment.\n\nYou will probably have more glaucoma testing to see if the treatment is helping. Ask your eye care specialist to explain your test results and be sure to find out how often you should have your eyes checked.\n\n**What are glaucoma tests?**\n\nGlaucoma tests are eye tests that help diagnose glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can damage a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. This nerve connects your eyes to your brain, allowing you to see. Damage to the optic nerve can cause vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma tests can help find the disease before you know you have it, so you can start treatment to protect your eyes against serious vision loss.\n\n**Researchers aren't sure exactly what causes the most common types of glaucoma. But having high fluid pressure in one or both eyes increases your risk for the disease.**\n\nYour eyes are always making fluid that nourishes the tissues inside the eye. The fluid leaves your eyes through a drainage system with openings in the space where your iris (the colored part of your eyes) and your cornea (the clear front layer of your eyes) meet.\n\nThe pressure inside of each eyes stays in a healthy range when there's a balance between how much fluid your eye makes and how much drains out of your eye. If the drainage system becomes clogged or blocked, fluid can't drain at a normal rate. If your eye makes new fluid faster than it can drain, the fluid backs up, which increases the pressure in your eye. The high pressure may damage the optic nerve and lead to serious vision problems.\n\n**There are several types of glaucoma. The main types are:**\n\n*   Open-angle glaucoma, also called primary open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type. It's called \"open\" because the canals that lead to your eye's drainage system are open. But deeper inside the drainage system, clogs develop. These clogs slow the fluid drainage.\n*   Closed-angle glaucoma, also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma. In this uncommon type of glaucoma, the canals that drain fluid from your eye are \"closed\" because your iris covers them.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nGlaucoma tests are used to screen for and diagnose glaucoma. If glaucoma is diagnosed early, treatment may help slow or prevent vision loss.\n\n**Why do I need glaucoma testing?**\n\nAnyone can get glaucoma. To protect your vision, it's important to be tested for glaucoma before symptoms start. When to start testing and how often to get tested will depend on your risk for glaucoma.\n\nYour risk for glaucoma may be high if you:\n\n*   Are over age 60. Glaucoma is much more common in older people. The risk is especially high if you are an older Hispanic/Latino American.\n*   Are an African American over age 40. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans.\n*   Are an Asian American. Asian Americans have a higher risk for getting a type of open-angle glaucoma called normal-pressure or normal-tension glaucoma. With this condition, optic nerve damage begins when eye pressure is normal or a little higher than normal. But treatments that lower eye pressure often help.\n*   Have a family history of glaucoma. You can inherit certain types of glaucoma from your parents.\n*   Have certain medical conditions. They include diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nIf your risk of glaucoma is high, ask your health care provider or eye care specialist when you should start getting tested and how often you need to have your eyes checked. Getting an eye exam with glaucoma testing by age 40 can help catch glaucoma and other eye diseases early.\n\n**What are the symptoms of acute closed-angle glaucoma?**\n\nSymptoms may start suddenly and be severe. They include:\n\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Severe eye pain\n*   Red eyes\n*   Colored halos around lights\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Headache\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma Tests**\n\nIf you have glaucoma, you may need regular testing to monitor your condition and check whether your treatment is working.\n\n**Who Should Get Tested?**\n\nAnyone can get glaucoma. To protect your vision, it's important to be tested for glaucoma before symptoms start. When to start testing and how often to get tested will depend on your risk for glaucoma.\n\nYour risk for glaucoma may be high if you:\n\n* Are over 60 years old\n* Have a family history of glaucoma\n* Are nearsighted or have other eye problems\n\nIf your risk of glaucoma is high, ask your health care provider or eye care specialist when you should start getting tested and how often you need to have your eyes checked.\n\n**What Happens During a Glaucoma Test?**\n\nGlaucoma tests are done as part of a comprehensive (complete) eye exam. A complete eye exam checks both your vision and your eye health. These exams can be done by:\n\n* An ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specializes in preventing, diagnosing, and treating all types of eye disease, including doing eye surgery.\n* An optometrist, a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating vision problems and certain eye disorders.\n\nIf you're unsure which type of eye specialist should check you for glaucoma, talk with your provider.\n\nGlaucoma tests check different parts of your eyes and vision, including:\n\n* Your eye pressure. There are a few ways to measure eye pressure using tonometry tests:\n\t+ Air-puff test\n\t+ Applanation tonometry\n\t+ Handheld device against your eye\n* The thickness of your corneas\n* Your optic nerves\n* Your peripheral (side) vision\n* The canals where fluid drains out of your eyes\n\nSome eye care specialists may use other tests to check for glaucoma, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for a Glaucoma Test?**\n\nIf you wear glasses or contact lenses, bring them with you. Bring sunglasses to wear after your exam in case your eyes are sensitive to light. Also, plan to have someone take you home because your vision may be blurry.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Tests?**\n\nThere is no risk to having glaucoma testing. Some of the tests may feel a bit uncomfortable. If your eyes were dilated, you may have blurry vision and be light sensitivity for a few hours.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your test results aren't normal, you may have glaucoma or a high risk for developing glaucoma.\n\nIf your eye care specialist diagnoses glaucoma, your treatment will depend on the type of condition you have.

Ask your eye care specialist to explain your test results and be sure to find out how often you should have your eyes checked.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma Tests**\n\nAre you concerned about glaucoma? Do you want to know more about the tests involved in diagnosing this condition? Look no further! In this article, we will delve into the world of glaucoma tests and provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what to expect.\n\n**Understanding Glaucoma**\n\nBefore we dive into the tests, it's essential to understand what glaucoma is. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, where the pressure in the eye increases due to a buildup of fluid.\n\n**The Importance of Early Detection**\n\nEarly detection and treatment are crucial in preventing vision loss due to glaucoma. That's why regular eye exams are essential, especially if you're over 40 or have a family history of glaucoma.\n\n**Common Glaucoma Tests**\n\nHere are some common tests used to diagnose glaucoma:\n\n*   **Tonometry**: This test measures the pressure inside your eye.\n*   **Gonioscopy**: This test examines the angle between your cornea and iris to detect any abnormalities.\n*   **Visual Field Test**: This test checks for blind spots or missing areas in your visual field.\n\n**What to Expect During a Glaucoma Test**\n\nDuring a glaucoma test, you can expect the following:\n\n1.  **Eye Examination**: Your eye doctor will perform a thorough examination of your eyes, including tonometry and gonioscopy.\n2.  **Visual Field Test**: You'll be asked to look at a screen or chart and identify any blind spots or missing areas in your visual field.\n3.  **Dilating Eye Drops**: In some cases, you may be given dilating eye drops to widen your pupils and allow for a more accurate examination.\n\n**What to Do After the Test**\n\nAfter the test, your eye doctor will discuss the results with you and explain any next steps. If you're diagnosed with glaucoma, your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan to prevent vision loss.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGlaucoma tests are an essential part of maintaining good eye health. By understanding what to expect during these tests, you can feel more confident and prepared. Remember, early detection and treatment are key to preventing vision loss due to glaucoma.",

    "content": "**Glaucoma**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the optic nerve of one, or both, of your eyes. This can result in vision loss. There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common type is open-angle glaucoma. Other less common types include angle-closure glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma.\n\n**What causes glaucoma?**\n\nMedical experts aren't sure what causes glaucoma, but the most common types usually happen when the fluid pressure inside your eye slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Other types of glaucoma may be caused by medical conditions, or a baby may be born with it.\n\n**Not everyone with high eye pressure develops glaucoma**\n\nSome people may even get glaucoma with normal eye pressure. The amount of pressure your optic nerve can handle is different for each person. Getting regular dilated eye exams helps your provider figure out what level of eye pressure is normal for you.\n\n**What are the symptoms of glaucoma?**\n\nOften there are no symptoms of glaucoma at first. Or symptoms may start so slowly that you may not notice them. Without treatment, you slowly lose your peripheral (side) vision. It may seem like you're looking through a tunnel. Over time, your straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.\n\nIf you have sudden symptoms of intense eye pain, blurry vision, red eyes, or an upset stomach (nausea), you need to go to your eye care provider or an emergency room right away. These could be symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma. This less common type of glaucoma causes fluid to build up quickly in your eye.\n\n**How is glaucoma diagnosed?**\n\nA comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. This would include:\n\n*   A dilated eye exam. This involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter your eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye to check for glaucoma or other eye problems. For a few hours after the exam your vision may be blurry and sensitive to light, so you will need someone to take you home.\n*   Visual field testing. This check of your peripheral (side) vision allows your eye care provider to find out how well you can see objects off to the side of your vision without moving your eyes.\n*   Tonometry. This measures the pressure inside your eye.\n\nIf you're at higher risk for glaucoma, you should get comprehensive eye exams every one to two years. You're at higher risk if you:\n\nAre Black or African American and over age 40\nAre over age 60, especially if you're Hispanic or Latino\nHave a family history of glaucoma\n\nYou're also at higher risk if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Talk with your provider about your risk and how often you should get your eyes checked.\n\n**What are the treatments for glaucoma?**\n\nEarly treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Without treatment it can eventually cause blindness. Treatments can include:\n\n*   Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment to lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve.\n*   Other treatments may include oral medicines, laser treatment, and/or surgery.\n\nA combination of these treatments may be used to lower eye pressure and help drain the fluid out of your eye.\n\n**Can glaucoma be prevented?**\n\nThere is no way to prevent glaucoma. Eye exams can help find glaucoma or other eye problems before they can affect your vision. If you have glaucoma, be sure to continue with treatment to prevent your vision from getting worse.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Glaucoma?**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the optic nerve of one, or both, of your eyes.

    "content": "**Glaucoma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Glaucoma?**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.\n\nMost often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGlaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: The increase in pressure happens slowly over time.\n*   **Angle-closure glaucoma**, also called closed-angle glaucoma: The increase is often high and sudden.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: It often runs in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include medicines such as corticosteroids, eye diseases, such as uveitis (an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye), diseases such as diabetes, and eye injury.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: Most people have no symptoms. Once you are aware of vision loss, the damage is already severe. Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision) is the main type of vision loss.\n*   **Angle-closure glaucoma**: Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice sudden, severe pain in one eye, decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision, nausea and vomiting, rainbow-like halos around lights, red eye, and eye feels swollen.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. Cloudiness of the front of the eye, enlargement of one eye or both eyes, red eye, sensitivity to light, and tearing.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve.\n\nEye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you may need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include:\n\n*   Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy).\n*   Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging).\n*   Laser scanning images of the angle of the eye.\n*   Checking your retina -- The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye.\n*   Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response).\n*   3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination).\n*   Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity).\n*   Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops or receive laser glaucoma treatment.\n*   **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. You may be given eye drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your eye doctor's directions.\n*   **Closed-angle glaucoma**: Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. There is uncertainty about the best way to screen for open-angle glaucoma. But you can help prevent vision loss.\n\nA complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your health care provider.\n\nIf you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve, leading to blindness. The most common cause of optic nerve damage is increased pressure in the eye, also known as intraocular pressure.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are four major types of glaucoma:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: This is the most common type of glaucoma. The increase in pressure happens slowly over time and cannot be felt.\n*   **Angle-closure glaucoma**, also called closed-angle glaucoma: This occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye, causing a quick, severe rise in eye pressure.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs in babies and is caused by an abnormal development of the eye.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma is caused by a known underlying problem, such as eye diseases or injuries.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: Most people have no symptoms until vision loss occurs. Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision is the main type of vision loss.\n*   **Angle-closure glaucoma**: Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse.

The following tests may be performed:\n\n*   Tonometry: A test to check your eye pressure.\n*   Gonioscopy: A special lens to look at the angle of the eye.\n*   Optic nerve imaging: Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye.\n*   Laser scanning images of the angle of the eye.\n*   Retinal examination: Checking the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye.\n*   Pupillary reflex response: Checking how your pupil responds to light.\n*   Slit lamp examination: A 3-D view of your eye.\n*   Visual acuity: Testing the clearness of your vision.\n*   Visual field measurement: Testing your field of vision.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: You will probably be given eye drops or receive laser glaucoma treatment. If drops alone or laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery.\n*   **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. You may be given eye drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOpen-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your eye doctor's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma: Understanding the Condition**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. The most common cause of blindness in the United States, glaucoma affects millions of people worldwide.\n\n**Causes of Glaucoma**\n\nThere are four major types of glaucoma:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: The most common type, characterized by a slow increase in eye pressure over time.\n*   **Angle-closure glaucoma**, also called **closed-angle glaucoma**: A sudden and severe rise in eye pressure, often triggered by dilating eye drops or certain medicines.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: Present at birth, caused by an abnormal development of the eye.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: Caused by a known underlying condition, such as eye diseases, diabetes, or eye injury.\n\n**Understanding Eye Pressure**\n\nThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid flows out of the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. Anything that slows or blocks this flow can cause pressure to build up in the eye.\n\nIn open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. Either type can damage the optic nerve, leading to blind spots in vision.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nOpen-angle glaucoma tends to run in families, with a higher risk if you have a parent or grandparent with the condition. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.\n\nClosed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This can be triggered by dilating eye drops or certain medicines.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nWhile open-angle glaucoma cannot be prevented, regular eye exams can help detect it early, making treatment easier. All adults should have a complete eye exam by age 40, with more frequent exams if you're at risk for glaucoma.\n\nIf you experience severe eye pain or sudden vision loss, seek immediate medical attention, as these may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. Your eye doctor may recommend treatment to prevent eye damage and vision loss in cases of closed-angle glaucoma.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\n**What is Glaucoma?**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. It is one of the most common causes of blindness in the United States.\n\n**Types of Glaucoma**\n\nThere are four major types of glaucoma:\n\n*   **Open-angle glaucoma**: This is the most common type of glaucoma, where the fluid in the eye does not flow out properly, causing pressure to build up.\n*   **Closed-angle glaucoma**: This occurs when the fluid in the eye is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out, causing a quick rise in eye pressure.\n*   **Congenital glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs in babies and is caused by improper development of the eye.\n*   **Secondary glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma is caused by another underlying condition or disease.\n\n**Causes of Glaucoma**\n\nGlaucoma can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n*   **Eye diseases**, such as uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye)\n*   **Diseases**, such as diabetes\n*   **Eye injury**\n*   **Congenital glaucoma** (present at birth)\n\n**Symptoms of Glaucoma**\n\nThe symptoms of glaucoma can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision** in open-angle glaucoma\n*   **Sudden, severe pain in one eye**, decreased or cloudy vision, nausea and vomiting, rainbow-like halos around lights, red eye, and swollen eye in angle-closure glaucoma\n*   **Cloudiness of the front of the eye**, enlargement of one eye or both eyes, red eye, sensitivity to light, and tearing in congenital glaucoma\n\n**Diagnosing Glaucoma**\n\nThe only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. This may include:\n\n*   **Tonometry**: a test to check eye pressure\n*   **Gonioscopy**: using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye\n*   **Optic nerve imaging**: photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of the eye\n*   **Retinal examination**: checking the retina for any signs of damage\n\n**Treatment of Glaucoma**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce eye pressure and prevent further damage. Treatment may include:\n\n*   **Eye drops**: to lower eye pressure\n*   **Laser glaucoma treatment**: to open channels where fluid flows out\n*   **Pills**: to lower eye pressure\n*   **Surgery**: in some cases, surgery may be necessary to create a new channel for fluid to escape\n\n**Preventing Glaucoma**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent glaucoma, certain steps can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\n*   **Regular eye exams**: getting regular eye exams can help detect any potential problems early on\n*   **Maintaining good eye health**: taking care of overall eye health through proper diet, exercise, and avoiding eye strain can also help reduce the risk of glaucoma\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.\n\n**Open-angle Glaucoma**\n\nIf you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops or receive laser glaucoma treatment. You may need more than one type of eye drop. Most people can be treated with eye drops. Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye.\n\nIf drops alone or laser treatment do not work, you may need other treatment:\n\n* If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. Your eye doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your eye pressure.\n* Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery.\n\n**Acute Angle Glaucoma**\n\nAn acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated.\n\nYou may be given eye drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The eye doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack.\n\nTo help prevent an attack in the other eye, the same procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack.\n\n**Congenital Glaucoma**\n\nCongenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain.\n\n**Secondary Glaucoma**\n\nIf you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOpen-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your eye doctor's directions.\n\nClosed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision.\n\nBabies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early.\n\nHow you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. There is uncertainty about the best way to screen for open-angle glaucoma. But you can help prevent vision loss.\n\nA complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat.\n\nAll adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40.\n\nIf you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40.\n\nYou should have regular eye exams as recommended by your health care provider.\n\nIf you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss.\n\n---\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Treat Glaucoma**\n\nAccording to Tai TYT, Dienderedjian L, and Piltz-Seymour JR, the decision to treat glaucoma should be based on the patient's visual potential and the risk of treatment. In their chapter \"When to treat glaucoma\" in Yanoff M and Duker JS's book Ophthalmology, they emphasize that treatment should not be delayed unnecessarily, as this can lead to vision loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Screening for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for primary open-angle glaucoma in adults aged 60 and older. This recommendation is based on a review of the evidence, which found that early detection and treatment can prevent vision loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Suspect Preferred Practice Pattern**\n\nGedde SJ, Lind JT, Wright MM, et al. developed the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern for primary open-angle glaucoma suspects. This pattern provides guidelines for the diagnosis and management of glaucoma suspects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Evidence-Based Medicine in Glaucoma**\n\nJampel HD and Mahjoub H discuss evidence-based medicine in glaucoma in their chapter \"Evidence-based medicine in glaucoma\" in Yanoff M and Duker JS's book Ophthalmology. They emphasize the importance of using high-quality evidence to inform treatment decisions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Current Medical Management of Glaucoma**\n\nMcMillan BD and Gross RL provide an overview of the current medical management of glaucoma in their chapter \"Current medical management of glaucoma\" in Yanoff M and Duker JS's book Ophthalmology. They discuss various treatment options, including medications and surgical interventions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review Date**\n\nThis article was last reviewed on July 9, 2024.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Glaucoma",

    "content": "**Gleason Grading System**\n\nThe Gleason grading system is used to determine how abnormal your prostate cancer cells look and how likely the cancer is to advance and spread.\n\n**What is the Gleason Score?**\n\nWhen looking at cells under the microscope, the doctor (pathologist) assigns a number (or grade) to the prostate cancer cells from 1 to 5. This grade is based on how abnormal the cells appear. Grade 1 means that the cells look almost like normal prostate cells. Grade 5 means that the cells look very different from normal prostate cells.\n\n**How is the Gleason Score Determined?**\n\nMost prostate cancers contain cells that are different grades. So, the two most common grades are used to determine the Gleason score by adding them together. For example, if the most common grade of the cells in a tissue sample is 3 and it's followed by 4, the Gleason score would be 7.\n\n**What Do the Numbers Mean?**\n\nHigher numbers indicate a faster growing cancer that is more likely to spread. Currently, the lowest score assigned to a tumor is grade 3. Grades below 3 show normal to near normal cells. Most cancers have a Gleason score of 6 (Gleason scores of 3+3) or 7 (Gleason scores of 3+4 or 4+3).\n\n**The 5 Grade Group System**\n\nA 5 grade group system was created to provide a better way to describe how a cancer will behave and respond to treatment. The groups are:\n\n*   **Grade group 1:** Gleason score 6 or lower (low-grade cancer)\n*   **Grade group 2:** Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (medium-grade cancer)\n*   **Grade group 3:** Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (medium-grade cancer)\n*   **Grade group 4:** Gleason score 8 (high-grade cancer)\n*   **Grade group 5:** Gleason score 9 to 10 (high-grade cancer)\n\n**What Does Grading Mean for Treatment?**\n\nGrading helps you and your health care provider determine your treatment options, along with:\n\n*   Stage of the cancer, which shows how much the cancer has spread\n*   PSA test result\n*   Your overall health\n*   Your desire to have surgery, radiation, or hormone medicines, or no treatment at all\n\n---\n\n**Gleason Grading System**\n\nThe Gleason grading system refers to how abnormal your prostate cancer cells look and how likely the cancer is to advance and spread. A lower Gleason grade means that the cancer is slower growing and is less aggressive.\n\n**Determining the Gleason Score**\n\nTo determine the Gleason score, a doctor (pathologist) assigns a number (or grade) to the prostate cancer cells from 1 to 5 based on how abnormal they appear. Grade 1 means that the cells look almost like normal prostate cells, while Grade 5 means that the cells look very different from normal prostate cells.\n\nMost prostate cancers contain cells that are different grades, so the two most common grades are used. The Gleason score is determined by adding these two grades. For example, if the most common grade of the cells in a tissue sample is Grade 3, followed by Grade 4, the Gleason score would be 7.\n\n**Gleason Score**\n\nHigher numbers indicate a faster growing cancer that is more likely to spread. Currently, the lowest score assigned to a tumor is Grade 3. Grades below 3 show normal to near normal cells. Most cancers have a Gleason score of 6 (Gleason scores of 3+3) or 7 (Gleason scores of 3+4 or 4+3).\n\n**5 Grade Group System**\n\nA 5 Grade Group System was created to have a better way to describe how a cancer will behave and respond to treatment.

A higher group means that more of the cancer cells look different from normal cells, and it is more likely that the tumor will spread aggressively.\n\n**Grading Helps Determine Treatment Options**\n\nGrading helps you and your health care provider determine your treatment options, along with:\n\n*   Stage of the cancer, which shows how much the cancer has spread\n*   PSA test result\n*   Your overall health\n*   Your desire to have surgery, radiation, or hormone medicines, or no treatment at all\n\n---\n\n**Gleason Grading System**\n\nThe Gleason grading system is a way to determine how aggressive prostate cancer is. The higher the group, the more likely it is that the tumor will spread aggressively.\n\n**Determining Treatment Options**\n\nGrading helps you and your healthcare provider determine your treatment options, including:\n\n*   Alternative Names: Prostate cancer - Gleason; Adenocarcinoma prostate - Gleason; Gleason grade; Gleason score; Gleason group; Prostate cancer - 5 grade group\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bostwick DG, Cheng L.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou may already be infected with hepatitis B (a virus that infects the liver and may cause severe liver damage) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, taking the combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious or life-threatening and you will develop symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have or ever had a hepatitis B virus infection. Your doctor will order a blood test to see if you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of hepatitis B infection during and for several months after your treatment. If necessary, your doctor may give you medication to treat this infection before and during your treatment with the combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your treatment, call your doctor immediately: excessive tiredness, yellowing of the skin or eyes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, pale stools, pain in upper right side of the stomach area, or dark urine.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake glecaprevir and pibrentasvir exactly as directed.

Do not mix the pellets with liquid or foods that may slide off the spoon to prevent the medicine from dissolving too fast. Give the entire mixture within 15 minutes of sprinkling the pellets on food. If pellets stick to the bowl or cup, add a small amount of soft food and swallow the rest of the mixture.\n\n**Important: Do Not Chew or Dissolve Pellets**\n\nTo avoid a bitter aftertaste, do not chew or dissolve the pellets in the food.\n\n**Continue Taking Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir Even If You Feel Well**\n\nThe length of your treatment depends on your condition, if you have previously taken certain HCV medications, how well you respond to the medication, and whether you experience serious side effects.

    "content": "**Glimepiride**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGlimepiride is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Glimepiride lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Glimepiride is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).\n\nOver time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGlimepiride comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. To help you remember to take glimepiride, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take glimepiride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of glimepiride and gradually increase your dose if needed. After you have taken glimepiride for some time, glimepiride may not control your blood sugar as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medication as needed so that the medication will work best for you. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and if your blood sugar test results have been higher or lower than normal at any time during your treatment.\n\nGlimepiride helps control blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to take glimepiride even if you feel well. Do not stop taking glimepiride without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Glimepiride: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **How to Take Glimepiride**\n    *   Take glimepiride exactly as directed by your doctor.\n    *   Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of glimepiride and gradually increase your dose if needed.\n    *   To help you remember to take glimepiride, take it at around the same time every day.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Before taking glimepiride, tell your doctor and pharmacist:\n    *   If you are allergic to glimepiride, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in glimepiride.\n    *   What prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking glimepiride.\n    *   About your medical history, including G6PD deficiency, hormone disorders, heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n*   Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.\n*   Discuss the risks and benefits of taking glimepiride if you are 65 years of age or older.\n*   Tell your doctor about any upcoming surgery, including dental surgery.\n*   Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while taking glimepiride.\n\n**What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   There are no special dietary instructions for glimepiride.\n\n---\n\n**Glimepiride: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nBe sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight if necessary.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nBefore you start to take glimepiride, ask your doctor what you should do if you forget to take a dose. Write these directions down so that you can refer to them later.\n\nAs a general rule, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nThis medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n\nGlimepiride may cause side effects.

Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\nIn one study, people who took a medication similar to glimepiride to treat their diabetes were more likely to die of heart problems than people who were treated with insulin and diet changes. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking glimepiride.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Globozoospermia**\n\nGlobozoospermia is a rare genetic disorder that affects only males, causing abnormal sperm and leading to infertility.\n\n**Normal Sperm Cells vs. Abnormal Sperm Cells**\n\nNormal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. In contrast, the sperm cells of males with globozoospermia have a round head and no acrosome.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nGlobozoospermia is estimated to affect 1 in 65,000 men worldwide. It is most common in North Africa, where it accounts for approximately 1 in 100 cases of male infertility.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe condition is most commonly caused by mutations in the DPY19L2 gene, which are found in about 70 percent of men with this disorder. The DPY19L2 protein plays a crucial role in the development of the acrosome and elongation of the sperm head during sperm cell maturation.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nGlobozoospermia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder, as they are carriers of one mutated copy of the gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Globozoospermia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on globozoospermia, including its genetic basis and treatment options, please consult a healthcare professional or a reputable medical resource.\n\n---\n\n**Globozoospermia: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**Globulin Test**\n\n**What is a Globulin Test?**\n\nGlobulins are a group of proteins in your blood. Some globulins are made by your liver. Others are made by your immune system. Globulins play an important role in liver and kidney function, blood clotting, and fighting infection. There are different types of globulins called alpha, beta, and gamma globulins.\n\n**Tests to Measure Globulins**\n\n*   Total protein test: This blood test measures the total amount of protein in your blood.\n*   Serum protein electrophoresis: This blood test measures the level of each type of protein in your blood, including the different types of globulins.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nGlobulin tests can be used to help diagnose various conditions, including:\n\n*   Liver damage or disease\n*   Kidney disease\n*   Nutritional problems, such as malnutrition\n*   Certain autoimmune disorders\n*   Certain types of cancer\n\n**Why Do I Need a Globulin Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order globulin tests:\n\n*   As part of your routine checkup\n*   To help diagnose specific conditions when you have symptoms\n*   To monitor liver or kidney problems\n\n---\n\n**Globulin Test**\n\nThe globulin test measures the levels of different types of globulins and other proteins in your blood. Your provider may order this test to diagnose disorders related to your immune system, including:\n\n* Allergies\n* Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\n* Multiple myeloma, a type of cancer\n\n**Why is the Globulin Test Ordered?**\n\nYour health care provider may order globulin tests if you have symptoms of kidney or liver disease. A total protein test may be included in a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which is often part of a routine checkup.\n\n* If your provider thinks you may have a liver disease, you may also have other tests that check how well your liver is working (liver function tests).\n* Your provider may order them if you are at risk for liver disease or have symptoms of liver disease, which may include:\n\n**What Happens During the Globulin Test?**\n\nGlobulin tests are blood tests. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n* If your globulin test is part of another blood test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nLow globulin levels may be a sign of:\n\n* Liver disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Malnutrition\n\nHigh globulin levels may be a sign of:\n\n* Infection\n* Inflammatory disease\n* An immune disorder\n* Certain cancers, such as multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease), or malignant lymphoma\n* Tuberculosis\n\nCertain medicines, dehydration, pregnancy, or other conditions may also cause abnormal results.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr-test/",
    "content": "**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Test**\n\n**What is a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test?**\n\nA glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys are two organs on either side of your spine near your waist. They have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters remove waste and extra water from your blood and gets rid of them through urine (pee).\n\nIf your kidneys have been damaged by kidney disease, they can't filter your blood as fast as they should. A GFR test checks for kidney disease by measuring how much blood your kidneys filter each minute.\n\n**How is GFR measured?**\n\nGFR can be measured directly, but it is a complicated test to do. So health care providers usually estimate GFR based on the amount of certain waste substances in your blood. An estimated GFR is called an eGFR.\n\nTo figure out your eGFR, your provider usually uses the results of a blood test that measures your creatinine level. Creatinine is a waste product that comes from normal wear and tear on your muscles. If your kidneys aren't working well, creatinine can build up in your blood.\n\nPeople make different amounts of creatinine, depending on their size, diet, and activity levels. So, to calculate your eGFR, your provider will use your creatinine levels and other information about you, such as your:\n\n* Age\n* Weight\n* Height\n* Sex\n\nThis information is put into a mathematical formula, called a GFR calculator, to find your eGFR.\n\neGFR may also be calculated using the level of cystatin C in your blood. This is a protein that many cells in your body make. Cystatin C levels are not affected by muscle size, age, or diet, so some researchers think cystatin C provides a more accurate estimate of GFR than creatinine. In certain cases, creatinine and cystatin levels are both used to calculate eGFR in adults.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA GFR test is used to:\n\n* Screen for kidney disease in people without symptoms\n* Help diagnose kidney disease in a people who have symptoms\n* Help find out how serious kidney disease is\n* Monitor people who:\n\t+ Have chronic kidney disease (CKD) to see if treatment is helping\n\t+ Take medicines that could harm their kidneys\n\t+ Check kidney health before people start certain treatments that could affect their kidneys\n\n**Why do I need a GFR test?**\n\nEarly-stage kidney disease doesn't usually cause symptoms, so you may have an eGFR test to check your kidney health as part of a routine exam.\n\nYou may also need this test if you have a high risk of getting kidney disease. Your risk may be higher if you:\n\n* Have diabetes\n* Have high blood pressure\n* Have a family health history of kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure\n* Have heart disease\n* Are over 50 years old\n* Smoke\n* Have obesity\n\nIf you have a condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, ask your provider how often you should get tested.\n\nLater stage kidney disease does cause symptoms. So, you may need an eGFR test if you have:\n\n* Swelling in your legs, feet, ankles, or hands or face\n* Urinating (peeing) more often or less often than usual\n* Dry skin and/or itching\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle cramps\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Loss of appetite\n\n**What happens during a GFR test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know how to prepare for your test. You may need to fast (not eat or drink) or avoid certain foods for several hours before the test. Certain medicines can affect your results. So be sure to tell your provider everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any medicine unless your provider tells you to stop.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour eGFR results may be reported as a number that shows how much blood your kidneys filter per minute. Your test results may also give your creatinine level and/or your cystatin C level.\n\nAsk your provider to explain what your eGFR says about your kidney health. An eGFR isn't a perfect test and may not always reflect kidney damage. It's also possible to have an abnormal result even if you don't have kidney damage.\n\nIn general:\n\n* A normal eGFR means that you probably don't have kidney disease.\n* An eGFR that's below normal or low may mean that you may have kidney disease.\n* A very low eGFR means that you may have kidney failure.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with kidney disease, your provider will explain what you can do to protect your kidneys from more damage and help prevent kidney failure.\n\n---\n\n**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA GFR test, also known as an estimated GFR (eGFR), is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nYour kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters remove waste and extra water from your blood and get rid of them through urine. If your kidneys have been damaged by kidney disease, they can't filter your blood as fast as they should. A GFR test checks for kidney disease by measuring how much blood your kidneys filter each minute.\n\n**How is it measured?**\n\nGFR can be measured directly, but it's a complicated test to do. So, health care providers usually estimate GFR based on the amount of certain waste substances in your blood. An estimated GFR is called an eGFR.\n\n**What happens during the test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know how to prepare for your test. You may need to fast (not eat or drink) or avoid certain foods for several hours before the test. Certain medicines can affect your results, so be sure to tell your provider everything you're taking.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour eGFR results may be reported as a number that shows how much blood your kidneys filter per minute. Your test results may also give your creatinine level and/or your cystatin C level. Ask your provider to explain what your eGFR says about your kidney health.\n\n**When is it used?**\n\nA GFR test is used to:\n\n* Screen for kidney disease in people without symptoms\n* Help diagnose kidney disease in people who have symptoms\n* Help find out how serious kidney disease is\n* Monitor people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to see if treatment is helping\n* Check kidney health before people start certain treatments that could affect their kidneys\n\n**Who needs a GFR test?**\n\nYou may need an eGFR test if you have:\n\n* Diabetes\n* High blood pressure\n* A family health history of kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure\n* Heart disease\n* Are over 50 years old\n* Smoke\n* Have obesity\n\nIf you have a condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, ask your provider how often you should get tested.\n\n---\n\n**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Test**\n\n**What is the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) test?**\n\nThe GFR test measures the rate at which your kidneys filter your blood. It's an important indicator of kidney function and can help diagnose kidney problems.\n\n**How is the GFR test performed?**\n\nA healthcare provider will take a sample of your blood, usually from a vein in your arm. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**What does the GFR test measure?**\n\nThe GFR test measures the amount of waste products in your blood that your kidneys are able to filter out. A normal result indicates that your kidneys are functioning properly and removing waste products from your blood at a healthy rate.\n\n**Why is the GFR test important?**\n\nThe GFR test is an essential tool for diagnosing kidney problems, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). It can help identify individuals who are at risk of developing CKD and monitor their kidney function over time.\n\n**What other tests may be ordered with a GFR test?**\n\nYour provider may order other tests that check your kidney health. These tests may include:\n\n* BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) test\n* Creatinine test\n* Fasting for a blood test\n* Microalbumin Creatinine Ratio test\n* Phosphate in Blood test\n* Phosphate in Urine test\n* Protein in Urine test\n\n**What should I do if I have questions about my health?**\n\nIf you have questions about your health, contact a healthcare provider. They can provide you with personalized advice and care.\n\n**Related Health Topics:**\n\n* Chronic Kidney Disease\n* Diabetes\n* Dialysis\n* Heart Diseases\n* High Blood Pressure\n* Kidney Diseases\n* Kidney Failure\n* Kidney Transplantation\n\n**Related Medical Tests:**\n\n* BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) test\n* Creatinine Test\n* Fasting for a Blood Test\n* How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n* How to Understand Your Lab Results\n* Microalbumin Creatinine Ratio\n* Phosphate in Blood\n* Phosphate in Urine\n* Protein in Urine\n* What You Need to Know About Blood Testing",

Tests may include:\n\n*   **Blood tests to rule out any infection or tumor**\n*   **CT scan of the head**\n*   **MRI of the head**\n*   **X-rays of the head or neck**\n\nSometimes the MRI may show swelling (inflammation) of the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\nTo find out whether a blood vessel is pressing on the nerve, pictures of the brain arteries may be taken using:\n\n*   **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**\n*   **CT angiogram**\n*   **X-rays of the arteries with a dye (conventional angiography)**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control pain. The most effective medicines are antiseizure medicines such as carbamazepine. Antidepressants may help certain people.\n\nIn severe cases, when pain is difficult to treat, surgery to take pressure off the glossopharyngeal nerve may be needed. This is called microvascular decompression. The nerve can also be cut (rhizotomy). Both surgeries are effective. If a cause of the neuralgia is found, treatment should control the underlying problem.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do depends on the cause of the problem and the effectiveness of the first treatment.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucagon-blood-test/",
    "content": "**Glucagon Blood Test**\n\nThis test measures the amount of glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is a hormone made by your pancreas. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Glucagon works with other hormones, like insulin, to help maintain your body's level of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Glucagon increases your blood glucose levels, while insulin decreases your blood glucose levels.\n\nGlucose is your body's main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. This causes your blood glucose levels to go up, and less glucagon is released.\n\nAnd when your blood glucose levels drop, your pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. But if your pancreas doesn't release the right amount of glucagon, it can lead to serious health problems.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA glucagon test is most often used to help diagnose the following conditions:\n\n* Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, occurs when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you. Severe hypoglycemia can be deadly if it's not treated. The condition often affects people with diabetes. It can happen when your diabetes medicines and/or food intake are not at the proper levels.\n* Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. It can be acute (sudden and short term) or chronic (long term). The symptoms of acute pancreatitis are severe and may require immediate medical attention. Chronic pancreatitis gets worse over time and can lead to permanent damage. Its symptoms may not appear until there are complications.\n* Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas. It is usually cancerous.\n\nThe test is also sometimes used to monitor people with diabetes.\n\n**Why do I need a glucagon blood test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia or a pancreatic tumor.\n\nSymptoms of hypoglycemia can include:\n\n* Fast or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n* Tingling in the lips, tongue, or cheeks\n* Anxiety\n* Irritability\n* Sweating\n* Blurred vision\n* Fatigue\n* Pale skin\n* Hunger\n\nSymptoms of a pancreatic tumor can include:\n\n* A rash on the face, stomach, or legs\n* Diarrhea\n* Weight loss\n* Sores in the mouth or tongue\n\n**What happens during a glucagon blood test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your glucagon levels were not in the normal range, it may be a sign of one of the following conditions:\n\n* Hypoglycemia\n* Diabetes\n* Acute or chronic pancreatitis\n* Glucagonoma (pancreatic tumor)\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Glucagon Blood Test**\n\n**What is a glucagon blood test?**\n\nA glucagon blood test is used to check conditions related to glucose levels.\n\n**How is the test performed?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

A glucagon blood test is used to check conditions related to glucose levels, while a glucagon stimulation test checks for problems with growth hormones. It is most often used for infants and children.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Diabetes Association\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* Hinkle J, Cheever K.

    "content": "**Glucagon Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGlucagon is used along with emergency medical treatment to treat very low blood sugar. Glucagon is also used in diagnostic testing of the stomach and other digestive organs.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGlucagon comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe and an auto-injector device to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). It also comes as a powder to be mixed with a provided liquid to be injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly (into the muscle), or intravenously (into a vein).\n\nUse glucagon injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist to show you, family, or caregivers who could be injecting the medication how to use and prepare glucagon injection. Before a friend or family member uses glucagon injection for the first time, read the patient information that comes with it.\n\nFollowing a glucagon injection, an unconscious person with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will usually wake within 15 minutes. Once the glucagon has been given, immediately contact a doctor and get emergency medical treatment.\n\nGlucagon can be injected with the prefilled syringe or autoinjector in the upper arm, thigh, or stomach. Never inject glucagon prefilled syringe or autoinjector into a vein or muscle.\n\nIt is important that all patients have a household member who knows the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to administer glucagon. If you have low blood sugar often, keep glucagon injection with you at all times.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nAlways look at the glucagon solution before it is injected. It should be clear, colorless, and free of particles. Do not use glucagon injection if it is cloudy, contains particles, or if the expiration date has passed.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nGlucagon can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and headache. These side effects are usually mild and temporary.\n\nIn rare cases, glucagon can cause more serious side effects such as allergic reactions, increased heart rate, and high blood pressure.\n\nIf you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nGlucagon injection should be stored in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

    "content": "**Glucagon Blood Test**\n\nA glucagon blood test measures the amount of a hormone called glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is produced by specific cells in the pancreas. It helps regulate your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nGlucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.\n\nThe provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:\n\n*   Diabetes (not commonly measured)\n*   Glucagonoma (rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis\n*   Growth hormone deficiency in children\n*   Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function)\n*   Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) -- most common reason\n*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 25 to 50 pg/mL.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may indicate that the person may have a condition described under Why the Test is Performed.\n\nSome experts now believe that high glucagon levels in the blood contribute to the development of diabetes instead of just a low level of insulin. Medicines are being developed to decrease glucagon levels or block the signal from glucagon in the liver.\n\nWhen your blood sugar is low, the level of glucagon in your blood should be high. If it is not increased, this can help identify people that are at higher risk of severe hypoglycemia that can be dangerous.\n\nGlucagon can be increased by prolonged fasting.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGlucagonoma - glucagon test; Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I - glucagon test; Hypoglycemia - glucagon test; Low blood sugar - glucagon test\n\n---\n\n**Glucagon Blood Test**\n\n**What is the Glucagon Blood Test?**\n\nThe glucagon blood test measures the level of glucagon in your blood.
