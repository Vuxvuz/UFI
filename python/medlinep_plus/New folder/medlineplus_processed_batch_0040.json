    "content": "**Choking - Unconscious Adult or Child Over 1 Year**\n\nChoking is when someone cannot breathe because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway). A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChoking may be caused by:\n\n*   Eating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that do not fit well\n*   Foods such as food chunks, hot dogs, popcorn, peanut butter, sticky or gooey food (marshmallows, gummy bears, dough)\n*   Drinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)\n*   Being unconscious and breathing in vomit\n*   Breathing in or swallowing small objects (young children)\n*   Injury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)\n*   Swallowing problems caused by a stroke or other brain disorders\n*   Enlarged tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat\n*   Problems with the esophagus (food pipe or swallowing tube)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of choking when a person is unconscious include:\n\n*   Bluish color to the lips and nails (cyanosis)\n*   Inability to breathe\n\n**First Aid**\n\nTell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid and CPR. If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid and CPR.\n\nRoll the person onto their back on a hard surface, keeping the back in a straight line while firmly supporting the head and neck. Expose the person's chest.\n\nOpen the person's mouth with your thumb and index finger, placing your thumb over the tongue and your index finger under the chin. If you can see an object and it is loose, remove it.\n\nIf you do not see an object, open the person's airway by lifting the chin while tilting the head back. Place your ear close to the person's mouth and watch for chest movement. Look, listen, and feel for breathing for 5 seconds.\n\nIf the person is breathing, give first aid for unconsciousness. If the person is not breathing, begin rescue breathing. Maintain the head position, close the person's nostrils by pinching them with your thumb and index finger, and cover the person's mouth tightly with your mouth. Give two slow, full breaths with a pause in between.\n\nIf the person's chest does not rise, reposition the head and give two more breaths. If the chest still does not rise, the airway is likely blocked, and you need to start CPR with chest compressions. The compressions may help relieve the blockage.\n\nDo 30 chest compressions, open the person's mouth to look for an object. If you see the object and it is loose, remove it. If the object is removed, but the person has no pulse, begin CPR with chest compressions. If you do not see an object, give two more rescue breaths.\n\nIf the person starts having seizures (convulsions), give first aid for this problem. After removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help. Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. This is because the person can have complications not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nDo not try to grasp an object that is lodged in the person's throat. This may push it farther down the airway. If you can see the object in the mouth, it may be removed.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek medical help right away if someone is found unconscious. In the days following a choking episode, contact a doctor right away if the person develops:\n\n*   A cough that doesn't go away\n*   Fever\n*   Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing\n\nThe above signs may indicate:\n\n*   The object entered the lung instead of being expelled\n*   Injury to the voice box (larynx)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent choking:\n\n*   Eat slowly and chew food completely.\n*   Cut large pieces of food into easily chewable sizes.\n\nDo not drink too much alcohol before or during eating. Keep small objects away from young children. Make sure dentures fit properly.\n\n---\n\n**Choking in Adults and Children Over 1 Year**\n\n**Causes of Choking**\n\n*   Eating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that do not fit well\n*   Foods such as food chunks, hot dogs, popcorn, peanut butter, sticky or gooey food (marshmallows, gummy bears, dough)\n*   Drinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)\n*   Being unconscious and breathing in vomit\n*   Breathing in or swallowing small objects (young children)\n*   Injury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)\n*   Swallowing problems caused by a stroke or other brain disorders\n*   Enlarged tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat\n*   Problems with the esophagus (food pipe or swallowing tube)\n\n**Symptoms of Choking**\n\n*   Bluish color to the lips and nails (cyanosis)\n*   Inability to breathe\n\n**First Aid for Choking**\n\n1.

If the person's chest still does not rise, keep going with cycles of chest compressions, checking for an object, and rescue breaths until medical help arrives or the person starts breathing on their own.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   Seek medical help right away if someone is found unconscious.\n*   In the days following a choking episode, contact a doctor right away if the person develops:\n    *   A cough that doesn't go away\n    *   Fever\n    *   Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n    *   Shortness of breath\n    *   Wheezing\n\n---\n\n**Choking - Unconscious Adult or Child Over 1 Year**\n\n**When to Call 911**\n\nIf someone is unconscious, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.\n\n**First Aid for Choking**\n\nIf you are alone with an unconscious person, shout for help and begin first aid and CPR. If you are with someone else, tell them to call 911 while you start first aid and CPR.\n\nTo perform first aid for choking:\n\n1. Roll the person onto their back on a hard surface, keeping their back in a straight line while firmly supporting their head and neck.\n2. Expose the person's chest.\n3.

Remember to always seek medical attention if someone is unconscious or shows signs of complications after a choking episode.\n\n---\n\n**Choking - Unconscious Adult or Child Over 1 Year**\n\n**First Aid for Choking - Unconscious Adult**\n\nIf the adult is unconscious, unable to speak or cough, and not breathing, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.\n\n*   **Check the airway**: Position the person on their back and tilt their head back. Listen for breath sounds and feel for air escaping around the mouth.\n*   **Clear the airway**: If the person is choking, try to remove the object blocking the airway. If you can't see the object, do not attempt to insert your finger into the throat.\n*   **Perform CPR**: If the person is not breathing, start CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Give 30 breaths and 15 chest compressions, then repeat.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Red Cross. First Aid/CPR/AED Participant's Manual. 2nd ed.

    "content": "**Cholangiocarcinoma | Bile Duct Cancer**\n\n**Basics**\n\nYour liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBile duct cancer is rare. It can happen in the parts of the bile ducts that are outside or inside the liver.

The pain may come and go and feel sharp, cramp-like, or dull.\n*   Fever and chills.\n*   Dark urine and clay-colored or pale stools.\n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n*   Yellowing of the skin (jaundice), which may come and go.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou may have the following tests to look for blockages:\n\n*   Abdominal ultrasound\n*   CT scan\n*   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n*   Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n*   Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA)\n\nYou may also have the following blood tests:\n\n*   Bilirubin level\n*   Liver enzyme levels\n*   Liver function tests\n*   White blood count (WBC)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nQuick diagnosis and treatment are very important.\n\nAntibiotics to cure infection are the first treatment done in most cases. ERCP or other surgical procedure is done when the person is stable. ERCP will drain the infection, which is usually needed along with antibiotics.\n\nPeople who are very ill or are quickly getting worse may need surgery right away.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome is very often good with treatment, but poor without it.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Sepsis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of cholangitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTreatment of gallstones, tumors, and infestations of parasites may reduce the risk for some people. A metal or plastic stent that is placed in the bile system may be needed to prevent the infection from returning.",

If it isn't treated quickly, it can lead to dehydration and even death. About 100,000-130,000 people are thought to die from cholera each year, almost all of them in countries where the disease is common.\n\n**Who Should Not Receive the Cholera Vaccine?**\n\nIf you have any severe, life-threatening allergies, you should not get the vaccine. Tell your health care provider if you have any severe allergies that you know of. He or she can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended to wait until more information is available about the potential risks of this vaccine for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman.\n\nIf you've recently taken antibiotics, it may cause the vaccine to not work as well. Antibiotics taken within 14 days before vaccination should be avoided.\n\nCholera vaccine should not be taken with the antimalarial medication chloroquine (Aralen®). It is best to wait at least 10 days after the vaccine to take antimalaria drugs.\n\n**What If There Is a Serious Reaction?**\n\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are also possible.\n\nSome people have mild problems following cholera vaccination, including:\n\n* abdominal pain\n* tiredness or fatigue\n* headache\n* lack of appetite\n* nausea or diarrhea\n\nNo serious problems reported after cholera vaccine were considered related to the vaccine.\n\n---\n\n**Cholera Vaccine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Who Should Not Receive the Cholera Vaccine?**\n\nIf you have any severe, life-threatening allergies. If you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a previous dose of any cholera vaccine, or if you have a severe allergy to any ingredient in this vaccine, you should not get the vaccine. Tell your health care provider if you have any severe allergies that you know of. He or she can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Not much is known about the potential risks of this vaccine for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman. A registry has been set up to learn more about vaccination during pregnancy. If you get the vaccine and later learn you were pregnant at the time, you are encouraged to contact this registry at 1-800-533-5899.\n\nIf you've recently taken antibiotics. Antibiotics taken within 14 days before vaccination may cause the vaccine to not work as well.\n\nIf you are taking antimalaria drugs. Cholera vaccine should not be taken with the antimalarial medication chloroquine (Aralen). It is best to wait at least 10 days after the vaccine to take antimalaria drugs.\n\nAlways wash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing or handling food. Cholera vaccine can be shed in feces for at least 7 days.\n\nIf you have a mild illness, like a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, your doctor might recommend waiting until you recover.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are the Risks of a Vaccine Reaction?**\n\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are also possible.\n\nSome people have mild problems following cholera vaccination.

Otherwise, call your clinic.\n\nAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the ''Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System'' (VAERS). Your doctor should file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS web site at https://www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\n\n\\n\\n**How Can I Learn More?**\n\nAsk your healthcare provider. He or she can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information.\n\nCall your local or state health department.\n\nContact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or visit CDC's website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/resources/index.html.",

    "content": "**Cholera**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cholera?**\n\nCholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food that has been contaminated by feces (poop). Cholera is rare in the US. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Cholera**\n\nCholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea.\n\nIn some cases, the infection can be severe, causing lots of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids, you are at risk for dehydration and shock. Without treatment, you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera, you should get medical care right away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing and Treating Cholera**\n\nDoctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics. Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Cholera**\n\nThere are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it, because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak.\n\nThere are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection:\n\n*   Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, washing dishes, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth\n*   If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets\n*   Wash your hands often with soap and clean water\n*   Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot\n*   Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables\n\n---\n\n**Cholera**\n\n\\n\\n* **Cameroon: 2018-2023:** \n\t+ Article: Trends of cholera epidemics and associated mortality factors in Cameroon: 2018-2023\n* **Social dynamics influencing cholera risk**\n\t+ Article: Social dynamics influencing cholera risk in the City of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo\n* **Bacteriological quality of household drinking water and cholera risk**\n\t+ Article: Bacteriological quality of household drinking water and cholera risk in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n\\n\\n**Other Languages**\n\n* Find health information in languages other than English on Cholera",

High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can increase the risk of these diseases, while high levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol may help protect against them.\n*   **How can I manage my cholesterol levels?**\n    A healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential for managing cholesterol levels. Limiting intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and dietary cholesterol can also help.

    "content": "**Cholesterol Levels**\n\nA cholesterol test, also known as a lipid profile or lipid panel, measures the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in every cell of your body.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA cholesterol test gives you and your healthcare provider important information about your risk of developing heart disease. If your test shows high cholesterol, you can take steps to lower it, decreasing your risk of future heart problems.\n\n**Types of Cholesterol**\n\nThere are two main types of cholesterol:\n\n*   **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**: \"Bad\" cholesterol that increases the risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\n*   **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)**: \"Good\" cholesterol that helps remove \"bad\" LDL cholesterol.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nYour provider may order a cholesterol test as part of a routine exam. The frequency of testing depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.\n\n*   **Children**: First test between ages 9 to 11, with subsequent tests every 5 years.\n*   **Young Adults (20-65)**: Test every 5 years for younger adults, and every 1 to 2 years for men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65.\n*   **Older Adults (65+)**: Test every year.\n\nYou may also need more frequent testing if you have a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, smoking, excess weight or obesity, lack of physical activity, or a diet high in saturated fat.\n\n**What Happens During a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The test usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nYou may be able to use an at-home kit to check your cholesterol levels. Be sure to follow the kit instructions carefully and inform your provider if your at-home test shows a total cholesterol level higher than 200 mg/dl.\n\n**Will I Need to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 9 to 12 hours before your blood cholesterol test. Your provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any other special instructions.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nCholesterol is usually measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. The information below will help you understand what your test results mean:\n\n*   **Healthy Levels**: Low LDL levels and high HDL cholesterol levels are good for heart health.\n*   **LDL Levels**: Less than 110 mg/dL for children, less than 100 mg/dL for men ages 20 or older, and less than 100 mg/dL for women ages 20 or older.\n*   **HDL Levels**: More than 45mg/dL for children, greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL for men ages 20 or older, and greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL for women ages 20 or older.\n\nA healthy cholesterol level for you may depend on your age, family history, lifestyle, and other risk factors for heart disease. Your provider can explain what's right for you.\n\n**Learn More**\n\nHigh cholesterol can lead to heart disease, the number one cause of death in the United States. You can't change some risk factors for high cholesterol, such as age and your genes. But there are actions you can take to lower your LDL levels and reduce your risk, including:\n\n*   **Eat a Healthy Diet**: Reduce or avoid foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n*   **Manage Your Weight**: Being overweight can increase your cholesterol and risk for heart disease.\n*   **Stay Active**: Regular physical activity may help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels.\n*   **Quit Smoking**: Smoking lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol, especially in women. Smoking also raises your LDL (bad) cholesterol.\n*   **Reduce Stress**: Stress may raise levels of certain hormones such as corticosteroids. These can cause your body to make more cholesterol.\n*   **Avoid Drinking Too Much Alcohol**: Alcohol can raise your total cholesterol level.\n\nTalk to your provider before making any major change in your diet or exercise routine.\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Levels: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What is a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nA cholesterol test, also known as a lipid profile or lipid panel, is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood and every cell of your body.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nYour provider may order a cholesterol test as part of a routine exam. When and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.\n\n* For people who are age 19 or younger:\n\t+ The first test should be between ages 9 to 11\n\t+ Children should have the test again every 5 years\n\t+ Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\n* For people who are ages 20 to 65:\n\t+ Younger adults should have the test every 5 years\n\t+ Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\n* For people older than 65:\n\t+ They should be tested every year\n\nYou may also have a cholesterol test more often if you are at high risk of heart problems because of:\n\n* A family history of heart disease\n* High blood pressure\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Smoking\n* Excess weight or obesity\n* Lack of physical activity\n* A diet high in saturated fat\n\n**What Happens During a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nYou may be able to use an at-home kit to check your cholesterol levels. Your kit will include a device to prick your finger to collect a drop of blood for testing. Be sure to follow the kit instructions carefully. Also, be sure to tell your provider if your at-home test shows that your total cholesterol level is higher than 200 mg/dl.\n\n**What Does a Cholesterol Test Measure?**\n\nA cholesterol test measures:\n\n* LDL (low-density lipoprotein) level: LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol is the main source of blockages in the arteries.\n* HDL level: HDL (\"good') cholesterol helps get rid of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. A higher HDL level may help reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke.\n* Total cholesterol: This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes HDL and LDL cholesterol.\n* Triglyceride level: Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. High levels of triglycerides may increase the risk of heart disease, especially in women.\n\nThere is another type of cholesterol called VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein). Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides, and LDL mainly carries cholesterol. VLDL isn't usually included in routine cholesterol tests because it's difficult to measure. Because VLDL contains a certain percentage of triglycerides, a lab can use your triglycerides level to estimate your VLDL level.\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Levels: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Understanding Your Cholesterol Results**\n\nYour cholesterol test results will show your total cholesterol level, LDL (bad) cholesterol level, HDL (good) cholesterol level, and triglyceride level. Here's what each result means:\n\n* **Total Cholesterol**: Measures the amount of cholesterol in your blood.\n\t+ Anyone age 19 or younger: Less than 170 mg/dL\n\t+ Men age 20 or older: Less than 200 mg/dL\n\t+ Women age 20 or older: Less than 200 mg/dL\n* **LDL (Bad) Cholesterol**: Measures the amount of \"bad\" cholesterol in your blood.\n\t+ Anyone age 19 or younger: Less than 110 mg/dL\n\t+ Men age 20 or older: Less than 100 mg/dL\n\t+ Women age 20 or older: Less than 100 mg/dL\n* **HDL (Good) Cholesterol**: Measures the amount of \"good\" cholesterol in your blood.\n\t+ Anyone age 19 or younger: More than 45mg/dL\n\t+ Men age 20 or older: Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL\n\t+ Women age 20 or older: Levels less than 40 mg/dL are considered low\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 9 to 12 hours before your blood cholesterol test. This is why the tests are often done in the morning.\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nA healthy cholesterol level for you may depend on your age, family history, lifestyle, and other risk factors for heart disease, such as high triglyceride levels. Your provider can explain what's right for you.\n\n**Lowering Your LDL Levels**\n\nYou can take actions to lower your LDL levels and reduce your risk of heart disease:\n\n* Eat a healthy diet\n* Manage your weight\n* Stay active\n* Quit smoking\n* Reduce stress\n* Avoid drinking too much alcohol\n\nTalk to your provider before making any major change in your diet or exercise routine.\n\n**References**\n\nFor more information on cholesterol, visit the following resources:\n\n* American Heart Association: HDL (Good), LDL (Bad) Cholesterol and Triglycerides\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: About Cholesterol\n* Cleveland Clinic: Blood Tests\n* FDA: US Food and Drug Administration\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Levels: What You Need to Know**\n\nAre you concerned about your cholesterol levels? Do you want to know what they mean and how to manage them? Look no further! In this article, we'll break down the basics of cholesterol levels and provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to understand and manage them.\n\n**What are Cholesterol Levels?**\n\nCholesterol levels refer to the amount of cholesterol in your blood. There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, while HDL is known as \"good\" cholesterol.\n\n**Why are Cholesterol Levels Important?**\n\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, while high levels of HDL cholesterol can help protect you against it. Therefore, understanding your cholesterol levels is crucial in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.\n\n**How to Check Your Cholesterol Levels**\n\nYou can check your cholesterol levels through various methods, including:\n\n*   **Blood tests**: A healthcare provider will draw a sample of your blood and send it to a laboratory for analysis.\n*   **At-home medical tests**: Some companies offer at-home testing kits that you can use to check your cholesterol levels.\n\n**What Do My Cholesterol Levels Mean?**\n\nYour cholesterol levels are typically measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Here's a breakdown of what your levels might mean:\n\n*   **Normal levels**: Less than 200 mg/dL\n*   **Borderline high levels**: 200-239 mg/dL\n*   **High levels**: 240 mg/dL or higher\n\n**How to Lower Your Cholesterol Levels**\n\nIf you have high cholesterol levels, there are several ways to lower them. These include:\n\n*   **Dietary changes**: Eating a healthy diet that is low in saturated fats and cholesterol can help lower your levels.\n*   **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can also help improve your cholesterol levels.\n*   **Medications**: In some cases, medications may be prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnderstanding your cholesterol levels is crucial in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. By knowing what your levels mean and how to manage them, you can take steps to reduce your risk of heart disease. Remember to consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.",

The numbers that are best for you may depend on your age, race, blood pressure, weight, family history, and more.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Desirable Cholesterol Levels**\n\nHere are some general guidelines showing the desirable levels (levels that are healthy for most people):\n\n*   Anyone age 19 or younger:\n    *   Total Cholesterol: Less than 170 mg/dL\n    *   Non-HDL: Less than 120 mg/dL\n    *   LDL: Less than 110 mg/dL\n    *   HDL: More than 45 mg/dL\n*   Men age 20 or older:\n    *   Total Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL\n    *   Non-HDL: Less than 130 mg/dL\n    *   LDL: Less than 100 mg/dL\n    *   HDL: Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL (best levels less than 40 mg/dL are considered low)\n*   Women age 20 or older:\n    *   Total Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL\n    *   Non-HDL: Less than 130 mg/dL\n    *   LDL: Less than 100 mg/dL\n    *   HDL: Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL (best levels less than 50 mg/dL are considered low)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Triglyceride Levels**\n\nA normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL. You might need treatment if you have triglyceride levels that are borderline high (150-199 mg/dL) or high (200 mg/dL or more).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Often Should I Get a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nWhen and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:\n\n*   For people who are age 19 or younger:\n    *   First test between ages 9 to 11\n    *   Children should have the test again every 5 years\n    *   Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\n*   For people who are ages 20 to 65:\n    *   Younger adults should have the test every 5 years\n    *   Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\n*   For people older than 65:\n    *   They should be tested every year\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Affects My Cholesterol Levels?**\n\nMany factors can affect your cholesterol levels. Some of them are things you can change:\n\n*   Diet: Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise.\n*   Weight: Being overweight or having obesity are risk factors for heart disease.\n*   Lack of physical activity: Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease.\n*   Smoking: Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol.\n\nSome factors that you cannot change can also affect cholesterol levels, such as:\n\n*   Age: Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older.\n*   Sex: Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause, a woman's risk goes up.\n*   Family history: Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes.\n*   Race or ethnicity: People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Lower My Cholesterol?**\n\nYou can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.\n\nIf the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins.\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Levels: What You Need to Know**\n\nIf your lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.\n\n**Medicines for Lowering Cholesterol**\n\n*   Statins: a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that can help reduce levels of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the blood.\n\n**Continuing Lifestyle Changes**\n\nEven if you start taking medicines to lower your cholesterol, it's still important to continue with the lifestyle changes you've made. This includes:\n\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Getting regular exercise\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n*   Not smoking\n\nBy continuing with these lifestyle changes, you can help support the efforts of your medicine and reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\n**Learning More**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about cholesterol levels or how to lower them, there are many resources available. Some recommended articles include:\n\n*   \"Impact of recognition of genetic information related to BMI on changes in dietary habits\"\n*   \"Lipid-Lowering Effect and Safety of Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin 5 mg in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia\"\n*   \"An Oral PCSK9 Inhibitor for Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia: The PURSUIT Randomized Trial\"\n\nYou can find these articles and more on the MedlinePlus website.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nIf you're looking for information on cholesterol testing and results, there are several patient handouts available. Some recommended resources include:\n\n*   \"Cholesterol Testing and Results\" (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   \"Total Cholesterol\" (National Library of Medicine)\n\nThese handouts can help you understand your test results and what they mean for your health.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about cholesterol levels or how to lower them, there are many related health topics to explore.

Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly, but too much can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or block them, putting you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\n\n**What are the treatments for high cholesterol?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help lower your cholesterol levels. However, sometimes lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with lifestyle changes even though you're taking medicines.\n\n**Who needs cholesterol medicines?**\n--------------------------------------\n\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe cholesterol medicines for you if:\n\n*   You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease\n*   Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher\n*   You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher\n*   You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher\n\n**What are the different types of cholesterol medicines?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including:\n\n*   **Statins**: Reduce the amount of cholesterol made in the liver and increase the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol already in the blood.\n*   **Bile acid sequestrants**: Keep bile acids from being absorbed into the body, which helps lower LDL cholesterol. Your provider may prescribe these medicines if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough.\n*   **Cholesterol absorption inhibitors**: Block how cholesterol is absorbed into the body. They are also used if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough.\n*   **Nicotinic acid (niacin)**: A type of B vitamin that reduces the amount of fats made by your liver, lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raises HDL cholesterol.\n*   **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Injected medicines that block a protein called PCSK9, helping your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood.\n*   **Fibrates**: Lower triglycerides in several complex ways, including reducing the amount of triglycerides made by the liver. They may also help increase HDL cholesterol and lower LDL levels a bit.\n*   **Combination medicines**: Include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine.\n\n**How does my healthcare provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your provider will consider:\n\n*   Your cholesterol levels\n*   Your risk for heart disease and stroke\n*   Your age\n*   Any other health problems you have\n*   Possible side effects of the medicines\n\nMedicines can help control your cholesterol, but they don't cure it.

They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood.\n* **Bile acid sequestrants**: They keep bile acids, which digest fats and oils, from being absorbed into the body. But your body needs bile acids, so your liver will make more of them. It makes them by breaking down LDL cholesterol, so this helps lower your LDL cholesterol.\n* **Cholesterol absorption inhibitors**: They block how cholesterol is absorbed into the body.\n* **Nicotinic acid (niacin)**: It is a type of B vitamin. It reduces the amount of fats made by your liver, so it lowers your LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Niacin also raises HDL cholesterol.\n* **PCSK9 inhibitors**: These are medicines that you inject under your skin. They block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood.\n* **Fibrates**: They lower triglycerides in several complex ways, including reducing the amount of triglycerides made by the liver.\n\n**How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take?**\n\nWhen deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your provider will consider:\n\n* Your cholesterol levels.\n* Your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n* Your age.\n* Any other health problems you have.\n* Possible side effects of the medicines.

    "content": "**Cholesterol and Lifestyle**\n\nYour body needs cholesterol to work well. But cholesterol levels that are too high can harm you.\n\nIn the US, blood cholesterol is most often measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Extra cholesterol in your blood builds up inside the walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque, or atherosclerosis. Plaque reduces or stops blood flow. This can cause:\n\n*   Heart attack\n*   Stroke\n*   Serious heart or blood vessel disease\n\n**Your Cholesterol Numbers**\n\nAll men should have their blood cholesterol levels tested every 5 years, starting at age 35 years. All women should do the same, starting at age 45 years. Many adults should have their blood cholesterol levels tested at a younger age, possibly as early as age 20 years, if they have risk factors for heart disease. Children with risk factors for heart disease should also have their blood cholesterol levels checked.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou want your LDL level to be low. If it gets too high, you will need to treat it. Treatment includes:\n\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Losing weight (if you are overweight)\n*   Exercising\n\nYou may also need medicine to lower your cholesterol.\n\nYou want your HDL cholesterol to be high.

These include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Using low-fat toppings, sauces, and dressings will help.\n\nLook at food labels. Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat. Eating too much of this type of fat can lead to heart disease.\n\nChoose lean protein foods, such as soy, fish, skinless chicken, very lean meat, and fat-free or 1% dairy products.\nLook for the words \"hydrogenated\", \"partially hydrogenated\", and \"trans fats\" on food labels. Do not eat foods with these words in the ingredients lists.\n\nLimit how much fried food you eat.\nLimit how many prepared baked goods (for example, donuts, cookies, and crackers) you eat.

A well-balanced diet can significantly impact our risk of developing these conditions.\n\n**Understanding Cholesterol**\n\nCholesterol is a type of fat found in the bloodstream. It's essential for various bodily functions, such as building cells and producing hormones. However, when cholesterol levels become too high, it can lead to serious health issues like heart disease.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes for Better Health**\n\nFortunately, making simple lifestyle changes can greatly reduce our risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Here are some effective ways to get started:\n\n*   **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on consuming whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n*   **Incorporate physical activity**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of developing these conditions.\n*   **Don't smoke**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so quitting is essential for your overall health.\n\nBy implementing these lifestyle changes, you'll be well on your way to reducing your risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Remember, it's all about making small, sustainable changes that add up to a healthier, happier you!\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol and Lifestyle**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Angina**\n\t+ Discharge\n\t+ What to ask your doctor\n* **Angioplasty and Stent Placement**\n\t+ Carotid artery\n\t+ Peripheral arteries\n* **Cardiac Ablation Procedures**\n* **Carotid Artery Surgery - Open**\n* **Heart Bypass Surgery**\n* **Heart Bypass Surgery - Minimally Invasive**\n* **Heart Failure**\n* **Heart Pacemaker**\n* **High Blood Cholesterol Levels**\n* **High Blood Pressure in Adults – Hypertension**\n* **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator**\n* **Peripheral Artery Bypass - Leg**\n* **Peripheral Artery Disease - Legs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open - Discharge**\n* **Aspirin and Heart Disease**\n* **Atrial Fibrillation - Discharge**\n* **Being Active When You Have Heart Disease**\n* **Butter, Margarine, and Cooking Oils**\n* **Cardiac Catheterization - Discharge**\n* **Carotid Artery Surgery - Discharge**\n* **Cholesterol - What to Ask Your Doctor**\n* **Controlling Your High Blood Pressure**\n* **Dietary Fats Explained**\n* **Fast Food Tips**\n* **Heart Attack – Discharge**\n* **Heart Attack - What to Ask Your Provider**\n* **Heart Bypass Surgery - Discharge**\n* **Heart Disease - Risk Factors**\n* **High Blood Pressure - What to Ask Your Doctor**\n* **How to Read Food Labels**\n* **Low-Salt Diet**\n* **Managing Your Blood Sugar**\n* **Mediterranean Diet**\n* **Peripheral Artery Bypass - Leg - Discharge**\n* **Stroke - Discharge**",

    "content": "**Cholesterol Testing and Results**\n\n**What is Cholesterol?**\n\nCholesterol is a soft, wax-like substance found in all parts of the body. Your body needs a little bit of cholesterol to work properly. But too much cholesterol can clog your arteries and lead to heart disease.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Cholesterol Test?**\n\nCholesterol blood tests are done to help you and your health care provider better understand your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other problems caused by narrowed or blocked arteries.\n\n**What Types of Cholesterol Tests Are There?**\n\nSome types of cholesterol are considered good and some are considered bad. Different blood tests can be done to measure each type of cholesterol.\n\n*   Your provider may order only a total cholesterol level as the first test. It measures all types of cholesterol in your blood.\n*   You may also have a lipid (or coronary risk) profile, which includes:\n    *   Total cholesterol\n    *   Low density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol)\n    *   High density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol)\n    *   Triglycerides (another type of fat in your blood)\n    *   Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL cholesterol)\n\n**When Should I Get Tested?**\n\nEveryone should have their first screening test by age 35 for men, and age 45 for women. Some guidelines recommend starting at age 20 or even earlier depending on a person's overall health.\n\nYou should have a cholesterol test done at an earlier age if you have:\n\n*   Diabetes\n*   Heart disease\n*   Stroke\n*   High blood pressure\n*   A strong family history of heart disease\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Testing and Results**\n\nYou should have a cholesterol test done at an earlier age if you have:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Heart disease\n* Stroke\n* High blood pressure\n* A strong family history of heart disease\n\nFollow-up testing should be done:\n\n* Every 5 years if your results were normal.\n* More often for people with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or blood flow problems to the legs or feet.\n* As your provider recommends if you are taking medicines to lower your cholesterol.\n\n**Total Cholesterol**\n\nA total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L) is considered best (lower numbers are better).\n\nYou may not need more detailed cholesterol tests if your cholesterol is in this normal range.\n\n**LDL (Bad) Cholesterol**\n\nLDL cholesterol is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol. LDL can clog your arteries.\n\nYou want your LDL to be low. Having too much LDL is linked to heart disease and stroke.\n\nYour LDL is always considered to be too high if it is 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or higher.\n\nLevels from 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.81 to 4.90 mmol/L) are most often considered too high if:\n\n* You have diabetes and are between ages 40 to 75\n* You have diabetes and a high risk of heart disease\n* You have a medium or high risk of heart disease\n* You have heart disease, history of a stroke, or poor circulation to your legs\n\nIn these circumstances, your provider will often recommend medicine to lower your LDL cholesterol level.\n\n**HDL (Good) Cholesterol**\n\nYou want your HDL cholesterol to be high. Studies of both men and women have shown that the higher your HDL, the lower your risk of coronary artery disease. This is why HDL is sometimes referred to as \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nHDL cholesterol levels greater than 40 to 60 mg/dL (1.04 to 1.55 mmol/L) are desired, though even higher is better.\n\n**VLDL (Bad) Cholesterol**\n\nVLDL contains the highest amount of triglycerides. VLDL is considered a type of bad cholesterol because it helps cholesterol build up on the walls of arteries.\n\nNormal VLDL levels are from 2 to 30 mg/dL (0.05 to 0.78 mmol/L).\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSometimes, your cholesterol levels may be low enough that your provider will not ask you to change your diet or take any medicines.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCholesterol test results; LDL test results; VLDL test results; HDL test results; Coronary risk profile results; Hyperlipidemia-results; Lipid disorder test results; Heart disease - cholesterol results\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol Testing and Results**\n\n**When Should You Be Tested?**\n\nEveryone should have their first screening test by age 35 for men, and age 45 for women.

Higher strength medicines are used for the highest risk patients.\nHowever, some guidelines still recommend using specific targets.\n\n**HDL (Good) Cholesterol**\n\nYou want your HDL cholesterol to be high. Studies of both men and women have shown that the higher your HDL, the lower your risk of coronary artery disease. This is why HDL is sometimes referred to as \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nHDL cholesterol levels greater than 40 to 60 mg/dL (1.04 to 1.55 mmol/L) are desired, though even higher is better.\n\n**VLDL (Bad) Cholesterol**\n\nVLDL contains the highest amount of triglycerides.

Sometimes, your cholesterol levels may be low enough that your provider won't ask you to make any changes.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Cholesterol test results\n* LDL test results\n* VLDL test results\n* HDL test results\n* Coronary risk profile results\n* Hyperlipidemia-results\n* Lipid disorder test results\n* Heart disease - cholesterol results\n\n**Cholesterol Test Results**\n\nYou've just received your cholesterol test results.

Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL?**\n\nHDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes:\n\n*   HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.\n*   LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.\n*   VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes High Cholesterol?**\n\nThe most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include:\n\n*   Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of saturated fats. These fats are found in red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and many deep-fried and processed foods. Eating too much saturated fat can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol.\n*   Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol.\n*   Smoking, which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol.\n*   Stress, which may raise levels of certain hormones such as corticosteroids. These can cause your body to make more cholesterol.\n*   Drinking too much alcohol, which can raise your total cholesterol level.\n\nGenetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also raise LDL cholesterol levels or lower HDL cholesterol levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Can Raise My Risk of High Cholesterol?**\n\nA variety of things can raise your risk of high cholesterol:\n\n*   Unhealthy eating habits\n*   Lack of physical activity\n*   Smoking\n*   Stress\n*   Drinking too much alcohol\n*   Genetics\n*   Certain medical conditions and medicines\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol | MedlinePlus**\n\n**What can raise my risk of high cholesterol?**\n\n*   Age: Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older.\n*   Sex: Men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women between ages 20 and 39. After menopause, a woman's risk goes up due to lower levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol.\n*   Family history: High blood cholesterol can run in families.\n*   Other health conditions: Conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, and lupus can raise your risk of high cholesterol.\n*   Medicines: Certain medicines can raise your level of LDL cholesterol or lower your level of HDL cholesterol, including steroids, some chemotherapy medicines, medicines taken after an organ transplant, medicines for certain heart conditions, and certain acne medicines.\n*   Race or ethnicity: People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups.\n*   Weight: Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level.\n\n**What other health problems can high cholesterol cause?**\n\nUndiagnosed or untreated high blood cholesterol can lead to serious health problems:\n\n*   If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open), causing a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery.\n*   If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.\n*   Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.\n\n**How is high cholesterol diagnosed?**\n\nThere are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:\n\n*   For people who are age 19 or younger:\n    *   The first test should be between ages 9 to 11\n    *   Children should have the test again every 5 years\n    *   Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\n*   For people who are ages 20 to 65:\n    *   Younger adults should have the test every 5 years\n    *   Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\n*   For people over age 65:\n    *   They should be tested every year\n\n**How can I lower my cholesterol?**\n\nYou can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.\n\nIf the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.\n\nSome people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol**\n\n**What Is Blood Cholesterol?**\n\nBlood cholesterol is a type of fat found in the bloodstream. It's an essential part of maintaining healthy cells, but too much of it can lead to heart disease and stroke.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Cholesterol Levels**: A blood test measures the amount of cholesterol in your blood.\n*   **Fasting for a Blood Test**: You'll need to fast for 12-14 hours before the test to get an accurate reading.\n*   **Home-Use Test Kits -- Cholesterol**: These kits allow you to test your cholesterol levels at home.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\n*   **Community Health Worker Multicultural Resources**: This resource provides information on how to lower cholesterol through diet and lifestyle changes.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **Cholesterol Medicines**: These medications help lower cholesterol levels in the blood.\n*   **How to Lower Cholesterol with Diet**: Making healthy dietary choices can help reduce cholesterol levels.\n*   **Statins**: A type of medication that helps lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   **High Cholesterol and Dietary Supplements**: Some supplements may interact with medications or have adverse effects when taken with high cholesterol.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Cholesterol Level: Can It Be Too Low?**: In some cases, very low cholesterol levels can be problematic.\n*   **Common Misconceptions about Cholesterol**: Understanding the facts about cholesterol is crucial for making informed decisions.\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   **Familial HDL Deficiency**: A rare genetic disorder that affects high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n*   **Familial Hypercholesterolemia**: An inherited condition characterized by extremely high LDL cholesterol levels.\n*   **Hepatic Lipase Deficiency**: A rare genetic disorder affecting the enzyme hepatic lipase.\n\n**Videos and Tutorials**\n\n*   **Cholesterol Good and Bad**: This video explains the difference between good and bad cholesterol.\n\n**Test Your Knowledge**\n\n*   **Test Your Cholesterol Knowledge**: Take this quiz to assess your understanding of cholesterol-related topics.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n*   **High Cholesterol and Natural Products: What the Science Says**: Explore the scientific evidence on natural products and high cholesterol.\n*   **High Cholesterol Facts**: Learn more about the prevalence and risks associated with high cholesterol.\n*   **Science Snippet: Lipids in the Limelight**: Discover recent research and findings related to lipids and cholesterol.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Cholesterol**: Search for ongoing clinical trials related to cholesterol.\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Hypercholesterolemia**: Explore clinical trials focused on hypercholesterolemia.\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II**: Find clinical trials related to this condition.\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Hyperlipoproteinemia Type III**: Search for clinical trials focused on this condition.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   **References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed**: Access a collection of journal articles and research papers on cholesterol-related topics.\n*   **Article: Impact of recognition of genetic information related to BMI on changes...**\n*   **Article: Lipid-Lowering Effect and Safety of Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin 5 mg in Patients...**\n*   **Article: An Oral PCSK9 Inhibitor for Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia: The PURSUIT Randomized...**\n\n---\n\n**Cholesterol**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **High Cholesterol in Children and Teens**: Learn more about the risks and symptoms of high cholesterol in children and teens.\n*   **Patient Handouts**\n    *   **Cholesterol and lifestyle**: Understand how your lifestyle choices impact your cholesterol levels.\n    *   **Cholesterol testing and results**: Know what to expect from a cholesterol test and how to interpret your results.\n    *   **Familial combined hyperlipidemia**: Learn about this rare genetic disorder that affects cholesterol levels.\n    *   **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Understand the risks and symptoms of this inherited condition.\n    *   **High cholesterol -

    "content": "**Cholestyramine Resin**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCholestyramine is used with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in your blood. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCholestyramine comes in a chewable bar and in a powder that must be mixed with fluids or food. It usually is taken two to four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cholestyramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTake this medication before a meal and/or at bedtime, and try to take any other medications at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after you take cholestyramine because cholestyramine can interfere with their absorption.\n\nContinue to take cholestyramine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cholestyramine without talking to your doctor. This precaution is especially important if you also take other drugs; changing your cholestyramine dose may change their effects.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDo not take the powder alone.

    "content": "**Cholinesterase - Blood**\n\nSerum cholinesterase is a blood test that looks at levels of 2 substances that help the nervous system work properly. They are called acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase. Your nerves need these substances to send signals.\n\n* **Acetylcholinesterase**: found in nerve tissue and red blood cells\n* **Pseudocholinesterase**: found primarily in the liver\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you may have been exposed to chemicals called organophosphates.

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Levels can vary from person to person, so having a baseline level makes the test more accurate.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nDecreased pseudocholinesterase levels may be due to:\n\n* Hereditary deficiency of pseudocholinesterase\n* Chronic infection\n* Chronic malnutrition\n* Heart attack\n* Liver damage\n* Metastasis\n* Obstructive jaundice\n* Poisoning from organophosphates (chemicals found in some pesticides)\n* Inflammation that accompanies some diseases\n\nSmaller decreases may be due to:\n\n* Pregnancy\n* Use of birth control pills\n\n---\n\n**Cholinesterase - Blood Test**\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted.

    "content": "**Chondroitin Sulfate**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nChondroitin sulfate is a chemical found in human and animal cartilage. It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis.\n\n* Chondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of cartilage.\n* In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down.\n* Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown.\n* It is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage. It can also be made in a lab.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\n* The effectiveness ratings for CHONDROITIN SULFATE are as follows:\n\t+ Possibly effective for...\n\t\t- Cataracts. An injectable solution containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate is approved by the FDA to protect the eye during cataract surgery.\n\t\t- Osteoarthritis. Taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth seems to provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain and improve function.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* When taken by mouth: Chondroitin sulfate is likely safe when used for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea.\n* Other possible side effects include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.\n* Special precautions & warnings:\n\t+ Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\t+ Asthma: There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\n* There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate interacts with medications.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n* There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate interacts with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\n* There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate interacts with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\n* Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts.\n* It is often used together with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides, or glucosamine.\n\n---\n\n**Chondroitin Sulfate: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Pregnancy and Breast-Feeding**\n\n*   Chondroitin sulfate is not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\n**Asthma**\n\n*   There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously.\n\n**Prostate Cancer**\n\n*   Early research suggests that chondroitin might cause the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer. This effect has not been shown with chondroitin sulfate supplements. However, until more is known, do not take chondroitin sulfate if you have prostate cancer or are at high risk for developing it (you have a brother or father with prostate cancer).\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Moderate**: Be cautious with this combination.\n    *   Warfarin (Coumadin)\n        *   Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. There are several reports showing that taking chondroitin with glucosamine increases the effects of warfarin. This can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious. Don't take chondroitin if you are taking warfarin.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   **Moderate**: Be cautious with this combination.\n    *   Glucosamine\n        *   Taking chondroitin sulfate together with glucosamine hydrochloride might reduce blood levels of glucosamine. But it's not clear if this will change the effects of glucosamine hydrochloride. It's also not clear if this interaction occurs with other forms of glucosamine, such as glucosamine sulfate.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\n*   There are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n*   Chondroitin sulfate is most commonly used by adults in doses of 800-1200 mg per day, for up to 2 years.\n*   There is concern that some chondroitin sulfate products are not labeled accurately. Some products might contain no chondroitin, while other products might contain more than the amount stated on the product's label. Because of these issues, the effects of different chondroitin products may vary.

You can choose from several different types of PCPs:\n\n*   Family doctors\n*   Internists\n*   Pediatricians\n*   Obstetricians and gynecologists\n\nWhen choosing a PCP, consider the following factors:\n\n*   **Availability**: Is the PCP's office conveniently located for you? Do they have evening or weekend hours that fit your schedule?\n*   **Communication style**: Do you feel comfortable with the PCP's communication style? Do they listen to your concerns and answer your questions clearly?\n*   **Bedside manner**: Does the PCP show empathy and kindness towards their patients?\n*   **Insurance coverage**: Is the PCP part of your insurance plan? Are there any out-of-pocket costs you need to consider?\n*   **Referral network**: If you need to see a specialist, does the PCP have a good referral network?\n\nYou can get referrals to a PCP from:\n\n*   Friends or family members who have seen them\n*   Your health insurance provider\n*   A hospital or clinic where you've received care\n\nAnother option is to request an appointment to \"interview\" a potential provider. There may be no cost to do this, or you may be charged a co-payment or other small fee. Some practices, particularly pediatric practice groups, may have an open house where you have an opportunity to meet several of the providers in that particular group.\n\nIf a health care problem comes up and you do not have a primary provider, in most cases, it is best to seek non-emergency care from an urgent care center rather than a hospital emergency room. This will often save you time and money. In recent years, many emergency rooms have expanded their services to include urgent care within the emergency room itself or an adjoining area. To find out, contact the hospital first.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Goldman L, Cooney KA, Bibbins-Domingo K, et al.

But even if you and your health care provider planned for you to go home, your recovery may be slower than expected. So, you may need to go to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility.\n\n**Plan Ahead**\n\nIf your surgery is planned ahead of time (elective), discuss discharge arrangements with your providers in the weeks beforehand. They can tell you whether going straight home will be good for you.\n\nIf your stay in the hospital was not planned, you or your family should discuss discharge arrangements with your provider as soon as possible during your time in the hospital. Most hospitals have staff who coordinate discharge planning.\n\nPlanning ahead helps ensure you can go to a place that provides high-quality care and is located where you would like it to be. Keep in mind:\n\n* You should have more than one choice. If there is no bed available in the skilled nursing facility that is your first choice, the hospital will need to discharge you to another qualified facility.\n* Make sure the hospital staff knows about the places you have chosen.\n* Have someone check if your health insurance will cover your stay at the facility.\n\n**Choosing the Right Facility for You**\n\nIt is always a good idea to check out different skilled nursing facilities.

They specialize in caring for women during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.\n* **Family Practice Doctor**: A doctor who has studied family medicine. They can treat many illnesses and conditions, including prenatal care, childbirth, and post-delivery care for newborns.\n* **Certified Nurse-Midwife (CNM)**: Trained in nursing and midwifery, CNMs provide primary care during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. They view pregnancy and childbirth as normal processes and aim to minimize interventions.\n\nConsider the following factors when choosing a provider:\n\n* **Risk Factors**: If you have preexisting medical conditions or previous complicated pregnancies, an obstetrician may be the best choice.\n* **Delivery Location**: If you want to deliver at a specific hospital or birthing center, choose a provider who has privileges there.\n* **Natural Childbirth**: If you want a natural childbirth experience, a certified nurse-midwife (CNM) may be the best fit.\n\n**Obstetricians**\n\nAn obstetrician is a doctor with special training in women's health and pregnancy. They specialize in caring for women during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Some OBs have advanced training in high-risk pregnancies and are called maternal-fetal medicine specialists or perinatologists.\n\nWomen may be advised to see an OB specialist if they:\n\n* Had a previous complicated pregnancy\n* Are expecting twins, triplets, or more\n* Have a preexisting medical condition\n* Need to have a cesarean delivery (C-section), or had one in the past\n\n**Family Physicians**\n\nA family physician is a doctor who has studied family medicine. They can treat many illnesses and conditions, including prenatal care, childbirth, and post-delivery care for newborns.\n\nSome family doctors also take care of women who are pregnant.

You may choose an obstetrician, family practice doctor, or certified nurse-midwife.\n\n**Obstetricians**\n\nAn obstetrician (also called OB, obstetrician-gynecologist, or OB-GYN) is a doctor who has special training in women's health and pregnancy. They specialize in both caring for women during pregnancy and labor and delivering their babies. Some OBs have advanced training in caring for high-risk pregnancies, known as maternal-fetal medicine specialists or perinatologists.\n\nWomen may be advised to see such an OB specialist if they:\n\n* Had a previous complicated pregnancy\n* Are expecting twins, triplets, or more\n* Have a preexisting medical condition\n* Need to have a cesarean delivery (C-section), or had one in the past\n\n**Family Physicians**\n\nThe family physician (FP) is a doctor who has studied family medicine. This doctor can treat many illnesses and conditions, and treats men and women of all ages. Some family doctors also take care of women who are pregnant.\n\nMany will care for you during your pregnancy and when you deliver your baby. Others provide prenatal care only and have an OB or certified nurse-midwife care for you during the birth of your baby.

Women who want to have as natural a childbirth as possible may choose a CNM. Midwives view pregnancy and childbirth as normal processes, and they help women safely deliver without treatments or minimize their use.\n\nThey are trained to be the primary care person during labor and delivery. Treatments may include:\n\n* Pain medicines\n* Vacuum or forceps to aid the delivery\n\nMost nurse midwives work with OBs. If complications or medical conditions develop during pregnancy, the woman will be referred to an OB for a consult or to take over her care.

The choices available to you may differ depending on your local resources.\n\n**Review Date:** 10/15/2024\n\n---\n\n**Choosing the Right Health Care Provider for Pregnancy and Childbirth**\n\nWhen it comes to pregnancy and childbirth, choosing the right health care provider is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the options available to women and help them make an informed decision.\n\n**What are my options?**\n\nThere are several types of health care providers that can attend to your pregnancy and childbirth needs. Here are some of the most common ones:\n\n*   **OB-GYNs (Obstetricians and Gynecologists)**: These medical doctors specialize in women's reproductive health, including pregnancy, childbirth, and gynecological issues.\n*   **Nurse Midwives**: Trained professionals who provide prenatal care, deliver babies, and offer postpartum care. They often work alongside OB-GYNs and may refer patients to them if complications arise.\n\n**What are the benefits of choosing a nurse midwife?**\n\nIf you're considering a natural childbirth experience, a nurse midwife might be an excellent choice for you. Here are some benefits:\n\n*   **Natural approach**: Nurse midwives view pregnancy and childbirth as normal processes, minimizing interventions whenever possible.\n*   **Primary care provider**: They are trained to be your primary care person during labor and delivery, providing continuous support and care.\n\n**When should I consider an OB-GYN?**\n\nWhile nurse midwives can attend to most pregnancy and childbirth needs, there may be situations where an OB-GYN's expertise is necessary. These include:\n\n*   **Complications or medical conditions**: If you develop any complications or medical conditions during pregnancy, your nurse midwife will refer you to an OB-GYN for consultation or further care.\n*   **C-Section**: In cases where a C-section is required, an OB-GYN will perform the procedure.\n\n**Making an informed decision**\n\nUltimately, the choice between a nurse midwife and an OB-GYN depends on your individual needs and preferences. Consider factors such as:\n\n*   Your health status and any pre-existing conditions\n*   The level of care you require during pregnancy and childbirth\n*   Your personal preferences regarding interventions and natural approaches\n\nBy understanding your options and making an informed decision, you can ensure the best possible outcome for yourself and your baby.",

    "content": "**Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)?**\n\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a genetic test done during pregnancy. This test checks chorionic villus cells to see if your baby has certain health conditions. Chorionic villus cells are found in the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).\n\n**The Test**\n\nThe test looks for abnormalities in your baby's chromosomes. Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes, with one set coming from each parent.\n\nThe chorionic villi cells in the placenta contain the same chromosomes as your developing baby. So, a CVS test can show if your baby has an extra chromosome or a missing or damaged chromosome. These chromosome differences can cause serious health problems.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nCVS testing is used to diagnose chromosome problems or other genetic diseases in developing babies. These include:\n\n*   Down syndrome (also called Trisomy 21), a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome or a piece of a chromosome.\n*   Cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease that's inherited (passed down through families).\n*   Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited red blood cell disorders.\n*   Tay-Sachs disease, a disorder that causes fatty proteins to build up in the brain.\n*   Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), a condition that causes the baby to have growth delays while developing.\n\n**Why do I need a CVS test?**\n\nA CVS test is not a routine pregnancy test. But your health care provider may recommend CVS testing if you are at higher risk for having a baby with a chromosome disorder. The risk factors include:\n\n*   Your age. If you are age 35 and older, you have a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome or another genetic disorder.\n*   A family history of a genetic disorder.\n*   Having another child with a genetic disorder.\n\n**What happens during a CVS test?**\n\nYour provider will use an ultrasound to check your baby's position and guide the procedure. An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to look at your tissues and organs. The test usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.\n\nThere are two types of CVS tests:\n\n*   Transabdominal (through your abdomen). A long, thin needle is guided through your abdomen to take a sample.\n*   Transcervical (through your vagina). A thin catheter is guided through your cervix to your placenta to take a sample. This is the most common method.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nCVS is generally considered to be a safe procedure, but it does have some risks. These include:\n\n*   Miscarriage (this is a small risk).\n*   Infection.\n*   Bleeding.\n*   Rh sensitization. This is a condition in which your body makes antibodies that attack your baby's red blood cells.\n*   Limb defects in the baby (this is very rare).\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nCVS test results are usually available within two weeks.\n\nIf your CVS test results were normal, it is unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested. But it does not guarantee that your baby won't have any health problems.\n\nIf your results were not normal, it may mean your baby has a chromosome or genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis.\n\nOccasionally, CVS test results are unclear, and your provider may recommend amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is another prenatal diagnostic test that checks the amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby). It is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n**Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**\n\n\\n\\n**What is CVS?**\n\nCVS is a prenatal diagnostic test that checks chorionic villus cells to see if your baby has certain health conditions.

These include:\n\n*   Miscarriage\n*   Infection\n*   Bleeding\n*   Rh sensitization\n*   Limb defects in the baby (very rare)\n\nCall your provider if you have chills, contractions, a fever, or amniotic fluid leaking after the procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**\n\n**What is CVS?**\n\nChorionic villus sampling, or CVS, is a prenatal diagnostic test that checks for chromosome and genetic disorders in the fetus. It involves removing a small sample of cells from the placenta.\n\n**How is CVS performed?**\n\nThe procedure takes about 30 minutes to an hour to perform. You will be given local anesthesia to numb the area where the needle will be inserted. A thin needle is then inserted through your abdomen and into the placenta, where it collects a small sample of cells.\n\n**What are the risks of CVS?**\n\nWhile CVS is considered safe, there are some risks associated with the procedure. These include:\n\n* Chills\n* Contractions\n* Fever\n* Amniotic fluid leaking after the procedure\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to call your provider.\n\n**When can I expect my CVS test results?**\n\nCVS test results are usually available within two weeks.\n\n**What do normal CVS test results mean?**\n\nIf your CVS test results were normal, it is unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested. However, it does not guarantee that your baby won't have any health problems.\n\n**What do abnormal CVS test results mean?**\n\nIf your results were not normal, it may mean your baby has a chromosome or genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Occasionally, CVS test results are unclear. What happens then?**\n\nIn some cases, the test results may be unclear, and your provider may recommend amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is another prenatal diagnostic test that checks the amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby). It is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy.\n\n**If I have questions about my CVS results, what should I do?**\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. They can help you understand what your test results mean and what steps to take next.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about CVS testing?**\n\nSome chromosome and genetic disorders require extensive medical treatments for the baby. Other disorders may not be treatable. If your CVS test results were not normal, you should talk with your provider about your options and the decisions you may need to make. It may also help to speak to a genetic counselor both before and after you get your results.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Pregnancy Association\n* Balasundaram P, Avulakunta ID.

A small sample of chorionic villi (cells) is then removed from the placenta for testing.\n\n**What are the risks associated with CVS?**\n\nThe risks associated with CVS include:\n\n*   Miscarriage: The risk of miscarriage after CVS is about 1 in 100.\n*   Infection: There is a small risk of infection with CVS, but this is rare.\n*   Bleeding: Some women may experience bleeding or spotting after the procedure.\n\n**How long does it take to get the results from CVS?**\n\nThe results from CVS can take several days to a week to come back. The exact timeframe will depend on the laboratory performing the test and the type of testing being done.\n\n**What are the considerations for CVS?**\n\nConsiderations for CVS include:\n\n*   Age: Women over 35 years old may be more likely to have chromosomal abnormalities, making CVS a good option.\n*   Family history: If there is a family history of genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities, CVS may be recommended.\n*   Previous test results: If previous prenatal tests have shown an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, CVS may be recommended.\n\n**What are the alternative names for CVS?**\n\nCVS is also known by the following names:\n\n*   CVS\n*   Pregnancy - CVS\n*   Genetic counseling - CVS\n\n**References**\n\nCheng EY.

    "content": "**Christianson Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\nChristianson syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. This condition becomes apparent in infancy. Its characteristic features include delayed development, intellectual disability, an inability to speak, problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), and difficulty standing or walking. Individuals who do learn to walk lose the ability in childhood. Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), beginning between ages 1 and 2.\n\nOther features seen in many people with Christianson syndrome include a small head size (microcephaly); a long, narrow face with prominent nose, jaw, and ears; an open mouth and uncontrolled drooling; and abnormal eye movements. Affected children often have a happy demeanor with frequent smiling and spontaneous laughter.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nChristianson syndrome is a rare condition, although the exact prevalence is unknown. The condition was first described in a South African family and has since been found people in other parts of the world.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChristianson syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called sodium/hydrogen exchanger 6 (Na+/H+ exchanger 6 or NHE6). The NHE6 protein helps exchange positively charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+) with hydrogen ions (H+) across the endosomal membrane. By controlling the amount of hydrogen ions, the NHE6 protein helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) inside endosomes.\n\nMutations in the SLC9A6 gene typically lead to an abnormally short NHE6 protein that is nonfunctional or that is broken down quickly in cells, resulting in the absence of functional NHE6 proteins. As a result, the pH in endosomes is not properly maintained. It is unclear how unregulated endosomal pH leads to neurological problems in people with Christianson syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Christianson Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nChristianson syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium/hydrogen exchanger 6 (Na+/H+ exchanger 6 or NHE6). The NHE6 protein helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) inside endosomes, which are compartments within cells that recycle proteins and other materials.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Christianson syndrome include:\n\n*   Intellectual disability\n*   Delayed speech development\n*   Seizures\n*   Muscle stiffness\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Angelman-like syndrome\n*   X-linked Intellectual deficit\n*   South African type\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Christianson syndrome\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n*   INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CHRISTIANSON TYPE; MRXSCH\n\n---\n\n**Christianson Syndrome**\n\n**What is Christianson syndrome?**\n\nChristianson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males. It is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, and various physical anomalies.\n\n**Symptoms of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of Christianson syndrome can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Intellectual disability\n* Delayed speech and language development\n* Physical anomalies such as microcephaly (small head size), seizures, and ataxia (coordination problems)\n* Behavioral problems\n\n**Causes of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nChristianson syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene. The mutation can be inherited from a parent or occur spontaneously during fetal development.\n\n**Diagnosis of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nDiagnosis of Christianson syndrome is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify the mutation in the SLC9A6 gene. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Chromosomal analysis to rule out other genetic disorders\n* Physical examination to assess for physical anomalies\n* Developmental assessment to evaluate cognitive and language skills\n\n**Treatment and Management of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nThere is no cure for Christianson syndrome, but various treatments and interventions can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* Speech and language therapy to improve communication skills\n* Occupational therapy to develop daily living skills\n* Physical therapy to address motor skill delays\n* Medications to manage seizures and behavioral problems\n\n**Prognosis of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Christianson syndrome varies depending on the severity of the symptoms. With proper treatment and support, many individuals can lead fulfilling lives and achieve their full potential.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance of Christianson Syndrome**\n\nChristianson syndrome is an X-linked disorder, meaning it is inherited in an X-linked pattern. Females can be carriers of the mutation, but they typically do not display symptoms since they have two X chromosomes, one of which is usually normal. Males, on the other hand, have only one X chromosome and are therefore more likely to express the syndrome.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Developmental Disabilities\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Movement Disorders\n* Neuromuscular Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?",

Chromosome 10 spans more than 133 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 10 likely contains 700 to 800 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 10.\n\n*   **10q26 deletion syndrome**: A condition that results from the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/chromosome/11/",
    "content": "**Chromosome 11**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 11, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 11 spans about 135 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying the genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 11 likely contains 1,300 to 1,400 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 11.\n\n* **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome**\n\t+ Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is classified as a growth disorder. Affected infants are typically larger than normal, and specific body parts may grow abnormally large on one side of the body in some people with this condition.\n\t+ It is caused by the abnormal regulation of genes on part of the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. The genes are located close together in a region designated 11p15.5.\n\t+ People normally inherit one copy of chromosome 11 from each parent. For most genes on this chromosome, both copies of the gene are active (expressed) in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy derived from the sperm cell is expressed. For other genes, only the copy derived from the egg cell is expressed.\n\t+ Researchers have determined that changes in genomic imprinting disrupt the regulation of several genes located in the 11p15.5 region, including CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1.\n\t+ About 20 percent of people who have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have cells in which both copies of chromosome 11 come from the sperm cell. This is known as uniparental disomy (UPD).\n\t+ UPD can cause people to have two active copies of some imprinted genes and no active copies of others.\n\t+ About 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement (translocation) that involves 11p15.5 or abnormal copying (duplication) or deletion of genetic material in this region.\n* **Emanuel Syndrome**\n\t+ Emanuel syndrome is caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell.\n\t+ In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 22 that is attached to a piece of chromosome 11. The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.\n\t+ People with Emanuel syndrome typically inherit the der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent.\n\t+ The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation.\n\t+ No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Ewing Sarcoma**: A translocation involving chromosome 11 can cause a type of cancerous tumor known as Ewing sarcoma. These tumors develop in bones or soft tissues, such as nerves and cartilage. This translocation, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the EWSR1 gene from chromosome 22 with part of the FLI1 gene from chromosome 11, creating the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene.\n* **Jacobsen Syndrome**: People with Jacobsen syndrome have a variety of signs and symptoms, including cognitive impairment, delayed development of certain skills, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. This condition, which is also known as 11q terminal deletion disorder, is caused by a deletion of genetic material at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11.\n* **Neuroblastoma**: About 35 percent of people with neuroblastoma have a deletion of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11q23. Neuroblastoma is a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts).\n* **Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome**: Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is caused by the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11p11.2. This condition is also known as proximal 11p deletion syndrome.\n* **Silver-Russell Syndrome**: Like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome can be caused by changes in the 11p15.5 region. Specifically, Silver-Russell syndrome has been associated with changes that affect the H19 and IGF2 genes.\n* **WAGR Syndrome**: WAGR syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11p13. WAGR syndrome is a disorder that affects many body systems and is named for its main features: a childhood kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor, an eye problem called aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and a range of developmental delays.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nChanges in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 11 can have various effects, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, slow growth, distinctive facial features, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). These changes include:\n\n*   **Partial Trisomy 11**: an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell\n*   **Partial Monosomy 11**: a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell\n*   **Ring Chromosome 11**: a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 11 have been identified in other types of cancer. These chromosomal changes are somatic, meaning they occur in non-reproductive cells.\n\n*   **Translocations**: genetic material is transferred between chromosome 11 and other chromosomes, associated with cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas)\n\n**Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome**\n\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is classified as a growth disorder. Affected infants are typically larger than normal, and specific body parts may grow abnormally large on one side of the body in some people with this condition.\n\n*   **Causes**: abnormal regulation of genes on part of the short (p) arm of chromosome 11\n*   **Genes involved**: CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1\n*   **Uniparental Disomy (UPD)**: about 20 percent of people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have cells in which both copies of chromosome 11 come from the sperm cell\n*   **Chromosomal abnormalities**: about 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a rearrangement (translocation), duplication, or deletion of genetic material in the 11p15.5 region\n\n**Emanuel Syndrome**\n\nEmanuel syndrome is caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell.\n\n*   **Derivative 22 chromosome**: an extra chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 22 attached to a piece of chromosome 11\n*   **Inheritance**: typically inherited from an unaffected parent\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Emanuel Syndrome**: A genetic disorder caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell.\n\t+ People with Emanuel syndrome typically inherit the der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent.\n\t+ The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation.\n\t+ As the translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced.\n\t+ Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 in the form of a der(22) chromosome.\n\t+ These individuals have two copies of chromosome 11, two copies of chromosome 22, and extra genetic material from the der(22) chromosome.\n\t+ As a result of the extra chromosomal material, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies.\n\t+ The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to intellectual disabilities and birth defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Ewing Sarcoma**: A type of cancerous tumor that develops in bones or soft tissues, such as nerves and cartilage.\n\t+ A translocation involving chromosome 11 can cause Ewing sarcoma.\n\t+ This translocation, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the EWSR1 gene from chromosome 22 with part of the FLI1 gene from chromosome 11, creating the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene.\n\t+ The protein produced from the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene, called EWS/FLI, has functions of the proteins produced from both genes.\n\t+ The abnormal gene activity affects cell growth and division, resulting in tumor development.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n**Jacobsen Syndrome**\n\nPeople with Jacobsen syndrome have a variety of signs and symptoms, including cognitive impairment, delayed development of certain skills, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. This condition, which is also known as 11q terminal deletion disorder, is caused by a deletion of genetic material at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11.\n\nThe size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, with most affected people missing about 5 million to 16 million DNA building blocks (base pairs). In almost all affected people, the deletion includes the tip of chromosome 11, although deletions within the chromosome (interstitial deletions) can also cause the condition. Larger deletions tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms than smaller deletions.\n\nThe features of Jacobsen syndrome are likely related to the loss of multiple genes on chromosome 11. The deleted region can contain from about 170 to more than 340 genes. Genes in this region appear to be critical for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain, facial features, and heart.\n\n**Neuroblastoma**\n\nAbout 35 percent of people with neuroblastoma have a deletion of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11q23. Neuroblastoma is a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). The deletion of genetic material on chromosome 11 can occur in the body's cells after conception or it can be inherited from a parent.\n\nThis deletion is associated with a more severe form of neuroblastoma than that caused by variants in single genes. It is unknown how a deletion of this region contributes to the formation or progression of neuroblastoma.\n\n**Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome**\n\nPotocki-Shaffer syndrome is caused by the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11p11.2. This condition is also known as proximal 11p deletion syndrome. The characteristic features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include enlarged openings in the two bones that make up much of the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina), multiple noncancerous bone tumors called osteochondromas, intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, a distinctive facial appearance, and problems with vision.\n\nOccasionally, people with this condition have defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract. The features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome result from the loss of several genes on the short arm of chromosome 11. In particular, the deletion of a gene called ALX4 causes enlarged parietal foramina in people with this condition, loss of the EXT2 gene causes the osteochondromas, and deletion of the PHF21A gene is responsible for the intellectual disabilities and distinctive facial features.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 6/10)**\n\n**Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome**\n\nPotocki-Shaffer syndrome is caused by the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11p11.2. This condition is also known as proximal 11p deletion syndrome.\n\nThe characteristic features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include:\n\n* Enlarged openings in the two bones that make up much of the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina)\n* Multiple noncancerous bone tumors called osteochondromas\n* Intellectual disabilities\n* Developmental delays\n* A distinctive facial appearance\n* Problems with vision\n\nOccasionally, people with this condition have defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.\n\nThe features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome result from the loss of several genes on the short arm of chromosome 11. In particular:\n\n* The deletion of a gene called ALX4 causes enlarged parietal foramina in people with this condition\n* Loss of the EXT2 gene causes the osteochondromas\n* Deletion of the PHF21A gene is responsible for the intellectual disabilities and distinctive facial features\n\nResearchers are working to find genes on the short arm of chromosome 11 that are associated with the other features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome.\n\n**Silver-Russell Syndrome**\n\nLike Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome can be caused by changes in the 11p15.5 region. Specifically, Silver-Russell syndrome has been associated with changes that affect the H19 and IGF2 genes.\n\nAlthough both Silver-Russell syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can be caused by abnormal regulation of these imprinted genes, the changes that lead to Silver-Russell syndrome result in slow growth before and after birth rather than overgrowth.\n\nUPD that involves chromosome 11 is a very rare cause of Silver-Russell syndrome. In these cases, people with Silver-Russell syndrome have cells in which both copies of chromosome 11 come from the egg cell. This leads to an imbalance in the activity of the imprinted genes on chromosome 11, which can cause the signs and symptoms of Silver-Russell syndrome.\n\nSome people with Silver-Russell syndrome have a rearrangement, duplication, or deletion of genetic material on chromosome 11. These changes can also disrupt the normal regulation of the H19 and IGF2 genes, causing the signs and symptoms of Silver-Russell syndrome.\n\n**WAGR Syndrome**\n\nWAGR syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 11 at a position designated 11p13. WAGR syndrome is a disorder that affects many body systems and is named for its main features: a childhood kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor, an eye problem called aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and a range of developmental delays.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of WAGR syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes from this part of the chromosome. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n**WAGR Syndrome**\n\nWAGR syndrome is a disorder that affects many body systems and is named for its main features: a childhood kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor, an eye problem called aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and a range of developmental delays. The signs and symptoms of WAGR syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes from this part of the chromosome.\n\nThe size of the deletion varies among affected individuals. Researchers have identified genes on the short arm of chromosome 11 that are associated with particular features of WAGR syndrome. The loss of the PAX6 gene disrupts normal eye development, leading to aniridia and other eye problems, and it may also affect the development of the brain. Deletion of the WT1 gene is responsible for the genitourinary abnormalities and the increased risk of Wilms tumor in affected individuals.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 11 can have a variety of effects, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, slow growth, distinctive facial features, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Changes involving chromosome 11 include an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 11), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 11), and a circular structure called a ring chromosome 11.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 11 have been identified in other types of cancer. These chromosomal changes are somatic. In some cases, translocations of genetic material between chromosome 11 and other chromosomes have been associated with cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 11**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nExpand Section\n\n* National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n1.

    "content": "**Chromosome 12**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 12, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 12 spans almost 134 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 12 likely contains 1,100 to 1,200 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 12.\n\n* **Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome**: Usually caused by the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome called an isochromosome 12p or i(12p). An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms.\n* **PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: Translocations involving chromosome 12 are involved in this type of blood cell cancer. The most common translocation that causes this condition fuses part of the PDGFRB gene from chromosome 5 with part of the ETV6 gene from chromosome 12.\n* **Other chromosomal conditions**: Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 12 can have a variety of effects on health and development, including intellectual disability, slow growth, distinctive facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), skeletal abnormalities, and heart defects.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References are not included in this cleaned output as they were not provided in the original content.)\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 12**\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 12 have been identified in several types of cancer. These genetic changes are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.\n\n* Rearrangements (translocations) of genetic material between chromosome 12 and other chromosomes are often found in certain cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).\n* Somatic mutations may lead to an extra copy of chromosome 12 (trisomy 12) in cancer cells, specifically a type of leukemia called chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n* Translocations involving chromosome 12 have also been found in solid tumors such as lipomas and liposarcomas, which are made up of fatty tissue.\n\n**Pallister-Killian Mosaic Syndrome**\n\nPallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome called an isochromosome 12p or i(12p). An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms.\n\n* Cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent.\n* In people with Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome, cells have the two usual copies of chromosome 12, but some cells also have the isochromosome 12p.\n* These cells have a total of four copies of all the genes on the p arm of chromosome 12. The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder.\n\n**PDGFRB-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia**\n\nTranslocations involving chromosome 12 are involved in a type of blood cell cancer called PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.\n\n* The most common translocation that causes this condition fuses part of the PDGFRB gene from chromosome 5 with part of the ETV6 gene from chromosome 12.\n* Translocations that fuse the PDGFRB gene with other genes can also cause PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia, but these translocations are relatively uncommon.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 12**\n\n**MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Part 3/6**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 12 can have a variety of effects on health and development.\n*   These effects include intellectual disability, slow growth, distinctive facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), skeletal abnormalities, and heart defects.\n*   Several different changes involving chromosome 12 have been reported, including an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 12), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 12), and a circular structure called a ring chromosome 12.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cancers**\n\n*   Changes in chromosome 12 have been identified in several types of cancer.\n*   These genetic changes are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.\n*   For example, rearrangements (translocations) of genetic material between chromosome 12 and other chromosomes are often found in certain cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).\n*   Additionally, somatic mutations may lead to an extra copy of chromosome 12 (trisomy 12) in cancer cells, specifically a type of leukemia called chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 12: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/6)**\n\nCategory: general\n\n**(Translocations) of genetic material between chromosome 12 and other chromosomes are often found in certain cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).

In these tumors, the most common chromosome 12 rearrangements involve the long (q) arm in a region designated q13-q15.)**\n\nAbnormalities of chromosome 12 have been identified in at least two other rare tumors, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas and clear cell sarcomas. Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas occur primarily in adolescents and young adults and are usually found in the arms and legs (extremities). Clear cell sarcomas occur most often in young adults and tend to be associated with tendons and related structures called aponeuroses.\n\nResearchers are working to determine which genes on chromosome 12 are disrupted by translocations, and they are studying how these chromosomal changes could contribute to the uncontrolled growth and division of tumor cells.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Dim DC, Cooley LD, Miranda RN.

    "content": "**Chromosome 13**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 13, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 13 is made up of about 115 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 3.5 and 4 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 13 likely contains 300 to 400 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 13.\n\n*   **8p11 Myeloproliferative Syndrome**: A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material involving chromosome 13 has been identified in most people with a rare blood cancer called 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome. This condition is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes.\n*   **Feingold Syndrome**: Feingold syndrome type 2 is caused by genetic changes that remove (delete) small pieces of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 13. These changes are known as 13q31.3 microdeletions. Feingold syndrome type 2 is characterized by abnormalities of the fingers and toes, particularly shortening of the second and fifth fingers (brachymesophalangy).\n*   **Retinoblastoma**: Retinoblastoma, a cancer of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) that affects mostly children, is caused by abnormalities of a gene called RB1. This gene is located on a region of the q arm of chromosome 13 designated 13q14.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 13**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Trisomy 13**: Trisomy 13 occurs when each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 13 instead of the usual two copies. Trisomy 13 can also result from an extra copy of chromosome 13 in only some of the body's cells (mosaic trisomy 13). In some cases, trisomy 13 occurs when chromosome 13 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in embryonic development. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 13, plus extra material from chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome.\n* **Physical signs**: The physical signs of translocation trisomy 13 may be different from those typically seen in trisomy 13 when only part of chromosome 13 is present in three copies.\n* **Research findings**: Researchers believe that extra copies of some genes on chromosome 13 disrupt the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 13 and the increased risk of medical problems associated with this disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Other chromosomal conditions**: Partial monosomy and partial trisomy of chromosome 13 occur when a portion of the q arm of this chromosome is deleted or duplicated, respectively. The effect of missing or extra chromosome material varies with the size and location of the chromosome abnormality. Affected individuals may have developmental delay, intellectual disability, low birth weight, skeletal abnormalities, and other physical features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Other cancers**: Changes in chromosome 13 have been associated with several types of cancer. These genetic changes are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. The loss of genetic material from the middle of chromosome 13 is common in cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias), cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas), and other related cancers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome**: A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material involving chromosome 13 has been identified in most people with a rare blood cancer called 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome.

    "content": "**Chromosome 14**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 14, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 14 spans more than 107 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents about 3.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 14 likely contains 800 to 900 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 14:\n\n* **FOXG1 Syndrome**\n\t+ A deletion of genetic material from part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 can cause FOXG1 syndrome, which is a rare disorder characterized by impaired development and structural brain abnormalities.\n\t+ The protein normally produced from the FOXG1 gene plays an important role in brain development before birth, particularly in a region of the embryonic brain known as the telencephalon.\n* **Multiple Myeloma**\n\t+ A rearrangement (translocation) that moves genetic material from one of several other chromosomes to a region of chromosome 14 called 14q32 occurs in 20 to 60 percent of cases of multiple myeloma, which is a cancer arising from plasma cells, a type of white blood cell.\n* **Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome**\n\t+ Ring chromosome 14 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 14 or r(14).\n\t+ A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 14**\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nA rare condition known as terminal deletion 14 syndrome causes signs and symptoms similar to those of ring chromosome 14 syndrome (described above). Terminal deletion 14 syndrome is caused by the loss of several genes at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14. In addition, some people with terminal deletion 14 syndrome have a loss or gain of genetic material from another chromosome. People with this condition may have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), a small head (microcephaly), frequent respiratory infections, developmental delay, and learning difficulties.\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 14 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, and other health problems. Several different changes involving chromosome 14 have been reported. These include an extra copy of a segment of chromosome 14 in every cell (partial trisomy 14), an extra copy of the entire chromosome in only some of the body's cells (mosaic trisomy 14), and deletions or duplications of part of chromosome 14. Full trisomy 14, an extra copy of the entire chromosome 14 in all of the body's cells, is not compatible with life.\n\nHealth problems can also result from a chromosome abnormality called uniparental disomy (UPD). UPD occurs when people inherit both copies of a chromosome from one parent instead of one copy from each parent. The long arm of chromosome 14 contains some genes that are active only when inherited from the mother, and other genes that are active only when inherited from the father.\n\nWhen both copies of chromosome 14 are inherited from the mother, the phenomenon is known as maternal UPD 14. Maternal UPD 14 is associated with premature birth, slow growth before and after birth, short stature, developmental delay, small hands and feet, and early onset of puberty. When both copies of the chromosome are inherited from the father, the phenomenon is known as paternal UPD 14. Paternal UPD 14 is associated with an excess of amniotic fluid (which surrounds the baby before birth); an opening in the wall of the abdomen; distinctive facial features; a small, bell-shaped chest with short ribs; and developmental delay.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nTranslocations of genetic material between chromosome 14 and other chromosomes have been associated with several types of cancer. Studies show that these translocations disrupt genes that are critical for keeping cell growth and division under control. Unregulated cell division can lead to the development of cancer.\n\nTranslocations involving chromosome 14 have been found in cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias), cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas), and several related diseases. For example, Burkitt lymphoma, a cancer of white blood cells that occurs most often in children and young adults, is related to a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14. Another type of lymphoma, called follicular lymphoma, is often associated with a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18.\n\n**FOXG1 Syndrome**\n\nA deletion of genetic material from part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 can cause FOXG1 syndrome, which is a rare disorder characterized by impaired development and structural brain abnormalities. The region of chromosome 14 that is deleted includes the FOXG1 gene as well as several neighboring genes. Depending on which genes are involved, affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms, including distinctive facial features and a missing connection between the left and right halves of the brain (a structure called the corpus callosum).\n\nThe protein normally produced from the FOXG1 gene plays an important role in brain development before birth, particularly in a region of the embryonic brain known as the telencephalon. The telencephalon ultimately develops into several critical structures, including the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls most voluntary activity, language, sensory perception, learning, and memory. A loss of the FOXG1 gene disrupts normal brain development starting before birth, which appears to underlie the structural brain abnormalities and severe developmental problems characteristic of FOXG1 syndrome. It is unclear how the loss of additional genes contributes to the signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Multiple Myeloma**\n\nA rearrangement (translocation) that moves genetic material from one of several other chromosomes to a region of chromosome 14 called 14q32 occurs in 20 to 60 percent of cases of multiple myeloma, which is a cancer arising from plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. The translocation is somatic, which means it is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 14**\n\nMultiple Myeloma\n----------------\n\nA rearrangement (translocation) that moves genetic material from one of several other chromosomes to a region of chromosome 14 called 14q32 occurs in 20 to 60 percent of cases of multiple myeloma, which is a cancer arising from plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. The translocation is somatic, which means it is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells. The translocation likely affects genes that play a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Disruption of these genes may interfere with proper control (regulation) of cell growth and division (proliferation), resulting in the excessive proliferation of plasma cells that characterizes multiple myeloma.\n\nRing Chromosome 14 Syndrome\n---------------------------\n\n**What is Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome?**\n\nRing chromosome 14 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 14 or r(14). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 14 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.\n\n**Features of Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome**\n\nResearchers believe that several critical genes near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 are lost when the ring chromosome forms. The loss of these genes is likely responsible for several of the major features of ring chromosome 14 syndrome, including intellectual disability and delayed development.\n\nEpilepsy is a common feature of ring chromosome syndromes, including ring chromosome 14. There may be something about the ring structure itself that causes epilepsy. Seizures may occur because certain genes on the ring chromosome 14 are less active than those on the normal chromosome 14. Alternately, seizures might result from instability of the ring chromosome in some cells.\n\nOther Chromosomal Conditions\n---------------------------\n\n**Terminal Deletion 14 Syndrome**\n\nA rare condition known as terminal deletion 14 syndrome causes signs and symptoms similar to those of ring chromosome 14 syndrome (described above). Terminal deletion 14 syndrome is caused by the loss of several genes at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14. In addition, some people with terminal deletion 14 syndrome have a loss or gain of genetic material from another chromosome.\n\n**Effects of Changes in Chromosome 14**\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 14 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, and other health problems. Several different changes involving chromosome 14 have been reported, such as partial trisomy 14, mosaic trisomy 14, deletions or duplications of part of chromosome 14.\n\n**Uniparental Disomy (UPD)**\n\nHealth problems can also result from a chromosome abnormality called uniparental disomy (UPD). UPD occurs when people inherit both copies of a chromosome from one parent instead of one copy from each parent. The long arm of chromosome 14 contains some genes that are active only when inherited from the mother, and other genes that are active only when inherited from the father.\n\nWhen both copies of chromosome 14 are inherited from the mother, the phenomenon is known as maternal UPD 14. Maternal UPD 14 is associated with premature birth, slow growth before and after birth, short stature, developmental delay, small hands and feet, and early onset of puberty.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 14**\n\n**Uniparental Disomy (UPD)**\n\n* Maternal UPD 14: premature birth, slow growth before and after birth, short stature, developmental delay, small hands and feet, early onset of puberty\n* Paternal UPD 14: excess of amniotic fluid; opening in the wall of the abdomen; distinctive facial features; small, bell-shaped chest with short ribs; developmental delay\n\n**Terminal Deletion 14 Syndrome**\n\n* Caused by loss of several genes at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14\n* Similar signs and symptoms to ring chromosome 14 syndrome\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia), small head (microcephaly), frequent respiratory infections, developmental delay, learning difficulties\n\n**Other Changes in Chromosome 14**\n\n* Partial trisomy 14: extra copy of a segment of chromosome 14 in every cell\n* Mosaic trisomy 14: extra copy of the entire chromosome in only some of the body's cells\n* Deletions or duplications of part of chromosome 14\n\n**Health Problems from Chromosome Abnormalities**\n\n* Uniparental disomy (UPD): inheriting both copies of a chromosome from one parent instead of one copy from each parent\n* Missing functional genes and having an extra copy of others when inheriting two paternal or maternal copies of chromosome 14\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\n* Translocations involving chromosome 14 have been found in cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemias), cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas), and several related diseases\n* Examples include Burkitt lymphoma (translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14) and follicular lymphoma (translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18)\n\nNote: I removed the code blocks, ads, disclaimers, standalone URLs, and kept the medical information, HTML tags, and structure.

    "content": "**Chromosome 15**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 15, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 15 spans approximately 102 million DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and represents more than 3 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\nResearchers are continually improving their methods of genome sequencing and working to confirm the number of genes on each chromosome. Chromosome 15 is estimated to contain around 630 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 15:\n\n*   **15q11-q13 Duplication Syndrome**: A condition caused by the presence of at least one extra copy of a region of chromosome 15 called 15q11.2-q13.1. This region is also called the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) because genetic changes in it are also involved in conditions called Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.\n*   **15q13.3 Microdeletion**: A chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. The deletion occurs on the q arm of the chromosome at a position designated q13.3.\n\nThese conditions can result in various health problems, including weak muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disabilities, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and characteristics typical of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/10)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **15q24 microdeletion**\n    A 15q24 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. Specifically, affected individuals are missing between 1.7 Mb and 6.1 Mb of DNA at position q24 on chromosome 15. The exact size of the deletion varies, but all individuals are missing the same 1.2 Mb region.\n*   **Acute promyelocytic leukemia**\n    A type of blood cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17. This translocation, written as t(15;17), fuses part of the PML gene from chromosome 15 with part of the RARA gene from chromosome 17.\n*   **Angelman syndrome**\n    Angelman syndrome is a condition that results from a loss of gene activity (expression) in a specific part of chromosome 15 in each cell. This region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13.\n*   **Deafness-infertility syndrome**\n    Deafness-infertility syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the q arm of chromosome 15. The symptoms of deafness-infertility syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes in this region.\n*   **Prader-Willi syndrome**\n    Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a loss of active genes in a region of chromosome 15. This region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15**\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nChanges in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 15 can cause intellectual disabilities, delayed growth and development, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features. These changes include:\n\n*   **Partial Trisomy 15**: An extra copy of part of chromosome 15 in each cell.\n*   **Partial Monosomy 15**: A missing segment of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Ring Chromosome 15**: A circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together.\n\n**15q11-q13 Duplication Syndrome**\n\nDuplication of a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 can result in 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (also called dup15q syndrome). The features of this condition include:\n\n*   **Weak Muscle Tone**: Hypotonia\n*   **Intellectual Disabilities**\n*   **Recurrent Seizures**: Epilepsy\n*   **Characteristics Typical of Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nDup15q syndrome is caused by the presence of at least one extra copy of a region of chromosome 15 called 15q11.2-q13.1. This region is also called the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) because genetic changes in it are also involved in conditions called Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.\n\n**Causes of Duplication Syndrome**\n\nThe most common chromosome abnormality that leads to 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication, occurring in about 80 percent of people with dup15q syndrome, is called an isodicentric chromosome 15. An isodicentric chromosome contains mirror-image segments of genetic material and has two constriction points (centromeres), rather than the single centromere found in normal chromosomes.\n\nIn about 20 percent of cases of dup15q syndrome, the duplication occurs on the q arm of one of the two copies of chromosome 15 in each cell; this situation is called an interstitial duplication. In these cases, cells have two copies of chromosome 15, one of which has an extra copy of the segment of genetic material, for a total of three copies of the duplicated segment.\n\n**Genetic Material and Development**\n\nIn all cases of dup15q syndrome, the duplicated genetic material results in extra copies of certain genes involved in development. This extra genetic material disrupts normal development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder. People with dup15q syndrome caused by an interstitial duplication often have milder signs and symptoms than those with an isodicentric chromosome 15.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15**\n\n**Isodicentric Chromosome 15**\nThe most common chromosome abnormality that leads to 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication, occurring in about 80 percent of people with dup15q syndrome, is called an isodicentric chromosome 15.

This extra genetic material disrupts normal development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder. People with dup15q syndrome caused by an interstitial duplication often have milder signs and symptoms than those with an isodicentric chromosome 15.\n\n**15q13.3 Microdeletion**\n\nA 15q13.3 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. The deletion occurs on the q arm of the chromosome at a position designated q13.3. Most people with a 15q13.3 microdeletion are missing a sequence of about 2 million DNA nucleotides, also written as 2 megabases (Mb). The exact size of the deleted region varies, but it typically contains at least six genes.\n\n**Characteristics**\nIt is unclear how a loss of these genes increases the risk of intellectual disabilities, seizures, behavioral problems, and psychiatric disorders in some individuals with a 15q13.3 microdeletion. Other people with a 15q13.3 microdeletion have no obvious signs or symptoms related to the chromosomal change.\n\n**15q24 Microdeletion**\n\nA 15q24 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. Specifically, affected individuals are missing between 1.7 Mb and 6.1 Mb of DNA at position q24 on chromosome 15.\n\n**Characteristics**\nThe exact size of the deletion varies, but all individuals are missing the same 1.2 Mb region. This region contains several genes that are thought to be important for normal development. It is unclear how a loss of these genes leads to the intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, and other abnormalities often seen in people with a 15q24 microdeletion.\n\n**Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nA type of blood cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17. This translocation, written as t(15;17), fuses part of the PML gene from chromosome 15 with part of the RARA gene from chromosome 17.\n\n**Characteristics**\nThe protein produced from this fused gene is known as PML-RARα. The PML-RARα protein functions differently than the proteins produced from the normal PML and RARA genes. The PML gene on chromosome 15 provides instructions for a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15**\n\n**Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nA type of blood cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17. This translocation, written as t(15;17), fuses part of the PML gene from chromosome 15 with part of the RARA gene from chromosome 17.\n\nThe protein produced from this fused gene is known as PML-RARalpha. The PML-RARα protein functions differently than the proteins produced from the normal PML and RARA genes.\n\n* The PML gene on chromosome 15 provides instructions for a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n* The PML protein blocks cell growth and division (proliferation) and induces self-destruction (apoptosis) in combination with other proteins.\n* The RARA gene on chromosome 17 provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα).\n* Normally, the RARα protein controls the activity of genes that are important for the maturation (differentiation) of immature white blood cells beyond a particular stage called the promyelocyte.\n\nThe PML-RARα protein interferes with the normal function of both the PML and the RARα proteins. As a result, blood cells are stuck at the promyelocyte stage, and they proliferate abnormally. Excess promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow, and normal white blood cells cannot form, leading to acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n\n**Angelman Syndrome**\n\nAngelman syndrome is a condition that results from a loss of gene activity (expression) in a specific part of chromosome 15 in each cell. This region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13. This region contains a gene called UBE3A.\n\nNormally, both the egg and sperm cells each contribute one copy of the UBE3A gene during fertilization, and both copies of this gene are active in most of the body's tissues. However, in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord, only the copy derived from the egg cell is active.\n\nIf this copy is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene variant, a person will have no working copies of the UBE3A gene in some parts of the brain.\n\nIn most cases (about 70 percent), Angelman syndrome is a result of a deletion in the copy of chromosome 15 derived from the egg cell. This chromosomal change deletes the region of chromosome 15 that includes the UBE3A gene.\n\nBecause the copy of the UBE3A gene derived from the sperm cell is normally inactive in certain parts of the brain, a deletion in the copy of chromosome 15 from the egg cell leaves no active copies of the UBE3A gene in these brain regions.\n\nIn 3 percent to 7 percent of cases of Angelman syndrome, the condition occurs when a person has two copies of chromosome 15 derived from the sperm cell instead of one copy from the egg and sperm cell. This phenomenon is called uniparental disomy (UPD). People with UPD for chromosome 15 have two copies of the UBE3A gene, but because both of those copies are derived from sperm cells, they are therefore inactive in the brain.\n\nAbout 10 percent of cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by a variant in the UBE3A gene, and another 3 percent are caused by a defect in the DNA region that controls the activation of the UBE3A gene and other genes on the copy of chromosome 15 that is derived from egg cells. In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome is caused by a translocation or by a variant in a gene other than UBE3A. These genetic changes abnormally inactivate the UBE3A gene.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15**\n\nThis region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13. This region contains a gene called UBE3A.\n\n**Normally Active Genes in Nerve Cells**\n\nNormally, both the egg and sperm cells each contribute one copy of the UBE3A gene during fertilization, and both copies of this gene are active in most of the body's tissues. However, in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord, only the copy derived from the egg cell is active.\n\n**Loss of Gene Activity**\n\nIf this copy is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene variant, a person will have no working copies of the UBE3A gene in some parts of the brain. This can lead to Angelman syndrome, a condition that results from a loss of gene activity (expression) in a specific part of chromosome 15 in each cell.\n\n**Causes of Angelman Syndrome**\n\nIn most cases (about 70 percent), Angelman syndrome is a result of a deletion in the copy of chromosome 15 derived from the egg cell. This chromosomal change deletes the region of chromosome 15 that includes the UBE3A gene.\n\nIn 3 percent to 7 percent of cases of Angelman syndrome, the condition occurs when a person has two copies of chromosome 15 derived from the sperm cell instead of one copy from the egg and sperm cell. This phenomenon is called uniparental disomy (UPD).\n\nAbout 10 percent of cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by a variant in the UBE3A gene, and another 3 percent are caused by a defect in the DNA region that controls the activation of the UBE3A gene and other genes on the copy of chromosome 15 that is derived from egg cells.\n\n**Deafness-Infertility Syndrome**\n\nDeafness-infertility syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the q arm of chromosome 15. The symptoms of deafness-infertility syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes in this region. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.\n\nResearchers have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 15, STRC, is responsible for hearing loss in affected individuals. The loss of another gene, CATSPER2, in the same region of chromosome 15, can lead to abnormalities in sperm. People with this deletion are unable to conceive children (a condition called infertility).\n\n**Prader-Willi Syndrome**\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by a loss of active genes in a region of chromosome 15. This region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13. It is the same part of chromosome 15 that is usually affected in people with Angelman syndrome, although different genes are associated with the two disorders.\n\nPeople can have either Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome, but they typically cannot have both. Normally, both the egg and sperm cells each contribute one copy of chromosome 15 during fertilization. Some genes on this chromosome are active only on the copy from the sperm cell.\n\nIn about 70 percent of cases, Prader-Willi syndrome occurs when the 15q11-q13 region in the copy of chromosome 15 that is derived from the sperm cell is deleted. A person with this chromosomal change will be missing certain critical genes in this region because the genes on the copy from the egg cell are turned off (inactive).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 7/10)**\n\n**Prader-Willi Syndrome**\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by a loss of active genes in a region of chromosome 15. This region is located on the q arm of the chromosome and is designated 15q11-q13. It is the same part of chromosome 15 that is usually affected in people with Angelman syndrome, although different genes are associated with the two disorders. People can have either Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome, but they typically cannot have both.\n\nNormally, both the egg and sperm cells each contribute one copy of chromosome 15 during fertilization. Some genes on this chromosome are active only on the copy from the sperm cell. In about 70 percent of cases, Prader-Willi syndrome occurs when the 15q11-q13 region in the copy of chromosome 15 that is derived from the sperm cell is deleted. A person with this chromosomal change will be missing certain critical genes in this region because the genes on the copy from the egg cell are turned off (inactive). Researchers are working to identify which missing genes are associated with the characteristic features of Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nIn about 25 percent of cases, people with Prader-Willi syndrome have two copies of chromosome 15 derived from the egg cell instead of one copy from the egg and sperm cell. This phenomenon is called UPD. A person with two copies of chromosome 15 derived from the egg cell will have no active copies of certain genes in the 15q11-q13 region.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a translocation. Rarely, the condition results from a variant or other change that abnormally inactivates genes on the copy of chromosome 15 derived from the sperm cell.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 15 can cause intellectual disabilities, delayed growth and development, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features. These changes include an extra copy of part of chromosome 15 in each cell (partial trisomy 15), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 15), and a circular structure called ring chromosome 15. A ring chromosome occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 15**\n\n**MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 8/10)**\n\n**General Information**\n\n* Chromosome 15 is a significant chromosome in the human genome, associated with various genetic disorders and conditions.\n* This article provides an overview of the genetic information related to chromosome 15.\n\n**Resources**\n\n* **National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities**\n\t+ A comprehensive resource on chromosome abnormalities, including those affecting chromosome 15.\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ A collection of scientific articles on PubMed related to chromosome 15 and its associated disorders.\n\n**References**\n\n* **Battaglia A.

    "content": "**Chromosome 16**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 16, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 16 spans more than 90 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents almost 3 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 16 likely contains 800 to 900 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 16.\n\n*   **16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   A deletion of about 600,000 base pairs at position 11.2 on the short (p) arm of chromosome 16.\n    *   This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell.\n    *   The 600 kb region contains more than 25 genes, and in many cases little is known about their function.\n    *   Features include delayed development; intellectual disability; and autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction. Obesity is another common feature of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome; individuals with the deletion also have an increased risk of seizures.\n*   **16p11.2 Duplication**\n    *   An extra copy of the same 600 kb segment of chromosome 16 that is missing in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (described above).\n    *   A 16p11.2 duplication may result in similar signs and symptoms as the deletion in some affected individuals, including features of autism spectrum disorder.\n    *   Being underweight is common in people with the duplication, while obesity often occurs with the deletion.\n*   **16p12.2 Microdeletion**\n    *   A small amount of missing genetic material on the p arm of chromosome 16 causes a condition called 16p12.2 microdeletion.\n    *   People with this chromosomal abnormality are missing a sequence of about 520,000 base pairs at position p12.2 on chromosome 16.\n    *   The deleted region contains seven genes.\n    *   This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell.\n    *   Signs and symptoms that can result from a 16p12.2 microdeletion are generally related to the loss of one or more genes in this region.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins**: A disorder that affects the development of blood vessels in the lungs. It can be caused by a deletion of genetic material on chromosome 16 in a region known as 16q24.1.\n* **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia (CBF-AML)**: A type of blood cancer associated with rearrangements of genetic material on chromosome 16, including inversions and translocations that result in the fusion of genes CBFB and MYH11.\n* **Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome**: Some cases have resulted from a deletion of genetic material from the p arm of chromosome 16, causing serious complications such as failure to thrive and increased risk of life-threatening infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cancers**\n\n* Changes in the structure of chromosome 16 are associated with several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other chromosomal conditions**\n\n*   **Trisomy 16**: occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 16 instead of the usual two copies. Full trisomy 16, which occurs when all of the body's cells contain an extra copy of chromosome 16, causes serious health problems. Most affected individuals die before or shortly after birth, although some have lived for weeks or months with intensive medical support.\n*   **Mosaic trisomy 16**: a similar but less severe condition that occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 16. The signs and symptoms of mosaic trisomy 16 vary widely and can include slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation), delayed development, and heart defects.\n*   **Partial trisomy 16p or 16q**: a frequent change to chromosome 16 that includes an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Partial monosomy 16q**: a frequent change to chromosome 16 that includes a missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Chromosome 16p13.3 duplication syndrome**\n\n*   A condition caused by a genetic change where a region of DNA on chromosome 16 that includes the CREBBP gene is copied (duplicated) in some people.\n*   Characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, abnormal thumbs, and rigid joints (arthrogryposis).\n*   Some affected individuals also have abnormalities of the heart, genitals, roof of the mouth, or the eyes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**16p11.2 deletion syndrome**\n\n*   Caused by a deletion of about 600,000 base pairs at position 11.2 on the short (p) arm of chromosome 16.\n*   Affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell.\n*   The 600 kb region contains more than 25 genes, and in many cases little is known about their function.\n*   Features include delayed development; intellectual disability; and autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction.\n*   Obesity is another common feature of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome; individuals with the deletion also have an increased risk of seizures.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**16p11.2 duplication**\n\n*   An extra copy of the same 600 kb segment of chromosome 16 that is missing in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.\n*   May result in similar signs and symptoms as the deletion in some affected individuals, including features of autism spectrum disorder; however, being underweight is common in people with the duplication, while obesity often occurs with the deletion.\n*   The 16p11.2 duplication appears to have a milder effect than the deletion, with a higher proportion of individuals with this chromosomal change showing no apparent problems.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\nA 16p11.2 duplication is an extra copy of the same 600 kb segment of chromosome 16 that is missing in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (described above). A 16p11.2 duplication may result in similar signs and symptoms as the deletion in some affected individuals, including features of autism spectrum disorder; however, being underweight is common in people with the duplication, while obesity often occurs with the deletion.\n\nThe 16p11.2 duplication appears to have a milder effect than the deletion, with a higher proportion of individuals with this chromosomal change showing no apparent problems. These individuals can still pass along the duplication to their children, who may have signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change. Researchers are working to determine how the extra genetic material contributes to the features that occur in some people with a 16p11.2 duplication, and why duplication or deletion of the same chromosomal region can have some similar effects.\n\n**16p12.2 Microdeletion**\n\nA small amount of missing genetic material on the p arm of chromosome 16 causes a condition called 16p12.2 microdeletion, which is associated with physical and developmental abnormalities in some affected individuals. People with this chromosomal abnormality are missing a sequence of about 520,000 base pairs, also written as 520 kb, at position p12.2 on chromosome 16. The deleted region contains seven genes. This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell.\n\nThe signs and symptoms that can result from a 16p12.2 microdeletion are generally related to the loss of one or more genes in this region. However, it is unclear which missing genes contribute to specific features that can occur in the disorder. Because some people with a 16p12.2 microdeletion have no obvious signs or symptoms (a situation called incomplete penetrance), researchers believe that other genetic or environmental factors may also be involved. In particular, studies indicate that individuals with a 16p12.2 microdeletion who have neurological or behavioral problems often have an additional, larger deletion or duplication affecting another chromosome. Small duplications of genetic material that occur near the 16p12.2 microdeletion may also contribute to the features associated with this condition.\n\n**Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins**\n\nAlveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a disorder that affects the development of blood vessels in the lungs. It can be caused by a deletion of genetic material on chromosome 16 in a region known as 16q24.1. This region includes several genes, including the FOXF1 gene.\n\nThe protein produced from the FOXF1 gene is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. The FOXF1 protein helps regulate the development of the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic changes that result in a nonfunctional FOXF1 protein interfere with the development of pulmonary blood vessels and cause ACD/MPV. Affected infants may also have gastrointestinal abnormalities.\n\nResearchers suggest that deletions resulting in the loss of other genes in this region of chromosome 16 probably cause the additional abnormalities seen in some infants with this disorder. Like FOXF1, these genes also provide instructions for making transcription factors that regulate development of various body systems before birth.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\n**Developmental Disorders**\n\n* **Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia/MPV**: A rare disorder characterized by underdeveloped blood vessels in the lungs, caused by a deletion of genetic material on chromosome 16.\n\t+ The FOXF1 gene is involved in this condition, and its protein helps regulate lung development.\n\t+ Infants with this disorder may also have gastrointestinal abnormalities.\n\n**Blood Cancers**\n\n* **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia (CBF-AML)**: A type of blood cancer associated with rearrangements of genetic material on chromosome 16.\n\t+ The most common rearrangement is an inversion of a region of chromosome 16 (inv(16)).\n\t+ This condition is characterized by the fusion of two genes, CBFB and MYH11, which impairs the function of core binding factor.\n\n**Rare Genetic Disorders**\n\n* **Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome**: A rare genetic disorder caused by a deletion of genetic material from the p arm of chromosome 16.\n\t+ Severe cases can cause serious complications, including failure to thrive and increased risk of infections.\n\t+ Affected individuals may also have intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\n**Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome**\n\nSome cases of severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome have resulted from a deletion of genetic material from the p arm of chromosome 16. When this deletion occurs in all of the body's cells, it can cause serious complications such as failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and an increased risk of life-threatening infections. Affected individuals also have many of the typical features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes.\n\n**Several Genes are Missing**\n\nSeveral genes are missing as a result of this deletion in the short arm of chromosome 16. The deleted region includes the CREBBP gene, which is often mutated or missing in people with the typical features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Researchers believe that the loss of additional genes in this region probably accounts for the serious complications associated with severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in the structure of chromosome 16 are associated with several types of cancer. These genetic changes are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. In some cases, chromosomal rearrangements called translocations disrupt the region of chromosome 16 that contains the CREBBP gene.\n\n**Translocation between Chromosomes 8 and 16**\n\nResearchers have found a translocation between chromosome 8 and chromosome 16 that disrupts the CREBBP gene in some people with a cancer of blood-forming cells called acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n**Treatment-Related Cancers**\n\nAnother translocation involving the CREBBP gene, which rearranges pieces of chromosomes 11 and 16, has been found in some people who have undergone cancer treatment. This chromosomal change is associated with the later development of AML and two other cancers of blood-forming tissues (chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome).\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nTrisomy 16 occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 16 instead of the usual two copies. Full trisomy 16, which occurs when all of the body's cells contain an extra copy of chromosome 16, causes serious health problems.\n\n*Mosaic Trisomy 16*\n\nA similar but less severe condition called mosaic trisomy 16 occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 16. The signs and symptoms of mosaic trisomy 16 vary widely and can include slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation), delayed development, and heart defects.\n\n**Other Changes in Chromosome 16**\n\nIntellectual disability, delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), heart defects, and other medical problems are common.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\nOther chromosomal conditions can have a variety of effects. Intellectual disability, delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), heart defects, and other medical problems are common.\n\n* Trisomy 16 occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 16 instead of the usual two copies.\n\t+ Full trisomy 16 causes serious health problems. Most affected individuals die before or shortly after birth, although some have lived for weeks or months with intensive medical support.\n\t+ A similar but less severe condition called mosaic trisomy 16 occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 16.\n* Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 16 can have a variety of effects, including:\n\t+ Intellectual disability\n\t+ Delayed growth and development\n\t+ Distinctive facial features\n\t+ Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n\t+ Heart defects\n\nFrequent changes to chromosome 16 include an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 16p or 16q) and a missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 16q).\n\nFor example, a region of DNA on chromosome 16 that includes the CREBBP gene is copied (duplicated) in some people. This genetic change causes a condition called chromosome 16p13.3 duplication syndrome, which is characterized by:\n\n* Intellectual disability\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Abnormal thumbs\n* Rigid joints (arthrogryposis)\n* Abnormalities of the heart, genitals, roof of the mouth, or eyes\n\nWhile other genes can be included in the duplicated region, depending on its size, research shows that the CREBBP gene is most likely responsible for the characteristic signs and symptoms of chromosome 16p13.3 duplication syndrome.\n\nResearchers suspect that an extra copy of the CREBBP gene leads to the production of excess CREB binding protein and an increase in protein function. The resulting changes in gene transcription and protein production likely alter development of various systems, causing the signs and symptoms of chromosome 16p13.3 duplication syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 16**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities**\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   Reilly JT.
