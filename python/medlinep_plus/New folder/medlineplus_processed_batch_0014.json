They may diet or exercise too much or use other ways to lose weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of anorexia are not known. Many factors may be involved. Genes and hormones may play a role. Social attitudes that promote very thin body types may also be involved.\n\nRisk factors for anorexia include:\n\n*   *Being more worried about, or paying more attention to, weight and body shape*\n*   *Having an anxiety disorder as a child*\n*   *Having a negative self-image*\n*   *Having eating problems during infancy or early childhood*\n*   *Having certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty*\n*   *Trying to be perfect or overly focused on rules*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person with anorexia usually:\n\n*   Has an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when underweight.\n*   Refuses to keep their weight at what is considered normal for their age and height (15% or more below the normal weight).\n*   Has a body image that is very distorted, is very focused on body weight or shape, and refuses to admit the danger of weight loss.\n\nPeople with anorexia may severely limit the amount of food they eat. Or they eat and then make themselves throw up. Other behaviors include:\n\n*   *Cutting food into small pieces or moving them around the plate instead of eating*\n*   *Exercising all the time, even when the weather is bad, they are hurt, or their schedule is busy*\n*   *Going to the bathroom right after meals*\n*   *Refusing to eat around other people*\n*   *Using pills to make themselves urinate (water pills, or diuretics), have a bowel movement (enemas and laxatives), or decrease their appetite (diet pills)*\n\nOther symptoms of anorexia may include:\n\n*   Blotchy or yellow skin that is dry and covered with fine hair\n*   Confused or slow thinking, along with poor memory or judgment\n*   Depression\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Extreme sensitivity to cold (wearing several layers of clothing to stay warm)\n*   Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis)\n*   Wasting away of muscle and loss of body fat\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests should be done to help find the cause of weight loss, or see what damage the weight loss has caused. Many of these tests will be repeated over time to monitor the person.\n\nThese tests may include:\n\n*   *Albumin (serum)*\n*   *Bone density test to check for thin bones (osteoporosis)*\n*   *Complete blood count (CBC)*\n*   *Electrocardiogram (ECG)*\n*   *Electrolytes*\n*   *Kidney function tests*\n*   *Liver function tests*\n*   *Total protein (serum)*\n*   *Thyroid function tests*\n*   *Urinalysis*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe biggest challenge in treating anorexia nervosa is helping the person recognize that they have an illness. Most people with anorexia deny that they have an eating disorder. They often seek treatment only when their condition is serious.\n\nGoals of treatment are to restore normal body weight and eating habits. A weight gain of 1 to 3 pounds (lb) or 0.5 to 1.5 kilograms (kg) per week is considered a safe goal.\n\nDifferent programs have been designed to treat anorexia. These may include any of the following measures:\n\n*   *Increasing social activity*\n*   *Reducing the amount of physical activity*\n*   *Using schedules for eating*\n\nTo start, a short hospital stay may be recommended. This is followed by a day treatment program.\n\nA longer hospital stay may be needed if:\n\n*   The person has lost a lot of weight (being below 70% of their ideal body weight for their age and height). For severe and life-threatening malnutrition, the person may need to be fed through a vein or stomach tube.\n*   Weight loss continues, even with treatment.\n*   Medical complications, such as heart problems, confusion, or low potassium levels develop.\n*   The person has severe depression or thinks about committing suicide.\n\nCare providers who are usually involved in these programs include:\n\n*   *Nurse practitioners*\n*   *Physicians*\n*   *Physician assistants*\n*   *Dietitians*\n*   *Mental health care providers*\n\nTreatment is often very difficult. People and their families must work hard. Many therapies may be tried until the disorder is under control.\n\nPeople may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured with therapy alone.\n\nDifferent kinds of talk therapy are used to treat people with anorexia:\n\n*   *Cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy), group therapy, and family therapy have all been successful.*\n*   *Goal of therapy is to change a person's thoughts or behavior to encourage them to eat in a healthier way. This kind of therapy is more useful for treating younger people who have not had anorexia for a long time.*\n\nIf the person is young, therapy may involve the whole family. The family is seen as a part of the solution, instead of the cause of the eating disorder.\n\nSupport groups may also be a part of treatment. In support groups, people with anorexia and their families meet and share what they have been through.\n\nMedicines such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers may help some people when given as part of a complete treatment program. These medicines can help treat depression or anxiety. Although medicines may help, none has been proven to decrease the desire to lose weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAnorexia is a serious condition that can be life threatening. Treatment programs can help people with the condition return to a normal weight. But it is common for the disease to relapse.\n\nWomen who develop this eating disorder at an early age have a better chance of recovering completely. Most people with anorexia will continue to prefer a lower body weight and be very focused on food and calories.\n\nWeight management may be hard. Long-term treatment may be needed to stay at a healthy weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAnorexia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time, including:\n\n*   *Bone weakening*\n*   *Decrease in white blood cells, which leads to increased risk of infection*\n*   *A low potassium level in the blood, which may cause dangerous heart rhythms*\n*   *Severe lack of water and fluids in the body (dehydration)*\n*   *Lack of protein, vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients in the body (malnutrition)*\n*   *Seizures due to fluid or sodium loss from repeated diarrhea or vomiting*\n*   *Thyroid gland problems*\n*   *Tooth decay*\n*   *Suicidal thinking or behavior*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nTalk to your health care provider if someone you care about is:\n\n*   Too focused on weight\n*   Over-exercising\n*   Limiting the food he or she eats\n*   Very underweight\n*   Showing suicidal thinking or behavior\n\nGetting medical help right away can make an eating disorder less severe.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n---\n\n**Anorexia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of anorexia are not known, but many factors may be involved. Genes and hormones may play a role, as well as social attitudes that promote very thin body types. Risk factors for anorexia include:\n\n*   Being more worried about, or paying more attention to, weight and body shape\n*   Having an anxiety disorder as a child\n*   Having a negative self-image\n*   Having eating problems during infancy or early childhood\n*   Having certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty\n*   Trying to be perfect or overly focused on rules\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person with anorexia usually:\n\n*   Has an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when underweight.\n*   Refuses to keep their weight at what is considered normal for their age and height (15% or more below the normal weight).\n*   Has a body image that is very distorted, is very focused on body weight or shape, and refuses to admit the danger of weight loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests should be done to help find the cause of weight loss, or see what damage the weight loss has caused.

    "content": "**Anoscopy and High-Resolution Anoscopy**\n\n**What is Anoscopy?**\n\nAnoscopy is a method to look at the anus, anal canal, and lower rectum.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThe procedure is usually done in a healthcare provider's office. A digital anorectal examination (DARE) is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument called an anoscope is placed a few inches or centimeters into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThere will be some discomfort during the procedure. You may feel the need to have a bowel movement. You may feel a pinch when a biopsy is taken.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test may be used to determine whether you have:\n\n* Anal fissures (small split or tear in the lining of the anus)\n* Anal polyps (growth on the lining of the anus)\n* Foreign object in the anus\n* Hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the anus)\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Tumors\n* Abnormal growth of cells (dysplasia)\n* Anal cancer\n\nAnoscopy and HRA may also be used as a yearly screening test for anal cancer in people with HIV.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe anal canal appears normal in size, color, and tone. There is no sign of:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Polyps\n* Hemorrhoids\n* Other abnormal tissue\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal results may include:\n\n* Abscess (collection of pus in the anus)\n* Fissures\n* Foreign object in the anus\n* Hemorrhoids\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Polyps (non-cancerous or cancerous)\n* Tumors or dysplasia\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are few risks. If a biopsy is needed, there is a slight risk for bleeding and mild pain.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAnal fissures - anoscopy; Anal polyps - anoscopy; Foreign object in the anus - anoscopy; Hemorrhoids - anoscopy; Anal warts - anoscopy; Anal cancer - anoscopy\n\n---\n\n**Anoscopy and High-Resolution Anoscopy**\n\n**What is Anoscopy?**\n\nAnoscopy is a medical procedure used to examine the anal canal and rectum for abnormalities such as hemorrhoids, polyps, or cancer. The procedure involves inserting a lubricated instrument called an anoscope into the rectum, which has a light on the end to illuminate the area.\n\n**How is Anoscopy Performed?**\n\nThe procedure typically starts with a digital anorectal examination (DARE) to assess the anal canal and rectum. Then, a lubricated anoscope is inserted a few inches or centimeters into the rectum. You may feel some discomfort during this process. The anoscope has a light on the end, allowing your healthcare provider to see the entire area.\n\n**What is High-Resolution Anoscopy (HRA)?**\n\nHigh-resolution anoscopy (HRA) uses an additional magnifying device called a colposcope to examine the tissues more closely and detect small changes. HRA may be used to help detect abnormal cells in your anal lining.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nOften, there is no preparation needed. However, you may receive a laxative, enema, or other preparation to empty your bowel. It's essential to empty your bladder before the procedure. Your provider may suggest that you avoid anal penetration and anal medicines or products before the procedure.\n\n**What Will I Feel During the Test?**\n\nThere will be some discomfort during the procedure. You may feel the need to have a bowel movement, and if a biopsy is taken, you may experience a pinch. However, you can usually return to normal activities after the procedure.\n\n**Why is Anoscopy Performed?**\n\nThis test may be used to determine whether you have:\n\n* Anal fissures (small split or tear in the lining of the anus)\n* Anal polyps (growth on the lining of the anus)\n* Foreign object in the anus\n* Hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the anus)\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Tumors\n* Abnormal growth of cells (dysplasia)\n* Anal cancer\n\nAnoscopy and HRA may also be used as a yearly screening test for anal cancer in people with HIV.\n\n**What Are Normal Results?**\n\nThe anal canal appears normal in size, color, and tone. There is no sign of bleeding, polyps, hemorrhoids, or other abnormal tissue.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAbnormal results may include:\n\n* Abscess (collection of pus in the anus)\n* Fissures\n* Foreign object in the anus\n* Hemorrhoids\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Polyps (non-cancerous or cancerous)\n* Tumors or dysplasia\n\n**Are There Any Risks?**\n\nThere are few risks associated with anoscopy. If a biopsy is needed, there is a slight risk for bleeding and mild pain.\n\n**What Are the Alternative Names for Anoscopy?**\n\nAnal fissures - anoscopy; Anal polyps - anoscopy; Foreign object in the anus - anoscopy; Hemorrhoids - anoscopy; Anal warts - anoscopy; Anal cancer - anoscopy\n\n---\n\n**Anoscopy and High-Resolution Anoscopy**\n\n**What is anoscopy?**\n\nAnoscopy is a procedure used to examine the anal canal for abnormalities such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or rectal polyps. During an anoscopy, a doctor inserts a specialized instrument called an anoscope into the anus to visualize the anal canal.\n\n**Types of Anoscopy**\n\nThere are two types of anoscopy: conventional anoscopy and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Conventional anoscopy uses a standard anoscope to examine the anal canal. HRA, on the other hand, uses a specialized instrument that produces high-quality images of the anal canal, allowing for more detailed examination.\n\n**Indications for Anoscopy**\n\nAnoscopy is typically performed to:\n\n* Diagnose and treat hemorrhoids\n* Identify rectal polyps or cancer\n* Examine the anal canal for signs of infection or inflammation\n\n**Preparation for Anoscopy**\n\nBefore undergoing an anoscopy, patients should:\n\n* Avoid eating a large meal before the procedure\n* Follow their doctor's instructions regarding bowel preparation\n* Be prepared to feel some discomfort during the procedure\n\n**Procedure and Recovery**\n\nThe anoscopy procedure typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete. During this time, the patient will lie on their side or back while the doctor inserts the anoscope into the anus. The procedure may cause some discomfort, but it is usually well-tolerated.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients can resume their normal activities immediately. However, they should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for a few days.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Anal Cancer\n* Anal Disorders\n* Hemorrhoids\n* Rectal Disorders",

    "content": "**Anoscopy**\n\nAn anoscopy is a procedure that uses a special lighted scope called an anoscope or anal speculum. An anoscope allows your health care provider to view the lining of your lower rectum and anus to check for signs of injury or disease.\n\n**What Happens During an Anoscopy?**\n\nYou will put on a gown and remove your underwear. You will lie on an exam table, and your provider will ask you to either lie on your side with your knees bent, on your stomach, or to bend forward over the table with your rear end raised in the air.\n\nYour provider will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your anus to check for hemorrhoids, fissures, or other problems. This is known as a digital rectal exam. Sometimes your provider may apply a numbing medicine if you have anal pain.\n\nYour provider will then insert a lubricated tube called an anoscope about two inches into your anus. Most anoscopes have a light on the end to give your provider a better view of the anus and lower rectum area.\n\nIf your provider finds cells that don't look normal, they may use a swab or other tool to collect a tissue sample for testing (biopsy). High-resolution anoscopy may be better than regular anoscopy at finding abnormal cells.\n\n**What are the Risks?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having an anoscopy or a high-resolution anoscopy. You may have some discomfort during the procedure. You may also feel a little pinch if your provider took a biopsy.\n\nIn addition, you may have a little bleeding when the anoscope is pulled out, especially if you have hemorrhoids.\n\n**After the Anoscopy**\n\nYou may have some soreness or bleeding for a few days after the procedure. Your provider may encourage you to sit in a warm bath or to use ice or a topical medicine for soreness.\n\nIf you had a biopsy, your provider may tell you when to expect your results and if there are any special instructions. These may include:\n\n* Avoiding strenuous activities or lifting\n* Taking over-the-counter pain relievers\n* Avoiding constipation by drinking water, eating a high-fiber diet, and taking a supplement, if necessary\n* Not putting anything into your anus until bleeding and pain have stopped\n\n---\n\n**Anoscopy: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is an anoscopy used for?**\n\nAn anoscopy can help your provider find problems in the anus and rectum, including hemorrhoids, fissures (tears), and abnormal growths.\n\n**Why do I need an anoscopy?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a problem in your anus or rectum. These may include:\n\n* Blood in your stool or on toilet paper after a bowel movement\n* Itching around your anus\n* Swelling or hard lumps around your anus\n* Discharge from your anus\n* Painful bowel movements\n* Difficulty having or holding a bowel movement\n\nPeople who have HIV may also need this test as part of an anal cancer screening. This screening is done to help detect and treat precancer (which can turn into cancer) and prevent anal cancer:\n\n* Your provider may recommend an anoscopy as part of the screening if you are:\n\t+ Under age 35 and have symptoms or signs of anal cancer\n* Your provider may recommend lab screening, along with a high resolution anoscopy if you have symptoms or signs of anal cancer, as part of the screening if you are:\n\t+ A man who has sex with men and are age 35 or older\n\t+ All other people with HIV age 45 or older\n\n**What happens during an anoscopy?**\n\nAn anoscopy may be done in a provider's office or outpatient clinic. The anoscopy procedure only takes a few minutes. If a high-resolution anoscopy is done or tissue samples are taken, the procedure might take longer.\n\nDuring an anoscopy:\n\n* You will put on a gown and remove your underwear.\n* You will lie on an exam table. Your provider will ask you to either lie on your side with your knees bent, on your stomach or to bend forward over the table with your rear end raised in the air.\n* Your provider will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your anus to check for hemorrhoids, fissures, or other problems. This is known as a digital rectal exam. Sometimes your provider may apply a numbing medicine if you have anal pain.\n* Your provider will then insert a lubricated tube called an anoscope about two inches into your anus.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may want to empty your bladder and/or have a bowel movement before the test. This may make the procedure more comfortable.\n\nYour provider might suggest that you avoid putting anything (like medicines and other products) into your anus for 24 hours before the test. This would also include avoiding anal sex. They will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having an anoscopy or a high-resolution anoscopy. You may have some discomfort during the procedure. You may also feel a little pinch if your provider took a biopsy.\n\nIn addition, you may have a little bleeding when the anoscope is pulled out, especially if you have hemorrhoids.\n\n**After the anoscopy:**\n\nYou may have some soreness or bleeding for a few days after the procedure. Your provider may encourage you to sit in a warm bath or to use ice or a topical medicine for soreness.\n\nIf you had a biopsy, your provider may tell you when to expect your results and if there are any special instructions. These may include:\n\n* Avoiding strenuous activities or lifting\n* Taking over-the-counter pain relievers\n* Avoiding constipation by drinking water, eating a high-fiber diet, and taking a supplement, if necessary\n* Not putting anything into your anus until bleeding and pain has stopped\n\n---\n\n**Anoscopy: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/3)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nYour results may show a problem with your anus or rectum. These may include:\n\n*   Anal fissures\n*   Rectal cancer\n*   Hemorrhoids\n\nDepending on the results, your provider may recommend more tests and/or treatment options.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nCleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diseases & Conditions [Internet].

    "content": "**Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury - Aftercare**\n\n**What is a Ligament?**\n\nA ligament is a band of tissue that connects a bone to another bone. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located inside your knee joint and connects the bones of your upper and lower leg.\n\n**Understanding ACL Injuries**\n\nAn ACL injury occurs when the ligament is stretched or torn. A partial ACL tear occurs when only part of the ligament is torn. A complete ACL tear occurs when the entire ligament is torn into two pieces or detaches from the bone.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nThe ACL is one of several ligaments that keep your knee stable. It helps keep your leg bones in place and allows your knee to move back and forth.\n\nAn ACL injury can occur if you:\n\n* Get hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle\n* Twist your knee\n* Quickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning\n* Land awkwardly after jumping\n\nSkiers and people who play basketball, football, or soccer are more likely to have this type of injury. Women are more likely to tear their ACL than men when they participate in sports.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nIt is common to hear a \"popping\" sound when an ACL injury occurs. You also may have:\n\n* Knee swelling that occurs within a few hours of injury\n* Knee pain, especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg\n* Knee instability when you start putting weight on it\n\nIf you have a mild injury, you may notice that your knee feels unstable or seems to \"give way\" when using it. ACL injuries often occur along with other knee injuries, such as to the cartilage called the meniscus. These injuries also may need to be treated, sometimes with surgery.\n\n**Imaging Tests**\n\nAfter examining your knee, your health care provider may order these imaging tests:\n\n* X-rays to check for damage to the bones in your knee.\n* An MRI of the knee. An MRI machine takes special pictures of the tissues inside your knee. The pictures will show whether these tissues have been stretched or torn.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nIf you have an ACL injury, you may need:\n\n* Crutches to walk until the swelling and pain get better\n* A brace to support and stabilize your knee\n* Physical therapy to help improve joint motion and leg strength\n* Surgery to reconstruct the ACL and other structures that also may have been injured\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nFollow R.I.C.E. to help reduce pain and swelling:\n\n* Rest your leg. Avoid putting weight on it.\n* Ice your knee for 20 minutes at a time 3 to 4 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first.\n* Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap.\n* Elevate your leg by raising it above the level of your heart.\n\nYou can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not with swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\n**Activity**\n\nAfter your injury, you should not play sports or do other strenuous activities until you and your provider decide what treatment is best for you.\n\nIf you have surgery to reconstruct your ACL:\n\n* Follow instructions on self-care at home.\n* You will need physical therapy to regain the full use of your knee.\n* Your recovery after surgery can take about 6 months. But you should be able to do the same activities you did before.\n\nIf you do not have surgery:\n\n* You will need to work with a physical therapist to lessen swelling and pain and regain enough range of motion and strength in your leg to resume activity. This may take a few months.\n* Depending on your injury, you may not be able to do certain types of activities that could re-injure your knee.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n* Increase in swelling or pain\n* Self-care does not seem to help\n* You lose feeling in your foot\n* Your foot or leg feels cold or changes color\n* Your knee suddenly locks and you can't straighten it\n\nIf you have surgery, contact your surgeon if you have:\n\n* A fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher\n* Drainage from the incisions\n* Bleeding that won't stop\n\n---\n\n**Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury - Aftercare**\n\n**What is an ACL injury?**\n\nAn ACL injury occurs when the ligament is stretched or torn.

For example, an ACL tear often occurs along with tears to the MCL and the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee (meniscus).\n\nMost ACL tears occur in the middle of the ligament, or the ligament is pulled off the thigh bone. These injuries form a gap between the torn edges, and do not heal on their own.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEarly symptoms:\n\n* A \"popping\" sound at the time of injury\n* Obvious knee swelling within 6 hours of injury\n* Pain, especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg\n* Difficulty in continuing with your sport\n* Feeling of instability\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe knee joint is located where the end of the thigh bone (femur) meets the top of the shin bone (tibia).\n\nFour main ligaments connect these two bones:\n\n* Medial collateral ligament (MCL) runs along the inside of the knee.

This can happen due to various reasons such as sports injuries, falls, or overuse.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   Sports injuries: Contact sports like football, soccer, and basketball increase the risk of ACL injuries.\n*   Falls: Direct blows to the knee can cause ACL tears.\n*   Overuse: Repetitive movements or excessive stress on the knee joint can lead to ligament sprains or tears.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of an ACL injury include:\n\n*   Sudden, severe pain in the knee\n*   Swelling and bruising around the injured area\n*   Instability or feeling of the knee \"giving way\"\n*   Difficulty walking or putting weight on the affected leg\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose an ACL injury, a healthcare professional may perform:\n\n*   Physical examination: Assessing knee stability and range of motion.\n*   Imaging tests: X-rays, MRI scans, or CT scans to visualize the ligament damage.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for ACL injuries depends on the severity of the injury and the individual's overall health. Possible treatment options include:\n\n*   Conservative management: Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) to alleviate symptoms.\n*   Physical therapy: Strengthening exercises to improve knee stability and function.\n*   Surgical reconstruction: Rebuilding or replacing the damaged ACL with a graft.\n\n**Recovery and Rehabilitation**\n\nRecovering from an ACL injury requires patience, dedication, and proper guidance. A healthcare professional can create a personalized rehabilitation plan to ensure a successful recovery and minimize the risk of further injuries.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent ACL injuries:\n\n*   Warm up properly before engaging in physical activities.\n*   Stretch and strengthen the surrounding muscles.\n*   Use protective gear, such as knee pads or braces, when participating in high-risk sports.\n*   Avoid overexertion and take regular breaks to rest and recover.",

    "content": "**Anterior Knee Pain**\n\n**What is Anterior Knee Pain?**\n\nAnterior knee pain is a dull, aching pain that occurs at the front and center of the knee.\n\n**Causes of Anterior Knee Pain**\n\nAnterior knee pain can be caused by many different problems, including:\n\n*   **Chondromalacia of the Patella**: The softening and breakdown of the tissue (cartilage) on the underside of the kneecap (patella)\n*   **Runner's Knee**: Sometimes called patellar tendinitis\n*   **Lateral Compression Syndrome**: The patella tracks more to the outside part of the knee\n*   **Quadriceps Tendinitis**: Pain and tenderness at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella\n*   **Patella Maltracking**: Instability of the patella on the knee\n*   **Patella Arthritis**: Cartilage breakdown underneath your kneecap\n\n**What Happens in the Knee?**\n\nYour kneecap (patella) sits over the front of your knee joint. As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of the patella glides over the bones that make up the knee.\n\nStrong tendons help attach the kneecap to the bones and muscles that surround the knee. These tendons are called:\n\n*   **The Patellar Tendon**: Where the kneecap attaches to the shin bone\n*   **The Quadriceps Tendon**: Where the thigh muscles attach to the top of the kneecap\n\n**Why Does Anterior Knee Pain Occur?**\n\nAnterior knee pain may occur when the kneecap does not move properly and rubs against the lower part of the thigh bone. This may occur because:\n\n*   The kneecap is in an abnormal position (also called poor alignment of the patellofemoral joint)\n*   There is tightness or weakness of the muscles on the front and back of your thigh\n*   You are doing too much activity that places extra stress on the kneecap (such as running, jumping or twisting, skiing, or playing soccer)\n*   Your muscles are not balanced and your core muscles maybe weaker\n*   The groove in the thighbone where the kneecap normally rests is too shallow\n*   You have flat feet\n*   Your lower leg alignment is abnormal\n*   Your core stability is weak and causes knee malalignment\n*   Excess body weight or over activity increases the stress on your kneecap\n\n**Who is at Risk for Anterior Knee Pain?**\n\nAnterior knee pain is more common in:\n\n*   People who are overweight\n*   People who have had a dislocation, fracture, or other injury to the kneecap\n*   Runners, jumpers, skiers, bicyclists, and soccer players who exercise often\n*   Teenagers and healthy young adults, more often girls\n\n**Other Possible Causes of Anterior Knee Pain**\n\nOther possible causes of anterior knee pain include:\n\n*   Arthritis\n*   Pinching of the inner lining of the knee during movement (called synovial impingement or plica syndrome)\n\n**Symptoms of Anterior Knee Pain**\n\nAnterior knee pain is a dull, aching pain that is most often felt in one or more location:\n\n*   Behind the kneecap (patella)\n*   Below the kneecap\n*   On the sides of the kneecap\n\nOne common symptom is a grating or grinding feeling when the knee is flexed (when the ankle is brought closer to the back of the thigh).\n\nSymptoms may be more noticeable with:\n\n*   Deep knee bends\n*   Going down stairs\n*   Running downhill\n*   Standing up from a squatting position or after sitting for a while\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. The knee may be tender and mildly swollen. Also, the kneecap may not be perfectly lined up with the thigh bone (femur).\n\nWhen you flex your knee, you may feel a grinding feeling below the kneecap. Pressing the kneecap when the knee is straightening out may be painful.\n\nYour provider may want you to do a single leg squat to look at muscle imbalance and your core stability.\n\nX-rays are very often normal. However, a special x-ray view of the kneecap may show signs of arthritis or tilting.\n\nMRI scans are rarely needed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nResting the knee for a short period of time and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin may help relieve pain.\n\nOther things you can do to relieve anterior knee pain include:\n\n*   Change the way you exercise.\n*   Learn exercises to both strengthen and stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.\n*   Learn exercises to strengthen your core.\n*   Lose weight (if you are overweight).\n*   Use special shoe inserts and support devices (orthotics) if you have flat feet.\n*   Tape your knee to realign the kneecap.\n*   Wear the correct running or sports shoes.\n*   Taping of your kneecap to improve tracking.\n\nRarely, surgery for pain behind the kneecap is needed. During the surgery:\n\n*   Kneecap cartilage that has been damaged may be removed.\n*   Changes may be made to the tendons to help the kneecap move more evenly.\n*   Kneecap may be realigned to allow for better joint movement.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAnterior knee pain often improves with a change in activity, exercise therapy, and the use of NSAIDs.

    "content": "**Anterior Vaginal Wall Repair**\n\n**Description**\n\nThe anterior vaginal wall can sink (prolapse) or bulge. This occurs when the bladder or the urethra sink into the vagina.\n\nThe repair may be done while you are under:\n\n* General anesthesia: You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\n* Spinal anesthesia: You will be awake, but you will be numb from the waist down and you will not feel pain. You will be given medicines to help you relax.\n\nYour surgeon will:\n\n* Make a surgical cut through the front wall of your vagina.\n* Move your bladder back to its normal location.\n* May fold your vagina, or cut away part of it.\n* Put sutures (stitches) in the tissue between your vagina and bladder. These will hold the walls of your vagina in the correct position.\n* Place a patch between your bladder and vagina. This patch can be made of commercially available biological material (cadaveric tissue). The FDA has banned use of synthetic material and animal tissue in the vagina to treat anterior vaginal wall prolapse.\n* Attach sutures to the walls of the vagina to the tissue on the side of your pelvis.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is used to repair sinking or bulging of the anterior vaginal wall.\n\n**Symptoms of Anterior Vaginal Wall Prolapse**\n\nYou may not be able to empty your bladder completely.\nYour bladder may feel full all the time.\nYou may feel pressure in your vagina.\nYou may be able to feel or see a bulging at the opening of the vagina.\nYou may have pain when you have sex.\nYou may leak urine when you cough, sneeze, or lift something.\nYou may get bladder infections.\n\n**This Surgery by Itself Does Not Treat Stress Incontinence**\n\nStress incontinence is the leaking of urine when you cough, sneeze, or lift. Surgery to correct stress urinary incontinence may be performed along with other surgeries.\n\n**Before Doing This Surgery**\n\nYour health care provider may have you:\n\n* Learn pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises)\n* Use estrogen cream in your vagina\n* Try a device called a pessary in your vagina to strengthen the muscle around the vagina\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots\n* Infection\n\nRisks for this procedure include:\n\n* Damage to the urethra, bladder, or vagina\n* Irritable bladder\n* Changes in the vagina (prolapsed vagina)\n* Urine leakage from the vagina or to the skin (fistula)\n* Worsening urinary incontinence\n* Lasting pain\n* Complications from the material used during surgery (mesh/grafts)\n\n---\n\n**Anterior Vaginal Wall Repair**\n\nThis surgical procedure tightens the front (anterior) wall of the vagina.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe anterior vaginal wall can sink (prolapse) or bulge due to the bladder or urethra sinking into the vagina.

    "content": "**Anthrax Vaccine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What is Anthrax?**\n\n\\n\\n\nAnthrax is a serious disease that can affect both animals and humans. It is caused by bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. People can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides.\n\nCutaneous Anthrax. In its most common form, anthrax is a skin disease that causes skin ulcers and usually fever and fatigue. Up to 20% of these cases are fatal if untreated.\n\nGastrointestinal Anthrax. This form of anthrax can result from eating raw or undercooked infected meat. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, abdominal pain and swelling, and swollen lymph glands. Gastrointestinal anthrax can lead to blood poisoning, shock, and death.\n\nInhalation Anthrax. This form of anthrax occurs when B. anthracis is inhaled, and is very serious. The first symptoms can include a sore throat, mild fever and muscle aches. Within several days these symptoms are followed by severe breathing problems, shock, and often meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord covering). This form of anthrax requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment with antibiotics. It is often fatal.\n\n**What is Anthrax Vaccine?**\n\n\\n\\n\nAnthrax vaccine protects against anthrax disease. The vaccine used in the United States does not contain B. anthracis cells and it does not cause anthrax. Anthrax vaccine was licensed in 1970 and relicensed in 2008.\n\nBased on limited but sound evidence, the vaccine protects against both cutaneous (skin) and inhalational anthrax.\n\n**Who Should Get Anthrax Vaccine and When?**\n\n\\n\\n\nAnthrax vaccine is recommended for certain people 18 through 65 years of age who might be exposed to large amounts of B. anthracis bacteria on the job, including:\n\n*   Certain laboratory or remediation workers\n*   Some people handling animals or animal products\n*   Some military personnel, as determined by the Department of Defense\n\nThese people should get five doses of vaccine (in the muscle): the first dose when risk of a potential exposure is identified, and the remaining doses at 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after the first dose.\n\nAnnual booster doses are needed for ongoing protection.\n\nIf a dose is not given at the scheduled time, the series does not have to be started over. Resume the series as soon as practical.\n\nAnthrax vaccine is also recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to anthrax in certain situations. These people should get three doses of vaccine (under the skin), with the first dose as soon after exposure as possible, and the second and third doses given 2 and 4 weeks after the first.\n\n---\n\n**Anthrax Vaccine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n\\n\\n**Who should get anthrax vaccine?**\n\nAnnual booster doses are needed for ongoing protection.\n\nIf a dose is not given at the scheduled time, the series does not have to be started over. Resume the series as soon as practical.\n\nAnthrax vaccine is also recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to anthrax in certain situations.

Tell your provider if you have any severe allergies, including latex.\n\nIf you have ever had Guillain Barr syndrome (GBS), your provider might recommend not getting anthrax vaccine.\n\nIf you have a moderate or severe illness your provider might ask you to wait until you recover to get the vaccine. People with mild illness can usually be vaccinated.\n\nVaccination may be recommended for pregnant women who have been exposed to anthrax and are at risk of developing inhalation disease. Nursing mothers may safely be given anthrax vaccine.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the risks from anthrax vaccine?**\n\nLike any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction.\n\nAnthrax is a very serious disease, and the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is extremely small.\n\nTenderness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 person out of 2)\n\nRedness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 7 men and 1 out of 3 women)\n\nItching on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 50 men and 1 out of 20 women)\n\nLump on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 60 men and 1 out of 16 women)\n\nBruise on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 22 women)\n\nMuscle aches or temporary limitation of arm movement (about 1 out of 14 men and 1 out of 10 women)\n\nHeadaches (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 12 women)\n\nFatigue (about 1 out of 15 men, about 1 out of 8 women)\n\nSerious allergic reaction (very rare - less than once in 100,000 doses).\n\n\\n\\n**What if there is a moderate or severe reaction?**\n\nAny unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction or a high fever. If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat.\n\nCall a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away.\n\nTell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.\n\nAsk your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.\n\n---\n\n**Anthrax Vaccine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/3)**\n\n\\n\\n* **Injury compensation**: A Federal program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, has been created under the PREP Act to help pay for medical care and other specific expenses of certain individuals who have a serious reaction to this vaccine. If you have a reaction to the vaccine your ability to sue may be limited by law. For more information, visit the program's website at https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp, or call 1-888-275-4772.\n* **How can I learn more?**: Ask your doctor or other health care provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information.

    "content": "**Anthrax**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nAnthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats. Humans who come into contact with infected animals can get sick with anthrax as well.\n\nThere are three main routes of anthrax infection: skin (cutaneous), lung (inhalation), and mouth (gastrointestinal).\n\nCutaneous anthrax occurs when anthrax spores enter the body through a cut or scrape on the skin. It is the most common type of anthrax infection. The main risk is contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, or with infected animals. People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, tanners, and wool workers.\n\nInhalation anthrax develops when anthrax spores enter the lungs through the airways. It is most commonly contracted when workers breathe in airborne anthrax spores during processes such as tanning hides and processing wool.\n\nBreathing in spores means a person has been exposed to anthrax. But it does not mean the person will have symptoms.\n\nThe bacterial spores must germinate or sprout (the same way a seed sprouts before a plant grows) before the actual disease occurs. This process usually takes 1 to 6 days. Once the spores germinate, they release several toxic substances. These substances cause internal bleeding, swelling, and tissue death.\n\nGastrointestinal anthrax occurs when someone eats anthrax-tainted meat. Injection anthrax can occur in someone who self-injects drugs (heroin). Anthrax may be used as a biological weapon or for bioterrorism.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of anthrax differ, depending on the type of anthrax.\n\nSymptoms of cutaneous anthrax start 1 to 7 days after exposure:\n\n*   An itchy sore develops that is similar to an insect bite. This sore may blister and form a black ulcer (sore or eschar).\n*   The sore is usually painless, but it is often surrounded by swelling.\n*   A scab often forms, and then dries and falls off within 2 weeks. Complete healing can take longer.\n\nSymptoms of inhalation anthrax:\n\n*   Begins with fever, malaise, headache, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain\n*   Fever and shock may occur later\n\nSymptoms of gastrointestinal anthrax usually occur within 1 week and may include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Bloody diarrhea\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Fever\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Nausea and vomiting (the vomit may contain blood)\n\nSymptoms of injection anthrax are similar to those of cutaneous anthrax. In addition, the skin or muscle beneath the injection site may get infected.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination.\n\nThe tests to diagnose anthrax depend on the type of disease that is suspected.\n\nA culture of the skin, and sometimes a biopsy, are done on the skin sores. The sample is looked at under a microscope to identify the anthrax bacterium.\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Blood culture\n*   Chest CT scan or chest x-ray\n*   Spinal tap to check for infection around the spinal column\n*   Sputum culture\n*   Complete blood count\n*   Blood chemistries\n\nMore tests may be done on fluid or blood samples.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics are usually used to treat anthrax. Antibiotics that may be prescribed include penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin.\n\nInhalation anthrax is treated with a combination of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin plus another medicine. They are given by IV (intravenously). Antibiotics are usually taken for 60 days because it can take spores that long to germinate.\n\nCutaneous anthrax is treated with antibiotics taken by mouth, usually for 7 to 10 days. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are most often used.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWhen treated with antibiotics, cutaneous anthrax is likely to get better. But some people who do not get treated may die if anthrax spreads to the blood.\n\nPeople with second-stage inhalation anthrax have a poor outlook, even with antibiotic therapy. Many cases in the second stage are fatal.\n\nGastrointestinal anthrax infection can spread to the bloodstream and may result in death.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you think you have been exposed to anthrax or if you develop symptoms of any type of anthrax.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere are two main ways to prevent anthrax:\n\nFor people who have been exposed to anthrax (but have no symptoms of the disease), providers may prescribe preventive antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or doxycycline, depending on the strain of anthrax.\n\nAn anthrax vaccine is available to military personnel and some members of the general public. It is given in a series of 5 doses over 18 months.\n\nThere is no known way to spread cutaneous anthrax from person to person. People who live with someone who has cutaneous anthrax do not need antibiotics unless they have also been exposed to the same source of anthrax.\n\n---\n\n**Anthrax**\n\n_An infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis._\n\n_Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs._\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Anthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats.

    "content": "**Anti-Müllerian Hormone Test**\n\n**What is an anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test?**\n\nAn anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test measures the amount of AMH in a blood sample. In males, AMH is made by the testicles (or testes), which are glands that make sperm and male hormones. In females, the ovaries make AMH. The ovaries are glands where eggs form and female hormones are made.\n\n**AMH plays different roles in males and females**\n\nNormal levels of AMH vary with your sex and your age. Measuring AMH levels can provide information about a variety of reproductive health conditions.\n\n* In unborn babies, AMH helps form the male and female reproductive organs.\n* In the early weeks of pregnancy, both male and female babies have a set of ducts (tubes) called Müllerian ducts.\n* Unborn female babies have very low levels of AMH. This allows the Müllerian ducts to develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper part of the vagina.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAMH tests are mainly used with other tests to make decisions about treating female infertility (not being able to get pregnant). If you're having fertility problems, an AMH test can:\n\n* Check how many eggs you have left in your ovaries. This is called your \"ovarian reserve.\"\n* Predict how well you may respond to fertility medicine.\n\n**In females, AMH testing may also be used to:**\n\n* Find out if you're getting close to menopause or have already begun menopause.\n* Help diagnose and monitor problems with the ovaries that cause high AMH levels. These include:\n\t+ Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility\n\t+ Certain types of ovarian cancer\n\n**For babies and children, an AMH test may be used:**\n\n* To check for healthy testicles in a male baby or child that may have undescended testicles.\n* To learn more about a baby born with genitals that aren't clearly male or female.\n\n**Why do I need an AMH test?**\n\nIf you're female, you may need an AMH test if you:\n\n* Are having fertility problems. You may need an AMH test to:\n\t+ Find out if your egg supply is normal for your age.\n\t+ Plan in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.\n* Have symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n* Are being treated for certain types of ovarian cancer.\n\n**What happens during an AMH test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an AMH test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nWhat the AMH test results mean depends on the reason the test was done:\n\n* If you're healthy and trying to get pregnant, ask your provider to explain what your AMH test results mean for your fertility based on your age and other test results.\n* If you were tested for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a high level of AMH is a sign that you may have the disease.\n* If you were tested for menopause, low AMH may mean you're getting close to menopause.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-Müllerian Hormone Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test?**\n\nAn anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test measures the amount of AMH in a blood sample. In males, AMH is made by the testicles (or testes), which are glands that make sperm and male hormones. In females, the ovaries make AMH. The ovaries are glands where eggs form and female hormones are made.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does AMH Play Different Roles in Males and Females?**\n\nAMH plays different roles in males and females and normal levels of AMH vary with your sex and your age. Measuring AMH levels can provide information about a variety of reproductive health conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the Significance of AMH in Unborn Babies?**\n\nIn unborn babies, AMH helps form the male and female reproductive organs. The sex of unborn babies is set by the chromosomes they inherit from their parents. Male babies have XY chromosomes and female babies have XX chromosomes. But the development of their reproductive organs and genitals is affected by hormones, including AMH.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does AMH Affect the Development of Reproductive Organs in Unborn Babies?**\n\nIn the early weeks of pregnancy, both male and female babies have a set of ducts (tubes) called Müllerian ducts. Normally, male babies make high levels of AMH in their testicular tissue. The AMH makes the Müllerian ducts shrink and helps male organs to grow. AMH levels stay high in male children until puberty when they begin to decrease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the Significance of AMH Levels in Healthy Females of Childbearing Age?**\n\nIn healthy females of childbearing age, higher levels of AMH mean that the ovaries have a larger supply of eggs. As females age, the number of eggs decreases, which causes AMH levels to decrease. At menopause, no eggs are left, and AMH levels drop to zero.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test Used For?**\n\nAMH tests are mainly used with other tests to make decisions about treating female infertility (not being able to get pregnant). If you're having infertility treatment, AMH testing can:\n\n*   Check how many eggs you have left in your ovaries. This is called your \"ovarian reserve.\" It's normal for your ovarian reserve to decrease with age.\n*   Predict how well you may respond to fertility medicine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Other Uses of an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test?**\n\nIn females, AMH testing may also be used to:\n\n*   Find out if you're getting close to menopause or have already begun menopause.\n*   Help diagnose and monitor problems with the ovaries that cause high AMH levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test Used For in Babies and Children?**\n\nFor babies and children, an AMH test may be used:\n\n*   To check for healthy testicles in a male baby or child that may have undescended testicles.\n*   To learn more about a baby born with genitals that aren't clearly male or female.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-Müllerian Hormone Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test?**\n\nAn AMH test measures the level of anti-Müllerian hormone in a person's blood. This hormone is produced by the ovaries in females and the testes in males.\n\n\\n\\n**Why is an AMH Test Done?**\n\nIn females, an AMH test may be done:\n\n*   To check how many eggs are left in the ovaries (ovarian reserve)\n*   To predict how well a woman may respond to fertility medicine\n*   To diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n*   To monitor treatment for ovarian cancer\n\nIn males, an AMH test may be done:\n\n*   To check for healthy testicles in a male baby or child with undescended testicles\n*   To help diagnose the cause of atypical genitalia in a newborn\n\n\\n\\n**How is an AMH Test Performed?**\n\nAn AMH test involves taking a blood sample from a vein in the arm. The test is usually quick and painless, taking less than five minutes.\n\n\\n\\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was inserted, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n\\n\\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe meaning of AMH test results depends on the reason for the test:\n\n*   In healthy women trying to get pregnant, high levels of AMH mean more eggs are available, while low levels indicate a shrinking egg supply.\n*   For polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), high AMH levels may be a sign of the disease.\n*   For menopause, low AMH levels may indicate approaching menopause, but results cannot predict when menopause will occur.\n*   In ovarian cancer treatment, decreasing AMH levels usually mean treatment is working, while increasing levels may indicate treatment failure or cancer recurrence.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Test Results**\n\nThe meaning of AMH test results depends on the reason the test was done. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Interpreting AMH Test Results for Fertility**\n\nIf you're healthy and trying to get pregnant, ask your provider to explain what your AMH test results mean for your fertility based on your age and other test results. In general:\n\n* A high level of AMH means you have more eggs available.\n* A low level of AMH means your egg supply is shrinking, and your time to get pregnant may be shorter.\n\n**Interpreting AMH Test Results for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**\n\nA high level of AMH is a sign that you may have PCOS. However, an AMH test alone cannot diagnose PCOS. There is no cure for PCOS, but symptoms can be managed with medications and/or lifestyle changes.\n\n**Interpreting AMH Test Results for Menopause**\n\nLow AMH may mean you're getting close to menopause. But AMH test results can't predict how long you have until menopause. If your test result showed no AMH in your blood, it means you are in menopause. If you're younger than age 40 and have symptoms of menopause, an AMH level that's lower than average for your age may be a sign of primary ovarian insufficiency.\n\n**Interpreting AMH Test Results for Ovarian Cancer**\n\nA decrease in AMH usually means that your treatment is working. If AMH increases, it may mean your treatment isn't working or cancer has returned.\n\n**Interpreting AMH Test Results for Undescended Testicles in Male Babies or Children**\n\nIf a baby is tested because of genitals that aren't clearly male or female, the meaning of AMH test results depends on the results of other tests.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-Müllerian Hormone Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Related Health Topics:***\n\t+ Assisted Reproductive Technology\n\t+ Female Infertility\n\t+ Fetal Health and Development\n\t+ Hormones\n\t+ Menopause\n\t+ Ovarian Cancer\n\t+ Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\n\t+ Pregnancy\n\t+ Primary Ovarian Insufficiency\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Related Medical Tests:***\n\t1. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone\n\t2.

People with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys.\n\nThese substances are called antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are antibodies against this membrane. They can damage the basement membrane, which can lead to kidney damage.\n\nSometimes, this disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may occur very slowly over months or even years, but they often develop very quickly over days to weeks.\n\nLoss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness are common early symptoms.\n\nLung symptoms may include:\n\n* Coughing up blood\n* Dry cough\n* Shortness of breath\n\nKidney and other symptoms include:\n\n* Bloody urine\n* Burning sensation when urinating\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pale skin\n* Swelling (edema) in any area of the body, especially in the legs\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may reveal high blood pressure and signs of fluid overload. Your health care provider may hear abnormal heart and lung sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.\n\nUrinalysis results are often abnormal and show blood and protein in the urine. Abnormal red blood cells may be seen.\n\nThe following tests may also be done:\n\n* Antiglomerular basement membrane test\n* Arterial blood gas\n* BUN\n* Chest x-ray\n* Creatinine (serum)\n* Lung biopsy\n* Kidney biopsy\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main goal is to remove the harmful antibodies from the blood. Treatment may include:\n\n* Plasmapheresis, which removes harmful antibodies to help reduce inflammation in the kidneys and lungs.\n* Corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and other drugs, which suppress or quiet the immune system.\n* Medicines such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help control blood pressure.\n* Dialysis, which may be done if kidney failure is severe and can no longer be treated by other means.\n* A kidney transplant, which may be done when your kidneys no longer function.\n\nYou may be told to limit your intake of salt and fluids to control swelling. In some cases, a low-to-moderate protein diet may be recommended.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with anti-GBM disease and their families can be found at:\n\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/glomerular-diseases/anti-gbm-goodpastures-disease\n* National Kidney Foundation -- www.kidney.org/atoz/content/goodpasture\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/goodpasture-syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Anti-glomerular Basement Membrane Disease**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAnti-GBM disease is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.

In this disease, the immune system produces antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane, a protein-rich layer in the kidney's filtration units.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of anti-GBM disease is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people may be more susceptible to developing the disease due to their genetic makeup or exposure to certain toxins.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of anti-GBM disease can vary depending on which organs are affected. In kidney involvement:\n\n*   Hematuria (blood in the urine)\n*   Proteinuria (excess protein in the urine)\n*   Nephritic syndrome (inflammation of the kidneys)\n\nIn lung involvement:\n\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing anti-GBM disease involves a combination of laboratory tests, including:\n\n*   Urine analysis to detect hematuria and proteinuria\n*   Blood tests to measure levels of certain antibodies\n*   Imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans, to evaluate kidney function and lung involvement\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for anti-GBM disease typically involves a combination of medications, including:\n\n*   Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation\n*   Immunosuppressive agents to suppress the immune system's attack on the kidneys and lungs\n*   Plasmapheresis to remove antibodies from the blood\n\nIn severe cases, kidney transplantation or lung transplantation may be necessary.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for anti-GBM disease varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With prompt and appropriate treatment, many people can recover from the disease and lead normal lives. However, some individuals may experience chronic kidney damage or lung scarring, requiring ongoing medical care to manage their condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent anti-GBM disease, as it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, people with a family history of the disease or those who have been exposed to certain toxins may be more susceptible to developing the disease. Regular health check-ups and prompt medical attention can help identify the disease in its early stages, improving treatment outcomes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related topics**\n\n*   Autoimmune diseases\n*   Kidney diseases\n*   Lung diseases",

Other risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood building up under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Anti-insulin antibody test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the anti-insulin antibody test?**\n\nThe anti-insulin antibody test measures the level of antibodies against insulin in your blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is the anti-insulin antibody test performed?**\n\nThe test is used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as:\n\n*   **Type 1 diabetes**: An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.\n*   **Insulin resistance**: A condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is the anti-insulin antibody test performed?**\n\nThe test involves a blood sample being drawn from a vein in your arm. The sample is then sent to a laboratory where the level of antibodies against insulin is measured.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the risks associated with the anti-insulin antibody test?**\n\nObtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   **Bruising**: A small bruise may form at the site where the needle was inserted.\n*   **Infection**: As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nAtkinson MA, Mcgill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

    "content": "**Anti-reflux Surgery - Children - Discharge**\n\nYour child had surgery to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition that causes acid, food, or liquid to come up from the stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\n**When Your Child Was in the Hospital**\n\nDuring the operation, the surgeon wrapped the upper part of your child's stomach around the end of the esophagus.\n\nThe surgery was done in one of these ways:\n\n* Through an incision (cut) in your child's upper belly (open surgery)\n* With a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end) through small incisions\n* By endoluminal repair (like a laparoscope, but the surgeon goes in through the mouth)\n\nYour child may also have had a pyloroplasty. This is a procedure that widened the opening between the stomach and small intestine. Your child's surgeon may have also placed a G-tube (gastrostomy tube) in the child's stomach for feeding.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nMost children can go back to school or daycare as soon as they feel well enough and when the surgeon feels it is safe.\n\nYour child should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity, such as gym class and very active play, for 3 to 4 weeks.\nYou may ask your child's surgeon for a letter to give to the school nurse and teachers to explain restrictions your child has.\n\nYour child may have a feeling of tightness when swallowing. This is from the swelling inside your child's esophagus. Your child may also have some bloating. These should go away in 6 to 8 weeks.\n\nRecovery is faster from laparoscopic surgery than from open surgery.\n\nYou will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your child's primary care provider (PCP) or gastroenterologist and with the surgeon after the surgery.\n\n**Care at Home**\n\nYou'll help your child get back to a regular diet over time.\n\n*   Start with a liquid diet in the hospital\n*   Add soft foods when the surgeon feels it is safe\n*   Once soft foods are well-tolerated, talk with the surgeon about returning to a regular diet\n\nIf your child had a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placed during surgery, it can be used for feeding and venting. Venting is when the G-tube is opened to release air from the stomach, similar to burping.\n\nThe nurse in the hospital should have shown you how to vent, care for, and replace the G-tube, and how to order G-tube supplies. Follow instructions on G-tube care.\nIf you need help with the G-tube at home, contact either your surgeon, health care provider, or the home health care nurse who helps children with a G-tube.\n\n**For Pain**\n\nYou can give your child over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). If your child is still having pain, contact your child's provider.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux Surgery - Children - Discharge**\n\nYou're now going home after your child's anti-reflux surgery. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth recovery.\n\n**When Your Child Was in the Hospital**\n\nDuring the operation, the surgeon wrapped the upper part of your child's stomach around the end of the esophagus. The surgery was done through one of three methods:\n\n*   Through an incision (cut) in your child's upper belly (open surgery)\n*   With a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end) through small incisions\n*   By endoluminal repair (like a laparoscope, but the surgeon goes in through the mouth)\n\nYour child may also have had a pyloroplasty, which widened the opening between the stomach and small intestine. Additionally, a G-tube (gastrostomy tube) was placed in the child's stomach for feeding.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nMost children can return to school or daycare as soon as they feel well enough and when the surgeon feels it is safe. Your child should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity, such as gym class and very active play, for 3 to 4 weeks. You may ask your child's surgeon for a letter to give to the school nurse and teachers to explain restrictions your child has.\n\nYour child may experience a feeling of tightness when swallowing due to swelling inside the esophagus. They may also have some bloating, which should go away in 6 to 8 weeks. Recovery is faster from laparoscopic surgery than from open surgery.\n\n**Care at Home**\n\nYou'll help your child get back to a regular diet over time. Start with a liquid diet, then progress to soft foods once the surgeon gives the green light. If your child had a G-tube placed during surgery, it can be used for feeding and venting. Venting is when the G-tube is opened to release air from the stomach, similar to burping.\n\nFor pain, you can give your child over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). If your child is still experiencing pain, contact their provider.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nIf sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your child's skin:\n\n*   Remove external dressings (bandages) the day after surgery unless instructed otherwise.\n*   Allow your child to take a brief shower the day after surgery unless instructed differently. Butterfly strips or glue should be left in place and not removed until the surgeon says it is OK.\n\nIf strips of tape were used to close your child's skin:\n\n*   Cover the incisions with plastic wrap before showering for the first week.\n*   Tape the edges of the plastic carefully to keep water out.\n*   Do not try to wash the tape off. It will fall off after about a week.\n\nDo not allow your child to soak in a bathtub or hot tub or go swimming until the surgeon gives the green light.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact the surgeon if your child has:\n\n*   A fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher\n*   Incisions that are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage\n*   A swollen or painful belly\n*   Nausea or vomiting for more than 24 hours\n*   Problems swallowing that keep your child from eating\n*   Problems swallowing that do not go away after 2 or 3 weeks\n*   Pain that pain medicine is not helping\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   A cough that does not go away\n*   Any problems that make your child unable to eat\n*   The G-tube is accidentally removed or falls out\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux Surgery - Children - Discharge**\n\n**Recovery**\n\n* Your child may experience swelling inside their esophagus, leading to a feeling of tightness when swallowing, and some bloating.

This surgery can also be performed during a hiatal hernia repair.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe most common type of anti-reflux surgery is called fundoplication, which typically takes 2 to 3 hours to complete. Before the surgery, your child will be given general anesthesia, ensuring they are asleep and unable to feel pain during the procedure.\n\n**Types of Surgery**\n\nThere are several methods used for anti-reflux surgery in children:\n\n*   **Open repair**: A large incision is made in the child's belly area (abdomen).\n*   **Laparoscopic repair**: 3 to 5 small cuts are made in the belly, and a thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end (a laparoscope) is inserted through one of these cuts.\n*   **Endoluminal fundoplication**: Similar to laparoscopic repair, but the surgeon reaches the stomach by going through the mouth.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nAnti-reflux surgery is usually performed to treat GERD in children when:\n\n*   Medicines have not worked or complications develop\n*   Symptoms of heartburn persist despite medication\n*   Part of the child's stomach is getting stuck in the chest or twisting around itself\n*   The child has a narrowing of the esophagus (stricture) or bleeding in the esophagus\n*   The child is not growing well or failing to thrive\n*   The child has a lung infection caused by breathing contents of the stomach into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia)\n*   GERD causes a chronic cough or hoarseness in the child\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks associated with anti-reflux surgery include:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Reactions to anesthesia medicines\n*   Breathing problems, including pneumonia\n*   Heart problems\n*   Damage to the stomach, esophagus, liver, or small intestine (rare)\n*   Gas and bloating that makes it hard to burp or throw up (most symptoms resolve over time)\n*   Gagging\n*   Painful, difficult swallowing (dysphagia) that typically resolves within 3 months\n*   Rarely, breathing or lung problems, such as a collapsed lung\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore surgery, it is essential to inform your child's healthcare team about all medications and supplements being taken. A week before surgery, you may be asked to stop giving your child products that affect blood clotting. Your child should not eat or drink anything after midnight before surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThe length of hospital stay depends on the type of surgery performed:\n\n*   Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery: 2 to 3 days\n*   Open surgery: 2 to 6 days\n\nYour child can start eating again about 1 to 2 days after surgery. Liquids are usually given first. If a g-tube is placed during surgery, it can be used for liquid feedings or to release gas from the stomach.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHeartburn and related symptoms should improve after anti-reflux surgery. However, your child may still need to take medicines for heartburn after surgery. Some children may require another operation in the future to treat new reflux symptoms or swallowing problems.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux Surgery in Children**\n\n**What is Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nAnti-reflux surgery is a procedure to tighten the muscles at the bottom of the esophagus, preventing stomach acid and food from flowing back up.

This surgery widens the opening between the stomach and small intestine so the stomach can empty faster.\n\nThis surgery may be done several ways, including:\n\n*   **Open repair**: The surgeon will make a large cut in the child's belly area (abdomen).\n*   **Laparoscopic repair**: The surgeon will make 3 to 5 small cuts in the belly. A thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end (a laparoscope) is placed through one of these cuts. Other tools are passed through the other surgical cuts.\n\nThe surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure if there is bleeding, a lot of scar tissue from earlier surgeries, or if the child is very overweight.\n\nEndoluminal fundoplication is similar to a laparoscopic repair, but the surgeon reaches the stomach by going through the mouth.

Your child's health care provider may suggest anti-reflux surgery when:\n\n*   **Symptoms of heartburn**: Burning in their stomach, throat, or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or problems swallowing food or fluids.\n*   **Complications**: Part of your child's stomach is getting stuck in the chest or is twisting around itself. Your child has a narrowing of the esophagus (called stricture) or bleeding in the esophagus. Your child is not growing well or is failing to thrive. Your child has a lung infection caused by breathing contents of the stomach into the lungs (called aspiration pneumonia). GERD causes a chronic cough or hoarseness in your child.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any surgery include:\n\n*   **Bleeding**\n*   **Infection**\n\nRisks for anesthesia include:\n\n*   **Reactions to medicines**\n*   **Breathing problems, including pneumonia**\n*   **Heart problems**\n\nAnti-reflux surgery risks include:\n\n*   **Damage to the stomach, esophagus, liver, or small intestine.** This is very rare.\n*   **Gas and bloating that makes it hard to burp or throw up.** Most of the time, these symptoms slowly get better.\n*   **Gagging.**\n*   **Painful, difficult swallowing, called dysphagia.** For most children, this goes away in the first 3 months after surgery.\n*   **Rarely, breathing or lung problems, such as a collapsed lung.**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways make sure your child's health care team knows about all the medicines and supplements your child is taking, including those you bought without a prescription.\n\nA week before surgery, you may be asked to stop giving your child products that affect blood clotting. This may include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, and warfarin (Coumadin).\n\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\nThe child should not eat or drink anything after midnight before surgery.\n\nYour child may take a bath or shower the night before or the morning of surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery, the child should take any medicine that the provider said to take with a small sip of water.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux surgery - children**\n\n**Preparing for the Procedure**\n\n* Always make sure your child's health care team knows about all the medicines and supplements your child is taking, including those you bought without a prescription.\n* A week before surgery, you may be asked to stop giving your child products that affect blood clotting.

    "content": "**Anti-reflux Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery to treat your gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition that causes food or liquid to come up from your stomach into your esophagus.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nIf you had a hiatal hernia, it was repaired. A hiatal hernia develops when the natural opening in your diaphragm is too large. Your diaphragm is the muscle between your chest and belly. Your stomach may bulge through this large hole into your chest. This bulging is called a hiatal hernia. It may make GERD symptoms worse.\n\nYour surgeon also wrapped the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus to create pressure at the end of your esophagus. This pressure helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up.\n\nYour surgery was done by making a large incision in your upper belly (open surgery) or with a small incision using a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end).\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nMost people go back to work 2 to 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery.\n\nYou may have a feeling of tightness when you swallow for 6 to 8 weeks. This is from the swelling inside your esophagus. You may also have some bloating.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nWhen you return home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks. You will be on a full liquid diet for about 2 weeks after that, and then a soft-food diet.\n\n*   On the liquid diet:\n    *   Start off with small amounts of liquid, about 1 cup (237 milliliters) at a time.\n    *   Sip. Do not gulp.\n    *   Drink liquids often during the day after surgery.\n    *   Avoid cold liquids.\n    *   Do not drink carbonated beverages.\n    *   Do not drink through straws (they can bring air into your stomach).\n    *   Crush pills and take them with liquids for the first month after surgery.\n\nWhen you are eating solid foods again, chew well. Do not eat cold foods. Do not eat foods that clump together, such as rice or bread. Eat small amounts of food several times a day instead of three big meals.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nTake care of your wound (incision):\n\n*   If sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin, you may remove the wound dressings (bandages) and take a shower the day after surgery.\n*   If tape strips were used to close your skin, cover the wounds with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Tape the edges of the plastic carefully to keep water out. Do not try to wash the strips off. They will fall off on their own after about a week.\n\nDo not soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your surgeon tells you it is OK.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher\n*   Incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage\n*   Belly swells or hurts\n*   Nausea or vomiting for more than 24 hours\n*   Problems swallowing that keep you from eating\n*   Problems swallowing that do not go away after 2 or 3 weeks\n*   Pain medicine is not helping your pain enough\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Cough that does not go away\n*   Can't drink or eat\n*   Skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery to treat your gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition that causes food or liquid to come up from your stomach into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach).\n\nNow that you're going home, be sure to follow your surgeon's instructions on how to take care of yourself.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nIf you had a hiatal hernia, it was repaired. A hiatal hernia develops when the natural opening in your diaphragm is too large. Your diaphragm is the muscle between your chest and belly. Your stomach may bulge through this large hole into your chest. This bulging is called a hiatal hernia. It may make GERD symptoms worse.\n\nYour surgeon also wrapped the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus to create pressure at the end of your esophagus. This pressure helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up.\n\nYour surgery was done by making a large incision in your upper belly (open surgery) or with a small incision using a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end).\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nMost people go back to work 2 to 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery.\n\nYou may have a feeling of tightness when you swallow for 6 to 8 weeks. This is from the swelling inside your esophagus. You may also have some bloating.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nWhen you return home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks. You will be on a full liquid diet for about 2 weeks after that, and then a soft-food diet.\n\nOn the liquid diet:\n\n*   Start off with small amounts of liquid, about 1 cup (237 milliliters) at a time. Sip. Do not gulp.\n*   Drink liquids often during the day after surgery.\n*   Avoid cold liquids.\n*   Do not drink carbonated beverages.\n*   Do not drink through straws (they can bring air into your stomach).\n*   Crush pills and take them with liquids for the first month after surgery.\n\nWhen you are eating solid foods again, chew well. Do not eat cold foods. Do not eat foods that clump together, such as rice or bread. Eat small amounts of food several times a day instead of three big meals.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-reflux Surgery - Discharge**\n\n**Self-care**\n\nWhen you return home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks.

Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine before your pain becomes too severe.\n\nIf you have gas pains, try walking around to ease them.\nDo not drive, operate any machinery, or drink alcohol when you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine can make you very drowsy and driving or using machinery is not safe.\n\nWalk several times a day. Do not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms or about a gallon of milk). Do not do any pushing or pulling. Slowly increase how much you do around the house. Your surgeon will tell you when you can increase your activity and return to work.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nTake care of your wound (incision):\n\n*   If sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin, you may remove the wound dressings (bandages) and take a shower the day after surgery.\n*   If tape strips were used to close your skin, cover the wounds with plastic wrap before showering for the first week.

This means eating foods that are easy to digest and not irritating to the esophagus.\n\n*   Eat small, frequent meals\n*   Choose bland foods such as crackers, toast, plain cookies, gelatin, pudding, and yogurt\n*   Avoid citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, and spicy or fatty foods\n\nYou should also avoid lying down after eating and elevate the head of your bed by 6 inches to prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus.\n\n**Gastroesophageal reflux - discharge**\n\nAfter anti-reflux surgery, you may experience gastroesophageal reflux symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nYou should also watch for signs of complications such as fever, chills, or severe abdominal pain. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical attention right away.\n\n**Heartburn - what to ask your provider**\n\nWhen speaking with your doctor about anti-reflux surgery, be sure to ask about the following:\n\n*   What are the risks and benefits of the procedure?\n*   How long will I need to follow a bland diet after surgery?\n*   Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to prevent gastroesophageal reflux symptoms?\n*   What are the signs of complications, and how can I prevent them?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can ensure that you are well-informed about your treatment options and can make an informed decision about your care.",

This condition is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\n\\n\\n**How Does Anti-reflux Surgery Work?**\n\nDuring anti-reflux surgery, the surgeon wraps the upper portion of the stomach around the lower end of the esophagus to create a tight seal. This helps prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n**Who Is a Candidate for Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nYou may be a candidate for anti-reflux surgery if you have severe GERD and have not responded to other treatments, such as medications or lifestyle changes.\n\n\\n\\n**What Are the Benefits of Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nThe benefits of anti-reflux surgery include:\n\n*   Relief from symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation\n*   Improved quality of life\n*   Reduced risk of complications from GERD, such as esophagitis and stricture\n\n\\n\\n**What Are the Risks of Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nAs with any surgery, there are risks associated with anti-reflux surgery. These may include:\n\n*   Bleeding or infection at the surgical site\n*   Damage to the esophagus or stomach during surgery\n*   Recurrence of GERD symptoms after surgery\n\n\\n\\n**How Do I Prepare for Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nTo prepare for anti-reflux surgery, you should:\n\n*   Quit smoking and avoid drinking alcohol for at least two weeks before surgery\n*   Avoid taking aspirin or other blood-thinning medications for at least one week before surgery\n*   Follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of complications during surgery\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens During Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nDuring anti-reflux surgery, you will be given general anesthesia to ensure your comfort and safety. The surgeon will then make several small incisions in your abdomen to access the stomach and esophagus. The surgeon will then wrap the upper portion of the stomach around the lower end of the esophagus to create a tight seal.\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens After Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nAfter anti-reflux surgery, you will need to rest for several days to allow your body to heal. You may experience some discomfort or pain during this time, which can be managed with medication. You should also follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n\\n\\n**How Long Does It Take to Recover from Anti-reflux Surgery?**\n\nThe recovery time for anti-reflux surgery varies from person to person, but most people are able to return to their normal activities within 2-4 weeks after surgery.",

Damage continues to occur to the kidneys, liver, esophagus, and stomach for several weeks after the substance was swallowed.\n\n**Lungs and Airways**\n\n*   Pneumothorax\n*   Pleural effusion\n\n**Home Care**\n\n*   Seek medical help right away.\n*   Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by the poison control center or a health care professional.\n*   If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n*   If the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a health care provider. Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.\n*   If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\n*   Get the following information:\n    *   Person's age, weight, and condition\n    *   Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n    *   Time it was swallowed\n    *   Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\n*   Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n*   This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\n*   The provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate.\n*   You may receive:\n    *   Blood and urine tests\n    *   Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth and into the lungs, connected to a breathing machine (ventilator)\n    *   Bronchoscopy -- a small camera down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs\n    *   Chest x-ray\n    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n    *   Endoscopy -- a small camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n    *   Fluids through the vein (by IV)\n    *   Methylene blue -- a medicine to reverse the effect of the poison\n    *   Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\n    *   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage)\n    *   Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n*   Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage continues to occur to the kidneys, liver, esophagus, and stomach for several weeks after the substance was swallowed. The outcome depends on this damage.\n\n---\n\n**Anti-rust product poisoning**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of damage**\n\nDamage continues to occur to the kidneys, liver, esophagus, and stomach for several weeks after the substance was swallowed.

    "content": "**Antibiotic Resistance**\n\n**What are Antibiotics?**\n\nAntibiotics are medicines that treat bacterial infections in humans and animals. They work by killing the bacteria or making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply. When used properly, antibiotics can save lives.\n\n**What is Antibiotic Resistance?**\n\nAntibiotic resistance happens when bacteria change and can resist the effects of an antibiotic. The bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. The infections these bacteria cause are called resistant infections. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. In some cases, they can even be deadly.\n\n**How Does Antibiotic Resistance Happen?**\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a natural process that happens over time. To survive, bacteria can develop defense strategies against antibiotics. This happens through genetic changes in the bacteria. These resistant bacteria survive, grow, and spread.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop an Antibiotic-Resistant Infection?**\n\nAnyone can develop an antibiotic-resistant infection, but certain people may be at higher risk, including those who:\n\n* Have a weakened immune system from diseases such as HIV or from taking medicines that affect the immune system\n* Are getting medical care such as surgery and hospital stays\n* Take antibiotics for a long time\n* Are infants, especially if they were born prematurely\n* Are older adults\n\n**How Can Antibiotic Resistance be Prevented?**\n\nThere will always be some antibiotic resistance, since it happens naturally.

It means that the bacteria you are infected with have become resistant to the antibiotic.\n\n**Types of Resistant Infections**\n\nThere are many different types of resistant infections. They include MRSA and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). If you get a resistant infection, you might need:\n\n* A long hospital stay\n* A long recovery\n* Follow-up visits with health care providers\n* Treatments that are expensive and may have severe side effects\n\n**How Do Bacteria Become Resistant to Antibiotics?**\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a natural process that happens over time.

    "content": "**Antibiotic Sensitivity Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn antibiotic sensitivity test is used to help find the best treatment for a bacterial infection and certain fungal infections.\n\n**Why do I need it?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have a bacterial or fungal infection that has been shown to have antibiotic resistance. These could include tuberculosis, MRSA, and C. diff.\n\n**What happens during the test?**\n\nTo find out what type of bacteria or fungi you have, your provider may order a fungal or bacteria culture. The test is done by taking a sample from the infected site. The most common types of tests include:\n\n*   Blood culture: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.\n*   Urine culture: You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.\n*   Wound culture: Your provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.\n*   Sputum culture: You may be asked to cough up sputum (a mucus, also called phlegm, made in the lungs) into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.\n*   Throat culture: Your provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for an antibiotic sensitivity test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood culture test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is no risk to having a throat culture, but it may cause slight discomfort or gagging.\n\nThere is no risk to having a urine, sputum, or wound culture.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour results will show how effective different antibiotics were in killing the bacteria or fungus causing your infection. Results are usually described in one of the following ways:\n\n*   Susceptible: The tested antibiotic stopped the growth or killed the bacteria or fungus causing your infection, so it may be a good choice for treatment.\n*   Intermediate: The antibiotic may work at a higher dose, or you may need to take the dose more often.\n*   Resistant: The antibiotic did not stop the growth or kill the bacteria or fungus causing the infection. It would not be a good choice for treatment.\n\nIf your results are resistant to all of the medicines, you may need to take a few medicines that may work better together.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an antibiotic sensitivity test?**\n\nIncorrect use of antibiotics has played a big role in the rise in antibiotic resistance. Make sure you use antibiotics the right way:\n\n*   Take them exactly as your provider tells you.\n*   Finish all of the antibiotics.\n*   Do not use antibiotics for viral infections. They don't work on viruses like colds and flu.\n*   Don't save them for later. Talk to your pharmacist about safely discarding leftover medicines.\n*   Don't share your antibiotics with others.\n*   Don't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else.\n\nTalk with your provider or pharmacist if you have any questions about your antibiotics.\n\n---\n\n**Antibiotic Sensitivity Test**\n\nIf you have a bacterial or fungal infection that has been shown to have antibiotic resistance, an antibiotic sensitivity test may be ordered by your healthcare provider. These could include tuberculosis, MRSA, and C. diff.\n\n**What happens during an antibiotic sensitivity test?**\n\nTo find out what type of bacteria or fungi you have, your provider may order a fungal or bacteria culture. The test is done by taking a sample from the infected site. The most common types of tests include:\n\n*   Blood culture: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.\n*   Urine culture: You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your healthcare provider.\n*   Wound culture: Your provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.\n*   Sputum culture: You may be asked to cough up sputum (a mucus, also called phlegm, made in the lungs) into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.\n*   Throat culture: Your provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.\n\nYour sample will be tested against different antibiotics to see if they are effective in killing the germs causing your infection.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for an antibiotic sensitivity test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood culture test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is no risk to having a throat culture, but it may cause slight discomfort or gagging.\n\nThere is no risk to having a urine, sputum, or wound culture.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour results will show how effective different antibiotics were in killing the bacteria or fungus causing your infection. Results are usually described in one of the following ways:\n\n*   Susceptible: The tested antibiotic stopped the growth or killed the bacteria or fungus causing your infection, so it may be a good choice for treatment.\n*   Intermediate: The antibiotic may work at a higher dose, or you may need to take the dose more often.\n*   Resistant: The antibiotic did not stop the growth or kill the bacteria or fungus causing the infection. It would not be a good choice for treatment.\n\nIf your results are resistant to all of the medicines, you may need to take a few medicines that may work better together.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an antibiotic sensitivity test?**\n\nIncorrect use of antibiotics has played a big role in the rise in antibiotic resistance. Make sure you use antibiotics the right way:\n\n*   Take them exactly as your provider tells you.\n*   Finish all of the antibiotics.\n*   Do not use antibiotics for viral infections. They don't work on viruses like colds and flu.\n*   Don't save them for later. Talk to your pharmacist about safely discarding leftover medicines.\n*   Don't share your antibiotics with others.\n*   Don't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else.\n\nTalk with your provider or pharmacist if you have any questions about your antibiotics.\n\n---\n\n**Antibiotic Sensitivity Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is an Antibiotic Sensitivity Test?**\n    An antibiotic sensitivity test, also known as antibiotic susceptibility testing, is a medical test used to determine which antibiotics are effective against a specific type of bacteria.\n*   **How does the test work?**\n    The test involves taking a sample of bodily fluid or tissue from the patient and culturing it in a laboratory. The cultured bacteria are then exposed to different antibiotics to see which ones inhibit their growth.\n*   **What is the purpose of an antibiotic sensitivity test?**\n    The primary purpose of this test is to help healthcare providers choose the most effective antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   **Antibiotic Resistance**: A growing concern in modern medicine, where bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics.\n*   **Bacterial Infections**: Infections caused by bacteria, which can range from mild to life-threatening.\n*   **C. diff Infections**: Infections caused by the bacterium Clostridioides difficile (C. diff).\n*   **Fungal Infections**: Infections caused by fungi, which can affect different parts of the body.\n*   **MRSA**: A type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics and can cause serious infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n*   **Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Tests**: Tests used to diagnose tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections.\n*   **Bacteria Culture Test**: A test used to identify the type of bacteria causing an infection.\n*   **C. diff Testing**: Tests used to diagnose C. diff infections.\n*   **Fungal Culture Test**: A test used to identify the type of fungus causing an infection.\n*   **Gonorrhea Test**: A test used to diagnose gonorrhea, a bacterial sexually transmitted infection.\n*   **Gram Stain**: A laboratory test used to identify bacteria based on their cell wall structure.\n*   **MRSA Tests**: Tests used to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.\n*   **Sputum Culture**: A test used to diagnose respiratory tract infections by culturing bacteria from sputum samples.\n*   **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring**: A test used to monitor the levels of certain drugs in the blood to ensure they are within a therapeutic range.\n*   **What You Need to Know About Blood Testing**: Information about blood tests, including their purpose, risks, and benefits.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "content": "**Antibiotics**\n\n**What are Antibiotics?**\n\nAntibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections in people and animals. They work by killing the bacteria or by making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply.\n\n**How are Antibiotics Taken?**\n\nAntibiotics can be taken in different ways:\n\n*   Orally (by mouth). This could be pills, capsules, or liquids.\n*   Topically. This might be a cream, spray, or ointment that you put on your skin. It could also be eye ointment, eye drops, or ear drops.\n*   Through an injection or intravenously (IV). This is usually for more serious infections.\n\n**What do Antibiotics Treat?**\n\nAntibiotics only treat certain bacterial infections, such as strep throat, urinary tract infections, and E. coli.\n\nYou may not need to take antibiotics for some bacterial infections. For example, you might not need them for many sinus infections or some ear infections. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed won't help you, and they can have side effects. Your health care provider can decide the best treatment for you when you're sick. Don't ask your provider to prescribe an antibiotic for you.\n\n**Do Antibiotics Treat Viral Infections?**\n\nAntibiotics do not work on viral infections. For example, you shouldn't take antibiotics for:\n\n*   Colds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow, or green\n*   Most sore throats (except strep throat)\n*   Flu\n*   Most cases of bronchitis\n\n**What are the Side Effects of Antibiotics?**\n\nThe side effects of antibiotics range from minor to very severe. Some of the common side effects include:\n\n*   Rash\n*   Nausea\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Yeast infections\n\nMore serious side effects can include:\n\n*   C. diff infections, which cause diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and sometimes even death\n*   Severe and life-threatening allergic reactions\n*   Antibiotic resistance infections\n\nCall your health care provider if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.\n\n**Why is it Important to Take Antibiotics Only When They're Needed?**\n\nYou should only take antibiotics when they are needed because they can cause side effects and can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance happens when the bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. This means that the bacteria continue to grow.\n\n**How Do I Use Antibiotics Correctly?**\n\nWhen you take antibiotics, it is important that you take them responsibly:\n\n*   Always follow the directions carefully.\n*   Finish your medicine even if you feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.\n*   Don't save your antibiotics for later.\n*   Don't share your antibiotic with others.\n*   Don't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else. This may delay the best treatment for you, make you even sicker, or cause side effects.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\n*   Antibiotic Use and Antimicrobial Resistance Facts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n*   Antibiotics: When They Can and Can't Help (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   Therapeutic Drug Monitoring  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   Antibiotic Resistance: MedlinePlus Health Topic  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n\n---\n\n**Antibiotics: MedlinePlus (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Why is it important to take antibiotics only when they're needed?**\n\nYou should only take antibiotics when they are needed because they can cause side effects and can contribute to antibiotic resistance.

    "content": "**Antibody Serology Tests**\n\n**What are antibody serology tests?**\n\nAntibody serology tests look for specific antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins your immune system makes to protect you from disease by fighting foreign substances. These substances are often pathogens (disease-causing germs), such as viruses and bacteria.\n\nYou may have specific antibodies in your blood if you:\n\n* Have been infected with, or exposed to, that pathogen before. Your body would've made antibodies to fight the pathogen. These antibodies may also protect you from getting another infection or from having severe symptoms.\n* Have had a vaccine against the pathogen. This may protect you by triggering your immune system to make antibodies against the specific pathogen.\n\nIt may take a few weeks for your body to make antibodies after you have had an infection, been exposed to a pathogen, or had a vaccine.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nAntibody serology tests are used to look for antibodies to specific diseases and may be used to check if you need another vaccination (booster shot). These diseases may include:\n\n* Measles and mumps\n* Chickenpox and shingles (which are both caused by the varicella-zoster virus)\n* Hepatitis\n* Mononucleosis\n\nThese tests may also be used to check for certain antibodies that may be a sign of an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases cause your immune system to attack your own cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake.\n\nAntibody serology tests are not used to diagnose diseases. They look at your body’s response to a pathogen by checking if you have antibodies to a disease. But they can’t show if the antibodies are from a current or past infection or a vaccination.\n\n**Why do I need an antibody serology test?**\n\nYou may need this test:\n\n* To find out if you've had a recent or past infection.\n* To check your vaccination status. If your medical records are incomplete, you may need this test to find out if you've been vaccinated.\n* To find out if a vaccine is effective. If you've already been vaccinated against a disease, the test can show if your vaccine is providing enough protection.\n* As a requirement for your school or job. Some organizations may require proof of past infection or vaccination.\n* To find out if you have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus.\n\n**What happens during an antibody serology test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an antibody serology test.\n\n**Are there any risks to this test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour results will depend on which antibodies were measured. They may be given as titers (levels of antibodies), positive (you have antibodies), or negative (you do not have antibodies).\n\nCommon results include:\n\n* Antibodies to a specific pathogen were found. This may mean you had an infection before. It could also mean you've been vaccinated against a certain disease.\n* Low levels of certain antibodies were found. This may mean an earlier vaccination does not provide you with enough protection against a disease. It also means you may need a booster shot.\n* Autoantibodies were found. Autoantibodies are a type of antibody that attacks healthy cells by mistake. This may mean you have an autoimmune disease.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.\n\n---\n\n**Antibody Serology Tests**\n\nYou may need an antibody serology test to find out if you've had a recent or past infection, check your vaccination status, or determine the effectiveness of a vaccine.

Medical Dictionary: pathogen; [cited 2024 Jun 7]; [about 1 screen].\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About an Antibody Serology Test?**\n\nAntibody serology tests can show that you have an immune response to a pathogen, but they cannot show if you have full protection from a disease or how long the protection lasts.\n\n---\n\n**Antibody Serology Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is an antibody serology test?**\n    An antibody serology test, also known as an antibody blood test, measures the levels of antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins produced by your immune system to fight off infections and diseases.\n*   **How does an antibody serology test work?**\n    During an antibody serology test, a healthcare professional will draw a sample of your blood from a vein in your arm. The blood sample is then sent to a laboratory where it is tested for the presence of specific antibodies.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Autoimmune Diseases**: Conditions where your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues.\n*   **Bacterial Infections**: Infections caused by bacteria, such as strep throat or urinary tract infections.\n*   **Chickenpox**: A viral infection that causes a painful rash and blisters.\n*   **Hepatitis**: Inflammation of the liver, often caused by viral infections.\n*   **Immune System and Disorders**: Conditions affecting the functioning of your immune system.\n*   **Infectious Mononucleosis**: A viral infection that causes fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes.\n*   **Lupus**: An autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs in the body.\n*   **Measles**: A highly contagious viral infection that causes a rash, fever, and cough.\n*   **Mumps**: A viral infection that causes swelling of the salivary glands near the ears.\n*   **Shingles**: A viral infection that causes a painful rash and blisters.\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) Test**: Measures the presence of antinuclear antibodies in your blood, often used to diagnose autoimmune diseases like lupus.\n*   **Chickenpox and Shingles Tests**: Detects the presence of antibodies against varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles.\n*   **Hepatitis Panel**: A group of tests that detect the presence of hepatitis viruses in your blood.\n*   **HIV Screening Test**: Measures the presence of antibodies against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n*   **Measles and Mumps Tests**: Detects the presence of antibodies against measles and mumps viruses.\n*   **Mononucleosis (Mono) Tests**: Measures the presence of antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis.\n\n**Coping with Medical Test Anxiety**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nIf you're feeling anxious about an upcoming medical test, consider the following tips:\n\n*   Talk to your healthcare provider: Share your concerns and ask questions about the testing process.\n*   Learn about the test: Understand what the test involves and what results mean.\n*   Prepare yourself: Bring a friend or family member for support, and take deep breaths before the test.\n\n**Preparing for a Lab Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nBefore undergoing a lab test:\n\n*   Follow your healthcare provider's instructions: Adhere to any specific preparation requirements.\n*   Arrive early: Plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment.\n*   Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to ensure accurate test results.\n\n**Understanding Your Lab Results**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nWhen receiving your lab test results:\n\n*   Review the report with your healthcare provider: Discuss any questions or concerns you may have.\n*   Ask about next steps: Understand what actions you need to take based on your test results.",

Depression is more than feeling a little sad or \"blue\" for a few days. It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health. It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives.\n\nBut antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.\n\nAre antidepressants used for other conditions?\n\nA health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety, chronic pain, or insomnia. Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions.\n\nWhat are the different types of antidepressants?\n\nThere are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems.\n\nMost of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups:\n\n* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n* Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n* Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groups\n\nIf these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people.\n\nWhich type of antidepressant is right for me?\n\nOur bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone. You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you.\n\nYour provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first. You'll consider questions such as:\n\n* Which symptoms bother you most? Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping.\n* What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs.\n* Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too.\n* Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment.\n* Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding? If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby.\n\nHow long do antidepressants take to work?\n\nAntidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job.\n\nSometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health.\n\nHow long will I need to take an antidepressant?\n\nWhen an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.\n\nWhat are the side effects of antidepressants?\n\nNot everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine.\n\nThe most common side effects from antidepressants include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Weight gain\n* Diarrhea\n* Sleepiness\n* Sexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex\n\nWhen thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options.\n\nIf you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own.\n\nIf you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away.\n\nIn some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens.\n\nWhat can I do to take antidepressants safely?\n\nAntidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:\n\n* Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too.\n* Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.\n* Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine.\n* Talk with your provider if side effects bother you.\n* Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant.\n\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\n\n---\n\n**Antidepressants: MedlinePlus (Part 2/5)**\n\n**What are antidepressants?**\n\nAntidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression.

Newer antidepressants are usually prescribed first due to fewer side effects and better efficacy.\n\n**Most common groups:**\n\n1. **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Block the reabsorption of serotonin in the brain.\n2. **Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Increase the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.\n3. **Atypical antidepressants**: Newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groups.\n\n**Older types:**\n\n1. **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**\n2. **Tetracyclics**\n3. **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**\n\n**Which type of antidepressant is right for me?**\n\nOur bodies and brains work differently, so one antidepressant won't work for everyone. You may need to try two or more medicines before finding the right one.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n1. Which symptoms bother you most?\n2. What other medicines and supplements do you take?\n3. Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative?\n4. Do you have other health conditions?\n5. Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding?\n\n**How long do antidepressants take to work?**\n\nAntidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so be patient. You may notice improvements in sleeping and eating before your mood improves.\n\n**How long will I need to take an antidepressant?**\n\nThe duration of treatment varies depending on individual circumstances. Your provider will help you determine the best course of action.\n\n---\n\n**Antidepressants: Understanding Your Options**\n\nAre you considering antidepressants to help manage your depression? With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to decide which one is right for you. In this article, we'll break down the different types of antidepressants, their benefits and risks, and what to expect when taking them.\n\n**How Long Will I Need to Take an Antidepressant?**\n\nWhen an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.\n\n**What Are the Side Effects of Antidepressants?**\n\nNot everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine. The most common side effects include:\n\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Weight gain\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Sleepiness\n*   Sexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex\n\n**What Can I Do to Take Antidepressants Safely?**\n\nAntidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:\n\n*   Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants.\n*   Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.\n*   Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine.\n*   Talk with your provider if side effects bother you.\n*   Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse.\n\n**Understanding Antidepressants**\n\nAntidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression. Depression is more than feeling a little sad or \"blue\" for a few days. It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health. It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives.\n\nBut antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.\n\n**Choosing the Right Antidepressant**\n\nThere are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems.\n\nMost of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups:\n\n*   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n*   Norepinephrine-releasing agents\n\nIf these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people.\n\n**Finding the Right Combination**\n\nOur bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone. You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you. Your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first.\n\n---\n\n**Antidepressants: MedlinePlus (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **8 Things To Know about Depression and Complementary Health Approaches**: Learn how complementary health approaches can help manage depression.\n*   **St. John's Wort and Depression**: Understand the potential interactions between St. John's Wort and antidepressant medications.\n\n**Living With**\n\n*   **MAOIs and Diet: Is It Necessary to Restrict Tyramine?**: Discover how a specific diet can affect MAOI treatment outcomes.\n*   **Antidepressant Withdrawal: Is There Such a Thing?**: Explore the possibility of antidepressant withdrawal and its implications for patients.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   **Antidepressants and Alcohol: What's the Concern?**: Learn about the potential risks of combining antidepressants with alcohol.\n*   **Antidepressants and Weight Gain: What Causes It?**: Understand the factors contributing to weight gain as a side effect of antidepressant treatment.\n*   **Antidepressants: Another Weapon against Chronic Pain**: Discover how antidepressants can help manage chronic pain.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Atypical Antidepressants**: Learn about the unique properties and uses of atypical antidepressants.\n*   **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)**: Understand the mechanism of action and applications of MAOI medications.\n*   **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Explore the characteristics and uses of SSRI antidepressants.\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   **Depression: MedlinePlus Genetics**: Access genetic information related to depression from the National Library of Medicine.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Antidepressants**: Find clinical trials related to antidepressant medications.\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov: Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors**: Explore clinical trials focused on serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   **References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed**: Access a collection of journal articles related to antidepressants.\n*   **Article: Azetukalner, a Novel KV7 Potassium Channel Opener, in Adults With Major...**: Read about the potential benefits of azetukalner in treating major depressive disorder.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   **NAMI**: Connect with experts from the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n*   **National Institute of Mental Health**: Access resources and expertise from the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n---\n\n**Antidepressants**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA**\n\n* **Amitriptyline and perphenazine overdose**: Amitriptyline and perphenazine can be toxic in high doses.

    "content": "**Antidiuretic Hormone Blood Test**\n\nThe antidiuretic hormone blood test measures the level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nTalk to your health care provider about your medicines before the test. Many medicines can affect ADH level, including:\n\n* Alcohol\n* Diuretics (water pills)\n* Blood pressure medicines\n* Insulin\n* Medicines for mental disorders\n* Nicotine\n* Steroids\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nADH is a hormone that is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary, a small gland at the base of the brain. ADH acts on the kidneys to control the amount of water excreted in the urine.\n\nThe ADH blood test is ordered when your provider suspects you have a disorder that affects your ADH level such as:\n\n* Buildup of fluids in your body that are causing swelling or puffiness (edema)\n* Excessive amounts of urine\n* Low sodium (salt) level in your blood\n* Thirst that is intense or uncontrollable\n\nCertain diseases affect the normal release of ADH. The blood level of ADH must be tested to determine the cause of the disease. ADH may be measured as part of a water restriction test to find the cause of a disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values for ADH can range from 0 to 5.9 pg/mL (0 to 5.4 pmol/L).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher-than-normal level may occur when too much ADH is released, either from the brain where it is made or from somewhere else in the body. This is called the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH).\n\nCauses of SIADH include:\n\n* Brain injury or trauma\n* Brain tumors\n* Fluid imbalance after surgery\n* Infection in the brain or the tissue that surrounds the brain\n* Infection in the lungs\n* Certain medicines, such as some seizure medicines, pain medicines, and antidepressants\n* Small cell carcinoma lung cancer\n* Stroke\n\nA higher-than-normal level of ADH may be found in people with heart failure, liver failure, or some kind of kidney disease.\n\nA lower-than-normal level may indicate:\n\n* Damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\n* Central diabetes insipidus (a condition in which the kidneys are not able to conserve water)\n* Excessive thirst (polydipsia)\n* Too much fluid in the blood vessels (volume overload)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Antidiuretic Hormone Blood Test**\n\nThe antidiuretic hormone (ADH) blood test measures the level of ADH in blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed to perform the ADH blood test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, talk to your health care provider about your medicines.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nMost laboratories cannot run this test. Only very specialized laboratories can perform the assay correctly. Serum co-peptin is now commonly used as a substitute for measuring ADH.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher-than-normal level may occur when too much ADH is released, either from the brain where it is made or from somewhere else in the body. This is called the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH).\n\nCauses of SIADH include:\n\n* Brain injury or trauma\n* Brain tumors\n* Fluid imbalance after surgery\n* Infection in the brain or the tissue that surrounds the brain\n* Infection in the lungs\n* Certain medicines, such as some seizure medicines, pain medicines, and antidepressants\n* Small cell carcinoma lung cancer\n* Stroke\n\nA higher-than-normal level of ADH may be found in people with heart failure, liver failure, or some kind of kidney disease.\n\nA lower-than-normal level may indicate:\n\n* Damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\n* Central diabetes insipidus (a condition in which the kidneys are not able to conserve water)\n* Excessive thirst (polydipsia)\n* Too much fluid in the blood vessels (volume overload)\n\n---\n\n**Antidiuretic Hormone Blood Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn antidiuretic hormone (ADH) blood test measures the level of ADH in your blood. ADH, also known as vasopressin, is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland.\n\n**Why is it done?**\n\nThe test is used to diagnose and monitor conditions related to ADH imbalance. A higher-than-normal level of ADH may be found in people with heart failure, liver failure, or some kind of kidney disease. A lower-than-normal level may indicate damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, central diabetes insipidus (a condition in which the kidneys are not able to conserve water), excessive thirst (polydipsia), or too much fluid in the blood vessels (volume overload).\n\n**Causes of SIADH**\n\nSIADH is a syndrome characterized by an inappropriate release of ADH. Causes include:\n\n*   **Infection in the lungs**: Certain infections can lead to an overproduction of ADH.\n*   **Certain medicines**: Some seizure medicines, pain medicines, and antidepressants can cause an increase in ADH levels.\n*   **Small cell carcinoma lung cancer**: This type of cancer can produce ADH.\n*   **Stroke**: A stroke can damage the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, leading to a decrease in ADH production.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

This need may be permanent if kidney damage is severe.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor ethylene glycol: Death may occur within the first 24 hours. If the patient survives, there may be little or no urine output for several weeks before the kidneys recover. Kidney damage may be permanent. Any brain damage that occurs also may be permanent.\n\nFor methanol: Methanol is extremely toxic. As little as 2 tablespoons (1 ounce or 30 milliliters) can kill a child, and 4 to 16 tablespoons (2 to 8 ounces or 60 to 240 milliliters) can be deadly for an adult. The outcome depends on how much was swallowed and how soon appropriate care was given. Vision loss or blindness may be permanent\n\nPermanent damage to the nervous system may occur. This can cause blindness, decreased mental functioning, and a condition similar to Parkinson disease.\n\nKeep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk for poisoning and overdose.\n\n---\n\n**Antifreeze Poisoning**\n\n**What is Antifreeze?**\n\nAntifreeze, also known as engine coolant, is a liquid used to cool engines. It contains poisonous ingredients that can cause serious harm if ingested.\n\n**Symptoms of Antifreeze Poisoning**\n\n*   Rapid breathing\n*   No breathing\n*   Blood in urine\n*   No urine output or decreased urine output\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Blindness\n*   Rapid heartbeat\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Leg cramps\n*   Coma\n*   Convulsions\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Slurred speech\n*   Stupor (lack of alertness)\n*   Unconsciousness\n*   Unsteady walk\n*   Weakness\n*   Blue lips and fingernails\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Treatment for Antifreeze Poisoning**\n\nSeek medical help right away. Do not make a person throw up unless poison control or a healthcare provider tells you to.\n\nUse standard first aid and CPR for signs of shock or no heartbeat (cardiac arrest). Call your local poison control center or 911 for more help.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n*   Person's age, weight, and condition\n*   Name of product (as well as the ingredients, if known)\n*   Time it was swallowed\n*   Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\n---\n\n**Antifreeze Poisoning**\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the head (computed tomography)\n* ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)\n* Intravenous fluids (through a vein)\n* Medicines to reverse the effects of the poison\n* Tube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes)\n\nDialysis (kidney machine) treatment may be needed during recovery. This need may be permanent if kidney damage is severe.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor ethylene glycol: Death may occur within the first 24 hours. If the patient survives, there may be little or no urine output for several weeks before the kidneys recover. Kidney damage may be permanent. Any brain damage that occurs also may be permanent.\n\nFor methanol: Methanol is extremely toxic. As little as 2 tablespoons (1 ounce or 30 milliliters) can kill a child, and 4 to 16 tablespoons (2 to 8 ounces or 60 to 240 milliliters) can be deadly for an adult. The outcome depends on how much was swallowed and how soon appropriate care was given. Vision loss or blindness may be permanent\n\nPermanent damage to the nervous system may occur. This can cause blindness, decreased mental functioning, and a condition similar to Parkinson disease.\n\n**Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk for poisoning and overdose.**\n\n**References**\n\nNelson ME. Toxic alcohols. In: Walls RM, ed. Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. 10th ed.

    "content": "**Antimitochondrial Antibody**\n\n_A blood test used to measure the amount of antimitochondrial antibodies in the blood._\n\n**What are Antimitochondrial Antibodies?**\n\nAntimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are substances (antibodies) that form against mitochondria. The mitochondria are an important part of cells, providing energy for their proper functioning.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed, typically taken from a vein through a procedure called venipuncture.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour healthcare provider may instruct you not to eat or drink anything for up to 6 hours before the test, usually overnight.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may experience moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there might be some throbbing.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nYou may need this test if you exhibit signs of liver damage. The test is primarily used to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis. It can also help distinguish between bile system-related cirrhosis and liver issues caused by other factors, such as blockages, viral hepatitis, or alcoholic cirrhosis.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormally, there are no antibodies present in the blood.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAlmost all individuals with PBC will test positive for AMA. It is rare for someone without PBC to have a positive result. However, some people with a positive AMA test and no other signs of liver disease may eventually develop PBC over time. Rarely, abnormal results might be due to other types of liver disease or autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but can include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a minor risk whenever the skin is broken)\n\n**References**\n\nDaniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne W, Pincus MR.

    "content": "**Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Test**\n\nThis test looks for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in a sample of your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. But sometimes antibodies attack the healthy cells of your own tissues and organs by mistake. This is called autoimmune disease.\n\nANCAs attack healthy white blood cells called neutrophils. This can lead to a disorder called autoimmune vasculitis. There are several types of autoimmune vasculitis, but they all cause inflammation and swelling in your blood vessels. When this happens, your blood vessels can narrow or close off. This can cause different types of serious health problems depending on which blood vessels in your body are affected.\n\nThere are two main kinds of ANCA called pANCA and cANCA. Each type targets a specific protein inside white blood cells. An ANCA test can show whether you have one or both types of antibodies. This information helps your health care provider diagnose which type of autoimmune vasculitis you have so you can get the right treatment.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nANCA testing is used to help:\n\n* Find out if you have autoimmune vasculitis and which type.\n* Monitor treatment for autoimmune vasculitis.\n* Diagnose whether you have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Both conditions are types of inflammatory bowel disease. ANCAs are more commonly found in ulcerative colitis.\n\n**Types of Autoimmune Vasculitis**\n\nThere are three main types:\n\n1. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: This condition used to be called Wegener's disease. It most often affects blood vessels in the lungs and/or sinuses. It may also affect the nose, windpipe, or kidneys.\n2. **Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)**: This disorder can affect several parts of the body, including the lungs, kidneys, nerves, skin, and joints.\n3. **Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)**: This condition used to be called Churg Strauss syndrome. It usually affects blood vessels in the lungs and/or sinuses. It may also affect the stomach and intestines, skin, heart, and nervous system. It often causes asthma and a high level of white blood cells called eosinophils.\n\n**Why do I need an ANCA test?**\n\nIf you have symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis, you may need an ANCA test. Symptoms may develop slowly or quickly. They may be mild or severe.\n\nSome common symptoms include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* General aches and pains\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n\nOther symptoms depend on which type of vasculitis you have and which parts of your body are affected.\n\n**What happens during an ANCA test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for an ANCA test. But ANCA testing may be done with other blood tests. Your provider will let you know if you need to prepare.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour provider will consider the results of your ANCA test along with your symptoms and the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean.\n\nIf you were tested for autoimmune vasculitis:\n\n* A negative result means that no ANCAs were found in your blood sample. Your symptoms probably aren't caused by autoimmune vasculitis.\n* A positive result means that ANCAs were found in your blood sample. This may mean you have autoimmune vasculitis. Your test results will also show which type of ANCAs were found. This can help diagnose the type of vasculitis you have.\n\nIf ANCA antibodies are found, another test may be done on your blood sample to see how much ANCA is in your blood. You will often need other blood tests and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue or cells for testing. The tissue sample will be taken from a blood vessel that is swollen.\n\nIf you were tested to monitor treatment for autoimmune vasculitis, ANCA test results may show whether your treatment is working. But this test isn't always an accurate way to measure how much disease you have.\n\nIf you were tested for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), your provider will consider your ANCA test results along with the results from another antibody blood test. This test checks for an antibody called ASCA (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies). ASCA are common in people with IBD. You may have:\n\n* Ulcerative colitis if ANCA was found, but ASCA was not found.\n* Crohn's disease if ANCA was not found, but ASCA was found.\n\nIf neither antibody was found, you may still have IBD.\n\n---\n\n**Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe ANCA test looks for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in a sample of your blood.

The antinuclear antibody test looks for antibodies that bind to a part of the cell called the nucleus.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nBlood is drawn from a vein, most often from a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic), and an elastic band is wrapped around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood. A needle is then inserted into the vein, and the blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed, but certain drugs, including birth control pills, procainamide, and thiazide diuretics, can affect the accuracy of this test. Make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may need this test if you have signs of an autoimmune disorder, such as unexplained symptoms including arthritis, rashes, fevers, or chest pain. Suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be the most common reason why the test is done.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nANA test results are most often reported in 2 parts: the level or titer and the pattern. Titres are reported in ratios, most often 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, and 1:640. Some labs will report a titre above 1:160 as positive.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive ANA is not enough to make a diagnosis. To diagnose any disease related to a positive ANA, it's essential to have:\n\n* A full assessment by a doctor who specializes in the illness\n* Further antibody testing for certain illnesses\n\nTo make the diagnosis of SLE, the following must be present:\n\n* Certain clinical features\n* Positive ANA results (a lack of ANA makes the diagnosis much less likely)\n* Certain specific ANA antibodies, which help to confirm the diagnosis\n\nOther disorders besides SLE where positive ANA results strongly suggest a diagnosis include:\n\n* Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)\n* Sjögren syndrome (primary)\n* Myositis (inflammatory muscle disease)\n* Drug-induced lupus erythematosus\n\n**Risks**\n\nVeins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe ANA can be positive in relatives of people with SLE who do not have SLE themselves. There is a very low chance of developing SLE at some time later in life if the only finding is a low titer of ANA.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican College of Rheumatology website.

Most often, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\n\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.\n\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\n\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\n\n**Why is the test performed?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have signs of an autoimmune disorder, such as unexplained symptoms including arthritis, rashes, fevers or chest pain.

    "content": "**Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**\n\n_Autoimmune Disorder Involving Frequent Blood Clots_\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses). When you have this condition, your body's immune system makes abnormal proteins that attack the blood cells and lining of the blood vessels. The presence of these antibodies can cause problems with blood flow and lead to dangerous clots in blood vessels throughout the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of APS is not known. Both certain gene changes and other factors (such as an infection) may cause the problem to develop.\n\nIt is often found in people with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The condition is more common in women than in men. It is often found in women who have a history of repeated miscarriages.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not have any symptoms, even though you have the antibodies. Symptoms that may occur include:\n\n* Blood clots in the legs, arms or the lungs\n* Recurrent miscarriages or still birth\n* Rash, in some people\n\nIn rare cases, clots suddenly develop in many arteries over a period of days. This is called catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS). It can lead to stroke as well as the clots in the kidney, liver, and other organs throughout the body, and gangrene in the limbs.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests for the lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies may be done when:\n\n* An unexpected blood clot occurs, such as in young people or those with no other risk factors for a blood clot.\n* A woman has a history of repeated pregnancy losses.\n\nThe lupus anticoagulant tests are blood clotting tests. The antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) cause the test to be abnormal in the laboratory.\n\nTypes of clotting tests may include:\n\n* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)\n* Russell viper venom time\n* Thromboplastin inhibition test\n\nTests for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) will also be done. They include:\n\n* Anticardiolipin antibody tests\n* Antibodies to beta-2-glypoprotein I (Beta2-GPI)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for APS is directed at preventing complications from new blood clots forming or existing clots getting larger. You will need to take some form of blood-thinning medicine.\n\nIf you also have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, you will need to keep that condition under control as well.\n\nThe exact treatment will depend on how severe your condition is and the complications it is causing.\n\n**Anticoagulation Therapy**\n\nIn general, you will need treatment with a blood thinner for a long time if you have APS. Initial treatment may be heparin. This medicine is given by injection.\n\nIn most cases, warfarin (Coumadin), which is given by mouth, is then started. It is necessary to frequently monitor the level of anticoagulation. This is most often done using the INR test.\n\nIf you have APS and become pregnant, you will need to be followed closely by a provider who is an expert in this condition. You will not take warfarin during pregnancy, but will be given heparin shots instead.\n\n**Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS)**\n\nTreatment for CAPS that involves a combination of anticoagulation therapy, high doses of corticosteroids, and plasma exchange has been effective in most people. Sometimes IVIG, rituximab or eculizumab is also used for severe cases.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo help prevent blood clots from forming:\n\n* Avoid most birth control pills or hormone treatments for menopause (women).\n* DO NOT smoke or use other tobacco products.\n* Get up and move around during long plane flights or other times when you have to sit or lie down for extended periods.\n* Move your ankles up and down when you can't move around.\n\nYou will be prescribed blood-thinning medicines (such as heparin and warfarin) to help prevent blood clots:\n\n* After surgery\n* After a bone fracture\n* With active cancer\n* When you need to sit or lie down for long periods of time, such as during a hospital stay or recovering at home\n\nYou may also need to take blood thinners for 3 to 4 weeks after surgery to lower your risk for blood clots.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, people with APS will have repeat clotting events. Most of the time, outcome is good with proper treatment, which includes long-term anticoagulation therapy. Some people may have blood clots that are hard to control in spite of treatments. This can lead to CAPS, which can be life-threatening.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you notice symptoms of a blood clot, such as:\n\n* Swelling or redness in the leg\n* Shortness of breath\n* Pain, numbness, and pale skin color in an arm or leg\n\nAlso talk to your provider if you have repeated loss of pregnancy (miscarriage).\n\n---\n\n**Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**\n\n**What is Antiphospholipid Syndrome?**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses).

If you also have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, you will need to keep that condition under control as well.\n\nIn general, you will need treatment with a blood thinner for a long time if you have APS. Initial treatment may be heparin. This medicine is given by injection.\n\n---\n\n**Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**\n\nIn general, you will need treatment with a blood thinner for a long time if you have APS. Initial treatment may be heparin. This medicine is given by injection.\n\nIn most cases, warfarin (Coumadin), which is given by mouth, is then started. It is necessary to frequently monitor the level of anticoagulation. This is most often done using the INR test.\n\nIf you have APS and become pregnant, you will need to be followed closely by a provider who is an expert in this condition. You will not take warfarin during pregnancy, but will be given heparin shots instead.\n\nIf you have SLE and APS, your provider may also recommend that you take hydroxychloroquine.\n\nCurrently, other types of blood thinning medicines are not recommended.\n\n**Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS)**\n\nTreatment for CAPS that involves a combination of anticoagulation therapy, high doses of corticosteroids, and plasma exchange has been effective in most people. Sometimes IVIG, rituximab or eculizumab is also used for severe cases.\n\n**Positive Test for Lupus Anticoagulant or APL**\n\nYou will not need treatment if you do not have symptoms, pregnancy loss, or if you have never had a blood clot.\n\nTake the following steps to help prevent blood clots from forming:\n\n* Avoid most birth control pills or hormone treatments for menopause (women).\n* DO NOT smoke or use other tobacco products.\n* Get up and move around during long plane flights or other times when you have to sit or lie down for extended periods.\n* Move your ankles up and down when you can't move around.\n\nYou will be prescribed blood-thinning medicines (such as heparin and warfarin) to help prevent blood clots:\n\n* After surgery\n* After a bone fracture\n* With active cancer\n* When you need to sit or lie down for long periods of time, such as during a hospital stay or recovering at home\n\nYou may also need to take blood thinners for 3 to 4 weeks after surgery to lower your risk for blood clots.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, people with APS will have repeat clotting events. Most of the time, outcome is good with proper treatment, which includes long-term anticoagulation therapy. Some people may have blood clots that are hard to control in spite of treatments. This can lead to CAPS, which can be life-threatening.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you notice symptoms of a blood clot, such as:\n\n* Swelling or redness in the leg\n* Shortness of breath\n* Pain, numbness, and pale skin color in an arm or leg\n\nAlso talk to your provider if you have repeated loss of pregnancy (miscarriage).\n\n---\n\n**Antiphospholipid Syndrome - APS**\n\nContact your provider if you notice symptoms of a blood clot, such as:\n\n* Swelling or redness in the leg\n* Shortness of breath\n* Pain, numbness, and pale skin color in an arm or leg\n\nAlso talk to your provider if you have repeated loss of pregnancy (miscarriage).\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAnticardiolipin antibodies; Hughes syndrome\n\n**Images**\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus rash on the face\nBlood clots\n\n**References**\n\nAmigo M-C, Khamashta MA.

    "content": "**Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\n_A Disorder Characterized by an Increased Tendency to Form Abnormal Blood Clots_\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.\n\nOther signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include:\n\n*   A reduced amount of cells involved in blood clotting called platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n*   A shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis)\n*   A purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin\n*   Open sores (ulcers) on the skin\n*   Migraine headaches\n*   Heart disease\n\nMany people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n**Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nRarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age. A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Antiphospholipid Syndrome?**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nThe genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition results from the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nOther signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include:\n\n*   A reduced amount of cells involved in blood clotting called platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n*   A shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis)\n*   A purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin\n*   Open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, or heart disease\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 2,000 people. This condition may be responsible for up to one percent of all thromboses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Complications During Pregnancy**\n\nWomen with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy, including:\n\n*   Pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia)\n*   An underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency)\n*   Early delivery\n*   Pregnancy loss (miscarriage)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nRarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body.

These antibodies are called lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\nThe exact cause of APS is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) in a few genes have been found in people with APS, which may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of APS are sporadic, occurring in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families, but it does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing APS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Antiphospholipid Carriers**\n\nPeople who repeatedly test positive for any of the antiphospholipid antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers. These individuals are at greater risk of developing a thrombosis than is the general population, with the risk being especially high in people who test positive for all three antiphospholipid antibodies (triple-positive).\n\n---\n\n**Antiphospholipid Syndrome**\n\n**What is Antiphospholipid Syndrome?**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a disorder of blood coagulation characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. These antibodies are directed against phospholipids, which are essential components of cell membranes.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of APS are still not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families, although there is no clear pattern of inheritance. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Anti-phospholipid syndrome\n* Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome\n* Hughes syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: Provides information on APS, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: Offers resources for patients with APS, including support groups and advocacy organizations.\n* **Clinical Trials**: Lists clinical trials related to APS, allowing patients to participate in research studies.\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: Provides information on the genetic aspects of APS, including its association with specific genes.\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on APS:\n\n1.
