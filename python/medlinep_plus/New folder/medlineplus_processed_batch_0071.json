    "content": "**Fibrinopeptide A Blood Test**\n\n_Fibrinopeptide A is a substance released as blood clots in your body. A test can be done to measure the level of this substance in your blood._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n_A blood sample is needed._\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n_No special preparation is necessary._\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n_When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away._\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n_This test is used to help diagnose severe problems with blood clotting, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Certain types of leukemia are associated with DIC._\n\n**Normal Results**\n\n_In general, the level of fibrinopeptide A should range from 0.6 to 1.9 (mg/mL)._\n\n---\n\n**Fibrinopeptide A Blood Test**\n\n**What is Fibrinopeptide A?**\n\nFibrinopeptide A (FPA) is a fragment of fibrinogen, a protein in the blood that helps form clots. The level of FPA in the blood can indicate how well the body's clotting system is working.\n\n**Normal Value Ranges**\n\nThe normal value range for FPA may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. In general, the level of fibrinopeptide A should range from 0.6 to 1.9 (mg/mL).\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn increased FPA level may be a sign of:\n\n* Cellulitis\n* DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation)\n* Leukemia at the time of diagnosis, during early treatment, and during a relapse\n* Some infections\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Drawing blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFPA\n\n**References**\n\nPai M, Moffat KA.

    "content": "**Fibrocystic Breasts**\n\nFibrocystic breasts are painful, lumpy breasts. Formerly called fibrocystic breast disease, this common condition is, in fact, not a disease. Many women experience these normal breast changes, usually around their period.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFibrocystic breast changes occur when thickening of breast tissue (fibrosis) and fluid-filled cysts develop in one or both breasts. It is thought that hormones made in the ovaries during menstruation can trigger these breast changes. This may make your breasts feel swollen, lumpy, or painful before or during your period each month.\n\nMore than half of women have this condition at some time during their life. It is most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It is rare in women after menopause unless they are taking estrogen. Fibrocystic breast changes do not change your risk for breast cancer.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Pain or discomfort in both breasts that may come and go with your period, but may last through the whole month\n* Breasts that feel full, swollen, or heavy\n* Pain or discomfort under the arms\n* Breast lumps that change in size with the menstrual period\n\nYou may have a lump in the same area of the breast that becomes larger before each period and returns to its original size afterward. This type of lump moves when it is pushed with your fingers. It does not feel stuck or fixed to the tissue around it.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you. This will include a breast exam. Tell your provider if you have noticed any breast changes.\n\nMammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.\n\n* Mammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\n* Women with a family history of breast cancer should work with their health care provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\n\nMammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older.\n\nFor women under 35, a breast ultrasound may be used to look more closely at breast tissue. You may need further tests if a lump was found during a breast exam or your imaging result was abnormal.\n\nIf the lump appears to be a cyst, your provider may aspirate the lump with a needle, which confirms the lump was a cyst and sometimes may improve the symptoms. For other types of lumps, additional imaging may be done. If these exams are normal, but your provider still has concerns about a lump, a biopsy may be performed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWomen who have no symptoms or only mild symptoms do not need treatment.\n\nYour provider may recommend the following self-care measures:\n\n* Take over-the-counter medicine, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain\n* Apply heat or ice on the breast\n* Wear a well-fitting supportive bra, such as a sports bra\n\nSome women believe that eating less fat, caffeine, or chocolate helps with their symptoms. There is no clear evidence that these measures help.\n\nVitamin E, thiamine, magnesium, and evening primrose oil are not harmful in most cases. Studies have not shown these to be helpful. Talk with your provider before taking any medicine or supplement.\n\nFor more severe symptoms, your provider may prescribe hormones, such as birth control pills or other medicine. Take the medicine exactly as instructed. Be sure to let your provider know if you have side effects from the medicine.\n\nSurgery is never done to treat this condition. However, a lump that stays the same throughout your menstrual cycle is considered suspicious. In this case, your provider may recommend a core needle biopsy. In this test, a small amount of tissue is removed from the lump and examined under a microscope.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf your breast exams and mammograms are normal, you do not need to worry about your symptoms. Fibrocystic breast changes do not generally increase your risk for breast cancer. However, if you have a family history of breast cancer and fibrocystic changes, there is a small increase in the risk. Symptoms usually improve after menopause.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You find new or different lumps during your breast self-exam.\n* You have new discharge from the nipple or any discharge that is bloody or clear.\n* You have redness or puckering of the skin, or flattening or indentation of the nipple.\n\n---\n\n**Fibrocystic Breasts**\n\nFormerly called fibrocystic breast disease, this common condition is, in fact, not a disease.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, benign breast conditions are common and can be managed effectively.\n\n**Screening for Breast Cancer**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for breast cancer in women aged 50-74 years old. This recommendation is based on evidence that mammography screening reduces mortality from breast cancer.\n\n**Etiology and Management of Benign Breast Disease**\n\nBenign breast disease, also known as fibrocystic change, is a common condition affecting many women. The exact cause of benign breast disease is unknown, but it is thought to be related to hormonal influences. Treatment options for benign breast disease include hormone therapy, pain relief medication, and surgical intervention in severe cases.\n\n**Diseases of the Breast**\n\nBreast diseases can range from benign conditions like fibrocystic change to malignant tumors.

    "content": "**Fibromyalgia**\n\nAlso called: Fibro, FMS\n\n**What is fibromyalgia?**\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that causes pain all over the body, fatigue, and other symptoms. There is no cure, but treatments can help with the symptoms.\n\n**What causes fibromyalgia?**\n\nThe exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Studies of the brains of people with fibromyalgia found that they seem to process pain differently than people who don't have it. They may feel pain when others do not, and they may also have a more severe reaction to pain.\n\nFibromyalgia can run in families, so genetics may also play a role. Other factors may also be involved, such as having certain diseases that cause pain.\n\n**Who is at risk for fibromyalgia?**\n\nAnyone can get fibromyalgia, but it is more common in:\n\n* Women; they are twice as likely to have fibromyalgia\n* Middle-aged people; your chance of having it increases as you get older\n* People with certain diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis\n* People who have a family member with fibromyalgia\n\n**What are the symptoms of fibromyalgia?**\n\nThe main symptoms of fibromyalgia are:\n\n* Chronic (long-lasting) pain and stiffness all over the body. People often describe it as aching, burning, or throbbing.\n* Fatigue and tiredness.\n* Trouble sleeping.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Problems with thinking, memory, and concentration (sometimes called \"fibro fog\")\n* Muscle and joint stiffness\n* Numbness or tingling in the arms and legs\n* Sensitivity to light, noise, odors, and temperature\n\nPeople who have fibromyalgia are also more likely to have certain diseases, including:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Depression\n* Headaches, including migraines\n* Irritable bowel syndrome\n* Pain in the face or jaw, including disorders of the jaw know as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ)\n\n**How is fibromyalgia diagnosed?**\n\nFibromyalgia can be hard to diagnose. It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis.\n\nTo find out if you have fibromyalgia, your provider:\n\n* Will take your medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptoms\n* Will do a physical exam\n* May order x-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions\n\n**What are the treatments for fibromyalgia?**\n\nNot all providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a provider or team of providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\nThere is no cure for fibromyalgia, so treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms. Providers usually use a combination of treatments, including medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies:\n\n* Medicines\n\t+ Certain antidepressants and anti-seizure medicines, which may help with pain or sleep problems.\n\t+ Pain relievers.\n* Lifestyle changes\n\t+ Getting enough sleep.\n\t+ Getting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you.\n\t+ Learning how to manage stress.\n\t+ Learning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest.\n* Talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too.\n* Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your provider first. These therapies include:\n\t+ Mindfulness meditation.\n\t+ Biofeedback, which uses electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them.\n\t+ Movement therapies such as yoga and tai chi.\n\t+ Massage therapy.\n\t+ Acupuncture.\n\n---\n\n**Fibromyalgia**\n\n**What is Fibromyalgia?**\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that causes pain all over the body, fatigue, and other symptoms.

It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\n\nTo find out if you have fibromyalgia, your provider:\n\n* Will take your medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptoms\n* Will do a physical exam\n* May order x-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions\n\n**Treating Fibromyalgia**\n\nNot all providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a provider or team of providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\nThere is no cure for fibromyalgia, so treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms. Providers usually use a combination of treatments, including medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies:\n\n* Medicines: Certain antidepressants and anti-seizure medicines, which may help with pain or sleep problems.\n* Lifestyle changes: Getting enough sleep, getting regular physical activity, learning how to manage stress, and learning to pace yourself.\n* Talk therapy: Such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts.\n* Complementary therapies: Such as mindfulness meditation, biofeedback, movement therapies such as yoga and tai chi, massage therapy, and acupuncture.\n\n**Genetics of Fibromyalgia**\n\nFibromyalgia can run in families, so genetics may also play a role. Other factors may also be involved, such as having certain diseases that cause pain.\n\n**Clinical Trials for Fibromyalgia**\n\nYou can find information about clinical trials for fibromyalgia on the National Institutes of Health website.\n\n**Journal Articles about Fibromyalgia**\n\nYou can find references and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed articles about fibromyalgia on the National Library of Medicine website.\n\n---\n\n**Fibromyalgia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Related Health Topics**\n\t+ Arthritis\n\t+ Muscle Disorders\n\t+ Pain\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **National Institutes of Health**\n\t+ The primary NIH organization for research on Fibromyalgia is the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **NIH MedlinePlus Magazine**\n\t+ 6 Ways To Manage Your Fibromyalgia",

    "content": "**Fibromyalgia**\n\nFibromyalgia is a condition characterized by long-term pain spread throughout the body. The pain is often accompanied by fatigue, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, headaches, depression, and anxiety.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but researchers believe it may be related to how the central nervous system processes pain signals from nerves. Possible causes or triggers include:\n\n*   Physical or emotional trauma\n*   Abnormal pain response: Areas in the brain that control pain may react differently in people with fibromyalgia\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Infection, such as a virus (although none has been identified)\n\nFibromyalgia is more common in females than males, particularly among women aged 20 to 50.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWidespread pain is the primary symptom of fibromyalgia. It may be mild to severe and can feel like:\n\n*   A deep ache\n*   Stabbing or burning pain\n*   Pain coming from the joints (although the joints are not affected or damaged)\n\nPeople with fibromyalgia often wake up with body pain and stiffness. Some experience improved pain during the day, while others have constant pain.\n\nPain may worsen with:\n\n*   Physical activity\n*   Cold or damp weather\n*   Anxiety and stress\n\nCommon symptoms include fatigue, depressed mood, sleep problems, and other issues like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose fibromyalgia, you must have had at least 3 months of widespread pain accompanied by one or more of the following:\n\n*   Ongoing sleep problems\n*   Fatigue\n*   Thinking or memory problems\n\nA physical exam may not reveal tender points, and blood and urine tests, as well as imaging tests, are typically normal.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment are to relieve pain and other symptoms, reduce disability, and help the person cope with their symptoms. Treatment may involve:\n\n*   Physical therapy\n*   Exercise and fitness program\n*   Stress-relief methods (including light massage and relaxation techniques)\n\nMedications like duloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), and milnacipran (Savella) are approved by the FDA specifically for treating fibromyalgia. Other medications, such as antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and pain relievers, may also be used.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy is an important part of treatment, helping individuals learn to:\n\n*   Deal with negative thoughts\n*   Keep a diary of pain and symptoms\n*   Recognize what makes their symptoms worse\n*   Seek out enjoyable activities\n*   Set limits\n\nComplementary and alternative treatments may also be helpful, including tai chi, yoga, acupuncture, and support groups.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for fibromyalgia.\n\n---\n\n**Fibromyalgia**\n\nFibromyalgia is a condition in which a person has long-term pain that is spread throughout their body. The pain is most often accompanied by fatigue, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, headaches, depression, and anxiety.\n\nPeople with fibromyalgia may also have tenderness in the joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of fibromyalgia is not known. Researchers think that it is due to a problem with how the central nervous system processes pain signals from nerves. Possible causes or triggers of fibromyalgia include:\n\n*   Physical or emotional trauma\n*   Abnormal pain response: Areas in the brain that control pain may react differently in people with fibromyalgia\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Infection, such as a virus, although none has been identified\n\nFibromyalgia is more common in females as compared to males. Women ages 20 to 50 are the most affected group of people.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe following conditions may be seen with fibromyalgia or have similar symptoms:\n\n*   Long-term (chronic) neck or back pain\n*   Long-term (chronic) fatigue syndrome\n*   Depression\n*   Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)\n*   Lyme disease\n*   Sleep disorders\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, you must have had at least 3 months of widespread pain with one or more of the following:\n\n*   Ongoing problems with sleep\n*   Fatigue\n*   Thinking or memory problems\n\nIt is not necessary for the health care provider to find tender points during a physical exam to make a diagnosis and results of the exam may be normal. You will be asked questions about depression and anxiety since those conditions are often present in people with fibromyalgia.\n\nResults from blood and urine tests, and imaging tests are normal. These tests may be done to check for other conditions with similar symptoms. Studies of breathing during sleeping may be done to find out if you have a condition called sleep apnea.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment are to help relieve pain and other symptoms, to reduce disability, and to help the person cope with the symptoms.\n\nThe first type of treatment may involve:\n\n*   Physical therapy\n*   An exercise and fitness program\n*   Stress-relief methods, including light massage and relaxation techniques\n\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may also prescribe an antidepressant or muscle relaxant. Sometimes, combinations of medicines are helpful.\n\nThe goal of these medicines is to improve your sleep and help you better tolerate pain.\nMedicine should be used along with exercise and behavior therapy.\nDuloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), and milnacipran (Savella) are medicines that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for treating fibromyalgia.\n\nOther medicines are also used to treat the condition, such as:\n\n*   Anti-seizure drugs, such as gabapentin\n*   Other antidepressants, such as amitriptyline\n*   Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine\n*   Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or tramadol\n\nIf you have sleep apnea, a device called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be prescribed.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy is an important part of treatment. This therapy helps you learn how to:\n\n*   Deal with negative thoughts\n*   Keep a diary of pain and symptoms\n*   Recognize what makes your symptoms worse\n*   Seek out enjoyable activities\n*   Set limits\n\nComplementary and alternative treatments may also be helpful. These may include:\n\n*   Tai chi\n*   Yoga\n*   Acupuncture\n\nSupport groups may also help.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFibromyositis; FM; Fibrositis\n\n---\n\n**Fibromyalgia**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Fibromyalgia?**\n\nFibromyalgia is not known, but researchers think it's due to a problem with how the central nervous system processes pain signals from nerves.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Causes or Triggers of Fibromyalgia**\n\n*   Physical or emotional trauma\n*   Abnormal pain response: Areas in the brain that control pain may react differently in people with fibromyalgia.\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Infection, such as a virus, although none has been identified\n\n\\n\\n**Who is Affected by Fibromyalgia?**\n\nFibromyalgia is more common in females as compared to males.

Fibromyalgia appears to be on one end of a range of chronic widespread pain, which may be present in 10% to 15% of the general population.\n\nThe central feature of fibromyalgia is chronic pain in multiple sites. These sites are the head, each arm, the chest, the abdomen, each leg, the upper back and spine, and the lower back and spine (including the buttocks).\n\nThe pain may be mild to severe.\n\nIt may feel like a deep ache, or a stabbing, burning pain.\nIt may feel like it is coming from the joints, although the joints are not affected or damaged and appear normal.\n\nPeople with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body pain and stiffness. For some people, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some people have pain all day long.\n\nPain may get worse with:\n\n*   Physical activity\n*   Cold or damp weather\n*   Anxiety and stress\n\nMost people with fibromyalgia have at least one of these symptoms: fatigue, depressed mood, or sleep problems. Many people say that they cannot get to sleep or stay asleep, and they feel tired when they wake up (called non-restorative sleep).\n\nOther symptoms in people with fibromyalgia may include:\n\n*   Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Memory and concentration problems\n*   Numbness and tingling in hands and feet\n*   Reduced ability to exercise\n*   Tension or migraine headaches\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, you must have had at least 3 months of widespread pain with one or more of the following:\n\n*   Ongoing problems with sleep\n*   Fatigue\n*   Thinking or memory problems\n\nIt is not necessary for the health care provider to find tender points during a physical exam to make a diagnosis and results of the exam may be normal.

    "content": "**Fifth Disease**\n\nAlso called: Erythema infectiosum, Parvovirus B19 infection\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nWhat is fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease, also called erythema infectiosum, is a viral infection caused by parvovirus B19. This virus only infects people; it's not the same type of parvovirus that dogs and cats can get.\n\nFifth disease mostly affects children. It often causes a bright red rash on their cheeks (sometimes called a \"slapped cheek\" rash).\n\nIn the United States, parvovirus B19 infections are more common in late winter, spring, and early summer. There are usually minor outbreaks of fifth disease about every 3 to 4 years.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What causes fifth disease?**\n\nParvovirus B19, which causes fifth disease, can spread from person to person:\n\n*   Through respiratory droplets, such as saliva (spit), sputum, or nasal mucus. The droplets can spread when:\n    *   Someone who has the virus coughs and sneezes\n    *   You touch an item that has the virus on it\n*   Through blood or blood products\n*   From a pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy\n\nYou are most contagious early in your infection, when you usually only have a fever or cold-like symptoms. You are not likely to be contagious after you get later symptoms such as a rash and joint pain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of fifth disease?**\n\nAbout 2 out of 10 people who get a B19 parvovirus infection will have no symptoms.\n\nBut most people will get the symptoms of fifth disease, which are usually mild and can include:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Cough\n*   Sore throat\n*   Rashes\n*   Joint pain\n\nThe \"slapped cheek\" rash is more common in children. They usually get the rash a few days after they first have other symptoms. The rash can then spread to the arms, legs, chest, back, and buttocks.\n\nAdults who get fifth disease might also have joint pain and swelling (called polyarthropathy syndrome).\n\nSometimes the infection can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system. This is more likely to happen if you are pregnant, have a blood disorder such as anemia, or a weakened immune system.\n\nBecause of these risks to you and some possible risks to your baby, contact your health care provider if you are pregnant and:\n\n*   You show signs of fifth disease (or a \"slapped cheek\" rash)\n*   You may have been exposed to someone who has the infection\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is fifth disease diagnosed?**\n\nThere is no routine lab test to diagnose fifth disease. Providers can often diagnose fifth disease just by seeing the \"slapped cheek\" rash and rashes on the body.\n\nThere is testing to show whether or not you have protection (immunity) against the B19 parvovirus or if you have had a recent infection. This test is usually not needed, but your provider may order the test if you are pregnant or at higher risk for complications of the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for fifth disease?**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for fifth disease. It is usually mild and goes away on its own.\n\nTo feel better, get plenty of rest. Taking acetaminophen can help with the fever and pain. Do not give aspirin to children, because it may cause Reye syndrome. This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Can fifth disease be prevented?**\n\nThere is no vaccine to prevent fifth disease. But you can help protect yourself and others by:\n\n*   Washing your hands often with soap and water\n*   Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze\n*   Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoiding close contact with people who are sick\n*   Staying home when you are sick\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Disease | Erythema Infectiosum**\n\nThis is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver.\n\n**Can fifth disease be prevented?**\n\nThere is no vaccine to prevent fifth disease.

This is often called a \"slapped-cheek\" rash.\n* The rash appears on the arms and legs and middle of the body, and it may itch.\n* The rash comes and goes and most often disappears in about 2 weeks. It fades from the center outwards, so it looks lacy.\n\nSome people also have joint pain and swelling. This more commonly occurs in adult women.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine the rash. Most often this is enough to diagnose the disease.\n\nYour provider can also do blood tests to look for signs of the virus, although it is not needed in most cases.\n\nThe provider may choose to do a blood test in certain situations, such as for pregnant women or people with anemia.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no treatment for fifth disease. The virus will clear up on its own in a couple of weeks. If your child has joint pain or an itchy rash, talk with your child's provider about ways to ease symptoms.

    "content": "**Finasteride: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/3)**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFinasteride (Proscar) is used alone or in combination with another medication (doxazosin [Cardura]) to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH, enlargement of the prostate gland). Finasteride is used to treat symptoms of BPH such as frequent and difficult urination and may reduce the chance of acute urinary retention (sudden inability to urinate). It also may decrease the chance that prostate surgery will be needed. Finasteride (Propecia) is also used to treat male pattern hair loss (gradual thinning of the hair on the scalp, leading to a receding hairline or balding on the top of the head in men.) Finasteride (Propecia) has not been shown to treat thinning hair at the temples and is not used to treat hair loss in women or children. Finasteride is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Finasteride treats BPH by blocking the body's production of a male hormone that causes the prostate to enlarge. Finasteride treats male pattern hair loss by blocking the body's production of a male hormone in the scalp that stops hair growth.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFinasteride comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take finasteride at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take finasteride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking finasteride to treat BPH, you should know that finasteride may control your condition, but will not cure it. It may take at least 6 months before your symptoms improve. Continue to take finasteride even if you feel well. Do not stop taking finasteride without talking to your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking finasteride to treat male pattern hair loss, it may take at least 3 months before you see any improvement because hair loss and growth happen slowly over time. However, you should expect to see improvement during the first 12 months of your treatment. If you have taken finasteride for 12 months and have not noticed any improvement, further treatment probably will not help. Talk to your doctor about whether you should continue your treatment.\n\nFinasteride will only slow hair loss while you are taking the medication. Continue to take finasteride even if you have already noticed an improvement. Do not stop taking finasteride without talking to your doctor. You will probably lose any hair that grew back while you were taking finasteride during the first 12 months after you stop taking the medication..\n\n---\n\n**Finasteride: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Taking Finasteride Without Talking to Your Doctor**\n\nYou will probably lose any hair that grew back while you were taking finasteride during the first 12 months after you stop taking the medication.\n\n**How to Take Finasteride**\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\nFinasteride comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Fine Motor Control**\n\nFine motor control is the coordination of muscles, bones, and nerves to produce small, exact movements. An example of fine motor control is picking up a small item with the index finger (pointer finger or forefinger) and thumb.\n\n**The Opposite of Fine Motor Control**\n\nThe opposite of fine motor control is gross (large, general) motor control. An example of gross motor control is waving an arm in greeting.\n\n**Problems That Can Decrease Fine Motor Control**\n\nProblems of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves (nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord), muscles, or joints may all decrease fine motor control. People with Parkinson disease have trouble speaking, eating, and writing because they have lost fine motor control.\n\n**Developmental Age in Children**\n\nThe amount of fine motor control in children is used to help figure out the child's developmental age. Children develop fine motor skills over time, by practicing and being taught. To have fine motor control, children need:\n\n* Awareness and planning\n* Coordination\n* Muscle strength\n* Normal sensation\n\n**Tasks That Require Fine Motor Control**\n\nThe following tasks can only occur if the nervous system develops in the right way:\n\n* Cutting out shapes with scissors\n* Drawing lines or circles\n* Folding clothes\n* Holding and writing with a pencil\n* Stacking blocks\n* Zipping a zipper\n\n---\n\n**Fine Motor Control**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Definition**: Fine motor control refers to the ability to perform precise movements with small muscles, such as those in the hands and fingers.\n*   **Importance**: Fine motor control is essential for daily activities, such as writing, using utensils, and manipulating objects.\n*   **Developmental Aspects**: Fine motor skills develop gradually during childhood, with significant improvements occurring between 2 to 5 years of age.\n\n**Causes of Fine Motor Control Problems**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Neurological Disorders**: Conditions like cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and stroke can impair fine motor control.\n*   **Injuries or Trauma**: Head injuries, spinal cord damage, or nerve compression can affect fine motor skills.\n*   **Developmental Delays**: Certain developmental delays, such as apraxia, can impact fine motor control.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Early Intervention**: Identifying and addressing fine motor control issues early on can significantly improve outcomes.\n*   **Physical Therapy**: Targeted exercises and therapies can help restore or maintain fine motor skills.\n*   **Assistive Devices**: Using adaptive tools, such as specialized writing instruments or utensils, can facilitate daily activities.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Variable Outcomes**: The prognosis for fine motor control problems varies depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.\n*   **Potential Recovery**: With proper treatment and support, some individuals may experience significant improvements in fine motor skills.",

Injuries and many medical conditions can cause finger pain.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nNearly everyone has had finger pain at some time. You may have:\n\n* Tenderness\n* Burning\n* Stiffness\n* Numbness\n* Tingling\n* Coldness\n* Swelling\n* Change in skin color\n* Redness\n\nMany conditions, such as arthritis, can cause finger pain. Numbness or tingling in the fingers may be a sign of a problem with nerves or blood flow. Redness and swelling can be a sign of infection or inflammation.\n\n**Causes**\n\nInjuries are a common cause of finger pain. Your finger may become injured from:\n\n* Playing contact sports such as football, baseball, or soccer\n* Doing recreational activities such as skiing or tennis\n* Using machinery at home or work\n* Doing tasks at home, such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, or repairs\n* Falling\n* Getting into a fist fight or punching something\n* Doing repetitive movements like typing\n\nInjuries that can cause finger pain include:\n\n* Smashed fingers, such as from a hammer blow or a car door that crushes the finger.\n* Compartment syndrome, which is severe swelling and pressure in an area of muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. A crushing injury can cause this serious condition, which requires immediate medical attention.\n* Mallet finger, when you can't straighten your finger. Sports injuries are a common cause.\n* Finger strains, sprains, and bruises.\n* Broken finger bones.\n* Skier's thumb, an injury to the ligaments in your thumb, such as from a fall during skiing.\n* Cuts and puncture wounds.\n* Dislocation.\n\nCertain conditions can also cause finger pain:\n\n* Arthritis, the breakdown of cartilage in the joint that causes inflammation with pain, stiffness, and swelling.\n* Carpal tunnel syndrome, pressure on the median nerve in the wrist, causing numbness and pain in the hand and fingers.\n* Raynaud phenomenon, a condition that results in blocked blood flow to the fingers when it is cold.\n* Trigger finger, when a swollen finger tendon makes it hard to straighten or bend your finger.\n* Dupuytren contracture, which causes tissue in the palm of the hand to become tighter. This makes it hard to straighten the fingers. It usually affects the small or ring finger.\n* De Quervain tenosynovitis, which causes pain in the tendons along the thumb side of the wrist, most often from overuse.\n* Infections.\n* Tumors.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nOften, care at home is enough to relieve finger pain. Start by avoiding activities that cause finger pain.\n\nIf finger pain is due to a minor injury:\n\n* Remove any rings in case of swelling.\n* Rest the finger joints so they can heal.\n* Apply ice and elevate the finger.\n* Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce both pain and swelling.\n* If needed, buddy tape the injured finger to the one next to it. This will help protect the injured finger as it heals. Don't tape it too tight, which can cut off circulation.\n\nIf you have a lot of swelling or the swelling does not go away in a day or so, see your health care provider. Small fractures or tendon or ligament tears can occur, and can lead to problems in the future if not treated correctly.\n\nIf finger pain is due to a medical condition, follow your provider's instructions for self-care. For example, if you have Raynaud phenomenon, take steps to protect your hands from the cold.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Your finger pain is caused by severe injury\n* Your finger is deformed\n* The problem continues after 1 week of home treatment\n* You have numbness or tingling in your fingers\n* You have severe pain at rest\n* You can't straighten your fingers\n* You have redness, swelling, or fever\n\n---\n\n**Finger Pain**\n\nFinger pain is a common issue that can be caused by various factors, including injuries and medical conditions.

    "content": "**Fingolimod: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFingolimod is used to prevent episodes of symptoms and slow the worsening of disability in adults and children 10 years of age and older with relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time) of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; first nerve symptom episode that lasts at least 24 hours), relapsing-remitting disease (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or active secondary progressive disease (later stage of disease with continuous worsening of symptoms).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFingolimod comes as a capsule and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take fingolimod at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fingolimod exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nFingolimod may cause the heartbeat to slow in adults and children, especially during the first 6 hours after you take your first dose, and after the first dose when the dose is increased in children. You will receive an electrocardiogram (ECG; test that records the electrical activity of the heart) before you take your first dose and again 6 hours after you take the dose. You will take your first dose of fingolimod in your doctor's office or another medical facility. You will need to stay at the medical facility for at least 6 hours after you take the medication so that you can be monitored. You may need to stay at the medical facility for longer than 6 hours or overnight if you have certain conditions or take certain medications that increase the risk that your heartbeat will slow or if your heartbeat slows more than expected or continues to slow after the first 6 hours. You may also need to stay at a medical facility for at least 6 hours after you take your second dose if your heartbeat slows too much when you take your first dose. Tell your doctor if you experience dizziness, tiredness, chest pain, or slow or irregular heartbeat at any time during your treatment, especially during the first 24 hours after you take your first dose.\n\nTo take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before you are ready to take it.\n\nFingolimod may help control multiple sclerosis but will not cure it. Do not stop taking fingolimod without talking to your doctor.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with fingolimod and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Fingolimod: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n*   If you experience dizziness, tiredness, chest pain, or slow or irregular heartbeat at any time during your treatment, especially during the first 24 hours after you take your first dose, tell your doctor.\n*   Fingolimod may cause the heartbeat to slow in adults and children, especially during the first 6 hours after you take your first dose, and after the first dose when the dose is increased in children.\n\n**Taking Your Medication**\n\n*   To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva.\n*   Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before you are ready to take it.\n\n**Using Fingolimod**\n\n*   Fingolimod may help control multiple sclerosis but will not cure it. Do not stop taking fingolimod without talking to your doctor.\n*   Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with fingolimod and each time you refill your prescription.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Before taking fingolimod, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fingolimod, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fingolimod capsules or orally disintegrating tablets.\n*   Some medications should not be taken with fingolimod. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with fingolimod.\n*   The following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with fingolimod: St. John's Wort.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n*   If you have any of the following conditions, your doctor may tell you not to take fingolimod:\n    *   Heart attack\n    *   Angina (chest pain)\n    *   Stroke or mini-stroke\n    *   Heart failure\n    *   Long QT syndrome\n    *   Irregular heart rhythm\n*   If you have any of the following conditions, tell your doctor:\n    *   Fever or other signs of infection\n    *   Infection that comes and goes or does not go away\n    *   Diabetes\n    *   Sleep apnea (condition in which you briefly stop breathing many times during the night)\n    *   High blood pressure\n    *   Uveitis (inflammation of the eye) or other eye problems\n    *   Slow heartbeat\n    *   Low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood\n    *   Skin cancer, or heart or liver disease\n*   If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding, tell your doctor.

Tips for proper use include:\n\n*   Install them in hallways, in or near all sleeping areas, the kitchen, and garage.\n*   Test them once a month. Change the batteries regularly. Another option is an alarm with a 10-year battery.\n*   Dust or vacuum over the smoke alarm as needed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using a Fire Extinguisher**\n\nUsing a fire extinguisher can put out a small fire to keep it from getting out of control. Tips for use include:\n\n*   Keep fire extinguishers in handy locations, at least one on each level of your home.\n*   Be sure to have a fire extinguisher in your kitchen and one in your garage.\n*   Know how to use a fire extinguisher. Teach everyone in your family how to use one, too. In an emergency, you must be able to act fast.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Escaping Fires**\n\nFires can be loud, burn fast, and produce a lot of smoke. It is a good idea for everyone to know how to get out of their home quickly if one occurs.\n\n*   Set up fire escape routes from every room in your house. It is best to have 2 ways to get out of each room, since one of the ways may be blocked by smoke or fire.\n*   Have twice-a-year fire drills to practice escaping.\n*   Teach family members what to do in case of a fire.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Smoke Rises During a Fire**\n\nSmoke rises during a fire.

It is important to know when to call 911 -- it is for life-threatening emergencies. While waiting for help to arrive, you may be able to save someone's life. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is for people whose hearts or breathing has stopped and the Heimlich maneuver is for people who are choking.\n\nYou can also learn to handle common injuries and wounds. Cuts and scrapes, for example, should be rinsed with cool water. To stop bleeding, apply firm but gentle pressure, using gauze.

    "content": "**Fish-eye disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nFish-eye disease, also called partial LCAT deficiency, is a disorder that causes the clear front surface of the eyes (the corneas) to gradually become cloudy. The cloudiness, which generally first appears in adolescence or early adulthood, consists of small grayish dots of cholesterol (opacities) distributed across the corneas. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals; it aids in many functions of the body but can become harmful in excessive amounts. As fish-eye disease progresses, the corneal cloudiness worsens and can lead to severely impaired vision.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nFish-eye disease is a rare disorder. Approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nFish-eye disease is caused by mutations in the LCAT gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The LCAT enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues by helping it attach to molecules called lipoproteins, which carry it to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called alpha- and beta-LCAT activity. Alpha-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Beta-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).\n\nLCAT gene mutations that cause fish-eye disease impair alpha-LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme's ability to attach cholesterol to HDL. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol-containing opacities in the corneas. It is not known why the cholesterol deposits affect only the corneas in this disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nFish-eye disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are needed to develop the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Fish-eye disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Fish-eye disease?**\n    Fish-eye disease, also known as LCAT deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by corneal opacities due to cholesterol-containing deposits in the corneas.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes and symptoms**\n    The condition arises from mutations in the LCAT gene, which affects the production of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in reducing cholesterol levels in the body by converting it into a form that can be easily excreted. In Fish-eye disease, this mechanism is impaired, leading to cholesterol deposits in the corneas.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Inheritance pattern**\n    Fish-eye disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms, as they are carriers of one mutated copy of the gene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other names for the condition**\n    Fish-eye disease is also known by other names, including Alpha-LCAT deficiency, Alpha-lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, Dyslipoproteinemic corneal dystrophy, FED (LCATA deficiency), and Partial LCAT deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Additional information & resources**\n    For those affected by Fish-eye disease or their families, there are various resources available for genetic testing, patient support, and advocacy. These include the Genetic Testing Registry, the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **References**\n    For further understanding of Fish-eye disease, references to scientific articles on PubMed provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of the condition. These studies have shed light on the structural differences between wild-type and mutant LCAT enzymes, as well as the relationship between very low levels of HDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis in individuals with LCAT deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Fish-eye disease**\n\n**A rare case of fish-eye disease presenting at age 75 years**\n\nIn a remarkable case, a 75-year-old individual was found to be suffering from fish-eye disease, a condition caused by mutations in the LCAT gene. This double heterozygote had two defined and new mutations affecting the structure and expression of the LCAT protein.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Corneal Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* Corneal transplant\n* Understanding Genetics\n\n**Prognosis of Genetic Conditions**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n**Note:** The information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

Otherwise, you can use one of the following ways to remove a hook that is superficially (not deeply) embedded just beneath the skin.\n\n**Fish Line Method**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water or use a disinfecting solution.\n2. Wash the skin surrounding the hook.\n3. Put a loop of fish line or string through the bend of the fishhook so that a quick jerk can be applied and the hook can be pulled out straight backward, directly in line with the shaft of the hook.\n4. Holding onto the shaft, push the hook slightly downwards and inwards (away from the barb) so as to disengage the barb.\n5. Holding this pressure constant to keep the barb disengaged, give a quick jerk on the fish line and the hook will pop out.\n6. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply a loose, sterile dressing. Do not close the wound with tape. Doing so can increase the chance of infection.\n7. Watch the skin for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, or drainage.\n\n**Wire Cutting Method**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water or disinfecting solution. Then wash the skin surrounding the hook.\n2. If the tip of the hook lies near the surface of the skin, advance the tip up and through the skin. Then cut it off just behind the barb with wire cutters. Remove the rest of the hook by pulling it back through the way it entered.\n3. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply a loose sterile dressing and apply antibiotic ointment. Do not close the wound with tape. Doing so can increase the chance of infection.\n4. Watch skin for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, or drainage.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nThe main advantage to getting medical help for any fishhook injury is that it can be removed under local anesthesia. This means before the hook is removed, your health care provider numbs the area with medicine.\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a fishhook injury and your tetanus immunization is not up to date (or if you are unsure)\n* After the fishhook is removed, the area starts to show signs of infection, such as increasing redness, swelling, pain, or drainage\n\n---\n\n**Fishhook Removal**\n\nIf you've got a fishhook stuck in your skin, don't panic! With the right techniques and precautions, you can remove it safely. But first, make sure you're up to date on your tetanus immunization - get a booster shot every 10 years.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFishing accidents are the most common cause of fishhooks stuck in the skin.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA fishhook stuck in the skin can cause:\n\n* Pain\n* Localized swelling\n* Bleeding\n\n**First Aid**\n\nIf the barb of the hook has not entered the skin, pull the tip of the hook out in the opposite direction it went in.

Get medical help right away.\n\nA fishhook in the eye is a medical emergency, and you should go to the nearest emergency room right away. The injured person should lie down with the head slightly raised. They should not move the eye, and the eye should be protected from further injury.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a fishhook injury and your tetanus immunization is not up to date (or if you are unsure)\n* After the fishhook is removed, the area starts to show signs of infection, such as increasing redness, swelling, pain, or drainage\n\n---\n\n**Fishhook Removal**\n\n**Prevention is Key**\n\nTo avoid fishhook injuries, keep a safe distance from others while fishing, especially when casting. Also, make sure you have electrician's pliers with a wire-cutting blade and disinfecting solution in your tackle box.\n\nAdditionally, ensure you are up-to-date on your tetanus immunization (vaccine). You should get a booster shot every 10 years.\n\n**Contact Your Provider If:**\n\nYou have a fishhook injury and your tetanus immunization is not up to date (or if you are unsure)\nAfter the fishhook is removed, the area starts to show signs of infection, such as increasing redness, swelling, pain, or drainage\n\n**The Main Advantage of Getting Medical Help**\n\nThe main advantage to getting medical help for any fishhook injury is that it can be removed under local anesthesia.

    "content": "**Fistula**\n\nA fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as an organ or blood vessel and another structure. Fistulas are usually the result of an injury or surgery. Infection or inflammation can also cause a fistula to form.\n\n**Information**\n\nFistulas may occur in many parts of the body. They can form between:\n\n* An artery and vein (arteriovenous fistula)\n* Bile ducts and the surface of the skin (from gallbladder surgery)\n* The cervix and vagina\n* The neck and throat\n* The space inside the skull and nasal sinus\n* The bowel and vagina\n* The colon or intestine and surface of the body, causing feces to exit through an opening other than the anus (enterocutaneous fistula)\n* The stomach and surface of the skin\n* The uterus and peritoneal cavity (the space between the walls of the abdomen and internal organs)\n* An artery and vein in the lungs (results in blood not picking up enough oxygen in the lungs)\n* The navel and gastrointestinal tract\n\nCrohn disease can lead to fistulas between one loop of intestine and another. Injury can cause fistulas to form between arteries and veins.\n\n**Types of Fistulas**\n\n* Blind: open on one end only, but connects to two structures\n* Complete: has openings both outside and inside the body\n* Horseshoe: connects the anus to the surface of the skin after going around the rectum\n* Incomplete: a tube from an internal structure that is closed on the other end and does not connect to skin\n\n---\n\n**Fistula**\n\nA fistula is an abnormal connection or passageway that forms between two organs or structures in the body. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Types of Fistulas**\n\nThere are several types of fistulas, including:\n\n*   **Blind**: A fistula that opens on one end only, connecting to two structures.\n*   **Complete**: A fistula with openings both outside and inside the body.\n*   **Horseshoe**: A type of fistula that connects the anus to the surface of the skin after going around the rectum.\n*   **Incomplete**: A tube from an internal structure that is closed on the other end and does not connect to the skin.\n\n**Causes of Fistulas**\n\nFistulas can form due to various reasons, including:\n\n*   **Crohn disease**: A condition that can lead to fistulas between one loop of intestine and another.\n*   **Injury**: Physical trauma can cause fistulas to form between arteries and veins.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about fistulas, you may also want to explore the following topics:\n\n*   **Fistulas**: A related topic that provides further information on this condition.\n*   **Gastrointestinal disease**: A category of diseases that affect the digestive system, including conditions that can lead to fistula formation.\n\n**References**\n\nThe information provided in this article is based on the following sources:\n\n*   de Prisco G, Celinski S, Spak CW.

They should be evaluated by a health care provider if this occurs.\n*   **Adults' Symptoms**: Symptoms in adults may include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing or playing sports.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests for Flat Feet**\n\n*   **Provider's Examination**: In people with flat feet, the instep of the foot comes in contact with the ground when standing.\n*   **Toe-Standing Test**: To diagnose the problem, the provider will ask you to stand on your toes. If an arch forms, the flat foot is called flexible.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment for Flat Feet**\n\n*   **No Treatment Needed**: Flat feet in a child do not need treatment if they are not causing pain or walking problems.\n*   **Flexible Flat Feet**: In older children and adults, flexible flat feet that do not cause pain or walking problems do not need further treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications After Surgery**\n\n*   **Failure of the Fused Bones to Heal**\n*   **Foot Deformity That Does Not Go Away**\n*   **Infection**\n*   **Loss of Ankle Movement**\n*   **Pain That Does Not Go Away**\n*   **Problems with Shoe Fit**\n\n---\n\n**Flat Feet**\n\nFlat feet refer to a change in foot shape where the foot does not have a normal arch when standing.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   The condition is normal in infants and toddlers.\n*   Flat feet occur because the tissues holding the joints in the foot together (called tendons) are loose.\n*   The tissues tighten and form an arch as children grow older. This will take place by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old.\n*   Most people have normal arches by the time they are adults. However, the arch may never form in some people.\n*   Some hereditary conditions cause loose tendons and ligaments.\n    *   Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\n    *   Marfan Syndrome\n\nPeople born with these conditions may have flat feet.\n\nAging, injuries, or illness may harm the tendons and cause flat feet to develop in a person who has already formed arches. This type of flat foot may occur only on one side.\n\nRarely, painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition in which two or more of the bones in the foot grow or fuse together. This condition is called tarsal coalition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Most flat feet do not cause pain or other problems.\n*   Children don't often have foot pain, ankle pain, or lower leg pain. They should be evaluated by a health care provider if this occurs.\n*   Symptoms in adults may include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing or playing sports. You also may have pain on the outside of the ankle.\n\nFor patients that have had flat foot for a long time, you may develop changes in the appearance and flexibility of your toes also. You can have pain in the deformed toes.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   In people with flat feet, the instep of the foot comes in contact with the ground when standing.\n*   To diagnose the problem, the provider will ask you to stand on your toes. If an arch forms, the flat foot is called flexible. You will not need any more tests or treatment.\n\nIf the arch does not form with toe-standing (called rigid flat feet), or if there is pain, other tests may be needed, including:\n\n*   X-rays\n*   MRI\n*   CT scans\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   In older children and adults, flexible flat feet that do not cause pain or walking problems do not need further treatment.\n*   If you have pain due to flexible flat feet, the following may help:\n    *   An arch-support (orthotic) that you put in your shoe. You can buy this at the store or have it custom-made.\n    *   Special shoes.\n    *   Calf muscle stretches.\n\nRigid or painful flat feet need to be checked by a provider. The treatment depends on the cause of the flat feet.\n\nFor tarsal coalition, treatment starts with rest and possibly a cast. Surgery may be needed if pain does not improve.\n\nIn more severe cases, surgery may be needed to:\n\n*   Clean or repair the tendon\n*   Transfer a tendon to restore the arch\n*   Fuse joints in the foot into a corrected position\n\nFlat feet in older adults can be treated with pain relievers, orthotics, and sometimes surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Flat Feet**\n\n**What is a flat foot?**\n\nA flat foot is a condition where the arch of the foot does not form properly.\n\n**Types of Flat Feet**\n\nThere are two types of flat feet:\n\n*   **Flexible flat feet**: This type of flat foot can be treated with exercises, orthotics, and sometimes surgery.\n*   **Rigid flat feet**: This type of flat foot is more serious and may require surgery to correct the deformity.\n\n**Causes of Flat Feet**\n\nFlat feet can be caused by:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Some people are born with flat feet due to their genetic makeup.\n*   **Injury**: A severe injury to the foot or ankle can cause flat feet.\n*   **Tarsal coalition**: This is a condition where two bones in the foot fuse together, causing flat feet.\n\n**Symptoms of Flat Feet**\n\nThe symptoms of flat feet include:\n\n*   **Pain**: People with flat feet may experience pain in their feet, ankles, or lower legs.\n*   **Difficulty walking**: Flat feet can make it difficult to walk or run without experiencing pain or discomfort.\n\n**Diagnosing Flat Feet**\n\nTo diagnose flat feet, a healthcare provider will typically perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: The provider will examine the foot and ankle to look for signs of flat feet.\n*   **X-ray**: An X-ray may be taken to rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment options for flat feet depend on the type and severity of the condition. Some common treatment options include:\n\n*   **Exercises**: Exercises can help strengthen the muscles in the foot and ankle, which can help alleviate pain and discomfort.\n*   **Orthotics**: Orthotics are custom-made shoe inserts that can help redistribute pressure on the foot and alleviate pain.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the deformity or relieve pain.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile most cases of flat feet are not preventable, wearing well-supported shoes can help reduce the risk of developing the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Flat Feet**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Correction of Flatfoot Deformity in the Adult**\n\nIn adults, flat feet can be corrected through surgical procedures. According to Myerson MS and Kadakia AR, correction of flatfoot deformity in the adult involves various techniques aimed at restoring the normal anatomy of the foot. This approach is crucial for individuals experiencing pain or discomfort due to the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Foot and Toes**\n\nUnderstanding the structure and function of the foot is essential in addressing flat feet. Winell JJ and Davidson RS discuss the importance of recognizing the anatomical differences between the human foot and those of other primates. This knowledge helps in identifying the root causes of foot-related issues, including flat feet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Disorders of Tendons and Fascia**\n\nGrear BJ provides valuable insights into disorders affecting tendons and fascia in individuals with pes planus. By examining the relationship between these conditions and flat feet, healthcare professionals can develop effective treatment plans to alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Foot Injuries and Disorders",

Flecainide is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. It works by slowing electrical signals in the heart to stabilize the heart rhythm.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFlecainide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once every 12 hours. Some people may take flecainide once every 8 hours if they experience side effects or if their condition cannot be controlled by taking flecainide every 12 hours. Take flecainide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take flecainide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou may be hospitalized when you begin your treatment with flecainide. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during this time and for as long as you continue to take flecainide. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of flecainide and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 days. Your doctor may also decrease your dose once your condition is controlled.\n\nFlecainide may control your condition, but will not cure it. Continue to take flecainide even if you feel well.

Flooding can also happen when a river or stream overflows its bank, when a levee is breached, or when a dam breaks. Flash floods, which can develop quickly, often have a dangerous wall of roaring water.\n\n**Be Aware of Flood Hazards**\n\n*   Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam.\n*   Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses.\n\n**Protect Yourself**\n\n*   Take actions to protect yourself during a flood.\n*   Have a disaster plan in place.\n*   Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses.\n\n**Federal Emergency Management Agency**\n\nLearn more about floods from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\n*   Article: Climate emergency and the food system: the impact of May floods... \n*   Article: Access to Vaccines in Floodplains and Hard-to-Reach Areas of the Brazilian... \n*   Article: Epidemiological insight into bacterial risk associated with flooded areas of city... \n\n**Learn More**\n\nDisasterAssistance.gov (Department of Homeland Security)\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\nFlooding (Environmental Protection Agency)\nFloods and Your Safety (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nNational Weather Service: Watch, Warning, Advisory Display (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)",

    "content": "**Flu (Influenza) Test**\n\n**What is a flu (influenza) test?**\n\nThe flu, also known as influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Most flu tests check a sample of fluid from your nose or throat to find out if you're infected with a flu virus.\n\n**Understanding the Flu**\n\nThe flu usually spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. You can also get the flu by touching a surface that has the virus on it, and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. The flu can be serious, or even deadly, especially for children under age 5, adults age 65 and over, and people with certain chronic (long-term) illnesses.\n\n**Types of Flu Tests**\n\nThere are two main types of tests for seasonal flu:\n\n*   **Rapid Influenza Antigen Tests**: These tests check your fluid sample for certain proteins (antigens) found on flu viruses. They can provide results in less than 30 minutes, but aren't as accurate as other types of flu tests.\n*   **Molecular Flu Tests**: These tests are more accurate than rapid antigen tests. They check your sample for genetic material from flu viruses.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Flu Test?**\n\nIf you have flu symptoms, testing can help you decide what to do next, such as starting antiviral medicine, and taking steps to lower your chances of spreading the virus to others.\n\n**Symptoms of the Flu**\n\nSymptoms of the flu may include:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Runny or stuffy nose\n*   Sore throat\n*   Cough\n\n**Who Needs a Flu Test?**\n\nYour provider may be more likely to order a flu test if you have symptoms and a high risk of developing a serious illness from the flu and other respiratory infections. Testing helps your provider make sure you get the right treatment to lower your risk.\n\n**What Happens During a Flu Test?**\n\nIf you are tested at your provider's office or other health care setting, a fluid sample may be collected using:\n\n*   A swab test\n*   A nasal aspirate or wash\n\n---\n\n**Flu (Influenza) Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Flu (Influenza) Test?**\n\nFlu is short for influenza. It is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Respiratory infections may affect your nose, throat, and/or lungs. Most flu tests check a sample of fluid from your nose or throat to find out if you're infected with a flu virus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Flu Tests**\n\nThere are two main types of tests for seasonal flu:\n\n*   **Rapid Influenza Antigen Tests**: These tests check your fluid sample for certain proteins (antigens) found on flu viruses. They can provide results in less than 30 minutes, and you can do them at home.\n*   **Molecular Flu Tests**: These tests are more accurate than rapid antigen tests. They check your sample for genetic material from flu viruses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparing for a Flu Test**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a flu test.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks Associated with a Flu Test**\n\nIf your throat or nose is swabbed, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle. A nasal aspirate or wash may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interpreting Flu Test Results**\n\nThe results of your flu test tell you if signs of influenza A or B virus were found in your sample. Your results are usually described as \"positive\" or \"negative.\"\n\n*   **Positive Result**: This means you most likely have the seasonal flu. It's essential to limit your contact with others to prevent infecting them.\n*   **Negative Result**: This means you may not have the flu, but it's possible that your test was a false negative (when your test says you don't have the flu, but you really do).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Do After a Flu Test**\n\nIf you have positive test results and flu-like symptoms:\n\n*   Get plenty of rest\n*   Drink lots of liquids\n*   Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, to help with fever and aches (but not aspirin for children and teens)\n*   Follow your provider's advice on antiviral medicine\n\nIf you have negative test results and flu-like symptoms:\n\n*   Ask your provider what you should do next\n*   Consider more testing, especially if your first test was a rapid antigen flu test\n\n---\n\n**Flu (Influenza) Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nIf you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, a test for common seasonal flu may be used to help find out if the influenza A or B virus is causing your illness. Knowing whether you have the flu is especially important if you have a high risk of becoming seriously ill from the flu. The test results can help your provider decide if medicine could help treat your illness and which one might help you.\n\n**Why do I need a flu test?**\n\nIf you have flu symptoms, testing can help you decide what to do next, such as starting antiviral medicine, and taking steps to lower your chances of spreading the virus to others.\n\n**Symptoms of the Flu**\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Muscle or body aches\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Runny or stuffy nose\n* Sore throat\n* Cough\n\n**Who Should Get Tested?**\n\nYour provider may be more likely to order a flu test if you have symptoms and a high risk of developing a serious illness from the flu and other respiratory infections. Testing helps your provider make sure you get the right treatment to lower your risk.\n\n**High-Risk Groups**\n\nThe risk of developing serious complications from the flu is higher for people who:\n\n* Are age 65 and older\n* Are younger than age 5 (especially those younger than 2 years old)\n* Have a chronic health condition, such as asthma, blood disorders, diabetes, lung diseases, metabolic disorders, obesity, conditions that affect the heart, kidneys, liver, or nervous system, and diseases that weaken the immune system\n\n---\n\n**Flu (Influenza) Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Category:** health\n\n**What is the flu test?**\n\nThe flu test, also known as a flu diagnosis or influenza test, is a medical test used to determine if you have the seasonal flu. The test can help your healthcare provider decide what to do next, such as starting antiviral medicine, and taking steps to lower your chances of spreading the virus to others.\n\n**Who needs a flu test?**\n\nYou may need a flu test if you have symptoms of the flu and are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu. This includes people with conditions such as asthma, blood disorders, diabetes, lung diseases, metabolic disorders, obesity, and diseases that weaken the immune system.\n\n**What happens during a flu test?**\n\nThere are two types of flu tests: rapid antigen tests and self-collection tests. Rapid antigen tests usually involve swabbing your nose to collect a fluid sample, which is then tested for signs of influenza A or B virus. Self-collection tests also involve swabbing your nose, but some may use saliva instead.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nYes, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle if your throat or nose is swabbed. A nasal aspirate or wash may also feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of your flu test will tell you if signs of influenza A or B virus were found in your sample. Your results are usually described as \"positive\" or \"negative.\" A positive result means you most likely have the seasonal flu, while a negative result means you may not have the flu.\n\n**What should I do after getting my flu test results?**\n\nIf you have a positive result, it's essential to limit your contact with others to prevent infecting them. You can go back to your usual activities when your symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours and you haven't had a fever or taken fever-reducing medicine.\n\n**How can I lower my risk of getting the flu?**\n\nTo lower your risk of getting the flu, avoid close contact with people who are sick, wash your hands often with soap and water, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and clean frequently touched surfaces. Your best protection against serious illness from the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine (flu shot).\n\n---\n\n**Flu (Influenza) Test**\n\nIf you're looking to get tested for the flu, there are several options available. In this article, we'll explore the different types of tests, their accuracy, and what to expect during the testing process.\n\n**Who Should Get Tested?**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that anyone 6 months or older get vaccinated against the flu each year. Additionally, if you're experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, or fatigue, you should consider getting tested for the flu.\n\n**Types of Flu Tests**\n\nThere are several types of tests available to diagnose the flu, including:\n\n* Rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT): This is a quick and easy test that can provide results in 15-30 minutes. However, it's not as accurate as other tests.\n* Molecular test: This test detects the genetic material of the flu virus and is considered more accurate than RIDT.\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: This test amplifies the genetic material of the flu virus to detect its presence.\n\n**Where to Get Tested**\n\nYou can get tested for the flu at various healthcare providers, including:\n\n* Primary care physicians\n* Urgent care centers\n* Emergency rooms\n\n**What to Expect During Testing**\n\nDuring testing, you'll typically be asked to provide a nasal swab or throat sample. The test will then detect the presence of the flu virus in your body.\n\n**References**\n\nFor more information on flu testing, consult the following resources:\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library\n* FDA: US Food and Drug Administration\n* Labcorp\n* Mayo Clinic\n* Merck Manual Consumer Version\n* Testing.com\n\n---\n\n**Flu (Influenza) Test**\n\n\\n\\n**Testing Options**\n\n*   Annuals.com: A comprehensive resource on respiratory viruses, including influenza.\n*   Testing.com: A website providing information on various medical tests, including influenza testing.

It's made up of killed or inactivated flu viruses, which can't cause illness but still stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies against the flu.\n\n**Types of Flu Shots**\n\nThere are several types of flu shots available:\n\n* **Inactivated or Recombinant**: This type of flu shot contains killed or inactivated flu viruses. It's the most common type of flu shot and is suitable for people of all ages.\n* **Live, Intranasal**: This type of flu shot contains a weakened live flu virus. It's given as a nasal spray and is suitable for healthy people between 2 and 49 years old.\n\n**Who Should Get the Flu Shot?**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months or older get vaccinated against the flu each year. This includes:\n\n* **Children**: Children 6 months to 8 years old should receive two doses of the flu vaccine, with the second dose given at least 28 days after the first dose.\n* **Pregnant Women**: Pregnant women should get vaccinated against the flu to protect themselves and their unborn babies.\n* **Older Adults**: Older adults (65 years or older) should get vaccinated against the flu to reduce their risk of serious illness.\n\n**Where Can I Get the Flu Shot?**\n\nYou can get the flu shot from your healthcare provider, a local health clinic, or a pharmacy that offers flu vaccination services. Make sure to check with your healthcare provider about the availability and cost of the flu shot before getting vaccinated.\n\n**Language Options**\n\nThe flu shot is available in multiple languages:\n\n* **English**\n* **Spanish (español)**\n* **Portuguese (português)**\n* **Polish (polski)**\n* **Russian (Русский)**\n* **Somali (Af-Soomaali)**\n* **Tagalog (Wikang Tagalog)**\n* **Thai (ภาษาไทย)**\n* **Turkish (Türkçe)**\n* **Ukrainian (українська)**\n* **Urdu (اردو)**\n* **Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)**\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information about the flu shot, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at [www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov).\n\n---\n\n**Flu Shot -

considering getting a flu shot this season? If so, you're likely wondering what's involved and whether it's right for you. In this article, we'll provide an overview of the flu shot, including its benefits, risks, and what to expect during the vaccination process.\n\n**Benefits of the Flu Shot**\n\nThe flu shot is designed to protect against the most common strains of influenza virus circulating during a given season. By getting vaccinated, you can reduce your risk of contracting the flu and experiencing its associated symptoms, such as fever, cough, and body aches. Additionally, the flu shot can help prevent serious complications from the flu, particularly for certain groups of people, like older adults and young children.\n\n**Risks and Side Effects**\n\nWhile generally safe, the flu shot is not without risks and side effects. Common reactions include:\n\n* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Muscle or joint pain\n\nIn rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, such as allergic reactions or Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). However, these risks are extremely low and typically outweighed by the benefits of getting vaccinated.\n\n**What to Expect During the Vaccination Process**\n\nWhen you arrive for your flu shot appointment, you'll typically be asked to provide some basic information about your medical history and any allergies you may have. The vaccination itself is usually quick and painless, with most people experiencing only minor discomfort at the injection site.\n\nAfter receiving the flu shot, you may be asked to wait for a few minutes to ensure that you don't experience any adverse reactions. Once cleared, you can resume your normal activities without worrying about the flu.\n\n**Language Options**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers flu shot information in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish, Vietnamese, and many others. This ensures that individuals from diverse backgrounds can access accurate and reliable information about the flu shot.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGetting a flu shot is an important step in protecting yourself against the flu and its associated risks. While there are some potential risks and side effects to consider, these are generally mild and temporary. By staying informed and taking advantage of language options available, you can make an educated decision about whether the flu shot is right for you.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information about the flu shot, including language-specific resources, please visit the CDC's website at [www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov).\n\n---\n\n**Flu Shot**\n\n*   **English**: Flu Shot: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n    *   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n        Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- Influenza (Flu) Vaccine (Inactivated or Recombinant): What you need to know -

    "content": "**Flu Shot**\n\nAlso called: Flu vaccine\n\n**What is the flu?**\n\nThe flu (influenza) is a respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that infect your nose, throat, and lungs. These viruses can spread from person to person.\n\nMost people with the flu get better on their own, without medical care. But for some people, the flu is serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. People who are 65 and older, under age 5, pregnant, or have certain health conditions are at higher risk of flu complications.\n\n**Benefits of getting a flu shot**\n\nThere are many reasons to get a flu shot each year:\n\n*   It may keep you from getting sick with the flu.\n*   If you do get the flu, it may be less severe. You may also be less likely to have complications or need to be hospitalized with the flu.\n*   If you have certain chronic health conditions, getting a flu shot may help prevent the flu from making your condition worse.\n*   Getting the vaccine during pregnancy not only helps protect you from the flu during and after pregnancy. It also helps protect your baby from flu during their first few months of life.\n*   It has been shown to lower the risk of severe life-threatening flu in children.\n*   It may also protect the people around you, including those who are at higher risk of complications.\n\n**How do flu shots work?**\n\nThe flu vaccine causes your immune system to make antibodies about two weeks after you get the shot. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the flu viruses that are in the vaccine.\n\n**Who needs a flu shot?**\n\nThe U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, with a few rare exceptions.\n\nFlu shots are especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu.\n\nThere are different types of flu vaccines. There are injectable vaccines (shots) and nasal spray vaccines. There are also some vaccines especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.\n\n**Who should not get a flu shot?**\n\nThere are some people who should not get a flu shot:\n\n*   Children younger than 6 months of age.\n*   Have severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.\n\nSome people need to talk to their provider before they get a flu shot. They include people who:\n\n*   Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine.\n*   Have ever had Guillain-Barre syndrome(GBS). Some people with a history of GBS should not get a flu vaccine.\n\nIf you are moderately or severely ill, you usually need to wait until you recover before getting a flu shot.\n\n**Why do I need a flu shot every year?**\n\nYou need to get a flu shot every year because:\n\n*   Your immune protection from the vaccine declines over time. You need to get the shot every year to boost that protection.\n*   Flu viruses are constantly changing, so every year, the flu vaccine is updated. The flu vaccine will include protection against the viruses that will most likely be common during the upcoming flu season.\n\n**When should I get the flu shot?**\n\nFor most people who need only one dose of the flu vaccine for the season, September and October are usually good times to get it. It's best to be vaccinated by the end of October.\n\nSome children need two doses of the flu vaccine. They should get their first dose as soon as the vaccine is available. They need to get the second dose at least four weeks after the first.\n\nIf you are pregnant, talk to your provider about when to get the vaccine. When you should get it can vary, based on how far along you are in your pregnancy.\n\n**Do flu shots cause side effects?**\n\nFlu vaccines have been shown to be safe. But like any medical product, they can cause side effects. If you have any side effects, they are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Common side effects include:\n\n*   Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot\n*   Headache\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea\n*   Muscle aches\n\nThe flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. In rare cases, some people have a serious allergic reaction.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nStart Here\nInfluenza (Flu) Vaccine (Inactivated or Recombinant): What You Need to Know (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) - PDF\nKey Facts about Seasonal Flu Vaccine (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nRelated Issues\nFDA's Critical Role in Ensuring Supply of Influenza Vaccine (Food and Drug Administration)\nAlso in Spanish\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (Department of Health and Human Services)\nAlso in Spanish\n\n**Benefits of the Flu Vaccine**\n\nThere are many benefits to getting a flu shot each year:\n\n*   It may keep you from getting sick with the flu.\n*   If you do get the flu, it may be less severe.
