    "content": "**Antithrombin III Blood Test**\n\n**What is Antithrombin III?**\n\nAntithrombin III (AT III) is a protein that helps control blood clotting. A blood test can determine the amount of AT III present in your body.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nCertain medicines may affect the results of the test. Your health care provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines or reduce their dose before the test. Do not stop taking any medicine before speaking with your provider.\n\n**What Does the Test Feel Like?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have repeated blood clots or if blood thinning medicine does not work.\n\n**What are Normal Results?**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nLower-than-normal AT III may mean you have an increased risk for blood clotting. This can occur when there is not enough AT III in your blood, or when there is enough AT III in your blood, but the AT III does not function properly and is less active.\n\nAbnormal results may not appear until you are an adult.\n\nExamples of complications associated with increased blood clotting are:\n\n* Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)\n* Phlebitis (vein inflammation)\n* Pulmonary embolus (blood clot traveling to lung)\n* Thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation with clot formation)\n\nLower than normal AT III may be due to:\n\n* Bone marrow transplant\n* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n* AT III deficiency, an inherited condition\n* Liver cirrhosis\n* Nephrotic syndrome\n\nHigher than normal AT III may be due to:\n\n* Use of anabolic steroids\n* Bleeding disorder (hemophilia)\n* Kidney transplant\n* Low level of vitamin K\n\n**What are the Risks?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Antithrombin III Blood Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe antithrombin III blood test measures the level of antithrombin III (AT III) in your blood. AT III is a protein that helps prevent blood clots from forming.\n\n**How is the test performed?**\n\nTo perform the test, a healthcare professional will insert a needle into a vein in your arm to draw a sample of blood. You may feel moderate pain when the needle is inserted, or you may only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but this soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the test performed?**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order this test if you have repeated blood clots or if blood thinning medicine does not work.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

    "content": "**Antithyroglobulin Antibody Test**\n\n**What is the Antithyroglobulin Antibody Test?**\n\nThe antithyroglobulin antibody test measures antibodies to a protein called thyroglobulin. This protein is found in thyroid cells, but a small amount leaks out into the bloodstream. Sometimes the immune system produces antibodies against this protein.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed for the test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for several hours (usually overnight). Your health care provider may monitor you or tell you to stop taking certain medicines for a short time before the test because they may affect the test results. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n**How will the Test Feel?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test helps detect possible thyroid problems. Antithyroglobulin antibodies can be a sign of thyroid gland damage caused by the immune system. They may be measured if thyroiditis is suspected. Measuring thyroglobulin antibody levels after treatment for thyroid cancer can help your provider decide what the best test is to monitor you for a recurrence of the cancer.\n\n**What do Normal Results Mean?**\n\nA negative test result is a normal result. It means no antibodies to thyroglobulin are found in your blood. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nA positive test means antithyroglobulin antibodies are found in your blood. They may be present with:\n\n* Graves disease or overactive thyroid\n* Hashimoto thyroiditis\n* Subacute thyroiditis\n* Underactive thyroid\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Type 1 diabetes\n\nPregnant women and relatives of those with autoimmune thyroiditis may also test positive for these antibodies. If you have a positive test for antithyroglobulin antibodies, this may make it harder to measure your thyroglobulin level accurately.\n\n**What are the Risks?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nThyroglobulin antibody; Thyroiditis - thyroglobulin antibody; Hypothyroidism - thyroglobulin antibody; Thyroiditis - thyroglobulin antibody; Graves disease - thyroglobulin antibody; Underactive thyroid - thyroglobulin antibody\n\n**References**\n\nBrent GA, Weetman AP.

It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are anxiety disorders?**\n\nAnxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of anxiety disorders**\n\nThere are several types of anxiety disorders, including:\n\n*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.\n*   **Panic Disorder**: People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.\n*   **Phobias**: People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger.

    "content": "**Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Endovascular - Discharge**\n\n**What is an Aortic Aneurysm?**\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is a widened area in your aorta, the large artery that carries blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had an endovascular aortic surgery repair for an aneurysm (a widened part) of the large artery that carries blood to your lower body (aorta).\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nYour doctor made a small incision near your groin to find your femoral artery. A large tube was inserted into the artery so that other instruments could be inserted. An incision may have been made in the other groin as well as the arm. Your doctor inserted a stent and a man-made (synthetic) graft through the incision into the artery. X-rays were used to guide the stent and graft into your aorta where the aneurysm was located. The graft and stent were opened up and attached to the walls of the aorta.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nThe cut in your groin may be sore for several days. You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest. But you should take it easy at first. It may take 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover. You may feel discomfort in your abdomen for a few days. You may also have a loss of appetite. This will get better over the next week. You may have constipation or diarrhea for a short time.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nYou will need to increase your activity slowly while the incision heals.\n\n*   Walk short distances on a flat surface, 3 or 4 times a day.\n*   Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days after the procedure.\n*   Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your doctor tells you to wait.\n*   Do not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) for 2 weeks after the procedure.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nEndovascular surgery does not cure the underlying problem with your blood vessels.

Having regular checkups to make sure your graft is working well is a very important part of your care.\n\nYour provider may ask you to take aspirin or another medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix) when you go home. These medicines are antiplatelet agents. They prevent the platelets in your blood from clumping together and forming clots in your arteries or stent. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nEndovascular surgery does not cure the underlying problem with your blood vessels.

This procedure involves inserting a stent-graft through a small incision in your groin and guiding it into the aneurysm using X-ray images.\n\n**Understanding Your Condition**\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the large artery that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. It can be caused by atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty deposits on the inner lining of the artery. Smoking and high blood pressure are also risk factors.\n\n**Preventing Future Problems**\n\nTo prevent future problems with your aneurysm or other cardiovascular issues:\n\n*   Quit smoking: Tobacco use significantly increases your risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n*   Control your cholesterol levels: High cholesterol can contribute to the development of an aneurysm. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medication to manage your cholesterol levels.\n*   Manage your high blood pressure: Hypertension can also increase your risk of developing an aneurysm. Work with your doctor to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication.\n\n**Follow-Up Care**\n\nAfter your procedure, you will need to follow up with your doctor to ensure that the stent-graft is functioning properly and that there are no signs of complications. Your doctor may recommend regular imaging tests, such as CT scans or ultrasounds, to monitor the aneurysm and the stent-graft.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n*   Quit smoking: Tobacco use significantly increases your risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n*   Control your cholesterol levels: High cholesterol can contribute to the development of an aneurysm. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medication to manage your cholesterol levels.\n*   Manage your high blood pressure: Hypertension can also increase your risk of developing an aneurysm. Work with your doctor to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication.\n\nBy following these instructions and working closely with your healthcare team, you can help prevent future problems with your aneurysm or other cardiovascular issues.",

It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery.\n\n_*Description of the procedure*_\n\nThis procedure is done in an operating room, in the radiology department of the hospital, or in a catheterization lab. You will lie on a padded table. You may receive general anesthesia (you are asleep and pain-free) or epidural or spinal anesthesia. During the procedure, your surgeon will:\n\nMake a small surgical cut near the groin, to find the femoral artery.\nInsert a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into the artery through the cut.\nInsert a stent (a metal coil) and a man-made (synthetic) graft along the catheter.\nThen use a dye to define the extent of the aneurysm.\nUse x-rays to guide the stent graft up into your aorta, to where the aneurysm is located.\nNext open the stent using a spring-like mechanism and attach it to the walls of the aorta. Your aneurysm will eventually shrink around it.\nUse x-rays and dye again to make sure the graft is in the right place and your aneurysm is not bleeding inside your body.\nRemove the catheter and close the surgical cut where the catheter was inserted.\n\n_*Why the procedure is performed*_\n\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is done because your aneurysm is very large, growing quickly, or is leaking or bleeding. You may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found this problem when you had an ultrasound or CT scan for another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may burst (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky. In such cases, EVAR is an option.\n\n_*Risks*_\n\nRisks of any surgery are:\n\nBlood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\nBreathing problems\nInfection, including in the lungs, urinary tract, and belly\nHeart attack or stroke\nReactions to medicines\n\nRisks of this surgery are:\n\nBleeding around the graft that needs more surgery\nBleeding before or after procedure\nBlockage of the stent\nDamage to a nerve, causing weakness, pain, or numbness in the leg\nKidney failure\nPoor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs\nProblems getting or keeping an erection\nSurgery is not successful and you need an open surgery\nThe stent graft slips\nThe graft leaks and requires open surgery\nDeath\n\n_*Before the procedure*_\n\nYour provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery. Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. If you are a smoker, you should stop. Your provider can help. Here are other things you will need to do before your surgery:\n\nAbout two weeks before your surgery, you will visit your provider to make sure any medical problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are well treated.\nYou also may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).\nAsk which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nAlways tell your provider if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery.\n\n_*After the procedure*_\n\nMost people stay in the hospital for a few days after this surgery, depending on the type of procedure they had. Most often, the recovery from this procedure is faster and with less pain than with open surgery. Also, you will most likely be able to go home sooner.\n\nDuring a hospital stay, you may:\n\nBe in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be watched very closely at first\nHave a urinary catheter\nBe given medicines to thin your blood\nBe encouraged to sit on the side of your bed and then walk\nWear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs\nReceive pain medicine into your veins or into the space that surrounds your spinal cord (epidural)\n\n_*Outlook (Prognosis)*_\n\nRecovery after endovascular repair is quick in most cases. You will need to be watched and checked regularly to make sure your repaired aortic aneurysm is not leaking blood.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Endovascular**\n\nThis surgery is performed to repair a widened area in your aorta, also known as an aneurysm.\n\n**What is an Aortic Aneurysm?**\n\nAn aortic aneurysm occurs when a part of the aorta becomes too large or balloons outward due to weakness in the wall of the artery.\n\n**Why is Endovascular Repair Performed?**\n\nEndovascular repair is performed because your aneurysm is very large, growing quickly, or is leaking or bleeding. You may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems, but your healthcare provider has found this problem when you had an ultrasound or CT scan for another reason.\n\n**Risks of the Procedure**\n\nThe risks of this surgery are:\n\n*   Bleeding around the graft that needs more surgery\n*   Bleeding before or after procedure\n*   Blockage of the stent\n*   Damage to a nerve, causing weakness, pain, or numbness in the leg\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Poor blood supply to your legs, kidneys, or other organs\n*   Problems getting or keeping an erection\n*   Surgery is not successful and you need an open surgery\n*   The stent graft slips\n*   The graft leaks and requires open surgery\n*   Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery. You should always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even if they are over-the-counter or prescription medications. If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking at least two weeks before your surgery.\n\n**On the Day of Your Surgery**\n\nTake any medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMost people stay in the hospital for a few days after this surgery, depending on the type of procedure they had.

Your provider is more likely to suggest this type of repair if you have other serious medical problems or are an older person.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any surgery are:\n\n* Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n* Breathing problems\n* Infection, including in the lungs, urinary tract, and belly\n* Heart attack or stroke\n* Reactions to medicines\n\nRisks of this surgery are:\n\n* Bleeding around the graft that needs more surgery\n* Bleeding before or after procedure\n* Blockage of the stent\n* Damage to a nerve, causing weakness, pain, or numbness in the leg\n* Kidney failure\n* Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs\n* Problems getting or keeping an erection\n* Surgery is not successful and you need an open surgery\n* The stent graft slips\n* The graft leaks and requires open surgery\n* Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery. Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. If you are a smoker, you should stop. Your provider can help.\n\nAbout two weeks before your surgery, you will visit your provider to make sure any medical problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are well treated. You also may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Ask which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n\nAlways tell your provider if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. The evening before your surgery: DO NOT drink anything after midnight, including water.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Endovascular**\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n*   Your provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery.\n*   Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even if they are prescription or over-the-counter medications, supplements, or herbs.\n*   If you are a smoker, quit.

    "content": "**Aortic Angiography**\n\n_A procedure that uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through the aorta._\n\n**What is Aortic Angiography?**\n\nAortic angiography is a medical test used to visualize the inside of the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs. The test uses x-rays and a special dye to see how blood flows through the aorta.\n\n**How is Aortic Angiography Performed?**\n\nThis test is done at a hospital or specialized procedure unit. Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax. An area of your body, most often in your arm or groin area, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic). A radiologist or cardiologist will place a needle into the groin blood vessel. A guidewire and a long tube (catheter) will be passed through this needle. The catheter is moved into the aorta, and dye is injected into it. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the aorta.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. You will wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being studied. Tell your health care provider:\n\n* If you are pregnant\n* If you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\n* If you are allergic to any medicines\n* Which medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)\n* If you have ever had any bleeding problems\n\n**What are the Risks of Aortic Angiography?**\n\nRisks of aortic angiography include:\n\n* Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n* Blockage of the artery\n* Blood clot that travels to the lungs\n* Bruising at the site of catheter insertion\n* Damage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are inserted\n* Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg\n* Heart attack or stroke\n* Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture\n* Infection\n* Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site\n* Kidney damage from the dye\n\n**What are the Considerations for Aortic Angiography?**\n\nThis procedure may be done with left heart catheterization to look for coronary artery disease.

Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.\n\nAn area of your body, most often in your arm or groin area, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic). A radiologist or cardiologist will place a needle into the groin blood vessel. A guidewire and a long tube (catheter) will be passed through this needle.\n\nThe catheter is moved into the aorta. The doctor can see live images of the aorta on a TV-like monitor. X-rays are used to guide the catheter to the correct position.\n\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is injected into it. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the aorta. The dye helps detect any blockages in blood flow.\n\nAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\n\nYou will wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure.

You may feel a sting as the numbing medicine is given and some pressure as the catheter is inserted. You may feel a warm flushing when the contrast dye flows through the catheter. This is normal and most often goes away in a few seconds.\n\nYou may have some discomfort from lying on the hospital table and staying still for a long time.\n\nIn most cases, you can resume normal activity the day after the procedure.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour provider may ask for this test if there are signs or symptoms of a problem with the aorta or its branches, including:\n\n* Aortic aneurysm\n* Aortic dissection\n* Congenital (present from birth) problems\n* AV malformation\n* Double aortic arch\n* Coarctation of the aorta\n* Vascular ring\n* Injury to the aorta\n* Takayasu arteritis\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n* Aortic dissection\n* Aortic regurgitation\n* Congenital (present from birth) problems\n* Double aortic arch\n* Coarctation of the aorta\n* Vascular ring\n* Injury to the aorta\n* Mesenteric artery disease or ischemia\n* Peripheral artery disease\n* Renal artery stenosis\n* Takayasu arteritis\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of aortic angiography include:\n\n* Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n* Blockage of the artery\n* Blood clot that travels to the lungs\n* Bruising at the site of catheter insertion\n* Damage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are inserted\n* Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg\n* Heart attack or stroke\n* Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture\n* Infection\n* Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site\n* Kidney damage from the dye\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Angiography**\n\n**Preparation**\n\n*   Remove any jewelry from the area being studied.\n*   Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or have ever had an allergic reaction to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\n*   You will be awake during the test and may feel a sting as the numbing medicine is given, some pressure as the catheter is inserted, and a warm flushing when the contrast dye flows through the catheter.\n*   You may have some discomfort from lying on the hospital table and staying still for a long time.\n\n**What to Expect After the Procedure**\n\n*   In most cases, you can resume normal activity the day after the procedure.\n*   You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n*   Your provider may ask for this test if there are signs or symptoms of a problem with the aorta or its branches, including:\n    *   Aortic aneurysm\n    *   Aortic dissection\n    *   Congenital (present from birth) problems\n    *   AV malformation\n    *   Double aortic arch\n    *   Coarctation of the aorta\n    *   Vascular ring\n    *   Injury to the aorta\n    *   Takayasu arteritis\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\n*   Abnormal results may be due to:\n    *   Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n    *   Aortic dissection\n    *   Aortic regurgitation\n    *   Congenital (present from birth) problems\n    *   Double aortic arch\n    *   Coarctation of the aorta\n    *   Vascular ring\n    *   Injury to the aorta\n    *   Mesenteric artery disease or ischemia\n    *   Peripheral artery disease\n    *   Renal artery stenosis\n    *   Takayasu arteritis\n\n**Risks**\n\n*   Risks of aortic angiography include:\n    *   Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n    *   Blockage of the artery\n    *   Blood clot that travels to the lungs\n    *   Bruising at the site of catheter insertion\n    *   Damage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are inserted\n    *   Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg\n    *   Heart attack or stroke\n    *   Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture\n    *   Infection\n    *   Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site\n    *   Kidney damage from the dye\n\n**Considerations**\n\n*   This procedure may be done with left heart catheterization to look for coronary artery disease.\n*   Aortic angiography has been mostly replaced by computed tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Angiography**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Principles, Techniques and Complications**\n\nIn: Adam A, Dixon AK, Gillard JH, Schaefer-Prokop CM, eds.

Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms.\n\nIn children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including:\n\n* Congenital absence of a branch of the aorta\n* Isolation of the subclavian arteries\n* Vascular rings\n\nAn inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Blood pressure changes\n* Breathing problems\n* Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes\n* Numbness of an arm\n* Reduced pulse\n* Swallowing problems\n* Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is often needed to treat the underlying cause of aortic arch syndrome.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSubclavian artery occlusive syndrome; Carotid artery occlusion syndrome; Subclavian steal syndrome; Vertebral-basilar artery occlusive syndrome; Takayasu disease; Pulseless disease\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Arch Syndrome**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Blood pressure changes\n* Breathing problems\n* Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes\n* Numbness of an arm\n* Reduced pulse\n* Swallowing problems\n* Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)\n\nThe symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is often needed to treat the underlying cause of aortic arch syndrome.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Subclavian artery occlusive syndrome\n* Carotid artery occlusion syndrome\n* Subclavian steal syndrome\n* Vertebral-basilar artery occlusive syndrome\n* Takayasu disease\n* Pulseless disease\n\n**References**\n\n* Braverman AC, Schermerhorn M.

It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta)._\n\n_Aortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta._\n\n_When a tear occurs, it creates 2 channels:_\n\n_*One in which blood continues to travel*_\n\n_*Another where blood stays still*_\n\n_If the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them._\n\n_An aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta (aneurysm)._\n\n_The exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include:_\n\n_*Aging*_\n\n_*Atherosclerosis*_\n\n_*Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident*_\n\n_*High blood pressure*_\n\n_Other risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include:_\n\n_*Bicuspid aortic valve*_\n\n_*Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta*_\n\n_*Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders*_\n\n_*Heart surgery or procedures*_\n\n_*Pregnancy*_\n\n_*Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis*_\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Dissection**\n\n**What is it?**\nAortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, causing blood to flow between the layers of the aorta. This can lead to severe chest pain and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n**Causes**\nThe exact cause of aortic dissection is unknown, but more common risks include:\n\n* Aging\n* Atherosclerosis\n* Blunt trauma to the chest\n* High blood pressure\n\nOther risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include:\n\n* Bicuspid aortic valve\n* Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta\n* Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders\n* Heart surgery or procedures\n* Pregnancy\n* Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis\n\n**Symptoms**\nIn most cases, the symptoms begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain. The pain may feel like a heart attack.\n\nPain can be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping.\nIt is felt below the breast bone, and then moves under the shoulder blades or to the back.\nPain can move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips.\nThe pain changes position, often moving to the arms and legs as the aortic dissection gets worse.\n\nSymptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include:\n\n* Anxiety and a feeling of doom\n* Fainting or dizziness\n* Heavy sweating (clammy skin)\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pale skin (pallor)\n* Rapid, weak pulse\n* Shortness of breath and trouble breathing when lying flat (orthopnea)\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Pain in the abdomen\n* Stroke symptoms\n* Swallowing difficulties from pressure on the esophagus\n\n**Exams and Tests**\nThe health care provider will take your medical and family medical history and listen to your heart, lungs, and abdomen with a stethoscope. The exam may find:\n\n* A \"blowing\" murmur over the aorta, heart murmur, or other abnormal sound\n* A difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms, or between the arms and legs\n* Low blood pressure\n* Signs resembling a heart attack\n* Signs of shock, but with normal blood pressure\n\nAortic dissection or aortic aneurysm may be seen on:\n\n* Aortic angiography\n* Chest x-ray\n* Chest MRI\n* CT scan of chest with dye\n* Duplex Doppler ultrasonography (occasionally performed)\n* Echocardiogram\n* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)\n\nBlood work to rule out a heart attack is needed.\n\n**Treatment**\nAortic dissection is a life-threatening condition and needs to be treated right away.\n\nDissections that occur in the part of the aorta that is leaving the heart (ascending) are treated with surgery.\nDissections that occur in other parts of the aorta (descending) may be managed with surgery or medicines.\n\nTwo techniques may be used for surgery:\n\n* Standard, open surgery. This requires a surgical incision that is made in the chest or abdomen.\n* Endovascular aortic repair. This surgery is done without any major surgical incisions.\n\nMedicines that lower blood pressure may be prescribed. These medicines may be given through a vein (intravenously). Beta-blockers are the medicines of first choice. Strong pain relievers are very often needed.\n\nIf the aortic valve is damaged, valve replacement is needed. If the heart arteries are involved, a coronary bypass is also performed.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Dissection**\n\n**What is Aortic Dissection?**\n\nAortic dissection is a serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears, causing blood to flow between the layers and potentially leading to rupture.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of aortic dissection is not always known, but it can be caused by:\n\n* High blood pressure\n* Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)\n* Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n* Trauma or injury\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Severe chest pain that radiates to the back\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Pale or cool skin\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for aortic dissection depends on the location and severity of the tear. Dissections that occur in the part of the aorta closest to the heart (ascending) are treated with surgery. Dissections that occur in other parts of the aorta may be managed with surgery or medicines.\n\nTwo techniques may be used for surgery:\n\n* Standard, open surgery\n* Endovascular aortic repair\n\nMedicines that lower blood pressure may be prescribed, and strong pain relievers are often needed.\n\nIf the aortic valve is damaged, valve replacement is needed. If the heart arteries are involved, a coronary bypass is also performed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAortic dissection is life-threatening, and the condition can be managed with surgery if it is done before the aorta ruptures. Less than one half of people with a ruptured aorta survive.\n\nThose who survive will need lifelong, aggressive treatment of high blood pressure and regular follow-up with CT scans to monitor the aorta.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAortic dissection may decrease or stop the blood flow to many different parts of the body, resulting in short-term or long-term problems or damage to:\n\n* Brain\n* Heart\n* Intestines or bowels\n* Kidneys\n* Legs\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have symptoms of an aortic dissection or severe chest pain, call 911 or the local emergency number, or go to the emergency room as quickly as possible.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany cases of aortic dissection cannot be prevented. However, things you can do to reduce your risk include:\n\n* Treating and controlling hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\n* Keeping high blood pressure under control\n* Taking safety precautions to prevent injuries that can cause dissections\n* If you have been diagnosed with Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, making sure you regularly follow-up with your provider\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Dissection**\n\n\\n\\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nAn aortic dissection is a serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears, causing blood to flow between the layers of the aorta. This can lead to a rupture of the aorta, which is life-threatening.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of an aortic dissection may include:\n\n*   Severe chest or abdominal pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Pale or cool skin\n*   Fainting\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA diagnosis of an aortic dissection is typically made using imaging tests such as:\n\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   CT scan\n*   MRI\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of an aortic dissection depends on the severity of the condition and may include:\n\n*   **Medical Management**: This involves controlling high blood pressure, stopping any smoking, and managing any other underlying medical conditions.\n*   **Surgical Management**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged section of the aorta.\n\n\\n\\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Aortic aneurysm\n*   Aortic rupture\n\n\\n\\n**Images**\n\n*   Aortic rupture - chest x-ray\n*   Aortic aneurysm\n*   Aortic dissection",

    "content": "**Aortic Stenosis**\n\nThe aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In people with aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAs the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain.\n\n*   As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs.\n*   Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.\n*   Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life.\n*   Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.\n\nAortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people.\n\nCalcium buildup of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcium buildup can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).\n\nAnother cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 to 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests before any symptoms developed.\n\n*   Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw.\n*   Cough, possibly bloody.\n*   Breathing problems when exercising.\n*   Becoming easily tired.\n*   Feeling the heartbeat (palpitations).\n*   Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity.\n\nIn infants and children, symptoms include:\n\n*   Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases)\n*   Failure to gain weight\n*   Poor feeding\n*   Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases)\n\nChildren with mild aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA heart murmur, click, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope. The provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. There may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck.\n\n*   Blood pressure may be low.\n*   Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed and then monitored using a test called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).\n*   The following tests may also be performed:\n    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n    *   Exercise stress testing\n    *   Left cardiac catheterization\n    *   MRI of the heart\n    *   Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nRegular checkups by a provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram.\n\nPeople with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited.\n\nMedicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far.\n\nIn the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your provider to find out whether you need antibiotics.\n\nPeople with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol.\n\nSurgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the provider may recommend surgery based on test results.\n\nA less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of or before surgery.\n\n*   A balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated.\n*   However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure.\n*   A newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve (transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR). This procedure is becoming more common.\n\nSome children may need aortic valve repair or replacement. Children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to take part in most activities.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome varies. The disorder may be mild and not produce symptoms. Over time, the aortic valve may become narrower. This may result in more severe heart problems such as:\n\n*   Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter\n*   Blood clots to the brain (stroke), intestines, kidneys, or other areas\n*   Fainting spells (syncope)\n*   Heart failure\n*   High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)\n\nThe results of aortic valve replacement are often excellent. To get the best treatment, go to a center that regularly performs this type of surgery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child has symptoms of aortic stenosis.\n\nAlso contact your provider right away if you have been diagnosed with this condition and your symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Stenosis**\n\nThe aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body.

    "content": "**Aortic Valve Surgery - Minimally Invasive**\n\nBlood flows out of your heart and into a large blood vessel called the aorta. The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart.\n\nYou may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if:\n\n* Your aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation.\n* Your aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called aortic stenosis.\n\nThe aortic valve can be replaced using:\n\n* Minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, done using one or more small cuts\n* Open aortic valve surgery, done by making a large cut in your chest\n\n**Description**\n\nBefore your surgery, you will receive general anesthesia. You will be asleep and pain-free.\n\nThere are several ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Techniques include min-thoracotomy, min-sternotomy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery. To perform the different procedures:\n\n* Your surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch (5 to 7.6 centimeters) cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). The muscles in the area will be divided. This lets the surgeon reach the heart and aortic valve.\n* Your surgeon may split only the upper portion of your breast bone, allowing exposure to the aortic valve.\n* For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes 2 to 4 tiny cuts in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. A 3D view of the heart and aortic valve are displayed on a computer in the operating room.\n\nYou may need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries.\n\nWhen the aortic valve is too damaged for repair, a new valve is put in place. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\n\n* Mechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve.\n* Biological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 20 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\n\nAnother technique is transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). TAVR can be done through a small incision made in the groin or the left chest. The replacement valve is passed into the blood vessel or the heart and moved up to the aortic valve. The catheter has a balloon on the end. The balloon is inflated to stretch the opening of the valve.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nAortic valve surgery is done when the valve does not work properly. Surgery may be done for these reasons:\n\n* Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting spells, or heart failure.\n* Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are harming the work of your heart.\n* Damage to your heart valve from infection (endocarditis).\n\n**Benefits**\n\nA minimally invasive procedure can have many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk for infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any surgery are:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n* Breathing problems\n* Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\n* Reactions to medicines\n\nOther risks vary by the person's age. Some of these risks are:\n\n* Damage to other organs, nerves, or bones\n* Heart attack, stroke, or death\n* Infection of the new valve\n* Kidney failure\n* Irregular heartbeat that must be treated with medicines or a pacemaker\n* Poor healing of incision\n* Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care provider:\n\n* If you are or could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nYou may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your provider about how you and your family members can donate blood.\n\nFor the week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.\n\nSome of them are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).\n\nIf you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or other blood thinning medicine, talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.\n\n**During the Days Before Your Surgery**\n\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help. Always let your provider know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery.\n\nPrepare your house for when you get home from the hospital.\n\nShower and wash your hair the day before surgery. You may need to wash your body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest 2 or 3 times with this soap. You also may be asked to take an antibiotic to prevent infection.\n\n**On the Day of Your Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes using chewing gum and mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry. Be careful not to swallow.\n\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter your operation, you will spend 3 to 7 days in the hospital. You will spend the first night in an intensive care unit (ICU). Nurses will monitor your condition at all times.\n\nMost of the time, you will be moved to a regular room or a transitional care unit in the hospital within 24 hours. You will start activity slowly. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger.\n\nYou may have two or three tubes in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. Most of the time, these are taken out 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\nYou may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV) lines for fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that display your vital signs (pulse, temperature, and breathing). You may have daily blood tests and ECGs to test your heart function until you are well enough to go home.\n\nA temporary pacemaker may be placed in your heart if your heart rhythm becomes too slow after surgery.\n\nOnce you are home, recovery takes time. Take it easy, and be patient with yourself.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMechanical heart valves do not fail often. However, blood clots can develop on them. If a blood clot forms, you may have a stroke. Bleeding can occur, but this is rare.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Valve Surgery - Minimally Invasive**\n\n**What is Aortic Valve Surgery?**\n\nAortic valve surgery is a procedure to replace or repair the aortic valve in your heart.

There are two main types of new valves:\n\n* Mechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You may need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve.\n* Biological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves may last 10 to 20 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\n\nOnce the new valve is working, your surgeon will:\n\nClose your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine.\nPlace catheters (tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up.\nClose your breastbone with stainless steel wires. It will take about 6 to 12 weeks for the bone to heal. The wires will stay inside your body.\n\nThis surgery may take 3 to 5 hours.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n* Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n* Blood loss\n* Breathing problems\n* Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\n* Reactions to medicines\n\nPossible risks from having open heart surgery are:\n\n* Heart attack or stroke\n* Heart rhythm problems\n* Incision infection, which is more likely to occur in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery\n* Infection of the new valve\n* Kidney failure\n* Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or \"fuzzy thinking\"\n* Poor healing of the incision\n* Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (low-grade fever and chest pain) that could last up to 6 months\n* Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care provider:\n\nIf you are or could be pregnant\nWhat medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nYou may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your provider how you and your family members can donate blood.\n\nIf you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help.\n\nFor the 1 week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.\n\nSome of these drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).\nIf you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or other blood thinning medicines, talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.\n\n**During the days before your surgery:**\n\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nAlways let your provider know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery.\n\nPrepare your house for when you get home from the hospital.\n\nShower and wash your hair the day before your surgery. You may need to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest 2 or 3 times with this soap.\n\n**On the day of your surgery:**\n\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes using chewing gum and breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry. Be careful not to swallow.\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nExpect to spend 4 to 7 days in the hospital after surgery. You will spend the first night in the ICU and may stay there for 1 to 2 days. There will be 2 to 3 tubes in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. These are usually removed 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\nYou may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV) lines to deliver fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that display your vital signs (your pulse, temperature, and breathing).\n\nYou will be moved to a regular hospital room from the ICU. Your heart and vital signs will continue to be monitored until you go home. You will receive pain medicine to control pain around your surgical cut.\n\nYour nurse will help you slowly resume some activity. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger.\n\nYou may have a pacemaker placed in your heart if your heart rate becomes too slow after surgery. It may be temporary or permanent.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMechanical heart valves do not fail often. However, blood clots can develop on them. If a blood clot forms, you may have a stroke. Bleeding can occur, but this is rare.\n\nBiological valves have a lower risk of blood clots, but tend to fail over an extended period of time. For best results, choose to have your aortic valve surgery at a center that does many of these procedures.\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Valve Surgery - Open**\n\n**What is aortic valve surgery?**\n\nAortic valve surgery is a procedure to replace the aortic valve in your heart. The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta, allowing blood to flow out of the heart and into the aorta.\n\n**Why do I need aortic valve surgery?**\n\nYou may need aortic valve surgery if:\n\n* Your aortic valve does not close all the way, causing blood to leak back into the heart (aortic regurgitation).\n* Your aortic valve does not open fully, reducing blood flow out of the heart (aortic stenosis).\n\n**Types of aortic valve surgery**\n\nThere are two main types of aortic valve surgery:\n\n1. **Open aortic valve surgery**: This procedure involves making a large cut in your chest to replace the valve.\n2. **Minimally invasive aortic valve surgery**: This procedure uses several small cuts to replace the valve.\n\n**Before the procedure**\n\n* You will receive general anesthesia, which will put you to sleep and make you pain-free.\n* Your surgeon will make a 10-inch-long (25 centimeters) cut in the middle of your chest.\n* Your breastbone may need to be divided to see your heart and aorta.\n* You may need to be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump, which will do the work of your heart while it is stopped.\n\n**The procedure**\n\n* If your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve (valve replacement surgery).\n* Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place.\n* There are two main types of new valves:\n\t+ Mechanical: made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon.

These include:\n\n* Coronary bypass surgery\n* Aortic root replacement (David procedure)\n* Ross (or switch) procedure\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nYou may need surgery if your aortic valve does not work properly. You may need open-heart valve surgery for these reasons:\n\n* Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting spells, or heart failure.\n* Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works.\n* Your heart valve has been damaged by infection of the heart valve (endocarditis).\n* You have received a new heart valve in the past and it is not working well.\n* You have other problems such as blood clots, infection, or bleeding.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n* Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n* Blood loss\n* Breathing problems\n* Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\n* Reactions to medicines\n\nPossible risks from having open heart surgery are:\n\n* Heart attack or stroke\n* Heart rhythm problems\n* Incision infection, which is more likely to occur in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery\n* Infection of the new valve\n* Kidney failure\n* Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or \"fuzzy thinking\"\n* Poor healing of the incision\n* Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (low-grade fever and chest pain) that could last up to 6 months\n* Death\n\n---\n\n**Aortic Valve Surgery - Open**\n\n**Possible Risks from Having Open Heart Surgery Are:**\n\n*   Heart attack or stroke\n*   Heart rhythm problems\n*   Incision infection, which is more likely to occur in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery\n*   Infection of the new valve\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or \"fuzzy thinking\"\n*   Poor healing of the incision\n*   Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (low-grade fever and chest pain) that could last up to 6 months\n*   Death\n\n**Risks for Any Surgery Are:**\n\n*   Possible risks from having open heart surgery are:\n    *   Blood loss\n    *   Avel to the lungs\n    *   Breathing problems\n    *   Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\n    *   Reactions to medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care provider:\n\n*   If you are or could be pregnant\n*   What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nYou may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery.

    "content": "**Aortopulmonary Window**\n\n_A rare heart defect in which there is a hole connecting the major artery taking blood from the heart to the body (the aorta) and the one taking blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery)._\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then the blood travels back to the heart and is pumped to the aorta and the rest of the body.\n\nBabies with an aortopulmonary window have a hole in between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Because of this hole, blood from the aorta flows into the pulmonary artery, and as a result too much blood flows to the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure. The bigger the defect, the more blood that is able to enter the pulmonary artery.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIf the defect is small, it may not cause any symptoms. However, most defects are large.\n\nSymptoms can include:\n\n* Delayed growth\n* Heart failure\n* Irritability\n* Poor eating and lack of weight gain\n* Rapid breathing\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Respiratory infections\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will usually hear an abnormal heart sound (murmur) when listening to the child's heart with a stethoscope.\n\nThe provider may order tests such as:\n\n* Cardiac catheterization -- a thin tube inserted into blood vessels and/or arteries around the heart to view the heart and blood vessels and directly measure pressure in the heart and lungs.\n* Chest x-ray.\n* Echocardiogram.\n* MRI of the heart.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe condition usually requires open heart surgery to repair the defect. Surgery should be done as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. In most cases, this is when the child is still a newborn.\n\nDuring the procedure, a heart-lung machine takes over for the child's heart. The surgeon opens the aorta and closes the defect with a patch made either from a piece of the sac that encloses the heart (the pericardium) or a man-made material.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSurgery to correct aortopulmonary window is successful in most cases. If the defect is treated quickly, the child should not have any lasting effects.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nDelaying treatment can lead to complications such as:\n\n* Congestive heart failure\n* Pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome\n* Death\n\n---\n\n**Aortopulmonary Window**\n\n_A rare congenital heart defect where there's a hole connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery._\n\n**Causes**\n\nNormally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, picks up oxygen, and then travels back to the heart, pumped to the aorta, and the rest of the body.

    "content": "**Apert Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nApert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. A key feature of Apert syndrome is the premature closure of the bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. In addition, a varied number of fingers and toes are fused together (syndactyly).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nApert syndrome is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of Apert syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and developing the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nApert syndrome is also known as acrocephalosyndactyly type I (ACS I).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about Apert syndrome, you can visit the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's website or consult with a genetic counselor.\n\n---\n\n**Apert Syndrome**\n\n**What is Apert syndrome?**\n\nApert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   Premature closure of the bones of the skull (craniosynostosis)\n*   A varied number of fingers and toes are fused together (syndactyly)\n\n**Facial Features**\n\n*   Sunken appearance in the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia)\n*   Beaked nose\n*   Wrinkled forehead\n*   Opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate)\n*   Underdeveloped upper jaw\n\n**Vision Problems**\n\n*   Bulging eyes (exophthalmos)\n*   Wide-set eyes (hypertelorism)\n*   Outside corners of the eyes that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures)\n*   Eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus)\n*   Shallow eye sockets (ocular proptosis)\n\n**Hearing Loss**\n\n*   Malformed ear structures\n\n**Breathing Difficulties**\n\n*   Partial blockage of the airways due to abnormal development of structures in the face and head\n\n**Intellectual Development**\n\n*   Cognitive abilities range from normal to mild or moderate intellectual disability\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\n*   Syndactyly of the fingers and toes\n*   Severity of fusion varies, with hands more severely affected than feet\n*   Most commonly, three digits on each hand and foot are fused together\n*   In severe cases, all fingers and toes are fused\n*   Rarely, extra fingers or toes (polydactyly)\n\n**Additional Signs and Symptoms**\n\n*   Unusually heavy sweating (hyperhidrosis)\n*   Oily skin with severe acne\n*   Patches of missing hair in the eyebrows\n\n**Frequency**\n\nApert syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 65,000 to 88,000 newborns. Although parents of all ages can have a child with Apert syndrome, the risk is increased in older fathers.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in a gene known as FGFR2 cause Apert syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). A mutation in a specific part of the FGFR2 gene alters the protein, increasing its signaling and promoting the premature fusion of bones in the skull, hands, and feet.\n\n---\n\n**Apert Syndrome**\n\n**What is Apert syndrome?**\n\nApert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of bones in the skull, hands, and feet.\n\n**Causes of Apert syndrome**\n\nMutations in a gene known as FGFR2 cause Apert syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). A mutation in a specific part of the FGFR2 gene alters the protein, increasing its signaling. The abnormal signaling causes the cell to mature too quickly and promotes the premature fusion of bones.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nApert syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Nearly all cases result from new (de novo) mutations that occur during the formation of reproductive cells or in early embryonic development.\n\n**Other names for this condition**\n\n* Acrocephalosyndactyly\n* Acrocephalosyndactyly type I\n* Apert's syndrome\n* Type I acrocephalosyndactyly\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nFor more information on Apert syndrome, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Acrocephalosyndactyly type I\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Apert syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: APERT SYNDROME\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on Apert syndrome:\n\n1.

    "content": "**Apgar Score**\n\nThe Apgar test is a quick assessment performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. It determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process (1-minute score) and how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb (5-minute score). The test also helps measure how well the baby responds if resuscitation is needed right after birth.\n\nIn rare cases, the test will be done 10 minutes after birth.\n\n**History**\n\nVirginia Apgar, MD (1909-1974) introduced the Apgar score in 1952.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe Apgar test is done by a doctor, midwife, or nurse. The health care provider examines the baby's:\n\n* Breathing effort\n* Heart rate\n* Muscle tone\n* Reflexes\n* Skin color\n\nEach category is scored with 0, 1, or 2, depending on the observed condition.\n\n**Breathing Effort**\n\n* If the infant is not breathing, the respiratory score is 0.\n* If the respirations are slow or irregular, the infant scores 1 for respiratory effort.\n* If the infant cries well, the respiratory score is 2.\n\n**Heart Rate**\n\n* If there is no heartbeat, the infant scores 0 for heart rate.\n* If heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the infant scores 1 for heart rate.\n* If heart rate is greater than 100 beats per minute, the infant scores 2 for heart rate.\n\n**Muscle Tone**\n\n* If muscles are loose and floppy, the infant scores 0 for muscle tone.\n* If there is some muscle tone, the infant scores 1.\n* If there is active motion, the infant scores 2 for muscle tone.\n\n**Reflexes**\n\n* Grimace response or reflex irritability is a term describing response to stimulation, such as a mild pinch:\n\t+ If there is no reaction, the infant scores 0 for reflex irritability.\n\t+ If there is grimacing, the infant scores 1 for reflex irritability.\n\t+ If there is grimacing and a cough, sneeze, or vigorous cry, the infant scores 2 for reflex irritability.\n\n**Skin Color**\n\n* If the skin color is pale blue, the infant scores 0 for color.\n* If the body is pink and the extremities are blue, the infant scores 1 for color.\n* If the entire body is pink, the infant scores 2 for color.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to determine whether a newborn needs help breathing or is having heart trouble.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe Apgar score is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth.\n\n* A score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and is a sign that the newborn is in good health.\n* A score of 10 is very unusual, since almost all newborns lose 1 point for blue hands and feet, which is normal for after birth.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAny score lower than 7 is a sign that the baby needs medical attention. The lower the score, the more help the baby needs to adjust outside the mother's womb.\n\nMost of the time a low Apgar score is caused by:\n\n* A difficult birth\n* C-section\n* Fluid in the baby's airway\n\nA baby with a low Apgar score may need:\n\n* Oxygen and clearing out the airway to help with breathing\n* Physical stimulation to get the heart beating at a healthy rate\n\n---\n\n**Apgar Score: Understanding the Test**\n\nThe Apgar test is a quick assessment performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth to determine their overall health.\n\n**What Does the Test Measure?**\n\n* Breathing effort\n* Heart rate\n* Muscle tone\n* Reflexes\n* Skin color\n\nEach category is scored with 0, 1, or 2, depending on the observed condition.\n\n**How Is the Test Performed?**\n\nA healthcare provider examines the baby's:\n\n* Breathing effort: If not breathing (0), slow or irregular respirations (1), or cries well (2)\n* Heart rate: If no heartbeat (0), less than 100 beats per minute (1), or greater than 100 beats per minute (2)\n* Muscle tone: If loose and floppy (0), some muscle tone (1), or active motion (2)\n* Reflexes: If no reaction (0), grimacing (1), or grimacing with a cough, sneeze, or vigorous cry (2)\n* Skin color: If pale blue (0), pink body with blue extremities (1), or entire body pink (2)\n\n**Why Is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is done to determine whether a newborn needs help breathing or is having heart trouble.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and indicates good health. A score of 10 is unusual, as almost all newborns lose 1 point for blue hands and feet, which is normal after birth.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAny score lower than 7 indicates the baby needs medical attention. The lower the score, the more help the baby needs to adjust outside the mother's womb. Most low Apgar scores are caused by a difficult birth, C-section, or fluid in the baby's airway.\n\n**What Happens Next?**\n\nA baby with a low Apgar score may need oxygen and clearing out the airway to help with breathing, as well as physical stimulation to get the heart beating at a healthy rate. Most of the time, a low score at 1 minute is near-normal by 5 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Apgar Score**\n\nThe Apgar score is a quick test used to assess the health of a newborn baby. It's named after Dr. Virginia Apgar, who developed it in 1952.\n\n**What Does the Test Measure?**\n\nThe Apgar score measures two main things:\n\n*   **Breathing**: Is the baby breathing well?\n*   **Heart Rate**: Is the baby's heart beating at a healthy rate?\n\n**How is the Score Calculated?**\n\nThe Apgar score is calculated based on five components:\n\n1.  **Color**: Is the baby pink all over, or are they blue or pale?\n2.  **Heart Rate**: How fast is the baby's heart beating?\n3.  **Muscle Tone**: Are the baby's muscles relaxed or tense?\n4.  **Reflexes**: Does the baby respond to stimulation, such as a pinch on the foot?\n5.  **Respiration**: Is the baby breathing well?\n\nEach component is scored from 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score. The scores are then added up to get a total Apgar score out of 10.\n\n**What Do the Scores Mean?**\n\nHere's what the scores typically mean:\n\n*   **7-10**: The baby is doing great!\n*   **4-6**: The baby needs some help, but it's not serious.\n*   **0-3**: The baby needs medical attention right away.\n\n**Why is the Apgar Score Important?**\n\nThe Apgar score is important because it helps doctors and nurses quickly identify if a newborn baby needs medical attention. It's not meant to predict the baby's future health, but rather to ensure they're healthy enough to go home with their parents.\n\n**What Can Cause a Low Apgar Score?**\n\nSome common reasons for a low Apgar score include:\n\n*   **Difficult birth**: The baby had a tough time coming out.\n*   **C-section**: The baby was delivered via cesarean section.\n*   **Fluid in the airway**: The baby has fluid in their lungs, making it hard to breathe.\n\nIf the Apgar score is low, the doctor may need to give the baby oxygen and help them clear out any fluid in their airways. In most cases, a low score at 1 minute will be near-normal by 5 minutes.",

    "content": "**Aphasia**\n\n_A Language Disorder That Affects Reading, Writing, and Speaking_\n\nAphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language.\n\n**Types of Aphasia**\n\nThere are four main types of aphasia:\n\n* **Expressive Aphasia**: when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts.\n* **Receptive Aphasia**: affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean.\n* **Global Aphasia**: the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write.\n* **Anomic or Amnesia Aphasia**: when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events.\n\n**Causes of Aphasia**\n\nAphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from:\n\n* Stroke\n* Brain tumor\n* Brain infection or inflammation\n* Brain injury\n* Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nIf a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually:\n\n* Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands.\n* Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include:\n\t+ MRI\n\t+ CT scan\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible.\n\nTreatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.\n\nThe specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.\n\nFamily participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:\n\n* Using simpler language\n* Including the person with aphasia in conversations\n* Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can help prevent aphasia by:\n\n* Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having:\n\t+ A stroke\n\t+ Heart disease\n\t+ Vascular disease (problems with your blood vessels)\n* Protecting your brain from injury:\n\t+ Wearing the right helmet for sports safety, such as when riding a bike\n\t+ Taking action to prevent falls\n\t+ Always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely\n\n---\n\n**Aphasia**\n\n_A Language Disorder That Makes It Hard to Read, Write, and Say What You Mean_\n\n**What is aphasia?**\n\nAphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too.\n\n**Causes of aphasia**\n\nAphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from:\n\n* Stroke\n* Brain tumor\n* Brain infection or inflammation\n* Brain injury\n* Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia\n\n**Who is more likely to develop aphasia?**\n\nAnyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time.\n\n**Diagnosing aphasia**\n\nIf a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually:\n\n* Test the person's ability to understand language and speech\n* Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged\n\n**Treating aphasia**\n\nSome people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible.\n\nTreatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.\n\nThe specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.\n\nFamily participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:\n\n* Using simpler language\n* Including the person with aphasia in conversations\n* Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly\n\n**Preventing aphasia**\n\nYou can help prevent aphasia by:\n\n* Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having a stroke, heart disease, or vascular disease\n* Protecting your brain from injury by wearing the right helmet for sports safety, taking action to prevent falls, and always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely\n\n---\n\n**Aphasia**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAphasia is a condition that affects a person's ability to communicate effectively. It can result from stroke, brain injury, or other neurological disorders.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Difficulty speaking\n* Difficulty understanding spoken language\n* Difficulty reading and writing\n* Difficulty with verbal communication\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Stroke\n* Brain injury\n* Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* Speech therapy to improve communication skills\n* Medications to manage underlying conditions\n* Support groups for individuals with aphasia and their families\n\n**Living with Aphasia**\n\n* Learning to adapt to communication challenges\n* Developing strategies to compensate for difficulties\n* Seeking support from healthcare professionals, family, and friends\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Speech and Communication Disorders\n* Stroke\n* National Institutes of Health\n\t+ The primary NIH organization for research on Aphasia is the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders",

    "content": "**Apixaban**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is Apixaban?**\n\nApixaban is a medication used to prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation. It belongs to a class of drugs called anticoagulants, which help prevent the formation of blood clots.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThis medication is prescribed to prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation. It is also used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n\\n\\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nTake apixaban exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not stop taking apixaban without talking to your doctor, even if you feel well. Be sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss any doses.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nApixaban is also used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n\\n\\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nIf you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while taking apixaban, you are at risk of having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause paralysis. Tell your doctor if you have an epidural catheter left in your body or have had repeated epidural or spinal punctures, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no special dietary instructions for apixaban.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of apixaban, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of apixaban include bleeding, bruising, or swelling at the injection site. Less common side effects may include muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in the legs, or loss of control of the bowels or bladder.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore apixaban at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Dispose of unused medication properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms such as muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in the legs, or loss of control of the bowels or bladder, call your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with apixaban and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking apixaban.**\n\nIf you have atrial fibrillation and are taking apixaban, you are at a higher risk of having a stroke after you stop taking this medication. Do not stop taking apixaban without talking to your doctor. Continue to take apixaban even if you feel well. Be sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss any doses of apixaban. If you need to stop taking apixaban, your doctor may prescribe another anticoagulant ('blood thinner') to help prevent a blood clot from forming and causing you to have a stroke.\n\nIf you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while taking a 'blood thinner' such as apixaban, you are at risk of having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause paralysis. Tell your doctor if you have an epidural catheter left in your body or have had repeated epidural or spinal punctures, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: anagrelide (Agrylin); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; cilostazol (Pletal); clopidogrel (Plavix); dipyridamole (Persantine); eptifibatide (Integrilin); heparin; prasugrel (Effient); ticagrelor (Brilinta); ticlopidine; tirofiban (Aggrastat), and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or loss of control of your bowels or bladder.\n\n---\n\n**Apixaban: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\n*   Apixaban is used to help prevent strokes or blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly, increasing the chance of clots forming in the body and possibly causing strokes) that is not caused by heart valve disease.\n*   Apixaban is also used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung) in people who are having hip replacement or knee replacement surgery.\n*   Apixaban is also used to treat DVT and PE and may be continued to prevent DVT and PE from happening again after the initial treatment is completed.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\n*   Apixaban comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day.\n*   When apixaban is taken to prevent DVT and PE after hip or knee replacement surgery, the first dose should be taken at least 12 to 24 hours after surgery.\n*   Apixaban is usually taken for 35 days after a hip replacement surgery and for 12 days after knee replacement surgery.\n*   Take apixaban at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   Take apixaban exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\n*   Continue to take apixaban even if you feel well.

    "content": "**Apnea of Prematurity**\n\nApnea means \"without breath\" and refers to breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. Apnea of prematurity refers to breathing pauses in babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (premature birth).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are several reasons why newborns, in particular those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including:\n\n* The brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing.\n* The muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life.\n\nOther stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including:\n\n* Anemia\n* Feeding problems\n* Heart or lung problems\n* Infection\n* Low oxygen levels\n* Temperature problems\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called \"periodic breathing.\" This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early. It consists of episodes of either shallow breathing or short pauses in breathing lasting just a few seconds. These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing. This is generally considered a normal pattern and can be expected in less mature and even some full-term babies. However, the pattern of breathing, length of breathing pauses, and the age of the baby are both important when deciding if it needs to be further evaluated.\n\nApnea episodes or \"events\" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a:\n\n* Drop in heart rate. This heart rate drop is called bradycardia (also called a \"brady\").\n* Drop in oxygen level (oxygen saturation). This is called desaturation (also called a \"desat\").\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAll premature babies under 35 weeks gestation are admitted to newborn intensive care units, or special care nurseries, with special monitors because they are at higher risk for apnea. Older babies who are found to have apnea episodes will also be placed on monitors in the hospital. More tests will be done if the baby is not preterm and appears unwell.\n\nMonitors keep track of breathing rate, heart rate, and oxygen levels.\nDrops in breathing rate, heart rate, or oxygen level can set off the alarms on these monitors.\nBaby monitors marketed for home use are not the same as those used in the hospital.\n\nAlarms may occur for other reasons (such as passing stool or moving around), so the monitor tracings are reviewed regularly by the health care team.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHow apnea is treated depends on:\n\n* The cause\n* How often it occurs\n* Severity of episodes\n\nBabies who are otherwise healthy and have occasional minor episodes are simply watched. In these cases, the episodes go away when the babies are gently touched or \"stimulated\" during periods when breathing stops.\n\nBabies who are well, but who are very premature and/or have many apnea episodes may be given caffeine. This will help make their breathing pattern more regular. Sometimes, the nurse will change a baby's position, use suction to remove fluid or mucus from the mouth or nose, or use a bag and mask to help with breathing.\n\nBreathing can be assisted by:\n\n* Proper positioning\n* Slower feeding time\n* Oxygen\n* Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n* Breathing machine (ventilator) in extreme cases\n\nSome infants who continue to have apnea but are otherwise mature and healthy may be discharged from the hospital on a home apnea monitor, with or without caffeine, until they have outgrown their immature breathing pattern.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nApnea is common in premature babies. Mild apnea does not appear to have long-term effects. However, preventing multiple or severe episodes is better for the baby over the long-term.\n\nApnea of prematurity most often goes away as the baby approaches their \"due date.\" In some cases, such as in infants who were born very prematurely or have severe lung disease, apnea may persist a few weeks longer.\n\n---\n\n**Apnea of Prematurity**\n\nApnea means \"without breath\" and refers to breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. Apnea of prematurity refers to breathing pauses in babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (premature birth).\n\nMost premature babies have some degree of apnea because the area of the brain that controls breathing is still developing.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are several reasons why newborns, in particular those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including:\n\n* The brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing.\n* The muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life.\n\nOther stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including:\n\n* Anemia\n* Feeding problems\n* Heart or lung problems\n* Infection\n* Low oxygen levels\n* Temperature problems\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called \"periodic breathing.\" This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early.

These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing.\n\nApnea episodes or \"events\" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a:\n\n* Drop in heart rate (bradycardia)\n* Drop in oxygen level (desaturation)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAll premature babies under 35 weeks gestation are admitted to newborn intensive care units, or special care nurseries, with special monitors because they are at higher risk for apnea. Older babies who are found to have apnea episodes will also be placed on monitors in the hospital.\n\nMonitors keep track of breathing rate, heart rate, and oxygen levels. Drops in breathing rate, heart rate, or oxygen level can set off the alarms on these monitors.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHow apnea is treated depends on:\n\n* The cause\n* How often it occurs\n* Severity of episodes\n\nBabies who are otherwise healthy and have occasional minor episodes are simply watched. In these cases, the episodes go away when the babies are gently touched or \"stimulated\" during periods when breathing stops.\n\nBabies who are well, but who are very premature and/or have many apnea episodes may be given caffeine. This will help make their breathing pattern more regular. Sometimes, the nurse will change a baby's position, use suction to remove fluid or mucus from the mouth or nose, or use a bag and mask to help with breathing.\n\nBreathing can be assisted by:\n\n* Proper positioning\n* Slower feeding time\n* Oxygen\n* Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n* Breathing machine (ventilator) in extreme cases\n\nSome infants who continue to have apnea but are otherwise mature and healthy may be discharged from the hospital on a home apnea monitor, with or without caffeine, until they have outgrown their immature breathing pattern.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nApnea is common in premature babies. Mild apnea does not appear to have long-term effects. However, preventing multiple or severe episodes is better for the baby over the long-term.\n\nApnea of prematurity most often goes away as the baby approaches their \"due date.\" In some cases, such as in infants who were born very prematurely or have severe lung disease, apnea may persist a few weeks longer.\n\n---\n\n**Apnea of Prematurity**\n\n**What is Apnea of Prematurity?**\n\nApnea of prematurity (AOP) is a condition where premature babies stop breathing for short periods.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of AOP is not known, but it is thought to be related to the immaturity of the respiratory system. Premature babies are at higher risk of developing AOP due to their underdeveloped lungs and brain.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of AOP is a pause in breathing that lasts for 15 seconds or more. This can cause a drop in oxygen levels, which can lead to other complications such as heart rate changes and skin color changes.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAOP is typically diagnosed using a monitor that tracks the baby's breathing rate, heart rate, and oxygen levels. The monitor will sound an alarm if the baby's breathing rate drops below 60 breaths per minute or if there is a drop in oxygen levels.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of AOP depends on the cause, frequency, and severity of the episodes. In some cases, the baby may be simply watched, while in other cases, caffeine may be given to help regulate the breathing pattern. In more severe cases, breathing assistance may be necessary, including proper positioning, slower feeding time, oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or a breathing machine (ventilator).\n\n**Outlook**\n\nApnea of prematurity is common in premature babies, but mild apnea does not appear to have long-term effects. However, preventing multiple or severe episodes is better for the baby over the long-term. Apnea of prematurity most often goes away as the baby approaches their \"due date.\" In some cases, such as in infants who were born very prematurely or have severe lung disease, apnea may persist a few weeks longer.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nApnea - newborns; AOP; As and Bs; A/B/D; Blue spell - newborns; Dusky spell - newborns; Spell - newborns; Apnea - neonatal\n\n**References**\n\nAhlfeld SK.

According to RW Martin RJ, apnea of prematurity is caused by a combination of factors including immaturity of the respiratory center, instability of the respiratory control system, and mechanical factors such as lung volume and chest wall compliance.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recent Research and Findings**\n\nIn recent years, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of apnea of prematurity. A study by Mitchell LJ et al found that apnea of prematurity is associated with an increased risk of respiratory complications and mortality. Another study by Patrinos ME found that neonatal apnea is related to the foundation of respiratory control.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Expert Insights**\n\nLeading experts in the field have shared their insights on apnea of prematurity. Martin RJ notes that apnea of prematurity is a multifactorial condition that requires a comprehensive approach to treatment and management. Ahlfeld SK emphasizes the importance of early recognition and intervention to prevent long-term consequences.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about apnea of prematurity, you may also want to explore related health topics such as premature babies and sleep apnea.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Review Date: 1/18/2023**\n\nThis article was last reviewed on January 18, 2023, by Mary J.

It is the primary apolipoprotein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.\n\n**Importance in Heart Disease**\n\nElevated levels of apoB have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. Studies have shown that individuals with high apoB levels are more likely to develop atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\n**Measurement and Significance**\n\nApoB can be measured through blood tests, providing valuable information about an individual's lipid profile. Research has demonstrated that apoB is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol alone. This is because apoB measures not only the amount of LDL cholesterol but also other lipoproteins, such as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL).\n\n**Clinical Significance**\n\nUnderstanding apoB levels can help healthcare providers identify individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease. Targeting apoB reduction through lifestyle modifications or pharmacological interventions may be an effective strategy for preventing or managing heart disease.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bredefeld CL, Lau R, Hussain MM.

    "content": "**Apomorphine Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nApomorphine injection is used to treat \"off\" episodes (times of difficulty moving, walking, and speaking that may happen as medication wears off or at random) in people with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) who are taking other medications for their condition.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nApomorphine comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). Apomorphine is usually injected when needed, according to your doctor's directions. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nUse apomorphine injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not use a second dose of apomorphine injection for treatment of the same \"off\" episode. Wait at least 2 hours between doses.\n\nYour doctor will give you another medication called trimethobenzamide (Tigan) to take when you begin to use apomorphine injection. This medication will help decrease your chance of developing nausea and vomiting while you are using apomorphine injection, especially during the beginning of treatment.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBe careful not to get apomorphine injection on your skin or in your eyes. If apomorphine injection does get on your skin or in your eyes, immediately wash your skin or flush your eyes with cold water.\n\nYou can inject apomorphine in your stomach area, upper arm, or upper leg. Do not inject into a vein or in an area where the skin is sore, red, bruised, scarred, infected, or abnormal in any way. Use a different spot for each injection, choosing from among the spots you have been told to use.\n\nAlways look at your apomorphine solution before you inject it. It should be clear, colorless, and free of particles. Do not use apomorphine if it is cloudy, green, contains particles, or if the expiration date on the carton has passed.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nAsk your doctor what to do if you do not use apomorphine injection for longer than 1 week. Your doctor will probably tell you to restart this medication using a low dose and gradually increase your dose.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nYou may experience nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, and falls while taking apomorphine injection. However, do not stop taking trimethobenzamide without first talking to your doctor.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nApomorphine solution comes in a glass cartridge to use with an injector pen. Some needles are provided with your pen and additional needles are sold separately. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of needle you need.\n\nAlways use a new, sterile needle for each injection. Never reuse needles, and never let a needle touch any surface except the place where you will inject the medicine. Never store or carry the injector pen with a needle attached. Discard used needles in a puncture-resistant container kept out of reach of children.\n\nYou can clean your apomorphine injector pen with a damp cloth as needed. Never use strong disinfectants or wash your pen under running water.\n\nKeep a record of how much apomorphine injection you use each time you receive an injection so that you will know when to replace the medication cartridge.\n\n---\n\n**Apomorphine Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n*   Taking trimethobenzamide along with apomorphine injection may increase your risk of drowsiness, dizziness, and falls.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nSome medications should not be used with apomorphine injection. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when receiving apomorphine injection. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting apomorphine injection with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while receiving apomorphine injection, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nTell your doctor if you drink alcohol or if you have or have ever had asthma; dizziness; fainting spells; a slow or irregular heartbeat; low blood pressure; low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood; mental illness; a sleep disorder; a stroke, mini-stroke, or other brain problems; sudden uncontrolled movements and falls; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using apomorphine injection, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using apomorphine injection.\n\nYou should know that apomorphine injection may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything that might put you at risk of getting hurt until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nYou should know that you may suddenly fall asleep during your regular daily activities while you are using apomorphine injection. You may not feel drowsy before you fall asleep. If you suddenly fall asleep while you are doing an everyday activity such as eating, talking, or watching television, call your doctor. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you talk to your doctor.\n\nYou should not drink alcohol while you are using apomorphine injection. Alcohol can make the side effects from apomorphine injection worse.\n\nYou should know that some people who took medications such as apomorphine injection developed gambling problems or other intense urges or behaviors that were compulsive or unusual for them, such as increased sexual urges or behaviors. There is not enough information to tell whether the people developed these problems because they took the medication or for other reasons.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a620044.html",
    "content": "**Apomorphine Sublingual**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nApomorphine sublingual is used to treat \"off\" episodes (times of difficulty moving, walking, and speaking that may happen as medication wears off or at random) in people with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance). Apomorphine is in a class of medications called dopamine agonists. It works by acting in place of dopamine, a natural substance produced in the brain that is needed to control movement.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nApomorphine comes as a sublingual film to take under the tongue. Apomorphine sublingual is usually used when needed, according to your doctor's directions. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use apomorphine sublingual exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not use a second dose of apomorphine sublingual for treatment of the same \"off\" episode. Wait at least 2 hours between doses and do not use more than 5 doses a day.\n\nYour doctor will give you another medication called trimethobenzamide to take when you begin to use apomorphine sublingual. This medication will help decrease your chance of developing nausea and vomiting while you are using apomorphine, especially during the beginning of treatment. Your doctor will probably tell you to begin taking trimethobenzamide 3 days before you begin to use apomorphine, and to continue taking it for up to 2 months.\n\nTo use apomorphine sublingual film, follow these steps:\n\n1. Drink water to moisten your mouth.\n2. Open the pouch using the wing tabs. Make sure to place your fingers directly on the raised dots on each wing tab. Gently pull the wing tabs apart to open the pouch.\n3. Hold apomorphine sublingual film between your fingers by the outside edges and remove the entire film from the pouch.\n4. Place entire sublingual film under your tongue as far back under your tongue as you can.\n5. Leave the film in place until it dissolves completely. It may take 3 minutes for the film to dissolve.\n6. Do not chew or swallow the film. Do not swallow your saliva or talk as the film dissolves.\n7. Open your mouth to see if the film has completely dissolved.\n8. After the sublingual film has completely dissolved, you may swallow again.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou will receive your first dose of apomorphine in a medical office where your doctor can closely monitor your condition to determine your dose. After that, your doctor will tell you to use apomorphine sublingual at home and to monitor for adverse effects.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nApomorphine sublingual may cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, sleepiness, and falls. However, these side effects are usually temporary and will go away once you get used to the medication. If you experience any of these side effects, talk to your doctor.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of apomorphine sublingual, wait at least 2 hours before taking another dose. Do not use more than 5 doses a day.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no special dietary instructions for using apomorphine sublingual. However, it is always best to eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated while taking any medication.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore apomorphine sublingual in its original packaging at room temperature (68°F to 77°F). Keep the medication away from children and pets. Do not dispose of the medication by flushing it down the toilet or pouring it into a drain.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much apomorphine sublingual, you may experience severe side effects such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, sleepiness, and falls. If you experience any of these side effects, call your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nApomorphine sublingual is a prescription medication that requires a doctor's supervision to ensure safe and effective use. Do not share the medication with anyone else, and do not take it if you are allergic to apomorphine or any of its ingredients. If you have any questions or concerns about using apomorphine sublingual, talk to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Apomorphine Sublingual: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**How to Use Apomorphine Sublingual**\n\n*   Do not swallow your saliva or talk as the film dissolves.\n*   Open your mouth to see if the film has completely dissolved.\n*   After the sublingual film has completely dissolved, you may swallow again.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n*   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n*   Apomorphine comes as a sublingual film to take under the tongue.

    "content": "**Appendicitis Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Appendicitis Tests?**\n\nAppendicitis is an inflammation (swelling) or infection of your appendix. Your appendix is a small finger-like pouch attached to your large intestine. It's located in the lower right side of your abdomen (belly).\n\nThe cause of appendicitis isn't always clear. Your appendix may become inflamed or infected if something blocks the opening where it attaches to your intestine. If appendicitis isn't treated promptly, your appendix can burst and spread bacteria in your abdomen. This can lead to a life-threatening bacterial infection. A burst appendix can also cause a pus-filled infection in your appendix called an abscess.\n\nAppendicitis typically causes abdominal (belly) pain in your right side. But some people may have different symptoms because their appendix isn't in the usual place. This can make appendicitis hard to diagnose. Appendicitis tests help your health care provider make an accurate diagnosis quickly so you can get proper care.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Appendicitis Tests May Include:**\n\n*   Blood tests to look for signs of infection and inflammation that may mean you have appendicitis.\n*   A urine (pee) test to rule out a urinary tract infection and/or a kidney stone. These conditions can cause symptoms similar to appendicitis.\n*   Imaging tests to take pictures of your appendix. If your symptoms and other tests suggest that you have appendicitis, imaging tests can confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are They Used For?**\n\nAppendicitis tests are used to confirm or rule out a problem with the appendix in people who have appendicitis symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why Do I Need Appendicitis Testing?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have abdominal (belly) pain that usually:\n\n*   Starts near your belly button and moves lower and to your right\n*   Hurts more when you move, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze\n*   Gets worse within hours\n\nIf you have any severe abdominal pain, it's important to get medical help as soon as possible.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Along With Pain, Other Appendicitis Symptoms Include:**\n\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Fever\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Swelling in your abdomen\n*   Diarrhea or constipation\n*   Problems passing gas\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During Appendicitis Testing?**\n\nBefore ordering appendicitis tests, your provider will ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. You'll also have an exam. If your provider thinks you could have appendicitis, you may have one or more tests to help confirm or rule out the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Blood Tests Can Help Find Out If You Have An Infection Or Inflammation In Your Body, But These Tests Can't Show Whether Appendicitis Is The Cause.**\n\nTo collect a blood sample, a health care professional will insert a small needle into a vein in your arm to collect a small amount of blood into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Urine Tests Can Help Rule Out A Urinary Tract Conditions That Could Be Causing Your Symptoms.**\n\nTo collect your urine sample, a health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Imaging Tests Check To See If Your Appendix Looks Normal. These Tests Can Confirm Whether You Have Appendicitis. They Include:**\n\n*   CT scan (computed tomography scan). A CT scan is the most accurate imaging test for diagnosing appendicitis.\n*   An ultrasound makes pictures using sound waves.\n*   An MRI scan makes pictures using magnets and a computer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I Need To Do Anything To Prepare For The Tests?**\n\nBlood and urine tests don't require any special preparations.\n\nFor imaging tests, you may have to stop eating and drinking for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you how to prepare.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Any Risks To The Tests?**\n\nA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly.\n\nA urine test has no risk.\n\nImaging tests are safe. If your test includes contrast dye, there's a small chance you could have an allergic reaction to it. Reactions can often be managed with medicine.\n\nCT scans are generally safe. They do use x-rays which are a form of radiation. The small amount of radiation in a CT scan is not considered harmful to most adults. But exposure to radiation can slightly increase the risk of developing cancer later in life. Children and unborn babies are more sensitive to radiation than adults because their bodies are still growing.\n\nIf you're concerned about radiation exposure for yourself, your unborn baby, or your child, ask about other imaging tests to diagnose appendicitis. If your child needs a CT scan, ask if the machine will be adjusted to use the lowest amount of radiation possible.\n\nAn ultrasound has no risk.\n\nMRI scans are generally very safe. But if you have certain metals and/or implanted medical devices in your body, ask your provider if you can have an MRI.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Do The Results Mean?**\n\nTo confirm or rule out appendicitis, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of your exam and appendicitis tests.\n\n---\n\n**Appendicitis Tests**\n\n\\n\\nIf your provider diagnoses appendicitis, you'll usually have surgery to remove your appendix as soon as possible before it can burst. If your appendix has already burst, you must have surgery right away. The surgeon will remove your appendix and clean the infection from your abdomen.\n\n\\n\\n**What are Appendicitis Tests?**\n\nAppendicitis tests help your health care provider make an accurate diagnosis quickly so you can get proper care. They may include:\n\n*   Blood tests to look for signs of infection and inflammation that may mean you have appendicitis.\n*   A urine (pee) test to rule out a urinary tract infection and/or a kidney stone.\n*   Imaging tests to take pictures of your appendix.\n\n\\n\\n**Why Do I Need Appendicitis Testing?**\n\nYou may need testing if you have abdominal (belly) pain that usually:\n\n*   Starts near your belly button and moves lower and to your right\n*   Hurts more when you move, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze\n*   Gets worse within hours\n\nIf you have any severe abdominal pain, it's important to get medical help as soon as possible.\n\n\\n\\n**Along With Pain, Other Appendicitis Symptoms Include:**\n\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Fever\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Swelling in your abdomen\n*   Diarrhea or constipation\n*   Problems passing gas\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens During Appendicitis Testing?**\n\nBefore ordering appendicitis tests, your provider will ask questions about your symptoms and medical history.

It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample.\n\n\\n\\n**Imaging Tests:**\n\nThese tests can confirm whether you have appendicitis. They include:\n\n*   CT scan (computed tomography scan)\n*   Ultrasound\n*   MRI scan\n\n---\n\n**Appendicitis Tests**\n\nIf there's a chance you could be pregnant, you will likely have a pregnancy test to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which can cause pain similar to appendicitis. It's also important to know whether you're pregnant before having a CT scan. That's because the x-rays could harm an unborn baby. A pregnancy test may be done with a blood or a urine test.\n\n**Preparing for Tests**\n\nYou may have trouble being in closed-in spaces, talk with your provider about options that may make you more comfortable. You may be given earplugs or headphones to help block loud sounds from the scanner.\n\nBlood and urine tests don't require any special preparations. For imaging tests, you may have to stop eating and drinking for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you how to prepare.\n\n**Risks of Tests**\n\nA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but it usually goes away quickly. A urine test has no risk. Imaging tests are safe, but if your test includes contrast dye, there's a small chance you could have an allergic reaction to it.\n\nCT scans are generally safe, but they do use x-rays which are a form of radiation.

MRI scans are generally very safe, but if you have certain metals and/or implanted medical devices in your body, ask your provider if you can have an MRI.\n\n**Interpreting Results**\n\nTo confirm or rule out appendicitis, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of your exam and appendicitis tests. Blood test results may show a high white blood cell count or a high level of c-reactive protein (CRP), which could indicate an infection or inflammation in your body.\n\nUrine test results may show a high level of white blood cells or bacteria, indicating a urinary tract infection, or blood, crystals, or high levels of certain minerals, indicating kidney stones. Imaging test results may show that your appendix is blocked, larger than normal, burst, or has an abscess, which would indicate appendicitis.\n\nIf your provider diagnoses appendicitis, you'll usually have surgery to remove your appendix as soon as possible before it can burst. If your appendix has already burst, you must have surgery right away. The surgeon will remove your appendix and clean the infection from your abdomen.\n\n---\n\n**Appendicitis Tests**\n\nIf you suspect you have appendicitis, don't wait to see a doctor. Go to the emergency room right away. The surgeon will remove your appendix and clean the infection from your abdomen.\n\n**Learning More About Laboratory Tests**\n\nWant to learn more about laboratory tests?

    "content": "**Appendicitis**\n\n**What is Appendicitis?**\n\nAppendicitis is a medical condition where the appendix, a small tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine, becomes inflamed due to a blockage.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nThe blockage inside the appendix causes increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If left untreated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen, causing peritonitis. The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side, which usually starts suddenly and worsens over time.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Swelling in the abdomen\n* Loss of appetite\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Constipation or diarrhea\n* Inability to pass gas\n* Low fever\n\nNot everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.\n\n**Treatment and Diagnosis**\n\nAppendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. The standard treatment involves removing the appendix, usually through surgery. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, appendicitis affects people of all ages, but it is most common among young adults.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nFor personalized advice and treatment, consult a healthcare professional or find an expert in the field of gastroenterology.\n\n---\n\n**Appendicitis**\n\nAnyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   Abdominal and Pelvic CT (Computed Tomography) - [American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America](http://www.acr.org/)\n*   Abdominal exploration - series - [Medical Encyclopedia](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n*   Abdominal Pain (Stomach Pain), Short-Term - [American Academy of Family Physicians](http://familydoctor.org/)\n*   Abdominal Ultrasound - [American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America](http://www.acr.org/)\n*   Appendicitis Tests - [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   Appendectomy - series - [Medical Encyclopedia](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n*   Treating Appendicitis: Comparing Surgery with Antibiotic Treatment - [Nemours Foundation](http://kidshealth.org/)\n*   Statistics and Research\n    *   Appendix Pain: Preventing Appendicitis Complications - [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/)\n*   Clinical Trials\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov: Appendicitis - [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/)\n*   Journal Articles\n    *   References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed - [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/)\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n\n**Children**\n\n*   Appendectomy (Laparoscopic) - [Nemours Foundation](http://kidshealth.org/)\n*   Pediatric Abdominal Ultrasound - [American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America](http://www.acr.org/)\n\n**Teenagers**\n\nAppendicitis in Teens - [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://aap.org/)\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   Appendectomy - [Medical Encyclopedia](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)\n*   Appendicitis - [Medical Encyclopedia](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html)",

The medical term for a loss of appetite is anorexia.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAny illness can reduce appetite. If the illness is treatable, the appetite should return when the condition is cured.\n\nLoss of appetite can cause weight loss.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA decreased appetite is often seen in older adults. Often, no physical cause is found. Emotions such as sadness, depression, or grief can lead to a loss of appetite.\n\nCancer can also cause decreased appetite. You may lose weight without trying. Cancers that may cause you to lose your appetite include:\n\n* Colon cancer\n* Ovarian cancer\n* Stomach cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n\nOther causes of decreased appetite include:\n\n* Chronic liver disease\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Dementia\n* Heart failure\n* Hepatitis\n* HIV\n* Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n* Pregnancy (first trimester)\n* Use of certain medicines, including antibiotics, chemotherapy medicines, codeine, and morphine\n* Use of street drugs, including amphetamines (speed), cocaine, and heroin\n\n**Home Care**\n\nPeople with cancer or a chronic illness that causes weight loss need to increase their protein and calorie intake by eating high-calorie, nutritious snacks or several small meals during the day. Liquid protein drinks may be helpful.\n\nFamily members should try to supply favorite foods to help stimulate the person's appetite.\n\nKeep a record of what you eat and drink for 24 or more hours. This is called a diet history.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you lose more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (kg) without trying.\n\nSeek medical help if decreased appetite occurs along with other signs of depression, prescription medicine, illegal drug or alcohol use, or an eating disorder.\n\nFor loss of appetite caused by medicines, ask your provider about changing the dosage or medicine. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and will check your height and weight.\n\nYou'll be asked about diet and medical history. Questions may include:\n\n* Is the decreased appetite severe or mild?\n* Have you lost any weight? How much?\n* Is the decreased appetite a new symptom?\n* If so, did it start after an upsetting event, such as the death of a family member or friend?\n* What other symptoms are present?\n\nTests that may be done include imaging tests, such as x-ray or ultrasound. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered.\n\nIn cases of severe malnutrition, nutrients are given through a vein (intravenously). This may require a hospital stay.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLoss of appetite; Decreased appetite; Anorexia\n\n**References**\n\nMason JB.

For example, it may be due to a mental condition or a problem with an endocrine gland.\n\nAn increased appetite can come and go (intermittent), or it can last for long periods of time (persistent). This will depend on the cause. It does not always result in weight gain.\n\nThe terms \"hyperphagia\" and \"polyphagia\" refer to someone who is focused only on eating, or who eats a large amount before feeling full.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCauses may include:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Certain medicines (such as corticosteroids, cyproheptadine, and tricyclic antidepressants)\n* Bulimia (most common in women 18 to 30 years old)\n* Diabetes mellitus (including gestational diabetes)\n* Graves disease\n* Hyperthyroidism\n* Hypoglycemia\n* Premenstrual syndrome\n\n**Home Care**\n\nEmotional support is recommended.

    "content": "**Apple Cider Vinegar**\n\n**What is it?**\nApple cider vinegar is the fermented juice from crushed apples. It contains acetic acid and nutrients such as B vitamins and vitamin C.\n\nIt's popularly used in salad dressings and cooking, but also been used traditionally as medicine. It might help lower blood sugar levels after a meal by changing how foods are absorbed from the gut.\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using apple cider vinegar for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Consuming apple cider vinegar in food amounts is likely safe. Apple cider vinegar is possibly safe when used as a medicine, short-term. But it is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts, long-term. Consuming large amounts of apple cider vinegar long-term might lead to problems such as low levels of potassium.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Apple cider vinegar is possibly unsafe. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin can cause chemical burns in some people.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if apple cider vinegar is safe to use as a medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.\n* Low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia): Apple cider vinegar might lower potassium levels in the blood. If your potassium is already low, apple cider vinegar might make it too low. Don't use apple cider vinegar if you have this condition.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nModerate\n\nBe cautious with this combination:\n\n* Digoxin (Lanoxin): Large amounts of apple cider vinegar may decrease potassium levels in the body. Low potassium levels can increase the side effects of digoxin.\n* Insulin: Insulin might decrease potassium levels in the body. Large amounts of apple cider vinegar might also decrease potassium levels in the body. Taking apple cider vinegar along with insulin might cause potassium levels in the body to be too low.\n* Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs): Apple cider vinegar might lower blood sugar levels. Taking apple cider vinegar along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n* Water pills (Diuretic drugs): Apple cider vinegar can decrease potassium levels. \"Water pills\" can also decrease potassium levels. Taking apple cider vinegar along with \"water pills\" might make potassium levels drop too low.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\nHerbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar\n\n* Apple cider vinegar might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n\nHerbs that contain cardiac glycosides\n\n* Apple cider vinegar can lower potassium levels. Some herbs contain cardiac glycosides, which can affect the heart. Using apple cider vinegar along with herbs that contain cardiac glycosides can increase the risk of serious side effects from low potassium levels. Examples of supplements that contain cardiac glycosides include black hellebore, foxglove, lily-of-the-valley, oleander, and pleurisy root.\n\n* Horsetail: Using apple cider vinegar along with horsetail could increase the chance that potassium levels might drop too low.\n* Licorice: Using apple cider vinegar along with licorice could increase the chance that potassium levels might drop too low.\n* Stimulant laxative herbs: Apple cider vinegar can lower potassium levels. Stimulant laxatives can cause diarrhea and also decrease potassium levels. Taking apple cider vinegar with stimulant laxative herbs might cause potassium levels to go too low.\n\n---\n\n**Apple Cider Vinegar: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Herbs that Contain Cardiac Glycosides**\n\n*   Apple cider vinegar can lower potassium levels.\n*   Some herbs contain cardiac glycosides, which can affect the heart.\n*   Using apple cider vinegar along with herbs that contain cardiac glycosides can increase the risk of serious side effects from low potassium levels.\n*   Examples of supplements that contain cardiac glycosides include black hellebore, foxglove, lily-of-the-valley, oleander, and pleurisy root.\n\n**Other Interactions**\n\n*   **Horsetail**: Using apple cider vinegar along with horsetail could increase the chance that potassium levels might drop too low.\n*   **Licorice**: Using apple cider vinegar along with licorice could increase the chance that potassium levels might drop too low.\n*   **Stimulant Laxative Herbs**: Apple cider vinegar can lower potassium levels.

In the US, there's no specific definition of what a product must contain to be called apple cider vinegar. Sometimes it's standardized to acidity, with concentrations ranging from 4% to 8%. But the amount of each component of apple cider vinegar may vary from product to product.\n\nWhen used as medicine, there isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of apple cider vinegar might be.

    "content": "**Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA)**\n\nGestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb.\n\nIf the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA).\n\n**Benefits of AGA**\n\nAGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their gestational age.\n\n**Understanding Gestational Age**\n\nGestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.\n\n**Determining Gestational Age**\n\nGestational age can be determined before or after birth.\n\nBefore birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb.\n\nAfter birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby. Weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the status of the skin and hair are assessed.\n\n**Graphs of Normal Limits**\n\nGraphs are available showing the upper and lower normal limits for different gestational ages, from around 25 weeks of gestation through 42 weeks.\n\n**Weight Range for Full-Term Infants**\n\nThe weight for full-term infants that are born AGA will most often be between 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds [lbs] or 2.5 kilograms [kg]) and 4,000 grams (about 8.8 lbs or 4 kg).\n\n**Definitions of Small and Large for Gestational Age**\n\nInfants weighing less are considered small for gestational age (SGA)\nInfants weighing more are considered large for gestational age (LGA)\n\n---\n\n**Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA)**\n\n**What is gestational age?**\n\nGestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is.

When apraxia develops in a person who was previously able to perform the tasks or abilities, it is called acquired apraxia.\n\nThe most common causes of acquired apraxia are:\n\n*   Brain tumor\n*   Condition that causes gradual worsening of the brain and nervous system (neurodegenerative illness)\n*   Dementia\n*   Stroke\n*   Traumatic brain injury\n*   Hydrocephalus\n\nApraxia may also be seen at birth. Symptoms appear as the child grows and develops. The cause is unknown.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA person with apraxia is unable to put together the correct order of muscle movements. At times, a completely different word or action is used or occurs than the one the person intended to speak or make. The person is often aware of the mistake.\n\nSymptoms of apraxia of speech include:\n\n*   Distorted, repeated, or left out speech sounds or words\n*   Struggling to pronounce the right word\n*   More difficulty using longer words, either all the time, or sometimes\n*   Ability to use short, everyday phrases or sayings (such as \"How are you?\") without a problem\n*   Better writing ability than speaking ability\n\nOther forms of apraxia include:\n\n*   Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia: Inability to carry out movements of the face on demand, such as licking the lips, sticking out the tongue, or whistling.\n*   Ideational apraxia: Inability to carry out learned, complex tasks in the proper order, such as putting on socks before putting on shoes.\n*   Ideomotor apraxia: Inability to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects. For instance, if given a screwdriver, the person may try to write with it as if it were a pen.\n*   Limb-kinetic apraxia: Difficulty making precise movements with an arm or leg. It becomes impossible to button a shirt or tie a shoe. In gait apraxia, it becomes impossible for a person to take even a small step.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests may be done if the cause of the disorder is not known:\n\n*   CT or MRI scans of the brain may help show a tumor, stroke, or other brain injury.\n*   An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be used to check for epilepsy as a cause of the apraxia.\n*   A spinal tap may be done to check for inflammation or an infection that affects the brain.\n\nStandardized language and intellectual tests should be done if apraxia of speech is suspected. Testing for other learning disabilities may also be needed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with apraxia can benefit from treatment by a health care team. The team should also include family members.\n\nOccupational and speech therapists play an important role in helping both people with apraxia and their caregivers learn ways to deal with the disorder. Those with gait apraxia may benefit from physical therapy to reduce the risk of falls.\n\nDuring treatment, therapists will focus on:\n\n*   Repeating sounds over and over to teach mouth movements\n*   Slowing down the person's speech\n*   Teaching different techniques to help with communication\n\nRecognition and treatment of depression is important for people with apraxia.\n\nTo help with communication, family and friends should:\n\n*   Avoid giving complex directions.\n*   Use simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings.\n*   Speak in a normal tone of voice. Speech apraxia is not a hearing problem.\n*   Not assume that the person understands.\n*   Provide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition.\n\nOther tips for daily living include:\n\n*   Maintain a relaxed, calm environment.\n*   Take time to show someone with apraxia how to do a task, and allow enough time for them to do so. Do not ask them to repeat the task if they are clearly struggling with it because it will increase their frustration.\n*   Suggest other ways to do the same things. For example, buy shoes with a hook and loop closure instead of laces.\n\nIf depression or frustration is severe, mental health counseling may help.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMany people with apraxia are no longer able to be independent and may have trouble performing everyday tasks. Ask the health care provider which activities may or may not be safe. Avoid activities that may cause injury and take the proper safety measures.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHaving apraxia may lead to:\n\n*   Learning problems\n*   Low self-esteem\n*   Social problems\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact the provider if someone has difficulty performing everyday tasks or has other symptoms of apraxia after a stroke or brain injury.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nReducing your risk of stroke and brain injury may help prevent conditions that lead to apraxia.\n\n---\n\n**Apraxia**\n\nApraxia is a disorder of the brain and nervous system in which a person is unable to perform tasks or movements when asked, even though:\n\n* The request or command is understood\n* They are willing to perform the task\n* The muscles needed to perform the task work properly\n* The task may have already been learned\n\n**Causes**\n\nApraxia is caused by damage to the brain.

In some cases, however, \"spider fingers\" can be a sign of an underlying disorder.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCauses may include:\n\n* Homocystinuria\n* Marfan syndrome\n* Other rare genetic disorders\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSome children are born with arachnodactyly. It may become more evident over time. Talk to your health care provider if your child has long, slender fingers and you are concerned that an underlying condition may exist.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked questions about the medical history. This includes:\n\n* When did you first notice the fingers being shaped like this?\n* Is there any family history of early death? Is there any family history of known hereditary disorders?\n* What other symptoms are present?

    "content": "**Are You At Risk For a Heart Attack?**\n\nYou can't ignore your risk for heart disease and heart attack. Understanding what causes a heart attack is crucial in preventing it.\n\n**What Causes a Heart Attack?**\n\nA heart attack occurs when the blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. There are three main reasons for this:\n\n*   **Too much cholesterol**: Cholesterol can build up in your arteries, forming plaque that narrows or blocks the artery.\n*   **Blood clot**: A blood clot can form in one of your coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart.\n*   **Spasm in an artery**: In rare cases, a spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery can cut off the flow of blood to the heart.\n\n**Risk Factors You Can Control**\n\nWhile some risk factors are beyond your control, there are several that you can manage to lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack:\n\n*   **Not smoking**: Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your heart.\n*   **Lowering blood pressure**: If you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to get it under control through lifestyle changes or medication.\n*   **Managing cholesterol levels**: High cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease. Talk to your doctor about ways to lower your cholesterol levels.\n*   **Exercising regularly**: Regular physical activity can help lower your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n*   **Maintaining a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese increases your risk for heart disease. Aim for a healthy weight through a combination of diet and exercise.\n*   **Managing diabetes**: If you have diabetes, work with your doctor to manage your condition through lifestyle changes and medication.\n\n**Risk Factors You Can't Control**\n\nSome risk factors are beyond your control:\n\n*   **Age**: Your risk for heart disease increases as you get older.\n*   **Sex**: Men are generally at higher risk for heart attacks than women. However, a woman's risk increases after menopause.\n*   **Family history**: If your parents have heart disease, you're more likely to develop it too.\n*   **Race**: Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, American Indians, Hawaiians, and some Asian-Americans, are at higher risk for heart problems.\n\n**Stress and Heart Disease**\n\nStress can contribute to your risk of heart disease. While stress itself may not directly cause heart disease, how you respond to stress can increase your risk:\n\n*   **Overeating**: Stress can lead to overeating, which can negatively impact your heart health.\n*   **Drinking too much alcohol**: Excessive drinking can increase your risk for heart problems.\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for heart disease.\n\n**Alcohol and Heart Disease**\n\nWhile some studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may have small benefits for the heart, the risks associated with excessive drinking outweigh any potential benefits:\n\n*   **Increased blood pressure**: Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure.\n*   **Obesity**: Drinking too much can contribute to weight gain and obesity.\n*   **Breast cancer**: Excessive drinking has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Recognizing the Signs of a Heart Attack**\n\nYou shouldn't assume that everyone experiences the classic sign of a heart attack: sudden, intense chest pain. Symptoms may vary:\n\n*   **Mild chest pain**: Chest pain can be mild or feel like pressure or fullness.\n*   **Discomfort in other areas**: Discomfort or pain in one or both arms, the jaw, neck, back, or stomach can also indicate a heart attack.\n\n**Warning Signs of a Heart Attack**\n\nBe aware of these warning signs:\n\n*   **Chest pain or discomfort**\n*   **Discomfort or pain in one or both arms, the jaw, neck, back, or stomach**\n*   **Shortness of breath**\n\nBy understanding what causes a heart attack and being aware of your risk factors, you can take steps to prevent it.\n\n---\n\n**Are You At Risk For a Heart Attack?**\n\n**Warning Signs of a Heart Attack**\n\nWhile chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom, symptoms can be less obvious, and you may not know what's going on. The more symptoms you have, the more likely you are having a heart attack.\n\n* Chest pain or discomfort such as pressure, squeezing, or fullness\n* Discomfort or pain in one or both arms, the jaw, neck, back, or stomach\n* Shortness of breath\n* Cold sweats, nausea, or feeling light-headed\n\n**Women and Heart Attack Symptoms**\n\nMen and women can have all the same warning signs. However, women are more likely to have shortness of breath, back or jaw pain, nausea, or feel light-headed. These symptoms may occur without chest pressure or pain.\n\n**What to Do If You Think You're Having a Heart Attack**\n\nMinutes count during a heart attack. The sooner you get help, the less damage to your heart. Aspirin can be harmful for some people, so don't take it unless told to do so by emergency or medical personnel.\n\n* Call 911 right away\n\n**Preventing a Heart Attack**\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends the ABCs for heart attack prevention:\n\n* Avoid tobacco\n* Become more active\n* Choose good nutrition",

    "content": "**Are You Eating Enough Fruits and Vegetables?**\n\nAccording to the USDA’s guidelines for a healthy diet, half of your plate should be fruits and vegetables. Another quarter should be protein, such as meat or beans, and the final quarter should have grains, preferably whole grains.\n\nSo, how many cups of vegetables should most adults eat each day?\n\n* A: Half a cup\n* B: One to two cups\n* C: Two and a half cups\n* D: Four cups\n\nThe correct answer is **C: Two and a half cups**. For the healthiest diet, eat a variety of vegetables every week. Choose vegetables from each subgroup: dark green, red and orange, beans and peas, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables such as mushrooms and bean sprouts.\n\nHow many cups of fruit should most adults eat each day?\n\n* A: Half a cup\n* B: Two cups\n* C: Two and a half to three cups\n* D: Four cups\n\nThe correct answer is **B: Two cups**. One cup of a fruit such as diced melon, sliced bananas, or grapes; one cup fruit juice; or one-half cup dried fruit all count as one cup of fruit. For the most nutrients, enjoy a variety of fruit every week. Choose fresh, dried, frozen, and canned fruit.\n\nIt's best to buy fresh fruit and vegetables in season.\n\n* A: True\n* B: False\n\nThe correct answer is **A: True**. When available, buying fresh fruits and vegetables in season will help you get the most flavor from your produce at the lowest price. Look for fresh fruits and vegetables in your local grocery store or visit your nearest farmers market.\n\nFruits and vegetables contain which of the following nutrients?\n\n* A: Fiber\n* B: Vitamins\n* C: Minerals\n* D: All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is **D: All of the above**. Fruits and vegetables are loaded with the vitamins and minerals your body needs to stay healthy. And the fiber in fruits and vegetables helps make you feel full faster, so you don’t overeat.\n\nEating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of disease.\n\n* A: True\n* B: False\n\nThe correct answer is **A: True**. Eating a diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables may help lower your risk of some chronic diseases and certain types of cancer. In addition, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can help you maintain a healthy weight.\n\nDrinking fruit juice is just as nutritious as eating the whole fruit.\n\n* A: True\n* B: False\n\nThe correct answer is **B: False**. Fruit juice doesn’t contain the fiber that whole fruit does. And because it's concentrated, it's also higher in calories. While it’s fine to get some of your fruit from juice, try to choose whole fruit or fruit slices.\n\nCanned fruits and vegetables are not nutritious.\n\n* A: True\n* B: False\n\nThe correct answer is **B: False**. Canned fruits and vegetables are a good option when you can’t buy fresh. And they’re easy to add to any meal. Look for products that don’t have sauce or added sugar, and choose those that are low in sodium when possible.\n\n---\n\n**Are You Eating Enough Fruits and Vegetables?**\n\n\\n\\n**Myths About Fruits and Vegetables**\n\nFruit juice is just as nutritious as eating the whole fruit. **False**. Fruit juice doesn't contain the fiber that whole fruit does. And because it's concentrated, it's also higher in calories.\n\nMost servings of fruits and vegetables have fewer than 100 calories. **True**. Their low calorie count makes fruits and vegetables a perfect snack in between meals. Choose an apple for 72 calories, a cup of blueberries for 83 calories, a cup of carrots for 45 calories, or a cup of grapes for an even 100 calories.\n\n\\n\\n**Dried Fruit vs Fresh Fruit**\n\nDried fruit and fresh fruit have the same amount of calories per cup. **False**. Dried fruit is more calorie-dense than fresh fruit. For example, a cup of grapes has the same amount of calories as a half cup of raisins. When eating dried fruit, remember that a half-cup counts as a full serving.\n\n\\n\\n**Correct Answer**\n\n❯\n\n❮",
