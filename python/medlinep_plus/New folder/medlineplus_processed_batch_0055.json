If waste products build up in your body, it can be dangerous and even cause death.\n\nKidney dialysis (peritoneal dialysis and other types of dialysis) does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well. This process:\n\n* Removes extra salt, water, and waste products so they do not build up in your body\n* Keeps safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body\n* Helps control blood pressure\n* Helps produce red blood cells\n\n**What is Peritoneal Dialysis?**\n\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) removes waste and extra fluid through the blood vessels that line the walls of your abdomen. A membrane called the peritoneum covers the walls of your abdomen.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\nPD involves putting a soft, hollow tube (catheter) into your abdominal cavity and filling it with a cleansing fluid (dialysis solution). The solution contains a type of sugar that draws out waste and extra fluid. The waste and fluid passes from your blood vessels through the peritoneum and into the solution. After a set amount of time, the solution and waste is drained and thrown away.\n\n**Types of Peritoneal Dialysis**\n\nThere are 2 types of PD:\n\n* **Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)**: For this method, you fill your abdomen with fluid, then go about your daily routine until it is time to drain the fluid. You are not hooked up to anything during the dwell period, and you do not need a machine. You use gravity to drain the fluid.\n* **Continuous Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD)**: With CCPD, you are connected to a machine that cycles through 3 to 5 exchanges at night while you sleep.\n\n**When to Start Dialysis**\n\nKidney failure is the last stage of long-term (chronic) kidney disease. This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. Your doctor will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. In most cases, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a risk for infection of the peritoneum (peritonitis) or the catheter site with PD. Your provider will show you how to clean and care for your catheter and prevent infection.\n\n---\n\n**Dialysis - Peritoneal**\n\n**What is Dialysis?**\n\nDialysis treats end-stage kidney failure by removing harmful substances from the blood when the kidneys cannot.\n\n**Peritoneal Dialysis**\n\nThis article focuses on peritoneal dialysis, a type of dialysis that removes waste and extra fluid through the blood vessels that line the walls of your abdomen.\n\n**How Peritoneal Dialysis Works**\n\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) involves putting a soft, hollow tube (catheter) into your abdominal cavity and filling it with a cleansing fluid (dialysis solution).

After a set amount of time, the solution and waste is drained and thrown away.\n\n**The Process of Filling and Draining**\n\nThe process of filling and draining your abdomen is called an exchange. The length of time the cleansing fluid remains in your body is called the dwell time. The number of exchanges and amount of dwell time depends on the method of PD you use and other factors.\n\n**Surgery to Place the Catheter**\n\nYour doctor will perform surgery to place the catheter in your abdomen where it will stay. It is most often near your belly button.\n\n**Independence with Peritoneal Dialysis**\n\nPD may be a good option if you want more independence and are able to learn to treat yourself. You will have a lot to learn and need to be responsible for your care. You and your caregivers must learn how to:\n\n* Perform PD as prescribed\n* Use the equipment\n* Buy and keep track of supplies\n* Prevent infection\n\n**Types of Peritoneal Dialysis**\n\nThere are two types of PD:\n\n* Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).

In PD, a special solution is put into your belly through a tube inserted through your skin. The solution helps remove waste products from your blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does peritoneal dialysis work?**\n\nIn PD, the solution in your belly absorbs waste products from your blood and removes them from your body. This process is called diffusion. The solution is then drained out of your belly and replaced with fresh solution. This cycle is repeated several times a day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of peritoneal dialysis?**\n\nPD has several benefits, including:\n\n*   It can be done at home, which allows for more flexibility and independence.\n*   It can help slow down the progression of kidney disease.\n*   It can improve the quality of life for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the risks of peritoneal dialysis?**\n\nWhile PD is generally safe, there are some risks to consider:\n\n*   Infection: As with any medical procedure, there is a risk of infection with PD.\n*   Perforation: The tube inserted through your skin can cause a perforation in your belly.\n*   Adhesions: The solution used in PD can cause adhesions in your belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who should consider peritoneal dialysis?**\n\nPD may be an option for people with ESRD who:\n\n*   Have a functioning kidney that can help filter their blood.\n*   Are able to perform the PD procedure at home.\n*   Have a support system to help them manage their treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is peritoneal dialysis performed?**\n\nPD involves several steps, including:\n\n1.  Insertion of a tube through your skin into your belly.\n2.  Placement of a catheter in your belly to allow for the exchange of solution.\n3.  Exchange of solution in your belly with fresh solution.\n4.  Draining of waste products from your blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the different types of peritoneal dialysis?**\n\nThere are two main types of PD:\n\n*   Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD): This type of PD involves exchanging solution in your belly several times a day while you are awake.\n*   Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD): This type of PD involves using a machine to exchange solution in your belly while you sleep.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How can I learn more about peritoneal dialysis?**\n\nIf you are considering PD, it is essential to talk to your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of this treatment. You can also:\n\n*   Read books and articles about PD.\n*   Join a support group for people with ESRD.\n*   Attend educational seminars about PD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   ehrota R, Saxena AB.

    "content": "**Dialysis Centers - What to Expect**\n\nIf you need dialysis for kidney disease, you have a few options for how to receive treatment. Many people have dialysis in a treatment center. This article focuses on hemodialysis at a treatment center.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\n* You may have treatment in a hospital or in a separate dialysis center.\n* You will have about 3 treatments a week.\n* Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\n* You will have set appointments for your treatments.\n\nIt is important not to miss or skip any dialysis sessions. Be sure you arrive on time. Many centers have busy schedules. So you may not be able to make up the time if you are late.\n\n**The Dialysis Process**\n\nDuring dialysis, your blood will flow through a special filter that removes waste and excess fluid. The filter is sometimes called an artificial kidney.\n\nOnce you arrive at the center, trained health care providers will take charge of you.\n\n* Your access area will be washed, and you will be weighed.\n* Then you will be taken to a comfortable chair where you'll sit during treatment.\n* Your provider will check your blood pressure, temperature, breathing, heart rate, and pulse.\n* Needles will be placed in your access area to allow blood to flow in and out. This may be uncomfortable at first. If needed, your provider can apply a cream to numb the area.\n* The needles are attached to a tube that connects to the dialysis machine. Your blood will flow through the tube, into the filter, and back into your body.\n\nThe same site is used every time, and over time, a small tunnel will form in the skin. This is called a buttonhole, and it is like the hole that forms in a pierced ear. Once this forms, you will not notice the needles as much.\n\nYour session will last 3 to 4 hours. During this time your provider will monitor your blood pressure and the dialysis machine.\n\nDuring treatment, you can read, use a laptop, nap, watch TV, or chat with providers and other people getting dialysis.\n\nOnce your session is over, your provider will remove the needles and put a dressing on your access area.\n\nYou will probably feel tired after your sessions.\n\n**Common Side Effects**\n\nDuring your first sessions, you may have some nausea, cramping, dizziness, and headaches. This may go away after a few sessions, but be sure to tell your providers if you feel unwell. Your providers may be able to adjust your treatment to help you feel more comfortable.\n\nHaving too much fluid in your body that needs to be removed can cause symptoms. This is why you should follow a strict kidney dialysis diet. Your provider will go over this with you.\n\n**How Long Your Dialysis Session Lasts**\n\n* How well your kidneys work\n* How much waste needs to be removed\n* How much water weight you have gained\n* Your size\n* The type of dialysis machine used\n\n**Between Sessions**\n\nGetting dialysis does take a lot of time, and it will take some getting used to. Between sessions, you can still go about your daily routine.\n\nGetting kidney dialysis does not have to keep you from traveling or working. There are many dialysis centers across the United States and in many other countries. If you plan to travel, you will need to make appointments ahead of time.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you notice:\n\n* Bleeding from your vascular access site\n* Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site\n* A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)\n* The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold\n* Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak\n\nAlso, contact your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:\n\n* Itching\n* Trouble sleeping\n* Diarrhea or constipation\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\n\n---\n\n**What to Expect from Dialysis**\n\nYou may have treatment in a hospital or in a separate dialysis center.\n\n* You will have about 3 treatments a week.\n* Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\n* You will have set appointments for your treatments.\n\nIt is important not to miss or skip any dialysis sessions.

This is why you should follow a strict kidney dialysis diet. Your provider will go over this with you.\n* How long your dialysis session lasts depends on:\n\t+ How well your kidneys work\n\t+ How much waste needs to be removed\n\t+ How much water weight you have gained\n\t+ Your size\n\t+ The type of dialysis machine used\n\n---\n\n**Dialysis Centers - What to Expect**\n\n**Part 3/4**\n\nYou can expect to spend around 2-5 hours per session on a dialysis machine, which is usually located in a hospital or separate dialysis center. It's essential not to miss or skip any dialysis sessions, as missing one treatment can lead to severe complications.\n\nDuring your first few sessions, you may experience some discomfort, such as nausea, cramping, dizziness, and headaches. However, these symptoms should subside after a few treatments. Be sure to inform your healthcare providers if you feel unwell, as they may be able to adjust your treatment to make you more comfortable.\n\n**Between Sessions**\n\nGetting dialysis does take a lot of time, and it will take some getting used to. Between sessions, you can still go about your daily routine. You don't have to let kidney dialysis keep you from traveling or working. There are many dialysis centers across the United States and in other countries, so if you plan to travel, make sure to schedule appointments ahead of time.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you notice:\n\n* Bleeding from your vascular access site\n* Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site\n* A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)\n* The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold\n* Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak\n\nAlso, contact your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:\n\n* Itching\n* Trouble sleeping\n* Diarrhea or constipation\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\n\n---\n\n**What to Expect at a Dialysis Center**\n\nIf you're about to start dialysis, you might be wondering what to expect. Well, let me tell you - it's not as scary as it sounds.\n\nFirst of all, you'll need to find a dialysis center near you. These centers are equipped with the necessary machinery and staffed by trained professionals who will guide you through the process.\n\nOnce you arrive at the center, you'll typically start by meeting with a nurse or doctor to discuss your treatment plan. They'll go over the details of your dialysis schedule, including the frequency and duration of your treatments.\n\nNext, you'll get ready for your treatment by lying down on an examination table. A vascular access device (VAD) will be inserted into one of your veins, usually in your arm. This is where the dialysate solution will flow in and out of your body during treatment.\n\nDuring treatment, you can expect to spend around 3-4 hours at the center, although this may vary depending on your individual needs. You'll be closely monitored by the staff, who will check your vital signs, blood pressure, and other important metrics.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that dialysis can be a bit uncomfortable at times. You might feel some pain or discomfort during the treatment, especially if you have a vascular access device inserted. But don't worry - the staff will do their best to make you as comfortable as possible.\n\nAfter your treatment, you'll need to rest for a while and avoid strenuous activities. This is because dialysis can leave you feeling a bit drained, both physically and emotionally.\n\nOverall, going to a dialysis center can seem intimidating at first, but it's really not that bad. With the right mindset and support, you can navigate this process with ease.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n* Dialysis\n* Dialysis",

People with this condition often also have physical abnormalities affecting various parts of the body._\n\n*The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. The resulting shortage of red blood cells (anemia) usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor).*\n\n_People with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing a bone marrow cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, and other cancers._\n\n_Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities. They may have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and a low frontal hairline, along with distinctive facial features such as wide-set eyes (hypertelorism); droopy eyelids (ptosis); a broad, flat bridge of the nose; small, low-set ears; and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Affected individuals may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip). They may have a short, webbed neck; shoulder blades that are smaller and higher than usual; and abnormalities of their hands, most commonly malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature._\n\n_Other features of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may include eye problems such as clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma), or eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Affected individuals may also have kidney abnormalities; structural defects of the heart; and, in males, the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias)._\n\n---\n\n**Diamond-Blackfan Anemia**\n\n**What is Diamond-Blackfan anemia?**\n\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder that primarily affects the bone marrow.

In Diamond-Blackfan anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues.\n* Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor).\n* Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities, including:\n\t+ An unusually small head size (microcephaly)\n\t+ A low frontal hairline\n\t+ Distinctive facial features such as wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), droopy eyelids (ptosis), a broad, flat bridge of the nose, small, low-set ears, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia)\n\t+ An opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip)\n\t+ A short, webbed neck\n\t+ Shoulder blades that are smaller and higher than usual\n\t+ Abnormalities of their hands, most commonly malformed or absent thumbs\n* About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature.\n* Other features may include eye problems such as clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma), or eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).\n* Affected individuals may also have kidney abnormalities, structural defects of the heart, and, in males, the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).\n\n**Causes**\n\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia can be caused by mutations in one of many genes, including the RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A, RPS10, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, and RPS26 genes. These and other genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia provide instructions for making ribosomal proteins, which are components of cellular structures called ribosomes.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide.\n\n---\n\n**Diamond-Blackfan Anemia**\n\n*   **Causes**: Mutations in one of many genes, including RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A, RPS10, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, and RPS26.\n*   **Ribosomal Proteins**: Components of cellular structures called ribosomes. Ribosomes process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins.\n\n**Ribosome Structure**\n\n*   Each ribosome is made up of two parts (subunits) called the large and small subunits.\n*   The ribosomal proteins produced from RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A genes are among those found in the large subunit.\n*   The proteins produced from RPS10, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, and RPS26 genes are among those found in the small subunit.\n\n**Functions of Ribosomal Proteins**\n\n*   Some ribosomal proteins are involved in the assembly or stability of ribosomes.\n*   Others help carry out the ribosome's main function of building new proteins.\n*   Studies suggest that some ribosomal proteins may have other functions, such as:\n    *   Participating in chemical signaling pathways within the cell\n    *   Regulating cell division\n    *   Controlling the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis)\n\n**Genetic Mutations and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia**\n\n*   Approximately 25 percent of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have mutations in the RPS19 gene.\n*   About another 25 to 35 percent of individuals with this disorder have mutations in the RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A, RPS10, RPS17, RPS24, or RPS26 gene.\n*   Mutations in any of these genes are believed to cause problems with ribosome function.\n\n**Consequences of Ribosomal Protein Deficiencies**\n\n*   A shortage of functioning ribosomes may increase the self-destruction of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, resulting in anemia.\n*   Abnormal regulation of cell division or inappropriate triggering of apoptosis may contribute to the other health problems that affect some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.\n\n**Ongoing Research**\n\n*   Scientists are working to determine why the blood abnormalities and physical problems can vary so much between individuals.\n*   Mutations in many other genes, some of which have not been identified, account for the remaining Diamond-Blackfan anemia cases.\n\n---\n\n**Diamond-Blackfan Anemia**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nIn approximately 45 percent of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The remaining cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Normal Variations and Physical Problems**\n\nNormal variations and physical problems can vary so much between individuals.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nMutations in many other genes, some of which have not been identified, account for the remaining Diamond-Blackfan anemia cases. While mutations in genes that provide instructions for ribosomal proteins cause most cases of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, gene changes affecting proteins that interact with ribosomal proteins or that play other roles in blood-forming processes have been identified in a few individuals with this disorder.\n\n**Genes Associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia**\n\n*   GATA1\n*   RPL11\n*   RPL35A\n*   RPL5\n*   RPS10\n*   RPS17\n*   RPS19\n*   RPS24\n*   RPS26\n\n**Additional Information from NCBI Gene**\n\n*   RPL15\n*   RPL26\n*   RPL27\n*   RPL31\n*   RPL36\n*   RPS15\n*   RPS27\n*   RPS27A\n*   RPS28\n*   RPS29\n*   RPS7\n*   TSR2\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nIn approximately 45 percent of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.

It is characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The condition is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia is unknown, but it is believed to be related to mutations in the genes that control the production of ribosomal proteins. These proteins are essential for the proper functioning of cells. Individuals with a family history of the condition are at higher risk of developing it.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Shortness of breath\n* Pale skin\n* Recurring infections\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Blood smear\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Genetic testing to identify mutations in the ribosomal protein genes.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Diamond-Blackfan anemia, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may involve:\n\n* Regular blood transfusions to increase red blood cell count\n* Antibiotics to prevent infections\n* Medications to stimulate bone marrow production\n* Close monitoring of blood counts and platelet function.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia varies depending on the severity of the condition. Some individuals may experience a mild course, while others may require frequent blood transfusions and have a higher risk of complications such as infections or bleeding.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Individuals with a family history of the condition should discuss their risks with a genetic counselor.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Anemia\n* Blood Disorders\n* Bone Marrow Diseases\n* Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Diaphragmatic Hernia**\n\nA diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect in which there is an abnormal opening in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle between the chest and abdomen that helps you breathe. The abnormal opening allows part of the organs from the belly to move into the chest cavity near the lungs.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA diaphragmatic hernia is a rare defect. It occurs while the baby is developing in the womb. The diaphragm is not fully developed. Due to this, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney may take up part of the chest cavity.\n\nCDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either. It is not clear if the diaphragmatic hernia causes the underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels, or the other way around.\n\nForty percent of babies with this condition have other problems as well. Having a parent or sibling with the condition increases the risk.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSevere breathing problems usually develop shortly after the baby is born. This is due in part to poor movement of the diaphragm muscle and crowding of the lung tissue. Problems with breathing and oxygen levels are often due to underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels as well.\n\nOther symptoms include:\n\n* Bluish colored skin due to lack of oxygen\n* Rapid breathing (tachypnea)\n* Fast heart rate (tachycardia)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nFetal ultrasound may show abdominal organs in the chest cavity. The pregnant woman may have a large amount of amniotic fluid.\n\nAn exam of the infant shows:\n\n* Irregular chest movements\n* Lack of breath sounds on side with the hernia\n* Bowel sounds that are heard in the chest\n* Abdomen that looks less protuberant than a normal newborn's and feels less full when touched\n\nA chest x-ray may show abdominal organs in the chest cavity.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA diaphragmatic hernia repair requires surgery. Surgery is done to place the abdominal organs into the proper position and repair the opening in the diaphragm.\n\nThe infant will need breathing support during the recovery period. Some infants are placed on a heart/lung bypass machine to help deliver enough oxygen to the body.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of surgery depends on how well the baby's lungs have developed. It also depends on whether there are any other congenital problems. Most often the outlook is good for infants who have a sufficient amount of working lung tissue and have no other problems.\n\nMedical advances have made it possible for more than one half of infants with this condition to survive. The babies that survive will often have ongoing challenges with breathing, feeding, and growth.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Lung infections\n* Other congenital problems\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention. Couples with a family history of this problem may want to seek genetic counseling.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHernia - diaphragmatic; Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (CDH)\n\n**References**\n\nAhlfeld SK.

    "content": "**Diarrhea in Children**\n\nDiarrhea is when your child has three or more very loose bowel movements in 1 day. For many children, diarrhea is mild and will pass within a few days. For others, it may last longer. It can make your child feel weak and dehydrated. It can also lead to unhealthy weight loss.\n\n**Causes of Diarrhea**\n\nA stomach or intestinal illness is a common cause of diarrhea. It can also be a side effect of medical treatments, such as antibiotics and some cancer treatments. Many other medicines can also cause diarrhea.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nIf your child has diarrhea, here are some questions you may want to ask your doctor:\n\n* **FOODS**\n\t+ What foods can make my child's diarrhea worse? How should I prepare the foods for my child?\n\t+ If my child is still breastfeeding or bottle feeding, do I need to stop? Should I water down my child's formula?\n\t+ Can I feed my child milk, cheese, or yogurt? Can I give my child any dairy foods?\n\t+ What type of bread, crackers, or rice is best for my child?\n\t+ Can I feed my child any sweets?

You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem. It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own.\n\nDiarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Diarrhea?**\n\nThe most common causes of diarrhea include:\n\n*   Bacteria from contaminated food or water\n*   Viruses such as the flu, norovirus, or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.\n*   Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water\n*   Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium\n*   Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance.\n*   Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease\n*   Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome\n\nSome people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.\n\nSometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is at Risk for Diarrhea?**\n\nPeople of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year.\n\nPeople who visit developing countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea. It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Symptoms Might I Have with Diarrhea?**\n\nOther possible symptoms of diarrhea include:\n\n*   Cramps or pain in the abdomen\n*   An urgent need to use the bathroom\n*   Loss of bowel control\n\nIf a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools.\n\nDiarrhea can cause dehydration, which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When Do I Need to See a Health Care Provider for Diarrhea?**\n\nAlthough it is usually not harmful, diarrhea can become dangerous or signal a more serious problem. Contact your health care provider if you have:\n\n*   Signs of dehydration\n*   Diarrhea for more than 2 days, if you are an adult. For children, contact the provider if it lasts more than 24 hours.\n*   Severe pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults)\n*   A fever of 102 degrees or higher\n*   Stools containing blood or pus\n*   Stools that are black and tarry\n\nIf children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is the Cause of Diarrhea Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may:\n\n*   Do a physical exam\n*   Ask about any medicines you are taking\n*   Test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection\n*   Ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away\n\nIf you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Treatments for Diarrhea?**\n\nDiarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection.\n\nAdults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food.\n\nChildren with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Can Diarrhea be Prevented?**\n\nTwo types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses.\n\nYou can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries:\n\n*   Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth\n*   If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets\n*   Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot\n*   Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables\n\n---\n\n**Diarrhea**\n\n**What is Diarrhea?**\n\nDiarrhea is loose, watery stools (bowel movements). You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem. It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own.\n\n**Causes of Diarrhea**\n\nThe most common causes of diarrhea include:\n\n*   Viral infections\n*   Bacterial infections\n*   Food poisoning\n*   Lactose intolerance\n*   Some medications\n\nSome people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.\n\n**Symptoms of Diarrhea**\n\nOther possible symptoms of diarrhea include:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Bloody stools\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\nIf a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools.\n\n**Prevention of Diarrhea**\n\nTwo types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea.

Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Contact your health care provider if you have:\n\n*   Diarrhea that lasts more than three days\n*   Severe abdominal pain\n*   Fever above 101.5°F (38.6°C)\n*   Bloody stools\n*   Signs of dehydration, such as excessive thirst, dark yellow urine, or dizziness\n\nIf children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants.\n\n**Tests for Diarrhea**\n\nTo find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may:\n\n*   Perform a physical exam\n*   Ask about your symptoms and medical history\n*   Order laboratory tests, such as stool cultures or blood tests\n\nIf you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nWater Disinfection for Travelers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n5 Things to Know about Probiotics  (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\n\nAntidiarrheal Medicines: OTC Relief for Diarrhea (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n\nChamomile  (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nBowel Control Problems (Fecal Incontinence)  (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\n\nChronic Diarrhea: A Concern after Gallbladder Removal?

This gap can be seen as a ridge or bulge in the abdominal wall.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\n*   In infants, diastasis recti is most easily seen when the baby tries to sit up.\n*   When the infant is relaxed, you can often feel the edges of the rectus muscles.\n*   Diastasis recti is commonly seen in women who have multiple pregnancies. This is because the muscles have been stretched many times.\n*   Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy.\n*   In the later part of pregnancy, the top of the pregnant uterus can be seen bulging out of the abdominal wall.\n*   An outline of parts of the unborn baby may be seen in some severe cases.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider can diagnose this condition with a physical exam.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nNo treatment is needed for pregnant women with this condition.\n\nIn infants, diastasis recti will disappear over time. Surgery may be needed if the baby develops a hernia that becomes trapped in the space between the muscles.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn some cases, diastasis recti heals on its own.\n\nPregnancy-related diastasis recti often lasts long after the woman gives birth. Exercise may help improve the condition. Umbilical hernia may occur in some cases. Surgery is rarely performed for diastasis recti.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn general, complications only result when a hernia develops.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if a child with diastasis recti:\n\n*   Develops redness or pain in the abdomen\n*   Has vomiting that does not stop\n*   Cries all the time\n\n---\n\n**Diastasis Recti**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Diastasis Recti?**\n\nDiastasis recti is a condition where the abdominal muscles are separated, resulting in a gap or split in the muscle tissue. This can occur due to various reasons such as pregnancy, childbirth, heavy lifting, or even normal aging process.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of diastasis recti is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the following factors:\n\n*   Pregnancy: The growing uterus can put pressure on the abdominal muscles, causing them to separate.\n*   Childbirth: The process of giving birth can also lead to diastasis recti due to the increased pressure and strain on the abdominal muscles.\n*   Heavy Lifting: Engaging in heavy lifting or bending can cause the abdominal muscles to stretch and eventually separate.\n*   Normal Aging Process: As we age, our abdominal muscles naturally weaken and lose their tone, making them more susceptible to diastasis recti.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of diastasis recti may include:\n\n*   A visible gap or split in the abdominal muscle tissue\n*   Abdominal pain or discomfort\n*   Difficulty standing up straight due to the separation of the abdominal muscles\n*   Increased risk of back pain and other musculoskeletal problems\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no cure for diastasis recti, there are several treatment options available:\n\n*   Physical Therapy: Engaging in physical therapy can help strengthen the abdominal muscles and improve posture.\n*   Core Strengthening Exercises: Performing core strengthening exercises such as planks, crunches, and leg raises can help improve muscle tone and reduce the risk of diastasis recti.\n*   Lifestyle Changes: Making lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding heavy lifting, and practicing good posture can also help prevent diastasis recti.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nDiastasis recti is often related to other health topics such as:\n\n*   Common Infant and Newborn Problems\n*   Health Problems in Pregnancy",

If the person is not decontaminated before getting to the hospital, emergency room personnel will decontaminate the person and provide other treatment.\n\nThe health care providers at the hospital will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT (computerized tomography) scan of the head\n* ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)\n* Intravenous fluids (through a vein)\n* Medicines to reverse the effects of the poison\n* Tube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes)\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation) and eyes, perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople who continue to improve over the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually recover. Prolonged treatment often is needed to reverse the poisoning. This may include staying in the hospital intensive care unit and getting long-term therapy. Some effects of the poison may last for weeks or months, or even longer.\n\nKeep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children.

You may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   CT (computerized tomography) scan of the head\n*   ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)\n*   Intravenous fluids (through a vein)\n*   Medicines to reverse the effects of the poison\n*   Tube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes)\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation) and eyes, perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople who continue to improve over the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually recover. Prolonged treatment often is needed to reverse the poisoning. This may include staying in the hospital intensive care unit and getting long-term therapy. Some effects of the poison may last for weeks or months, or even longer.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nKeep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk of poisoning and overdose.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Bazinon poisoning\n*   Diazol poisoning\n*   Gardentox poisoning\n*   Knox-Out poisoning\n*   Spectracide poisoning\n\n**References**\n\n*   Tekulve K, Tormoehlen LM, Walsh L.

If the victim has collapsed or is having seizures, do not try to give them anything to drink. Instead, call for emergency medical help.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect in the Hospital**\n\nIf you are brought to the hospital, you will likely be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Your doctor may perform various tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry panel, to assess your overall health. You may also receive supportive care, including oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and cardiac monitoring.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for diazinon poisoning varies depending on the severity of the exposure and the promptness of treatment. In general, people who receive prompt medical attention tend to have better outcomes. However, even with proper treatment, some individuals may experience long-term effects, such as neurological damage or respiratory problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent diazinon poisoning, it is essential to handle pesticides safely and follow the instructions provided on the label. Always wear protective clothing, including gloves and a mask, when applying pesticides. Keep children and pets away from areas where pesticides are being applied, and avoid ingesting or inhaling pesticide fumes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Pesticides",

Diclofenac ophthalmic solution is also used to temporarily relieve eye pain and sensitivity to light in patients who are recovering from corneal refractive surgery (surgery to improve vision).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nOphthalmic diclofenac comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. When diclofenac eye drops are used by patients recovering from cataract surgery, they are usually instilled 4 times a day beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing for 2 weeks after surgery. When diclofenac eye drops are used by patients undergoing corneal refractive surgery, they are usually instilled one hour before the surgery, 15 minutes after the surgery, and then four times a day for up to 3 days.\n\nTo use the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n2. Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n3. Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and droppers must be kept clean.\n4. While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n5. Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n7. While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n8. Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n9. Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n10. Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n11. If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n12.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002442.htm",
    "content": "**Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\nWhen you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), your diet may need to change to keep the levels of electrolytes, minerals, and fluid in your body balanced. This is especially important if you're on dialysis.\n\n**Function**\n\nThe purpose of this special diet is to limit the buildup of waste products in the body when you have CKD or are on dialysis. People on dialysis need to watch their fluid intake between treatments because most people on dialysis urinate very little, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAsk your healthcare provider to refer you to a registered dietitian who specializes in kidney diets. Your dietitian can help create a personalized diet plan that meets your other health needs.\n\n**CARBOHYDRATES**\n\nIf you don't have trouble eating carbohydrates, these foods are a good source of energy:\n\n* Fruits\n* Breads\n* Grains\n* Vegetables\n\nYou can replace calories from protein with:\n\n* Hard candies\n* Sugar\n* Honey\n* Jelly\n* High-calorie desserts like pies, cakes, or cookies (limit those made with dairy, chocolate, nuts, or bananas)\n\n**FATS**\n\nUse monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (like olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) to protect your heart health. Talk to your provider or dietitian about fats and cholesterol that may increase your risk for heart problems.\n\n**PROTEIN**\n\nLow-protein diets may be helpful before starting dialysis. Your provider or dietitian may advise a lower-protein diet based on your weight, stage of disease, muscle mass, and other factors. However, you still need enough protein, so work with your provider to find the right balance for you.\n\nOnce you start dialysis, you'll need to eat more protein. A high-protein diet with fish, poultry, pork, or eggs at every meal may be recommended. People on dialysis should aim for 8-10 ounces (225-280 grams) of high-protein foods daily. Your provider or dietitian may suggest adding egg whites, egg white powder, or protein powder.\n\n**CALCIUM AND PHOSPHOROUS**\n\nYour healthcare provider will regularly check your calcium and phosphorous levels. Even in the early stages of CKD, phosphorous levels can get too high, leading to:\n\n* Low blood calcium\n* Itching\n\nLimit dairy foods that contain large amounts of phosphorous, including milk, yogurt, and cheese. Some lower-phosphorous dairy options are:\n\n* Tub margarine\n* Butter\n* Cream, ricotta, brie cheese\n* Heavy cream\n* Sherbet\n* Nondairy whipped toppings\n\nYou may need to take calcium supplements to prevent bone disease and vitamin D to control the balance of calcium and phosphorous in your body. Your provider may also recommend medicines called \"phosphorous binders\" if diet changes alone don't work.\n\n**FLUIDS**\n\nIn the early stages of kidney failure, you don't need to limit fluids. However, as your condition worsens or when you're on dialysis, you'll need to watch your fluid intake. In between dialysis sessions, too much fluid can build up in your body, leading to shortness of breath, a medical emergency.\n\nYour provider and dialysis nurse will let you know how much fluid you should drink daily. Keep track of foods that contain a lot of water, such as soups, fruit-flavored gelatin, fruit-flavored ice pops, ice cream, grapes, melons, lettuce, tomatoes, and celery.\n\n**SALT OR SODIUM**\n\nReducing sodium in your diet helps control high blood pressure, prevents thirst, and stops your body from holding onto extra fluid. Look for these words on food labels:\n\n* Low-sodium\n* No salt added\n* Sodium-free\n* Sodium-reduced\n* Unsalted\n\nCheck all labels to see how much salt or sodium foods contain per serving. Avoid salty foods and don't use salt when cooking.\n\n**POTASSIUM**\n\nToo much potassium can build up in your body, leading to dangerous heart rhythms that can be fatal. Fruits and vegetables contain large amounts of potassium, so limit or avoid:\n\n* Oranges and orange juice\n* Nectarines\n* Kiwis\n* Raisins or other dried fruit\n* Bananas\n* Cantaloupe\n* Honeydew\n* Prunes\n* Nectarines\n\nChoose potassium-friendly fruits like peaches, grapes, pears, apples, berries, pineapple, plums, tangerines, and watermelon. When eating vegetables, choose:\n\n* Broccoli\n* Cabbage\n* Carrots\n* Cauliflower\n* Celery\n* Cucumber\n* Eggplant\n* Green and wax beans\n* Lettuce\n* Onion\n* Peppers\n* Watercress\n* Zucchini\n* Yellow squash\n\nLimit or avoid asparagus, avocado, potatoes, tomatoes or tomato sauce, winter squash, pumpkin, and cooked spinach.\n\n**IRON**\n\nPeople with advanced kidney failure often have anemia and need extra iron. Many foods contain extra iron, such as:\n\n* Liver\n* Beef\n* Pork\n* Chicken\n* Lima and kidney beans\n* Iron-fortified cereals\n\nTalk to your provider or dietitian about which foods with iron you can eat due to your kidney disease.\n\n**References**\n\nGoraya N, Wesson DE.

This is especially important if you're on dialysis.\n\n**Function**\n\nThe purpose of this diet is to prevent the buildup of waste products in the body when you have CKD or are on dialysis.\n\n**People on Dialysis**\n\nIf you're on dialysis, limiting fluid intake between treatments is crucial because most people on dialysis urinate very little. Without urination, fluid will build up in the body and cause too much fluid in the heart and lungs.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   Ask your healthcare provider to refer you to a registered dietitian who specializes in kidney diets.\n*   Your dietitian can help you create a diet that fits your other health needs and ensures you're taking in enough calories each day to keep you healthy and prevent the breakdown of body tissue.\n\n**CARBOHYDRATES**\n\nIf you don't have a problem eating carbohydrates, these foods are a good source of energy. You may replace the calories from protein with:\n\n*   Fruits\n*   Breads\n*   Grains\n*   Vegetables\n*   Hard candies\n*   Sugar\n*   Honey\n*   Jelly\n\n**FATS**\n\nFats can be a good source of calories. Use monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) to protect your heart health.\n\n**PROTEIN**\n\nLow-protein diets may be helpful before you start dialysis. Your provider or dietitian may advise a lower-protein diet based on your weight, stage of disease, how much muscle you have, and other factors.\n\nOnce you start dialysis, you'll need to eat more protein. A high-protein diet with fish, poultry, pork, or eggs at every meal may be recommended.\n\nPeople on dialysis should eat 8 to 10 ounces (225 to 280 grams) of high-protein foods each day. Your provider or dietitian may suggest adding egg whites, egg white powder, or protein powder.\n\n**CALCIUM AND PHOSPHOROUS**\n\nThe minerals calcium and phosphorous will be checked often. Even in the early stages of CKD, phosphorous levels in the blood can get too high. This can cause:\n\n*   Low blood calcium\n*   Itching\n\nYou'll need to limit the amount of dairy foods you eat because they contain large amounts of phosphorous.\n\n**FLUIDS**\n\nIn the early stages of kidney failure, you don't need to limit the fluid you drink. However, as your condition gets worse or when you're on dialysis, you'll need to watch the amount of liquid you take in.\n\nToo much fluid can lead to shortness of breath, an emergency that needs immediate medical attention.\n\n**SALT OR SODIUM**\n\nReducing sodium in your diet helps control high blood pressure and prevents your body from holding onto extra fluid. Look for these words on food labels:\n\n*   Low-sodium\n*   No salt added\n*   Sodium-free\n*   Sodium-reduced\n*   Unsalted\n\nCheck all labels to see how much salt or sodium foods contain per serving.\n\n**POTASSIUM**\n\nNormal blood levels of potassium help keep your heart beating steadily. However, too much potassium can build up when the kidneys no longer function well. Dangerous heart rhythms may result, which can lead to death.\n\nFruits and vegetables contain large amounts of potassium, and for that reason should be limited to maintain a healthy heart.\n\n**IRON**\n\nPeople with advanced kidney failure also have anemia and usually need extra iron. Many foods contain extra iron (liver, beef, pork, chicken, lima and kidney beans, iron-fortified cereals). Talk to your provider or dietitian about which foods with iron you can eat because of your kidney disease.\n\n**Tips**\n\n*   Avoid salty foods\n*   Freeze some juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a fruit-flavored ice pop (you must count these ice cubes in your daily amount of fluids)\n*   Stay cool on hot days\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\nWhen you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), you may need to make changes to your diet. These changes can include limiting fluids, eating a low-protein diet, limiting salt, potassium, phosphorous, and other electrolytes, and getting enough calories if you are losing weight.\n\n**Function of the Diet**\n\nThe purpose of this diet is to keep the levels of electrolytes, minerals, and fluid in your body balanced when you have CKD or are on dialysis. People on dialysis need this special diet to limit the buildup of waste products in the body. Limiting fluid intake between dialysis treatments is very important because most people on dialysis urinate very little.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   Ask your health care provider to refer you to a registered dietitian to help you with your diet for kidney disease.\n*   Take in enough calories each day to keep you healthy and prevent the breakdown of body tissue. Weigh yourself every morning to make sure you are meeting this goal.\n*   Limit carbohydrates, protein, salt, potassium, phosphorous, and other electrolytes as recommended by your provider or dietitian.\n\n**CARBOHYDRATES**\n\nIf you do not have a problem eating carbohydrates, these foods are a good source of energy. You can replace the calories from protein with:\n\n*   Fruits\n*   Breads\n*   Grains\n*   Vegetables\n*   Hard candies\n*   Sugar\n*   Honey\n*   Jelly\n\n**FATS**\n\nFats can be a good source of calories. Make sure to use monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) to protect your heart health.\n\n**PROTEIN**\n\nLow-protein diets may be helpful before you start dialysis. Your provider or dietitian may advise a lower-protein diet based on your weight, stage of disease, how much muscle you have, and other factors. But you still need enough protein, so work with your provider to find the right diet for you.\n\nOnce you start dialysis, you will need to eat more protein. A high-protein diet with fish, poultry, pork, or eggs at every meal may be recommended.\n\n**CALCIUM AND PHOSPHOROUS**\n\nThe minerals calcium and phosphorous will be checked often. Even in the early stages of CKD, phosphorous levels in the blood can get too high. This can cause:\n\n*   Low blood calcium\n*   Itching\n\nYou will need to limit the amount of dairy foods you eat, because they contain large amounts of phosphorous. This includes milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\n**FLUIDS**\n\nIn the early stages of kidney failure, you do not need to limit the fluid you drink. But, as your condition gets worse, or when you are on dialysis, you will need to watch the amount of liquid you take in.\n\n**SALT OR SODIUM**\n\nReducing sodium in your diet helps you control high blood pressure. It also keeps you from being thirsty, and prevents your body from holding onto extra fluid. Look for these words on food labels:\n\n*   Low-sodium\n*   No salt added\n*   Sodium-free\n*   Sodium-reduced\n*   Unsalted\n\nCheck all labels to see how much salt or sodium foods contain per serving.\n\n**POTASSIUM**\n\nPeople with CKD also need to limit their potassium.\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nAs a person with chronic kidney disease (CKD), it's essential to follow a diet that helps manage your condition. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:\n\n**Herbs vs Salt**\n\n*   Herbs are safe and can be used as alternatives to salt.\n*   Avoid using salt substitutes, which contain potassium.\n\n**Potassium Limitations**\n\n*   Fruits and vegetables contain large amounts of potassium, so limit or avoid:\n    *   Oranges and orange juice\n    *   Nectarines\n    *   Kiwis\n    *   Raisins or other dried fruit\n    *   Bananas\n    *   Cantaloupe\n    *   Honeydew\n    *   Prunes\n    *   And nectarines\n*   Choose potassium-rich foods like:\n    *   Peaches\n    *   Grapes\n    *   Pears\n    *   Apples\n    *   Berries\n    *   Pineapple\n    *   Plums\n    *   Tangerines\n    *   Watermelon\n\n**Vegetable Choices**\n\n*   Limit or avoid:\n    *   Asparagus\n    *   Avocado\n    *   Potatoes\n    *   Tomatoes or tomato sauce\n    *   Winter squash\n    *   Pumpkin\n    *   Cooked spinach\n*   Choose potassium-rich vegetables like:\n    *   Broccoli\n    *   Cabbage\n    *   Carrots\n    *   Cauliflower\n    *   Celery\n    *   Cucumber\n    *   Eggplant\n    *   Green and wax beans\n    *   Lettuce\n    *   Onion\n    *   Peppers\n    *   Watercress\n    *   Zucchini\n    *   Yellow squash\n\n**Iron Intake**\n\n*   People with advanced kidney failure may need extra iron due to anemia.\n*   Talk to your provider or dietitian about which foods with iron you can eat.\n\n**Calories and Energy**\n\n*   If you don't have a problem eating carbohydrates, these foods are a good source of energy.\n*   Replace calories from protein with:\n    *   Fruits\n    *   Breads\n    *   Grains\n    *   Vegetables\n    *   Hard candies\n    *   Sugar\n    *   Honey\n    *   Jelly\n\n**Fats and Cholesterol**\n\n*   Use monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) to protect your heart health.\n*   Talk to your provider or dietitian about fats and cholesterol that may increase your risk for heart problems.\n\n**Protein Intake**\n\n*   Low-protein diets may be helpful before you start dialysis.\n*   Your provider or dietitian may advise a lower-protein diet based on your weight, stage of disease, muscle mass, and other factors.\n*   Once you start dialysis, you'll need to eat more protein. A high-protein diet with fish, poultry, pork, or eggs at every meal may be recommended.\n\n**Calcium and Phosphorus**\n\n*   The minerals calcium and phosphorous will be checked often.\n*   Even in the early stages of CKD, phosphorous levels in the blood can get too high, causing:\n    *   Low blood calcium\n    *   Itching\n*   Limit dairy foods that contain large amounts of phosphorous.\n*   Some dairy foods are lower in phosphorous, including:\n    *   Tub margarine\n    *   Butter\n    *   Cream\n    *   Ricotta cheese\n    *   Brie cheese\n    *   Heavy cream\n    *   Sherbet\n    *   Nondairy whipped toppings\n\n**Fluid Intake**\n\n*   In the early stages of kidney failure, you don't need to limit fluid intake.\n*   As your condition worsens or when on dialysis, watch the amount of liquid you take in.\n*   Your provider and dialysis nurse will let you know how much you should drink every day.\n\n**Tips for Managing Fluid Intake**\n\n*   Use smaller cups or glasses\n*   Turn over your cup after finishing it\n*   Avoid salty foods\n*   Freeze juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a fruit-flavored ice pop (count these ice cubes in your daily amount of fluids)\n*   Stay cool on hot days\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\nAs a person with chronic kidney disease (CKD), it's essential to follow a specific diet to manage your condition effectively.

Do not gulp.\n* Ask your provider before using a straw, as it may bring air into your stomach.\n\n**Nutritional Requirements**\n\n* Ensure you are getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals while losing weight.\n* Eat mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support your body's needs.\n* Low-fat protein choices include:\n\t+ Skinless chicken\n\t+ Lean beef or pork\n\t+ Fish\n\t+ Whole eggs or egg whites\n\t+ Beans\n\t+ Dairy products (low-fat or nonfat hard cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt)\n\n**Supplements**\n\n* Your provider may prescribe supplements to ensure you are getting enough essential vitamins and minerals, including:\n\t+ Multivitamin with iron\n\t+ Vitamin B12\n\t+ Calcium (1,200 mg per day) and vitamin D\n\n---\n\n**Diet after Gastric Banding**\n\nAfter gastric banding surgery, you will need to follow a special diet to ensure your weight loss is successful and to prevent any complications.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nYou may need to take supplements to get enough of certain vitamins and minerals. These include:\n\n*   Multivitamin with iron\n*   Vitamin B12\n*   Calcium (1,200 mg per day) and vitamin D\n\nYour body can only absorb about 500 mg of calcium at a time, so divide your daily dose into 2 or 3 portions.\n\n**Regular Checkups**\n\nYou will need to have regular checkups with your provider to monitor your weight loss and ensure you are eating well. These visits are a good opportunity to discuss any problems you are experiencing with your diet or other issues related to your surgery and recovery.\n\n**Eating for Weight Loss**\n\nTo lose weight successfully, you need to make sure you are getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals. Eating mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help your body get the nutrients it needs.\n\nProtein is particularly important because your body needs it to build muscles and other tissues. Low-fat protein choices include:\n\n*   Skinless chicken\n*   Lean beef or pork\n*   Fish\n*   Whole eggs or egg whites\n*   Beans\n*   Dairy products, such as low-fat or nonfat hard cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, and yogurt\n\nCombining foods with texture together with protein can help you feel fuller for longer. Examples include a salad with grilled chicken or toast with low-fat cottage cheese.\n\n**Avoiding High-Calorie Foods**\n\nTo avoid gaining weight or slowing down your weight loss, read food labels to avoid high-calorie foods. Also, steer clear of:\n\n*   Foods that contain a lot of fats, sugar, or carbohydrates\n*   \"Slider\" foods that dissolve easily or pass quickly through the band\n*   Drinks with sugar, fructose, or corn syrup\n*   Carbonated drinks like soda and sparkling water\n\nLet soda go flat before drinking it.\n\n**When to Call Your Provider**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your provider:\n\n*   You are gaining weight or stopping weight loss\n*   You are vomiting after eating\n*   You feel tired all the time\n*   You have dizziness or are sweating\n\nBy following these dietary guidelines and staying in touch with your provider, you can ensure a successful weight loss journey after gastric banding surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Diet after Gastric Banding**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Post-Surgical Diet Guidelines**\n\nAfter undergoing gastric banding, it's essential to follow a specific diet to ensure proper healing and minimize complications. The following guidelines are based on recommendations from reputable medical sources:\n\n*   **Initial Post-Surgery Period**: During the first week or two after surgery, patients should focus on clear liquids, such as water, clear broth, and electrolyte-rich beverages like sports drinks. This helps prevent dehydration and promotes healing.\n*   **Soft Foods**: Once cleared by their doctor, patients can gradually introduce soft foods into their diet. These may include mashed potatoes, cooked pasta, scrambled eggs, and other easy-to-digest options.\n*   **Solid Foods**: As the banding adjusts and the stomach adapts, solid foods can be reintroduced in small portions. It's crucial to chew food thoroughly and eat slowly to avoid discomfort or pain.\n\n**Nutritional Considerations**\n\nIn addition to following a specific diet, patients should also pay attention to their overall nutritional intake:\n\n*   **Protein-Rich Foods**: Incorporating protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, and legumes can help maintain muscle mass and support overall health.\n*   **Fiber-Rich Foods**: A balanced diet that includes fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can promote digestive health and prevent constipation.\n*   **Vitamin and Mineral Supplements**: Patients may require vitamin and mineral supplements to ensure they're getting all the necessary nutrients. Consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations.\n\n**Long-Term Dietary Adjustments**\n\nAfter gastric banding, patients will need to make long-term dietary adjustments to maintain their weight loss and overall health:\n\n*   **Portion Control**: Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help manage hunger and prevent overeating.\n*   **Balanced Diet**: Focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n*   **Regular Follow-Ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor progress, address concerns, and make any necessary adjustments to your diet.\n\nBy following these guidelines and consulting with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian, patients can ensure a smooth recovery and maintain optimal health after gastric banding.",

    "content": "**Diet and Eating After Esophagectomy**\n\nYou had surgery to remove part, or all, of your esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach. The remaining part of your esophagus was reconnected to your stomach.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou will probably have a feeding tube for 1 to 2 months after surgery. This will help you get enough calories so that you start to gain weight. You will also be on a special diet when you first get home.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nIf you have a feeding tube that goes directly into your stomach (gastrostomy tube) or intestine (jejunostomy tube):\n\n* Usually, you need to use it only at night or for periods during the day. You can still go about your daytime activities.\n* A nurse or dietitian will teach you how to prepare the liquid diet for the feeding tube and how much to use.\n* Follow instructions on how to care for the tube. This includes flushing the tube with water before and after feedings and replacing the dressing around the tube. You will also be taught how to clean the skin around the tube.\n\nYou may have diarrhea when you are using a feeding tube, or even when you start eating regular foods again.\n\n* If specific foods are causing your diarrhea, try to avoid these foods.\n* If you have too many loose bowel movements, try psyllium powder (for example, Metamucil) mixed with water or orange juice. You can either drink it or put it through your feeding tube. It will add bulk to your stool and make it more solid.\n* Ask your health care provider about medicines that may help with diarrhea. Never start these medicines without first talking to your provider.\n\n**What You Will Be Eating**\n\nYou will be on a liquid diet at first. Then you may eat soft foods for the first 4 to 8 weeks after surgery. A soft diet contains only foods that are mushy and do not need much chewing.\n\n* When you are back to a normal diet, be careful eating steak and other dense meats because they may be hard to swallow. Cut them into very small pieces and chew them well.\n* Drink fluids 30 minutes after you eat solid food. Take 30 to 60 minutes to finish a drink.\n* Sit in a chair when you eat or drink. Do not eat or drink when you are lying down. Stand or sit upright for 1 hour after eating or drinking because gravity helps food and liquid move downward.\n\n**Eat and Drink Small Amounts**\n\nIn the first 2 to 4 weeks, eat or drink no more than 1 cup (240 milliliters) at a time. It is OK to eat more than 3 times and even up to 6 times a day.\n\nYour stomach will stay smaller than it was before surgery. Eating smaller meals throughout the day instead of 3 larger meals will be easier.\n\n---\n\n**Diet and Eating After Esophagectomy**\n\nIf you have had part or all of your esophagus removed, you will need to follow a special diet for several weeks after surgery.

Cut them into very small pieces and chew them well.\n* Drink fluids 30 minutes after you eat solid food. Take 30 to 60 minutes to finish a drink.\n* Sit in a chair when you eat or drink. Do not eat or drink when you are lying down. Stand or sit upright for 1 hour after eating or drinking because gravity helps food and liquid move downward.\n\n**Eat and Drink Small Amounts**\n\nIn the first 2 to 4 weeks, eat or drink no more than 1 cup (240 milliliters) at a time. It is OK to eat more than 3 times and even up to 6 times a day.\n\nYour stomach will stay smaller than it was before surgery. Eating smaller meals throughout the day instead of 3 larger meals will be easier.\n\n---\n\n**Diet and Eating After Esophagectomy**\n\n\\n\\nAfter an esophagectomy, you will need to make some changes to your diet. The goal is to eat small, frequent meals that are easy to swallow.\n\n*   **Start with liquids**: Begin with liquids like water, clear broth, or juice. Gradually introduce soft foods like yogurt, scrambled eggs, and mashed potatoes.\n*   **Choose soft foods**: Opt for soft foods that are easy to chew and swallow. Avoid hard, crunchy, or dry foods that may cause discomfort.\n*   **Eat slowly and carefully**: Take small bites, chew slowly, and swallow carefully to avoid discomfort or pain.\n\n\\n\\n**Additional Tips**\n\n*   **Avoid spicy or fatty foods**: Steer clear of spicy or fatty foods that can irritate your throat or stomach.\n*   **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.\n*   **Listen to your body**: If you experience any discomfort, pain, or difficulty swallowing, stop eating and consult with your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**Returning to Normal Diet**\n\n*   **Gradually increase food texture**: As your throat and stomach heal, you can gradually introduce more solid foods into your diet.\n*   **Be patient**: It may take some time for your body to adjust to the changes in your digestive system. Be patient and follow your doctor's advice.\n\n\\n\\n**Remember**\n\n*   Your doctor is there to guide you through this process. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.",

    "content": "**Diet for Rapid Weight Loss**\n\nRapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (lb) or 1 kilogram (kg) a week over several weeks. To lose weight this quickly, you must eat very few calories.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nThese diets are most often chosen by people with obesity who want to lose weight quickly. These diets are less commonly recommended by health care providers. People on these diets should be followed closely by their provider. Rapid weight loss may not be safe for some people to do on their own.\n\n**Types of Rapid Weight Loss Diets**\n\nThese diets are only to be used for a short time and are usually not recommended for more than several weeks. The types of rapid weight loss diets are described below:\n\n*   **Very Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD)**: On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 lb (1.5 to 2 kg) week.\n*   **Low-Calorie Diet (LCD)**: These diets usually allow about 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day for women and 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day for men.\n*   **Time-Restricted Eating**: This diet strategy limits the number of hours per day that you can eat.\n*   **Intermittent Fasting**: Fasting is an ancient form of caloric restriction. It has become more popular recently.\n*   **Fad Diets**: Some fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss.\n\n**The Role of Exercise**\n\nRapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while you are on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nRapid weight loss diet is usually for people who have health problems because of obesity. For these people, losing a lot of weight quickly can help improve:\n\n*   Diabetes\n*   High cholesterol\n*   High blood pressure\n\n**Possible Health Concerns**\n\nYou should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than 1 or 2 lb (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including:\n\n*   Gallstones\n*   Gout\n*   Fatigue\n*   Constipation\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea\n\n**Who Should Not Follow a Rapid Weight Loss Diet**\n\nIn general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children. It may also not be safe for teens, pregnant women or older adults unless a provider recommends it.\n\nIf you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your provider before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight.\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Rapid Weight Loss**\n\nRapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (lb) or 1 kilogram (kg) a week over several weeks.

These diets are only to be used for a short time and are usually not recommended for more than several weeks.\n\n**Why Should I Choose a Rapid Weight Loss Diet?**\n\nPeople who lose weight very quickly are much more likely to regain the weight over time than people who lose weight slowly through less drastic diet changes and physical activity. The weight loss is a bigger stress for the body, and the hormonal response to the weight loss is much stronger.\n\n**Types of Rapid Weight Loss Diets**\n\n*   **Very Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD)**: On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 lb (1.5 to 2 kg) week. Most VLCDs use meal replacements, such as formulas, soups, shakes, and bars instead of regular meals.\n*   **Low-Calorie Diet (LCD)**: These diets usually allow about 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day for women and 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day for men. An LCD is a better choice than a VLCD for most people who want to lose weight quickly.\n*   **Time-Restricted Eating**: This diet strategy limits the number of hours per day that you can eat. A popular strategy is the 16:8, where you have to eat all of your meals during an 8 hour period, for example, 10 am to 6 pm.\n\n**Is a Rapid Weight Loss Diet Safe?**\n\nRapid weight loss may not be safe for some people to do on their own. You should only use a VLCD with the help of your provider. Most experts do not recommend using a VLCD for more than 12 weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Rapid Weight Loss**\n\nRapid weight loss diets are not suitable for everyone, but they can be effective for people with health problems due to obesity. These diets involve severely limiting calories to achieve quick weight loss.\n\n**Intermittent Fasting**\n\nFasting is an ancient form of caloric restriction that has become popular recently. Some studies have shown benefits to fasting for people with diabetes and obesity. One of the most popular methods is the 5:2 system, which involves two days a week of fasting or very low-calorie diet (VLCD) and five days a week of eating normally. Diets that incorporate fasting can cause rapid weight loss.\n\n**Fad Diets**\n\nSome fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss. However, these diets are not safe in some cases and are not sustainable for long enough to cause long-term weight loss. Once you stop the diet, you are at risk of regaining the weight if you return to your old eating habits.\n\n**The Role of Exercise**\n\nRapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nRapid weight loss can help improve:\n\n* Diabetes\n* High cholesterol\n* High blood pressure\n\n**Possible Health Concerns**\n\nYou should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than 1 or 2 lb (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including:\n\n* Gallstones\n* Gout\n* Fatigue\n* Constipation\n* Diarrhea\n* Nausea\n\nPeople who lose weight quickly are also more likely to gain back the weight quickly. This can lead to other health problems.\n\nIn general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children. It may also not be safe for teens, pregnant women or older adults unless a provider recommends it.\n\nIf you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your provider before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Very low-calorie diet; VLCD\n* Low-calorie diet; LCD\n* Very low energy diet\n* Weight loss - rapid weight loss\n* Overweight - rapid weight loss\n* Obesity - rapid weight loss\n* Diet - rapid weight loss\n* Intermittent fasting - rapid weight loss\n* Time-restricted eating - rapid weight loss\n\n---\n\n**Diet for Rapid Weight Loss**\n\nRapid weight loss is a topic of great interest, but it's essential to understand the risks involved. Yo-yo dieting, which involves repeatedly losing and gaining weight, can have severe consequences on one's health.\n\n**The Risks of Yo-Yo Dieting**\n\nWeight loss, when achieved through rapid methods, can lead to a range of problems, including:\n\n*   **Malnutrition**: Severely restricting calorie intake can result in malnutrition, as the body may not receive the necessary nutrients for optimal functioning.\n*   **Loss of Muscle Mass**: When calories are severely limited, the body may start to break down muscle tissue to use for energy, leading to a loss of muscle mass and strength.\n*   **Decreased Metabolism**: Rapid weight loss can cause the metabolism to slow down, making it more challenging to lose weight in the long run.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website. 4 ways low-calorie diets can sabotage your health. www.eatright.org/health/wellness/weight-and-body-positivity/4-ways-low-calorie-diets-can-sabotage-your-health.

    "content": "**Diet Myths and Facts**\n\nA diet myth is advice that becomes popular without facts to back it up. When it comes to weight loss, many popular beliefs are myths and others are only partly true. Here are some facts to help you sort through what you hear.\n\n* **Cut back on carbs to lose weight?**\n\t+ Myth: Cut back on carbs to lose weight.\n\t+ Fact: Carbohydrates come in different forms: simple and complex. Simple carbs found in foods like cookies and candy lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Cutting back on these sweets is a great way to eat healthier and possibly lose weight. Foods with complex carbs like whole-wheat bread, beans, and fruit, have lots of nutrients that are good for you.\n\t+ Tip: Cut back on simple carbs but keep complex carbs on the menu.\n* **Low-fat or no-fat foods?**\n\t+ Myth: If the label says \"no-fat\" or \"low-fat,\" you can eat all you want and not gain weight.\n\t+ Fact: Many low-fat or no-fat foods have added sugar, starch, or salt to make up for the reduction in fat. These \"wonder\" foods often have just as many calories, or more, than the regular version.\n\t+ Tip: Check the nutrition label to see how many calories are in a serving. Be sure to check the serving size too.\n* **Breakfast myths**\n\t+ Myth: Skipping breakfast makes you gain weight.\n\t+ Fact: Eating a healthy breakfast can help you manage your hunger later in the day and help you to say \"No thanks\" to unhealthy snacks. No scientific studies have shown that skipping the morning meal leads directly to weight gain.\n\t+ Tip: If you are not hungry first thing, listen to your body. When you are ready to eat, help yourself to a healthy option like oatmeal with fresh berries.\n* **Eating at night**\n\t+ Myth: Eating at night will make you gain weight.\n\t+ Fact: People who eat late at night do tend to put on extra weight. One possible reason is that late-night eaters tend to choose high-calorie treats. Some people who snack after dinner do not sleep well, which can lead to unhealthy cravings the next day.\n\t+ Tip: If you are hungry after dinner, limit yourself to healthy snacks such as low-fat yogurt or baby carrots.\n* **Overweight and healthy?**\n\t+ Myth: You cannot be overweight and healthy.\n\t+ Fact: There are some people who are overweight with healthy blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. For most people, excess weight increases the risk for heart disease and diabetes. The longer you are overweight, the more your risk of developing disease increases.\n\t+ Tip: While you can be overweight and healthy, carrying extra weight will increase your risk for health problems down the line, but healthy eating and regular activity are good for you no matter what you weigh.\n* **Fasting**\n\t+ Myth: Fasting can help you lose weight quickly.\n\t+ Fact: Fasting is not healthy if you go hungry all day and cap it off with a huge meal that replaces all the calories you skipped earlier. Compared to people who lose fat by eating fewer calories, people who fast lose more muscle than fat.\n\t+ Tip: Look at your daily diet for empty calories you can cut out, such as refined grains and sugary drinks. Do not cut out meals entirely, especially without a doctor's supervision.\n\nRemember, no two people are the same. What works for someone else may not work for you. Losing weight is a process. Be ready to modify your plan as you discover what works and does not work for you.\n\n---\n\n**Diet Myths and Facts**\n\n**Part 2/3**\n\n**Cutting Back on Carbs**\n\n*   Cutting back on simple carbs like cookies and candy is a great way to eat healthier and possibly lose weight.\n*   Foods with complex carbs like whole-wheat bread, beans, and fruit have lots of nutrients that are good for you.\n\n**Low-Fat or No-Fat Foods**\n\n*   Many low-fat or no-fat foods have added sugar, starch, or salt to make up for the reduction in fat.\n*   These \"wonder\" foods often have just as many calories, or more, than the regular version.\n\n**Breakfast and Weight Gain**\n\n*   Eating a healthy breakfast can help you manage your hunger later in the day and help you say \"No thanks\" to unhealthy snacks.\n*   No scientific studies have shown that skipping the morning meal leads directly to weight gain.\n\n**Eating at Night**\n\n*   People who eat late at night do tend to put on extra weight.\n*   One possible reason is that late-night eaters tend to choose high-calorie treats.\n\n**Being Overweight and Healthy**\n\n*   There are some people who are overweight with healthy blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.\n*   For most people, excess weight increases the risk for heart disease and diabetes.\n\n**Fasting for Weight Loss**\n\n*   Fasting is not healthy if you go hungry all day and cap it off with a huge meal that replaces all the calories you skipped earlier.\n*   Compared to people who lose fat by eating fewer calories, people who fast lose more muscle than fat.\n\n---\n\n**Diet Myths and Facts**\n\nWhen it comes to weight loss, many popular beliefs are myths and others are only partly true. Here are some facts to help you sort through what you hear.\n\n**Myth? Cut back on carbs to lose weight.**\n\n*   **Fact:** Carbohydrates come in different forms: simple and complex.

You have to set modest goals if you want to lose weight.**\n\n*   **Fact:** In theory, it makes sense that if you set ambitious goals and do not reach them, you might give up. However, some people actually lose more weight when they set goals that make them push themselves.\n\n**Myth? Slow weight loss is the only way to lose weight and keep it off.**\n\n*   **Fact:** While it is true that many people who lose a lot of weight in a short time gain it all back, this is not true for everyone. Some people with overweight are more successful when they lose weight quickly, for instance, going from 300 to 250 pounds (135 to 112 kilograms) in less than a year.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Dawson RS.

whole grains should be listed first.\n    Great ways to get more whole grains include:\n        *   Whole-wheat or multigrain toast with avocado\n        *   Oatmeal with berries\n        *   Wild rice and mushroom salad\n        *   Brown rice with stir-fried vegetables\n        *   Whole-grain barley and vegetable soup\n        *   Whole-wheat pizza with grilled vegetables and marinara sauce\n        *   Popcorn with little or no added salt and butter\n\n**Low-Fat and Nonfat Dairy Foods**\n\nLow-fat and nonfat milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese are healthy sources of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium.\nUnlike sweetened drinks with extra calories, milk fills you up with nutrients.\n\n*   **Ways to Get More Dairy**\n    Get creative when adding dairy to your diet:\n        *   Add milk to high-fiber cereal\n        *   Cook your oatmeal with skim milk instead of water\n        *   Eat yogurt alone, with fruit, or drizzled with honey\n        *   Use yogurt-based salad dressing\n        *   Substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream\n        *   Snack on low-fat or nonfat cheese sticks\n        *   Spread low-fat cottage cheese on wheat crackers and top with tomatoes\n        *   Add a spoonful of nonfat cottage cheese to scrambled eggs\n\n**Foods to Eat in Moderation**\n\nAdd limited amounts of these foods to your diet.\n\n*   **Nuts**\n    In small amounts, nuts are a great source of fiber, protein, and healthy fat.\n    But nuts are also high in calories, and they're easy to overeat.\n    Eat them sparingly.\n    Portion nuts out ahead of time, rather than eating them straight from the container.\n    Add nuts to salads and main dishes as a source of protein.\n\n*   **Healthy Oils**\n    Oils such as olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and soft margarine are great replacements for oils that are high in solid fat, like butter and shortening.\n    Many oils that are high in solid fat promote waist fattening and are bad for your heart.\n\n*   **Seafood**\n    Seafood is high in nutrients and heart-healthy fat.\n    The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends eating at least one 8-ounce (226 grams) serving of seafood every week.\n    Healthy choices include sardines, herring, tilapia, and trout.\n\n*   **Chicken**\n    Chicken is healthiest when you roast, broil, or grill it.\n    Chicken breasts are lower in fat and calories than chicken thighs.\n    It's fine to cook chicken with the skin on, which helps keep it moist.\n    Remove the skin before eating to save about 50 calories and almost 5 grams of fat.\n\n*   **Lean Cuts of Meat**\n    Whether meat is lean or high in fat depends on the part of the animal it came from.\n\n    A serving of pork loin has 3 grams of fat. Spare ribs have 26 grams of fat.\n    A top sirloin steak has 7 grams of fat. Prime rib has almost 23 grams of fat.\n    Look for ground meat labeled \"97% to 99% lean.\"\n\n    It's even healthier to use lean meat as a garnish instead of as a main course.\n    For example, cook some lean ground beef, drain any oil, and add it, along with chopped carrots and zucchini, to a pot of tomato sauce.\n\n---\n\n**Diet-boosting foods**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Fruit and Vegetables**\n\nAny healthy diet includes fruit and vegetables every day. Foods that grow on farms, in gardens, or on trees are loaded with nutrients and fiber. They fill you up and give you a steady flow of energy.\n\n*   Keep a fruit bowl stocked in your kitchen for a quick, healthy snack.\n*   Use frozen fruit that comes pre-sliced if you're short on time.\n*   Check the label to make sure there's no added sugar.\n*   Try these serving suggestions:\n    *   Berries over nonfat, low sugar yogurt\n    *   Fruit smoothie with nonfat, low sugar yogurt\n    *   Citrus salad with walnuts\n    *   Watermelon salad with balsamic vinegar\n    *   Grilled pineapple, peaches, or nectarines\n    *   Poached pears\n    *   Spinach and pear salad\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Ways to eat vegetables**\n\nCut raw veggies like carrots, celery, or bell peppers into sticks so you can snack on them throughout the day. You can also eat them in a salad. Like fruit, many vegetables come pre-cut and frozen. Again, check the label to make sure the ingredient list only includes vegetables. Try these vegetable recipe ideas:\n\n*   Stir-fried broccoli over brown rice\n*   Collard greens with a fried egg\n*   Roasted beets with fennel and orange slices\n*   Corn and tomato salad\n*   Grilled veggie kabobs or roasted vegetables\n*   Store-bought low-sodium soups with added frozen veggies\n*   Frozen vegetables stirred into boiling pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Beans**\n\nBeans are a great source of protein and fiber. You can use beans to reduce or even replace meat in many dishes.\n\n*   If you don't have time to pre-soak and cook dry beans, canned beans will save you time.\n*   Just be sure you buy beans that are low in salt (sodium).\n*   You can also reduce the sodium content by rinsing and draining canned beans.\n*   Here are some tasty ways to eat more beans:\n    *   Vegetarian chili with kidney beans\n    *   Black-eyed pea salsa\n    *   Hummus made with garbanzo beans\n    *   Lentil soup with carrots and spinach\n    *   Split pea soup\n    *   Brown rice and pinto beans\n    *   White bean salad with lemon and avocado\n    *   Veggie burgers\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Whole Grains**\n\nAt least one half of the grains you eat should be whole grains. Whole grains still have most of the nutrients and fiber they started with as plants, because whole grains contain the entire grain kernel. That's why whole-grain bread has texture and white bread is smooth.\n\n*   When choosing foods made with whole grains, check the ingredients list - whole grains should be listed first.\n*   Great ways to get more whole grains include:\n    *   Whole-wheat or multigrain toast with avocado\n    *   Oatmeal with berries\n    *   Wild rice and mushroom salad\n    *   Brown rice with stir-fried vegetables\n    *   Whole-grain barley and vegetable soup\n    *   Whole-wheat pizza with grilled vegetables and marinara sauce\n    *   Popcorn with little or no added salt and butter\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Low-Fat and Nonfat Dairy Foods**\n\nLow-fat and nonfat milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese are healthy sources of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Unlike sweetened drinks with extra calories, milk fills you up with nutrients.\n\n*   Get creative when adding dairy to your diet:\n    *   Add milk to high-fiber cereal\n    *   Cook your oatmeal with skim milk instead of water\n    *   Eat yogurt alone, with fruit, or drizzled with honey\n    *   Use yogurt-based salad dressing\n    *   Substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream\n    *   Snack on low-fat or nonfat cheese sticks\n    *   Spread low-fat cottage cheese on wheat crackers and top with tomatoes\n    *   Add a spoonful of nonfat cottage cheese to scrambled eggs\n\n---\n\n**Diet-Boosting Foods**\n\nAre you looking to shed some pounds? Do you want to maintain a healthy weight without sacrificing flavor or nutrition? Look no further than the world of diet-boosting foods! In this article, we'll explore the top foods that can help you achieve your weight loss goals.\n\n**Fruits and Vegetables**\n\nStart your day off right with a serving of fruits and vegetables. Not only are they low in calories, but they're also packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants that will keep you full and satisfied throughout the morning. Some of our top picks include:\n\n* Apples\n* Carrots\n* Broccoli\n\n**Sources of Fiber**\n\nFiber is an essential nutrient that can help you feel fuller longer. Aim to get at least 25 grams of fiber per day from sources like:\n\n* Whole grains\n* Legumes\n* Nuts and seeds\n\n**Dairy Delights**\n\nMilk, yogurt, and cheese are all excellent sources of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Unlike sweetened drinks with extra calories, milk fills you up with nutrients. Try adding dairy to your diet in creative ways such as:\n\n* Adding milk to high-fiber cereal\n* Cooking oatmeal with skim milk instead of water\n* Eating yogurt alone or with fruit\n\n**Nuts and Healthy Oils**\n\nIn small amounts, nuts are a great source of fiber, protein, and healthy fat. But be careful not to overdo it - nuts are also high in calories. Instead, try using healthy oils like olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and soft margarine for cooking and salad dressings.\n\n**Seafood**\n\nSeafood is high in nutrients and heart-healthy fat. Aim to eat at least one 8-ounce serving of seafood per week. Healthy choices include sardines, herring, tilapia, and trout.\n\n**Lean Cuts of Meat**\n\nWhether meat is lean or high in fat depends on the part of the animal it came from. Look for ground meat labeled \"97% to 99% lean\" and use lean cuts as a garnish instead of as a main course.\n\nBy incorporating these diet-boosting foods into your daily routine, you'll be well on your way to achieving a healthy weight and maintaining it for good!\n\n---\n\n**Diet-boosting foods**\n\n\\n\\nTo make healthy choices, use the dietary guidelines, MyPlate, and food labels. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website provides information on how to use these tools.\n\n\\n\\nAccording to D. Mozaffarian in Braunwald's Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, nutrition plays a crucial role in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\n\n\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 recommend a variety of diet-boosting foods, including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.\n\n\\n\\nSources of fiber include:\n\n*   Fruits\n*   Vegetables\n*   Whole grains\n\n\\n\\nBy incorporating these diet-boosting foods into your daily meals, you can significantly reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.",

    "content": "**Diet-Busting Foods**\n\nDiet-busting foods work against you if you are watching your weight. These foods may taste good, but are low in nutrition and high in calories. Many of these foods leave you feeling hungry because they are low in fiber or protein. In general, diet-busting foods should make up a very small portion of your overall diet.\n\n**Worst Offenders**\n\n* **High-Fat Foods**: Most high-fat foods have a lot of calories but little nutrition. Many of these diet-busting foods are made with unhealthy saturated or trans fats.\n\t+ Fatty meats, such as sausage, bacon, and ribs\n\t+ Dishes made with full-fat cheese, such as pizza, burritos, and mac and cheese\n\t+ Fried foods\n\t+ Whole-fat dairy foods, such as ice cream or pudding\n\t+ Foods prepared in cream, such as creamy sauces and soups\n* **Refined Grains**: Unlike diet-boosting whole grains, most of the nutrients and fiber have been stripped away from these grains in the refining process.\n\t+ White bread\n\t+ Pasta made with white flour\n\t+ White rice\n* **High-Calorie Drinks**:\n\t+ Soda: A 16-ounce (oz) or 480 milliliter (mL) can of sugary soda has almost as many calories as a cookie.\n\t+ Fruit juice: Many fruit juices sold in stores are high in sugar and low in fruit. Look for 100% fruit juice with no added corn syrup, dextrose, sucrose, or syrup.\n\t+ Sports and energy drinks: Many of these drinks are high in sugar and calories. Energy drinks also have a lot of caffeine.\n\t+ Coffee drinks: Coffee is low in calories on its own. But once you add high-fat milk, sugary flavorings, and whipped cream, the calorie count soars.\n\n**Other Diet-Busters**\n\n* **Baked Goods**: High in fat, sugar, and refined grains, pastries and baked desserts are diet-busters on every level.\n\t+ Donuts\n\t+ Muffins\n\t+ Scones\n\t+ Cake\n\t+ Cookies\n\t+ Brownies\n* **Exercise Bars**: These bars may have earned their healthy reputation because they are sold to give you energy for exercise. But most of them are more like candy bars: low in fiber, and high in sugar, fat, and calories.\n* **Cream-Based Soups**: The advice to make a meal of soup and salad can backfire if your cup of soup has the calorie and fat profile of a hamburger.\n* **Creamy Salad Dressing**: Ranch, peppercorn, and blue cheese dressings can turn a healthy salad into a high-fat meal.\n\n**Healthy in Small Amounts**\n\n* **Nuts**: High in fiber, nuts are a tasty way to eat heart-healthy fat. But nuts are also high in calories.\n* **Dried Fruit**: The drying process takes away the water and a lot of the volume, making dried fruit higher in calories and sugar than a similar portion size of fresh fruit.\n* **Granola**: This is another food best eaten in small portions.\n\n**References**\n\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics website.

But some foods can be particularly problematic if consumed excessively. In this section, we'll explore five common diet-busting foods that may surprise you.\n\n**Sugar-Free Foods**\n\nIf a food that's usually made with sugar is labeled \"sugar-free,\" check the calories on the nutrition label. Often, extra fat and salt are added to make up for the lack of sugar.\n\n**Potatoes**\n\nWhether a potato is diet-busting or diet-boosting depends on how you cook it. A baked potato has about 120 calories. You can top it with broccoli and drizzle it with olive oil. But once you fry a potato or turn it into hash browns, the calories more than double and unhealthy fats increase dramatically.\n\n**Exercise Bars**\n\nThese bars may have earned their healthy reputation because they're sold to give you energy for exercise. But most of them are more like candy bars: low in fiber, and high in sugar, fat, and calories. Choose bars high in fiber and lower in sugar and fat when you need an energy boost.\n\n**Cream-Based Soups**\n\nThe advice to make a meal of soup and salad can backfire if your cup of soup has the calorie and fat profile of a hamburger. Creamy soups like mushroom bisque and many chowders have around 400 calories in 1 cup (c) or 0.24 liters (L). Broth-based soups like minestrone have around 100 calories.\n\n**Creamy Salad Dressing**\n\nRanch, peppercorn, and blue cheese dressings can turn a healthy salad into a high-fat meal. But you don't need to go totally nonfat. Instead, use a spoonful of dressing made with healthy fats such as avocados, olive oil, or yogurt. If you do choose to indulge in a creamy dressing, measure it out carefully and limit your portions to no more than 1 to 2 tablespoons (tbsp) or 15 to 30 mL.\n\n**Healthy in Small Amounts**\n\nSome foods are healthy in small amounts but can be diet-busting if consumed excessively. Here are three examples:\n\n*   **Nuts**: High in fiber, nuts are a tasty way to eat heart-healthy fat. But nuts are also high in calories. One cup of chopped nuts can contain more than 700 calories. To get a dose of protein and heart-healthy fat, limit yourself to 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of peanut butter or a small handful of unsalted nuts like almonds or walnuts.\n*   **Dried Fruit**: The drying process takes away the water and a lot of the volume, making dried fruit higher in calories and sugar than a similar portion size of fresh fruit. A cup or 160 grams (g) of dried figs has 371 calories and 71 g of sugar. Compare that to 2 large fresh figs, which have a total of 94 calories and 20 g of sugar.\n*   **Granola**: This is another food best eaten in small portions. A cup (112 g) of granola can range from 343 calories in a low-fat version you buy in the store, to 597 calories in a cup of homemade granola. Many commercial versions have added sugar and fat. Like dried fruit and nuts, granola is packed with fiber and nutrients. Read labels, pay attention to serving sizes, watch the calorie count, and eat granola in small amounts.\n\nBy being aware of these diet-busting foods and consuming them in moderation, you can maintain a healthy balance in your diet and achieve your weight loss goals.\n\n---\n\n**Diet-busting foods**\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the importance of a healthy diet and how certain foods can hinder our weight loss efforts.\n\n**The Importance of a Healthy Diet**\n\nA healthy diet is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, \"food is any substance that provides nutritional value\" (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 emphasize the importance of making healthy choices by using the dietary guidelines, MyPlate, and food labels (Snetselaar et al., 2021).\n\n**Dietary Guidelines**\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 provide a framework for making healthy choices. These guidelines are based on scientific evidence and are updated regularly to reflect new research findings. For example, the 2020-2025 guidelines recommend limiting saturated fats, which can be found in foods such as candy (Mozaffarian, 2022).\n\n**Food Label Guide**\n\nWhen shopping for food, it's essential to read the labels carefully. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics provides a guide to understanding food labels, including information on saturated fats (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website). By making informed choices, we can avoid diet-busting foods and maintain a healthy weight.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA healthy diet is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. By following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 and reading food labels carefully, we can avoid diet-busting foods and make informed choices about our nutrition. Remember, \"food is any substance that provides nutritional value\" (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website).\n\n**References**\n\nSnetselaar LG, de Jesus JM, DeSilva DM, Stoody EE.

Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.\n\nBut not all fats are the same. You should try to avoid:\n\n* Saturated fats such as butter, solid shortening, and lard\n* Trans fats. These are found in vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods, and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs). By 2018, most U.S. companies will not be allowed to add PHOs to food.\n\nTry to replace them with oils such as canola, olive, safflower, sesame, or sunflower. Of course, eating too much fat will put on the pounds.

    "content": "**Dietary Fats Explained**\n\nFats are an important part of your diet, but some types are healthier than others. Choosing healthy fats from vegetable sources more often than less healthy types from animal products can help lower your risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems.\n\n**What Are Fats?**\n\nFats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. It is essential to eat some fats, though it is also harmful to eat too much.\n\nThe fats you eat give your body energy that it needs to work properly. During exercise, your body uses calories from carbohydrates you have eaten. But after 20 minutes, exercise depends partially on calories from fat to keep you going.\n\nYou also need fat to keep your skin and hair healthy and help you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are called fat-soluble vitamins. Fat also fills your fat cells and insulates your body to help keep you warm.\n\nThe fats your body gets from your food give your body essential fatty acids called linoleic and linolenic acid. They are called \"essential\" because your body cannot make them itself, or work without them. Your body needs them for brain development, controlling inflammation, and blood clotting.\n\n**Types of Fat**\n\n*   Saturated fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol level.\n*   Unsaturated fats lower your LDL cholesterol.\n*   Monounsaturated fats include olive and canola oil.\n*   Polyunsaturated fats include safflower, sunflower, corn, and soy oil.\n*   Trans fatty acids are unhealthy fats that form when vegetable oil goes through a process called hydrogenation.\n\n**Healthy Fats vs. Unhealthy Fats**\n\nChoosing healthy fats from vegetable sources more often than less healthy types from animal products can help lower your risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems.\n\n*   Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado, nuts\n*   Unhealthy fats: butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, cream, fatty meats\n\n**How to Cut Down on Fat**\n\nIt is essential to read nutrition labels on foods. This will help you know what kinds of fats, and how much, your food contains.\n\nTalk with your health care provider about how to cut down on the amount of fat you eat. Your provider can refer you to a dietitian who can help you learn more about foods and help you plan a healthy diet.\n\n---\n\n**Dietary Fats Explained**\n\nFats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet.

Fats are called saturated or unsaturated depending on how much of each type of fatty acid they contain.\n\n*   **Saturated Fats**: Raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol level. A high LDL cholesterol level puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems.\n*   **Unsaturated Fats**: Lower your LDL cholesterol.

This leads the fat to harden and become solid at room temperature.\n\n*   **Hydrogenated Fats**: Also known as \"trans fats,\" they can raise LDL cholesterol levels in your blood and lower your HDL (good) cholesterol levels.\n*   **Limit Trans Fatty Acids**: Experts are working to limit the amount of trans fats used in packaged foods and restaurants.\n\n---\n\n**Dietary Fats Explained**\n\n**What are dietary fats?**\n\nFats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet.

A high LDL cholesterol level puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems.\n*   **Unsaturated fats**: These can help lower your LDL cholesterol. Most vegetable oils that are liquid at room temperature have unsaturated fats.\n*   **Trans fatty acids**: These are unhealthy fats that form when vegetable oil goes through a process called hydrogenation.\n\n**How can I incorporate healthy dietary fats into my diet?**\n\nEating unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats can help lower your LDL cholesterol. Most vegetable oils that are liquid at room temperature have unsaturated fats.\n\nYou should avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fats, such as animal products like butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, cream, and fatty meats.\n\nIt is also important to read nutrition labels on foods to know what kinds of fats, and how much, your food contains.\n\n---\n\n**Dietary Fats Explained**\n\nAre you confused about dietary fats? Do you know the difference between good and bad fats? In this article, we'll break down the basics of dietary fats and how they impact your health.\n\n**What are Dietary Fats?**\n\nDietary fats are a type of macronutrient that provides energy to your body. They come in three main forms: saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated.\n\n*   **Saturated Fats**: These fats are typically solid at room temperature and can be found in animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs.\n*   **Monounsaturated Fats**: These fats are liquid at room temperature and can be found in foods like avocados, olive oil, and nuts.\n*   **Polyunsaturated Fats**: These fats are also liquid at room temperature and can be found in foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, and sunflower seeds.\n\n**The Importance of Dietary Fats**\n\nDietary fats play a crucial role in maintaining good health. They help with:\n\n*   **Energy Production**: Fats provide energy to your body when carbohydrates are low.\n*   **Vitamin Absorption**: Fats help absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.\n*   **Brain Function**: Fats are essential for brain function and development.\n\n**How to Choose Healthy Dietary Fats**\n\nTo make healthy dietary choices, focus on consuming:\n\n*   **Avocados**: Rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber.\n*   **Olive Oil**: High in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants.\n*   **Fatty Fish**: Rich in polyunsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDietary fats are a vital part of a healthy diet. By understanding the differences between saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, you can make informed choices about the foods you eat. Remember to focus on consuming healthy sources of dietary fats like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Arnett DK, Blumenthal RS, Albert MA, Buroker AB, et al.

The specific treatment will depend on the specific cause of the DSD. Depending on the cause, surgery, hormone replacement, or other treatments are used to treat DSD.\n\nThere have been significant changes in treating DSD in recent years. In the past, the external genitals were prioritized over chromosomes. Expert opinion has shifted to understanding that chromosomal, neural, hormonal, psychological, and behavioral factors can all have an influence on an individual.\n\nMany experts now urge delaying definitive surgery for as long as is healthy, and ideally involving the child in the decision, unless surgery is needed for the health of the infant.\n\n---\n\n**Differences of Sex Development (DSD)**\n\nDSD is a group of conditions in which there is a discrepancy between the external and internal genitals. Intersex is an older term for DSD.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many causes of DSD, which can be divided into several categories:\n\n*   **46,XX DSD**: The person has the XX chromosomes (typically seen in females), but external genitals that appear male.\n*   **46,XY DSD**: The person has the XY chromosomes (typically seen in males), but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female.\n*   **Ovotesticular DSD**: The person has both ovarian and testicular tissue.\n*   **Complex or Undetermined DSD**: Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46,XX or 46,XY can result in disorders of sex development.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe cause of DSD may remain undetermined, even with modern diagnostic techniques.\n\n---\n\n**Differences of Sex Development**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**46,XX DSD**\n\nThe person has the XX chromosomes (typically seen in females), the ovaries of a female, but external genitals that appear male. This most often is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia (\"lips\" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse (grow together), and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes.\n\nThere are several possible causes:\n\n*   **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: This is the most common cause of 46,XX DSD.\n*   **Male hormones (such as testosterone)**: Taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy.\n*   **Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother**: These are most often ovarian tumors. Mothers who have children with 46,XX DSD should be checked for this unless there is another clear cause.\n*   **Aromatase deficiency**: This may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little can lead to 46,XX DSD. At puberty, these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**46,XY DSD**\n\nThe person has the XY chromosomes (typically seen in males), but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous (ambiguous genitalia), or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46,XY with undervirilization.\n\nFormation of normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones. Therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46,XY DSD has many possible causes:\n\n*   **Problems with the testes**: The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.\n*   **Problems with testosterone formation**: Testosterone is made through a series of chemical steps. Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46,XY DSD. Different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can also fall in this category.\n*   **Problems with using testosterone**: Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY DSD due to conditions such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).\n*   **People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency**: Lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least 5 different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty.\n*   **AIS**: The most common cause of 46,XY DSD. In this situation, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. Over 150 different defects have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**OVOTESTICULAR DSD**\n\nThe person has both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**COMPLEX OR UNDETERMINED DSD**\n\nMany chromosome configurations other than simple 46,XX or 46,XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45,XO (only one X chromosome), and 47,XXY or 47,XXX - both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in a condition in which there is a discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels and overall sexual development, due to the altered numbers of sex chromosomes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n**Differences of Sex Development**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Differences of Sex Development?**\n\nDifferences of sex development, also known as disorders of sex development (DSD), are conditions where the physical characteristics of an individual's sex do not fit into typical male or female categories. This can include variations in genitalia, chromosomes, and hormone levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of DSD**\n\nThere are several types of DSD, including:\n\n* **46,XX DSD**: A condition where a person has two X chromosomes but also has some male physical characteristics.\n* **46,XY DSD**: A condition where a person has one X and one Y chromosome but also has some female physical characteristics.\n* **Ovotesticular DSD**: A condition where a person has both ovarian and testicular tissue. This can be present in the abdomen or in the genital area.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of DSD**\n\nThe symptoms associated with intersex will depend on the underlying cause. They may include:\n\n* Ambiguous genitalia at birth\n* A very small penis (micropenis)\n* Enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly)\n* Partly fused labia\n* Undescended testes (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys\n* Labial or groin (inguinal) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls\n* The opening of the penis is somewhere other than at the tip (hypospadias); in females, the urethra (urine canal) opens into the vagina\n* Otherwise unusual-appearing genitalia at birth\n* Electrolyte abnormalities\n* Delayed or absent puberty\n* Unexpected changes at puberty\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests and exams may be done:\n\n* Chromosome analysis (karyotyping) to determine the person's genetic makeup\n* Blood tests to check levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)\n* Electrolyte tests\n* Specific molecular testing\n* Endoscopic exam (to verify the absence or presence of a vagina or cervix)\n* Ultrasound or MRI to evaluate whether internal sex organs are present (for example, a uterus)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA team of health care professionals with expertise in DSD will work together to understand and treat a child with DSD and support the family.

    "content": "**Differential Diagnosis**\n\nWhat is a differential diagnosis?\n\nDifferent health conditions often cause similar symptoms. For example, fatigue is a symptom that can be caused by anemia, depression, heart disease, thyroid disease, sleep disorders, and many other conditions. If you have fatigue or other symptoms that are linked to many conditions, your provider has to figure out which condition you have so that you get the right treatment.\n\nTo make a diagnosis, your provider will follow a careful step-by-step process of ruling out conditions that share your symptoms until it's clear which condition is most likely the cause of your illness. This process is called making a differential diagnosis.\n\nAn important step in making a differential diagnosis is to make a list of all the possible conditions that you might have. This is your differential diagnosis list. Your provider will base your list on your specific:\n\n* Symptoms\n* Medical history\n* Family health history\n* Test results\n\nA list of possible conditions helps your provider decide which tests will help confirm or rule out the conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Your test results help narrow your differential diagnosis list until it's clear which condition you have. This is your final diagnosis.\n\nThe process of making a differential diagnosis may take time, but it helps make sure your provider doesn't miss a possible cause of your symptoms. That means your final diagnosis is more likely to be accurate and you'll get the right treatment.\n\n**How is it used?**\n\nA differential diagnosis process is used to help make a final diagnosis when you have symptoms that don't have one clear cause. It can be used to help diagnose physical and mental disorders.\n\n**What happens during a differential diagnosis?**\n\nTo make a differential diagnosis, your provider has to think like a detective and follow several steps:\n\n1. **Gather clues**: Your provider will ask detailed questions about your:\n\t* Symptoms\n\t* Medical history\n\t* Medicines and supplements\n\t* Family health history\n\t* Life and habits\n2. **Physical exam**: Information from an exam gives your provider more clues about your health.\n3. **Create a differential diagnosis list**: Your provider will come up with a list of \"suspects\" -- the conditions that you may have based on information about your symptoms, health, and lifestyle.\n4. **Order tests**: Tests can help confirm or rule out the conditions on your differential diagnosis list.\n\n**Common tests to help narrow your differential diagnosis list may include:**\n\n* Lab tests, such as blood and urine (pee) tests\n* A biopsy\n* Imaging tests, such as an MRI scan, ultrasound, or x-ray\n* A mental health screening if your symptoms could be caused by a mental disorder\n\nAs test results rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, your final diagnosis should become clear. Then your provider can recommend treatment.\n\n**What do my results mean?**\n\nThe conditions on your differential diagnosis list are not your final diagnosis. They're the conditions that could cause symptoms like yours. If you have questions about these conditions, talk with your provider.\n\nYour provider will use the differential diagnosis list to choose which tests to order.

It can be used to help diagnose physical and mental disorders.\n\n**How is it Used?**\n\nTo make a differential diagnosis, your provider has to think like a detective and follow several steps:\n\n*   Gather clues by asking you about your health.\n*   Perform a physical exam.\n*   Put together a differential diagnosis list of \"suspects\" - the conditions that you may have based on information about your symptoms, health, and lifestyle.\n*   Order tests to help confirm or rule out the conditions on your list.\n\n**What Happens During a Differential Diagnosis?**\n\nTo make a differential diagnosis, your provider will ask detailed questions about your:\n\n*   Symptoms\n*   Medical history\n*   Medicines and supplements\n*   Family health history\n*   Life and habits\n\nThe second step of the differential diagnosis process is a physical exam. Information from an exam gives your provider more clues about your health.\n\nThe third step is to put together a differential diagnosis list. Your provider will come up with a list of \"suspects\" -- the conditions that you may have based on information about your symptoms, health, and lifestyle.\n\nThe fourth step is to order tests. Tests can help confirm or rule out the conditions on your differential diagnosis list. The tests you have will depend on the conditions on your list. If your list includes a serious condition that may need urgent treatment, you'll have tests for that condition first.\n\n**Common Tests to Help Narrow Your Differential Diagnosis List May Include:**\n\n*   Lab tests, such as blood and urine (pee) tests\n*   A biopsy\n*   Imaging tests, such as an MRI scan, ultrasound, or x-ray\n*   A mental health screening if your symptoms could be caused by a mental disorder\n\n**What Do My Results Mean?**\n\nThe conditions on your differential diagnosis list are not your final diagnosis. They're the conditions that could cause symptoms like yours. If you have questions about these conditions, talk with your provider.\n\nYour provider will use the differential diagnosis list to choose which tests to order. Each time you get test results, ask your provider how they affect your differential diagnosis. Test results may help your provider decide to do other tests, or they may guide treatment choices.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests, Reference Ranges, and Understanding Results.**\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Differential Diagnosis?**\n\nYour provider may recommend starting treatment before your final diagnosis is certain.
