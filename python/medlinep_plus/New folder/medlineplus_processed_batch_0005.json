    "content": "**Abortion - Procedure**\n\nAn abortion is a medical procedure that ends an undesired pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta from the woman's uterus (womb). A medication abortion uses medicine to end an undesired pregnancy.\n\nAn abortion is not the same as miscarriage. Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\n**Description**\n\nAn abortion procedure involves dilating the opening to the uterus (cervix) and placing a small suction tube into the uterus. Suction is used to remove the fetus and related pregnancy material from the uterus.\n\nBefore the procedure, you may have the following tests:\n\n*   Pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are.\n*   A urine or blood HCG test to confirm you are pregnant.\n*   A blood test to check your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future. The shot is called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands).\n*   An ultrasound test to check how many weeks pregnant you are and the location of the fetus in the uterus.\n\nDuring the procedure:\n\n*   You will lie on an exam table.\n*   You may receive medicine (sedative) to help you relax and feel sleepy.\n*   Your feet will rest in supports called stirrups. These allow your legs to be positioned so that your health care provider can view your vagina and cervix.\n*   Your provider may numb your cervix so you feel little pain during the procedure.\n*   Small rods called dilators will be put in your cervix to gently stretch it open. Sometimes laminaria (sticks of seaweed for medical use) are placed in the cervix. This is done the day before the procedure to help the cervix dilate slowly.\n*   Your provider will insert a tube into your uterus, then use a special vacuum to remove the pregnancy tissue through the tube.\n*   You may be given an antibiotic to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nAfter the procedure, you may be given medicine to help your uterus contract. This reduces bleeding.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nReasons an abortion might be considered include:\n\n*   You have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy.\n*   The fetus has a severe birth defect or genetic problem.\n*   Your pregnancy may be harmful to your health.\n*   The pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as rape or incest.\n\nThe decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. To help you weigh your choices, discuss your feelings with a counselor or your provider. A family member or friend can also be of help.\n\n**Risks**\n\nAn abortion procedure is very safe. It is very rare to have any complications.\n\nRare risks of an abortion include:\n\n*   Damage to the uterus or cervix\n*   Uterine perforation (accidentally putting a hole in the uterus with one of the instruments used)\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Infection of the uterus or fallopian tubes\n*   Scarring of the inside of the uterus\n*   Reaction to the medicines or anesthesia, such as problems breathing\n*   Not removing all of the tissue, requiring another procedure\n\n---\n\n**Abortion - procedure**\n\nAn abortion is a medical procedure that ends an undesired pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta from the woman's uterus (womb).

Be sure to make arrangements to prevent pregnancy, especially during the first month after the procedure.

    "content": "**Absence Seizure**\n\nAn absence seizure is a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) change in awareness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSeizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may also occur with other types of seizures, such as bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may:\n\n* Occur many times a day\n* Occur for weeks to months before being noticed\n* Interfere with school and learning\n* Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior\n\nUnexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may:\n\n* Stop walking and start again a few seconds later\n* Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later\n\nThe person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually:\n\n* Wide awake\n* Thinking clearly\n* Unaware of the seizure\n\nSpecific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include:\n\n* Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing\n* Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities\n\nSome absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An electroencephalogram (EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your provider can tell you more about these options.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSeizure - petit mal; Seizure - absence; Petit mal seizure; Epilepsy - absence seizure; Non-motor generalized seizure\n\n---\n\n**Absence Seizure**\n\nAn absence seizure is a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) change in awareness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSeizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years.\n\nIn some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates).\n\nThey may also occur with other types of seizures, such as bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes.

During an absence seizure, a person may experience a brief loss of consciousness, usually lasting only a few seconds.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of an absence seizure can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n* A blank or staring expression\n* Inability to respond to questions or commands\n* No muscle spasms or convulsions\n* Seizures may occur frequently, sometimes several times a day\n\n**Causes and Diagnosis**\n\nThe causes of absence seizures are not fully understood, but they are often associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. To diagnose an absence seizure, a healthcare provider will typically perform the following tests:\n\n* Physical exam to check for signs of neurological problems\n* Head CT or MRI scan to rule out other health issues causing the seizures\n* Blood and urine tests to check for underlying medical conditions\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brain electrical activity\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for absence seizures may include:\n\n* Medicines to control seizure frequency and severity\n* Lifestyle changes, such as adjusting diet and activity levels, for adults and children\n* In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat underlying neurological conditions\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAbsence seizures are also known by the following names:\n\n* Petit mal seizure\n* Seizure - absence\n* Epilepsy - absence seizure\n* Non-motor generalized seizure\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you or a loved one has been diagnosed with an absence seizure, consider asking your healthcare provider the following questions:\n\n* What are the best ways to manage my seizures?\n* How can I adjust my lifestyle to reduce seizure frequency?\n* Are there any alternative treatments or medications that may be effective for me?\n\n**References**\n\nThe information provided in this article is based on the following sources:\n\n* Abou-Khalil BW, Gallagher MJ, Macdonald RL.

This can be caused by various factors, including genetic disorders, birth defects, and hormonal imbalances.\n\n**Causes of absent menstrual periods - primary**\n\nThe causes of absent menstrual periods - primary can be divided into several categories:\n\n*   **Genetic disorders**: Certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome, can cause absent menstrual periods.\n*   **Birth defects**: Birth defects of the female organs, such as a missing or abnormal uterus, can also cause absent menstrual periods.\n*   **Hormonal imbalances**: Hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can also cause absent menstrual periods.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma**: A tumor near the pituitary gland at the base of the brain can also cause absent menstrual periods.\n\n**Symptoms of absent menstrual periods - primary**\n\nThe symptoms of absent menstrual periods - primary may include:\n\n*   **No menstruation**: The most obvious symptom is the absence of menstruation.\n*   **Delayed puberty**: Girls with absent menstrual periods may experience delayed puberty.\n*   **Infertility**: Women with absent menstrual periods may experience infertility.\n\n**Diagnosis of absent menstrual periods - primary**\n\nThe diagnosis of absent menstrual periods - primary typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. The provider will ask questions about the girl's or woman's menstrual cycle, including:\n\n*   **Age of onset**: When did menstruation start?\n*   **Frequency and duration**: How often does menstruation occur, and how long does it last?\n\n**Treatment of absent menstrual periods - primary**\n\nThe treatment of absent menstrual periods - primary depends on the underlying cause. Treatment may include hormone medicines, surgery, or other interventions.\n\nIf the amenorrhea is caused by a tumor in the brain:\n\n*   **Medicines**: Medicines may shrink certain types of tumors.\n*   **Surgery**: Surgery to remove the tumor may also be needed.\n*   **Radiation therapy**: Radiation therapy is usually only done when other treatments have not worked.\n\nIf the problem is caused by a systemic disease, treatment of the disease may allow menstruation to begin.\n\nIf the cause is bulimia, anorexia or too much exercise, periods will often begin when the weight returns to normal or the exercise level is decreased.\n\nIf the amenorrhea cannot be corrected, hormone medicines can sometimes be used. Medicines can help the woman feel more like her friends and female family members. They can also protect the bones from becoming too thin (osteoporosis).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the cause of the amenorrhea and whether it can be corrected with treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\nPeriods are not likely to start on their own if the amenorrhea was caused by one of the following conditions:\n\n*   **Birth defects**: Birth defects of the female organs.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma**: A tumor near the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.\n*   **Cystic fibrosis**: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that can cause absent menstrual periods.\n*   **Genetic disorders**: Certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome.\n\nYou may have emotional distress because you feel different from friends or family. Or, you may worry that you might not be able to have children.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your daughter is older than 15 and has not yet begun menstruating, or if she is 14 or older and shows no other signs of puberty.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPrimary amenorrhea; No periods - primary; Absent periods - primary; Absent menses - primary; Absence of periods - primary\n\n---\n\n**Absent Menstrual Periods**\n\n**Etiology, Diagnostic Evaluation, and Management**\n\nIn: Gershenson DM, Lentz GM, Valea FA, Lobo RA, eds.

    "content": "**Absent Menstrual Periods - Secondary**\n\nAbsent menstrual periods, also known as secondary amenorrhea, is a condition where a woman who has been having normal menstrual cycles stops getting her periods for 6 months or longer.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSecondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes.\n\nWomen who take birth control pills or hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months.\n\nYou are more likely to have absent periods if you:\n\n* Are obese\n* Exercise too much and for long periods of time\n* Have low body fat (less than 15% to 17%)\n* Have severe anxiety or emotional distress\n* Lose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, from strict or extreme diets or after gastric bypass surgery)\n\nOther causes include:\n\n* Drugs for cancer treatment\n* Medicines to treat schizophrenia or psychosis\n* Overactive thyroid gland\n* Pituitary tumors\n* Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n* Reduced function of the ovaries\n* Premature ovarian failure\n\nAlso, procedures such as a dilation and curettage (D and C) can cause scar tissue to form. This tissue may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome. Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn addition to having no menstrual periods, other symptoms can include:\n\n* Breast size changes\n* Weight gain or weight loss\n* Discharge from the breast or change in breast size\n* Acne and increased hair growth in a male pattern\n* Vaginal dryness\n* Voice changes\n\nIf amenorrhea is caused by a pituitary tumor, there may be other symptoms related to the tumor, such as vision loss and headache.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam and pelvic exam must be done to check for pregnancy. A pregnancy test will be done.\n\nBlood tests may be done to check hormone levels, including:\n\n* Estradiol levels\n* Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH level)\n* Luteinizing hormone (LH level)\n* Prolactin level\n* Testosterone level\n* Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\n\nOther tests that may be performed include:\n\n* CT scan or MRI scan of the head to look for tumors\n* Biopsy of the lining of the uterus\n* Genetic testing\n* Ultrasound of the pelvis or hysterosonogram (pelvic ultrasound that involves putting saline solution inside the uterus)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Normal monthly periods most often return after the condition is treated.\n\nA lack of menstrual period due to obesity, vigorous exercise, or weight loss may respond to a change in exercise routine or weight control (gain or loss, as needed).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Many of the conditions that cause secondary amenorrhea will respond to treatment.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSee your primary health care provider or women's health care provider if you have missed more than one period so you can get diagnosed and treated, if needed.\n\n---\n\n**Absent Menstrual Periods - Secondary**\n\n**Causes**\n\nSecondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body.

    "content": "**Absent Pulmonary Valve**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve is a rare congenital defect where the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed. Oxygen-poor blood flows through this valve from the heart to the lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. It often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot, found in about 3% to 6% of people who have this condition.\n\nWhen the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen. In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect), leading to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body.\n\nThe skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis) due to the body's blood containing a low amount of oxygen. Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged branch pulmonary arteries, which can press on the tubes that bring oxygen into the lungs, causing breathing problems.\n\nOther heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Abnormal tricuspid valve\n* Atrial septal defect\n* Double outlet right ventricle\n* Ductus arteriosis\n* Endocardial cushion defect\n* Marfan syndrome\n* Tricuspid atresia\n* Absent left pulmonary artery\n\nHeart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include:\n\n* Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis)\n* Coughing\n* Failure to thrive\n* Poor appetite\n* Rapid breathing\n* Respiratory failure\n* Wheezing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram). During an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest.\n\nTests for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Heart CT scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart\n\n**Treatment**\n\nInfants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later.\n\nDepending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve:\n\n* Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect)\n* Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis)\n* Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs\n\nTypes of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways\n* Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication and reduction arterioplasty)\n* Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs\n* Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue\n\nInfants with severe breathing symptoms may need to get oxygen or be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) before and after surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout surgery, there may be a risk for serious consequences. In many cases, surgery can treat the condition and relieve symptoms. Outcomes are most often very good.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Brain infection (abscess)\n* Lung collapse (atelectasis)\n* Pneumonia\n* Right-sided heart failure\n* Stroke\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your infant has symptoms of absent pulmonary valve. If you have a family history of heart defects, talk to your provider before or during pregnancy.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAlthough there is no way to prevent this condition, families may be evaluated to determine their risk for congenital defects.\n\n---\n\n**Absent Pulmonary Valve**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed.

It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include:\n\n* Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis)\n* Coughing\n* Failure to thrive\n* Poor appetite\n* Rapid breathing\n* Respiratory failure\n* Wheezing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram). During an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest. Tests for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Heart CT scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart\n\n**Treatment**\n\nInfants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later. Depending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve:\n\n* Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect)\n* Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis)\n* Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs\n\nTypes of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways\n* Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication and reduction arterioplasty)\n* Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs\n* Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue\n\nInfants with severe breathing symptoms may need to get oxygen or be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) before and after surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout surgery, there may be a risk for serious consequences. In many cases, surgery can treat the condition and relieve symptoms. Outcomes are most often very good.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Brain infection (abscess)\n* Lung collapse (atelectasis)\n* Pneumonia\n* Right-sided heart failure\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Absent Pulmonary Valve**\n\n**What is absent pulmonary valve?**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve, also known as pulmonary valve agenesis, is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve is missing or underdeveloped. This condition can lead to increased blood flow through the lungs, causing them to become overinflated and potentially leading to respiratory problems.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of absent pulmonary valve is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations during fetal development. Families with a history of congenital heart defects may be at higher risk for this condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants born with absent pulmonary valve may exhibit symptoms such as:\n\n* Respiratory distress\n* Cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin)\n* Failure to thrive\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through echocardiography, which uses sound waves to create images of the heart. Other diagnostic tests may include chest X-rays and electrocardiograms.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for absent pulmonary valve depends on the severity of the condition and may involve:\n\n* Medications to manage symptoms\n* Oxygen therapy to help increase oxygen levels in the blood\n* Surgery to repair or replace the pulmonary valve\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with absent pulmonary valve varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many individuals can lead normal lives.\n\n**References**\n\nBernstein D. General principles of treatment of congenital heart disease.

    "content": "**Acarbose: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAcarbose is used (with diet only or diet and other medications) to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Acarbose works by slowing the action of certain chemicals that break down food to release glucose (sugar) into your blood. Slowing food digestion helps keep blood glucose from rising very high after meals.\n\nOver time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAcarbose comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day. It is very important to take each dose with the first bite of each main meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take acarbose exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nContinue to take acarbose even if you feel well. Do not stop taking acarbose without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Acarbose: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking acarbose, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acarbose or any other drugs. Also, inform them about all prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially other medications for diabetes, digoxin (Lanoxin), diuretics ('water pills'), estrogens, isoniazid, medications for high blood pressure or colds, oral contraceptives, pancreatic enzymes, phenytoin (Dilantin), steroids, thyroid medications, and vitamins. Additionally, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ketoacidosis, cirrhosis, or intestinal disease such as inflammatory bowel disease or bowel obstruction.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nBe sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is essential to eat a healthful diet. Alcohol may cause a decrease in blood sugar; ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking acarbose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If you will be having a snack soon, take a dose with the snack. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nWhen used in combination with insulin or other medications used to treat diabetes, acarbose may cause excessive lowering of blood sugar levels. If you have any of these symptoms, glucose products (Insta-Glucose or B-D Glucose tablets) should be used and you should call your doctor. Because acarbose blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or other products containing these sugars will not help to increase blood sugar.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Acatalasemia**\n\nAcatalasemia is a condition characterized by very low levels of an enzyme called catalase. Many people with acatalasemia never have any health problems related to the condition and are diagnosed because they have affected family members.\n\nSome of the first reported individuals with acatalasemia developed open sores (ulcers) inside the mouth that led to the death of soft tissue (gangrene). When mouth ulcers and gangrene occur with acatalasemia, the condition is known as Takahara disease. These complications are rarely seen in more recent cases of acatalasemia, probably because of improvements in oral hygiene.\n\nStudies suggest that people with acatalasemia have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of diabetes. A higher percentage of people with acatalasemia have type 2 diabetes than in the general population, and the disease tends to develop at an earlier age (in a person's thirties or forties, on average). Researchers speculate that acatalasemia could also be a risk factor for other common, complex diseases; however, only a small number of cases have been studied.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nMore than 100 cases of acatalasemia have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers estimate that the condition occurs in about 1 in 12,500 people in Japan, 1 in 20,000 people in Hungary, and 1 in 25,000 people in Switzerland. The prevalence of acatalasemia in other populations is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CAT gene can cause acatalasemia. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme catalase, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide molecules into oxygen and water. Hydrogen peroxide is produced through chemical reactions within cells. At low levels, it is involved in several chemical signaling pathways, but at high levels it is toxic to cells. If hydrogen peroxide is not broken down by catalase, additional reactions convert it into compounds called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.\n\nA shortage of this enzyme can allow hydrogen peroxide to build up to toxic levels in certain cells. For example, hydrogen peroxide produced by bacteria in the mouth may accumulate in and damage soft tissues, leading to mouth ulcers and gangrene.\n\n---\n\n**Acatalasemia: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAcatalasemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of the CAT gene in each cell have mutations. When both copies of the gene are altered, the activity of catalase is reduced to less than 10 percent of normal.\n\nWhen only one of the two copies of the CAT gene has a mutation, the activity of catalase is reduced by approximately half. This reduction in catalase activity is often called hypocatalasemia. Like acatalasemia, hypocatalasemia usually does not cause any health problems.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Acatalasia\n* Catalase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Acatalasia\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Acatalasemia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ACATALASEMIA\n\n---\n\n**Acatalasemia: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/3)**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   ACATALASEMIA\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Acatalasia\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   Acatalasemia\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   ACATALASEMIA\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Goth L, Eaton JW.

    "content": "**Acebutolol: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Acebutolol?**\n\nAcebutolol is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and certain irregular heart rhythms. It belongs to a class of medications called beta blockers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does Acebutolol Work?**\n\nAcebutolol works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, which improves blood flow and decreases blood pressure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the Possible Risks of Using Acebutolol?**\n\nHigh blood pressure can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. If left untreated, it may lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and more.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should I Use Acebutolol?**\n\nAcebutolol comes as a capsule to take by mouth, usually once or twice a day. Take it around the same time(s) every day to help you remember. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of acebutolol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust. Continue taking acebutolol even if you feel well, as it controls your condition but does not cure it.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Should I Know About Stopping Acebutolol?**\n\nDo not stop taking acebutolol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking acebutolol, you may experience serious heart problems such as angina (chest pain), heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually over 2 weeks.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Uses for Acebutolol**\n\nAcebutolol is also used sometimes to treat chest pain (angina). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Acebutolol: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking acebutolol, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acebutolol, any other medications, or any ingredients in acebutolol capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking while you are taking acebutolol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with acebutolol: nasal decongestants such as oxymetazoline (Afrin, Neo-Synephrine, Vicks Sinex, others) or cough and cold combination products that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking acebutolol. Do not start any of these medications while taking acebutolol without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have a slow or irregular heart rate or heart failure. Your doctor may tell you not to take acebutolol.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart, kidney, or liver disease; asthma or other lung diseases; problems with blood circulation; diabetes; or hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). Also tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction to a food or any other substance.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking acebutolol, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking acebutolol.\n\nYou should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nYou should know that acebutolol may increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and prevent the warning signs and symptoms that would tell you that your blood sugar is low. Let your doctor know if you are unable to eat or drink normally or are vomiting while you are taking acebutolol. You should know the symptoms of low blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n\nYou should know that if you have allergic reactions to different substances, your reactions may be worse while you are using acebutolol, and your allergic reactions may not respond to the usual doses of injectable epinephrine.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAcebutolol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* dizziness\n* lightheadedness\n* excessive tiredness\n* headache\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* upset stomach\n* nausea\n* muscle or joint pain\n* difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

Iron accumulation in the brain results in neurological problems that generally appear in adulthood and worsen over time.\n\nPeople with aceruloplasminemia develop a variety of movement problems. They may experience involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia) of the head and neck, resulting in repetitive movements and contortions. Other involuntary movements may also occur, such as rhythmic shaking (tremors), jerking movements (chorea), eyelid twitching (blepharospasm), and grimacing. Affected individuals may also have difficulty with coordination (ataxia). Some develop psychiatric problems and a decline of intellectual function (dementia) in their forties or fifties.\n\nIn addition to neurological problems, affected individuals may have diabetes mellitus caused by iron damage to cells in the pancreas that make insulin, a hormone that helps control levels of blood sugar, also called blood glucose. Iron accumulation in the pancreas reduces the cells' ability to make insulin, which impairs blood glucose regulation and leads to the signs and symptoms of diabetes.\n\nIron accumulation in the tissues and organs results in a corresponding shortage (deficiency) of iron in the blood, leading to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Anemia and diabetes usually occur by the time an affected person is in his or her twenties.\n\nAffected individuals also have changes in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina) caused by excess iron. The changes result in small opaque spots and areas of tissue degeneration (atrophy) around the edges of the retina. These abnormalities usually do not affect vision but can be observed during an eye examination.\n\nThe specific features of aceruloplasminemia and their severity may vary, even within the same family.\n\n---\n\n**Aceruloplasminemia**\n\n**What is Aceruloplasminemia?**\n\nAceruloplasminemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of iron in various organs, including the brain, liver, and pancreas. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Causes of Aceruloplasminemia**\n\nMutations in the CP gene cause aceruloplasminemia. The CP gene provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin, which is involved in iron transport and processing. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body and prepares it for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports it to red blood cells to help carry oxygen.\n\n**Symptoms of Aceruloplasminemia**\n\nPeople with aceruloplasminemia develop a variety of movement problems, including involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors, chorea, blepharospasm, and grimacing. Affected individuals may also have difficulty with coordination (ataxia) and experience psychiatric problems and a decline of intellectual function (dementia). In addition to neurological problems, affected individuals may have diabetes mellitus caused by iron damage to cells in the pancreas that make insulin.\n\n**Frequency of Aceruloplasminemia**\n\nAceruloplasminemia has been seen worldwide, but its overall prevalence is unknown. Studies in Japan have estimated that approximately 1 in 2 million adults in this population are affected.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nDeficiency of ferroxidase, Familial apoceruloplasmin deficiency, Hereditary ceruloplasmin deficiency, Hypoceruloplasminemia, Systemic hemosiderosis due to aceruloplasminemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Deficiency of ferroxidase\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Aceruloplasminemia\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ACERULOPLASMINEMIA; ACEP\n\n---\n\n**Aceruloplasminemia**\n\n**What is Aceruloplasminemia?**\n\nAceruloplasminemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired iron homeostasis in the central nervous system.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene, which codes for a protein involved in iron metabolism. The risk of developing aceruloplasminemia is highest among individuals with a family history of the disorder.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of aceruloplasminemia may include:\n\n*   Impaired cognitive function\n*   Motor dysfunction\n*   Seizures\n*   Ataxia\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for aceruloplasminemia, but treatment may involve managing symptoms and preventing complications. In some cases, iron supplementation may be recommended to help alleviate symptoms.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with aceruloplasminemia varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. In general, the disorder is associated with a poor prognosis, and most individuals experience significant cognitive and motor impairment over time.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Berg D, Youdim MB.

This may cause serious and sometimes deadly liver damage.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Acetaminophen Level Test?**\n\nYour provider may order this test if you or your child has symptoms of an overdose. When you take too much of the medicine, your liver cannot process the excessive dose and it can build up in your body. Symptoms may happen as soon as two to three hours after taking the medicine but can take as long as 12 hours to appear.\n\n**What Happens During an Acetaminophen Level Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to an Acetaminophen Level Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf results show a high level of acetaminophen, you or your child may be at risk for liver damage and may need immediate treatment. The type of treatment will depend on how much excess acetaminophen is in your system. After you get your results, your provider may recommend other tests or treatment. They may repeat this test every four to six hours to make sure you are out of danger.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About an Acetaminophen Level Test?**\n\nBefore you or your child take any medicine, read the label carefully. Make sure that you only use the recommended dose. Check the ingredient list to see whether the medicines contain acetaminophen so that you don't take too much. Some common medicines that may contain acetaminophen include:\n\n* Nyquil\n* Dayquil\n* Dristan\n* Contact\n* Theraflu\n* Actifed\n* Mucinex\n* Sudafed\n\nAlso, if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages a day, ask your provider if it is safe to take acetaminophen. Drinking alcohol while taking acetaminophen can increase your risk of liver damage.\n\nKeep medicines out of reach of children and don't take medicines with acetaminophen for more than ten days without talking to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Acetaminophen Level Test**\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nThe test is used to find out if you or your child has taken too much acetaminophen.

    "content": "**Acetaminophen Rectal**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nAcetaminophen rectal is used to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches or muscle aches and to reduce a fever. Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAcetaminophen rectal comes as a suppository to use rectally. Acetaminophen rectal is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen to treat certain conditions. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nIf you are giving acetaminophen rectal to your child, read the package label carefully to make sure that it is the right product for the age of the child. Do not give children acetaminophen products that are made for adults. Some products for adults and older children may contain too much acetaminophen for a younger child.\n\nMany acetaminophen products also come in combination with other medications such as those to treat cough and cold symptoms. Check product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking or using them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.\n\nStop giving acetaminophen rectal to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling, or your child's pain lasts for longer than 5 days, or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days.\n\nTo insert an acetaminophen suppository into the rectum, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands.\n*   Remove the wrapper.\n*   Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)\n*   Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in infants and children and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.\n*   Remain lying down for 5 minutes to prevent the suppository from coming out.\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Acetaminophen Rectal: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n*Other uses for this medicine*\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using acetaminophen rectal, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetaminophen, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the product. Ask your pharmacist or check the label on the package for a list of ingredients.\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, or herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), certain medications for seizures including carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenobarbital, and phenytoin (Dilantin); or medications for pain, fever, coughs, and colds. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\nTell your doctor if you have ever developed a rash or skin blister after taking or using acetaminophen.\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease or if you drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day.\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using acetaminophen rectal, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that using too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage. You might accidentally use too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you use more than one product that contains acetaminophen.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nThis medication is usually used as needed. If your doctor has told you to use acetaminophen rectal regularly, use the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAcetaminophen rectal may cause side effects.\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using acetaminophen rectal and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical attention:\nred, peeling, or blistering skin\nrash\n\nAcetaminophen may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while you are using this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

Take acetaminophen and codeine exactly as directed. Do not take more of it, take it more often, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor.\n\n* Discuss with your health care provider your pain treatment goals, length of treatment, and other ways to manage your pain.\n* Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.\n\nThere is a greater risk that you will overuse acetaminophen and codeine if you have or have ever had any of these conditions.

Acetaminophen and codeine should never be used to treat pain or cough in children younger than 12 years of age or to relieve pain after surgery to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids in children younger than 18 years of age.\n\nAcetaminophen and codeine should not be used in children 12 to 18 years of age who are obese or who have a neuromuscular disease (disease that affects the nerves that control voluntary muscles), a lung disease, or obstructive sleep apnea (condition in which the airway becomes blocked or narrow and breathing stops for short periods during sleep) as these conditions may increase their risk of breathing problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Liver Damage**\n\nTaking too much acetaminophen (found in this combination preparation) can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. You might accidentally take too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you take more than one product that contains acetaminophen.\n\n* Be aware that you should not take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen per day.\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you need to take more than one product that contains acetaminophen, it may be difficult for you to calculate the total amount of acetaminophen you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to help you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interactions with Other Medications**\n\nTaking certain medications during your treatment with acetaminophen and codeine may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take any of the following medications:\n\n* Certain antifungal medications including itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), ketoconazole, and voriconazole (Vfend);\n* Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), and triazolam (Halcion);\n* Carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, Teril);\n* Erythromycin (Erytab, Erythrocin);\n* Certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), and ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra);\n* Muscle relaxants;\n* Other pain medications;\n* Phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek);\n* Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate);\n* Sedatives;\n* Sleeping pills;\n* Tranquilizers.\n\nYour doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.

You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n**Habit Forming**\n\nThe combination of acetaminophen and codeine may be habit forming, especially with prolonged use. Take acetaminophen and codeine exactly as directed. Do not take more of it, take it more often, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor.\n\n**Breathing Problems**\n\nThe combination of acetaminophen and codeine may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma.\n\n**Other Warnings**\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a head injury, brain tumor, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weak or malnourished due to disease.\n\n**Symptoms to Watch For**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.\n\n**Children and Acetaminophen and Codeine**\n\nAcetaminophen and codeine should never be used to treat pain or cough in children younger than 12 years of age or to relieve pain after surgery to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids in children younger than 18 years of age.\n\n---\n\n**Acetaminophen and Codeine**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of acetaminophen and codeine is used to relieve mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body. Codeine belongs to a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics and to a class of medications called antitussives. When codeine is used to treat pain, it works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. When codeine is used to reduce coughing, it works by decreasing the activity in the part of the brain that causes coughing.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of acetaminophen and codeine comes as a tablet, capsule, and liquid to take by mouth. It usually is taken every 4 hours as needed. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take acetaminophen and codeine exactly as directed.\n\nIf you have taken acetaminophen and codeine for several weeks or longer, do not stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor.

Ask your pharmacist for the instructions or visit the manufacturer's website to get the instructions. If symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives.\n\nYour symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\nIf someone takes more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen and codeine, get medical help immediately, even if the person does not have any symptoms.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a615021.html",
    "content": "**Acetylcysteine Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAcetylcysteine inhalation is used along with other treatments to relieve chest congestion due to thick or abnormal mucous secretions in people with lung conditions including asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes problems with breathing, digestion, and reproduction). Acetylcysteine is in a class of medications called mucolytic agents. It works by thinning the mucus in the air passages to make it easier to cough up the mucus and clear the airways.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAcetylcysteine comes as a solution (liquid) and concentrated solution to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). When using a nebulizer, it is usually used 3 to 4 times a day. When given by other methods, acetylcysteine should be used as directed. Use acetylcysteine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use acetylcysteine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Only mix acetylcysteine with other medications if instructed to do so by your doctor.\n\nThe concentrated solution of acetylcysteine should be mixed with normal saline or sterile water and used within an hour.\n\nThere may be a slight unpleasant odor when you use acetylcysteine that goes away quickly. In an opened bottle of acetylcysteine, there may be a color change to a light purple, but it will not affect use.\n\nAcetylcysteine should only be used with nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Acetylcysteine should not be routinely used in a hand bulb operated nebulizer or put directly into a heated nebulizer. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the correct nebulizer to use with acetylcysteine.\n\nClean your nebulizer immediately following each use. If you do not clean your nebulizer properly, the nebulizer may become clogged and may not allow medication to be inhaled. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAcetylcysteine is also sometimes used to treat people who have taken or received an overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Acetylcysteine Oral Inhalation**\n\n**What is this medication used for?**\n\nThis medication is used to treat people with certain respiratory conditions, such as chronic bronchitis or asthma. It may also be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using acetylcysteine:\n\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetylcysteine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in acetylcysteine inhalation. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma.\n* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using acetylcysteine, call your doctor.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nUse the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAcetylcysteine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* fever\n* runny nose\n* swelling of the inside of the mouth\n* throat irritation\n* drowsiness\n* cool, moist skin\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Achalasia**\n\nThe tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is the esophagus or food pipe. Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent.\n\nThis problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus.\n\nOther problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes Chagas disease, which is more common in Mexico and Central and South America.\n\nAchalasia is rare.

It uses a flexible tube and camera.\n* Upper GI x-ray.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve:\n\n* Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the benefit wears off within a few weeks or months.\n* Medicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers -- These medicines can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. But there is rarely a long-term solution with medicines to treat achalasia.\n* Surgery (called a myotomy) -- In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. This procedure is usually performed using a laparoscope. It can now sometimes be performed during EGD instead of traditional surgery.\n* Widening (dilation) of the esophagus -- This is done during EGD by stretching the LES with a balloon dilator.\n\nYour health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar.

    "content": "**Aches and Pains During Pregnancy**\n\nDuring pregnancy, your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the other common symptoms during pregnancy, you will often notice new aches and pains.\n\n*   **Headaches**\n    Headaches are common during pregnancy. Before you take medicine for your headache, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take. Other than medicine, relaxation techniques may help.\n    Headaches can be a sign of preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy). If your headaches get worse, and they do not go away easily when you rest and take acetaminophen (Tylenol), especially toward the end of your pregnancy, tell your provider.\n\n*   **Pain in Your Lower Abdomen (Belly) or Groin**\n    Most often, this happens between 18 and 24 weeks. When you feel stretching or pain, move slowly or change positions. This is called round ligament pain and may be helped by wearing a maternity girdle.\n    Mild aches and pains lasting for short periods of time are normal. But see your provider right away if you have constant, severe abdominal pain, possible contractions, or you have pain and are bleeding or have fever. These are symptoms that can indicate more severe problems, such as:\n\n        *   **Placental Abruption**\n            The placenta separates from the uterus.\n        *   **Preterm Labor**\n        *   **Gallbladder Disease**\n        *   **Appendicitis**\n\n*   **Numbness and Tingling**\n    As your uterus grows, it may press on the nerves in your legs. This may cause some numbness and tingling (feeling of pins and needles) in your legs and toes. This is normal and will go away after you give birth (it may take a few weeks to months).\n    You may also have numbness or tingling in your fingers and hands. You may notice it more often when you wake up in the morning. This also goes away after you give birth, though not always right away.\n    If it is uncomfortable, you can wear a wrist brace at night. Ask your provider where to get one.\n    Have your provider check any persistent numbness, tingling, or weakness in any extremity to ensure there is not a more serious problem.\n\n*   **Backache**\n    Pregnancy strains your back and posture. To avoid or reduce backaches, you can:\n\n        *   **Stay Physically Fit, Walk, and Stretch Regularly**\n        *   **Wear Low-Heeled Shoes**\n        *   **Sleep on Your Side with a Pillow Between Your Legs**\n        *   **Sit in a Chair with Good Back Support**\n        *   **Avoid Standing for Too Long**\n        *   **Bend Your Knees When Picking Things Up. Do Not Bend at the Waist.**\n        *   **Avoid Lifting Heavy Objects**\n        *   **Avoid Gaining Too Much Weight**\n        *   **Use Heat or Cold on the Sore Part of Your Back**\n        *   **Have Someone Massage or Rub the Sore Part of Your Back. If You Go to a Professional Massage Therapist, Let Them Know You Are Pregnant.**\n        *   **Do Back Exercises That Your Provider Suggests to Relieve Back Stress and Maintain a Healthy Posture**\n        *   **Wear a Maternity Girdle**\n\n*   **Leg Aches and Pains**\n    The extra weight you carry when you are pregnant can make your legs and back hurt.\n    Your body will also make a hormone that loosens ligaments throughout your body to prepare you for childbirth. However, these looser ligaments are more easily injured, most often in your back, so be careful when you lift and exercise.\n    Leg cramps are common in the last months of pregnancy. Sometimes stretching your legs before bed will reduce the cramps. Your provider can show you how to safely stretch.\n    Watch for pain and swelling in one leg, but not the other. This can be a sign of a blood clot. Let your provider know if this happens.\n\n**References**\n\nCline MK, Young N. Antepartum care. In: Kellerman RD, Rakel DP, Heidelbaugh JJ, Lee EM, eds.

    "content": "**Achilles Tendinitis**\n\n_Achilles tendinitis occurs when the tendon that connects the back of your leg to your heel becomes swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot._\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Heel pain is most often due to overuse of the foot.\n*   Rarely, it is caused by an injury.\n*   Tendinitis due to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes.\n*   Achilles tendinitis may be more likely to occur if:\n    *   There is a sudden increase in the amount or intensity of an activity.\n    *   Your calf muscles are very tight (not stretched out).\n    *   You run on hard surfaces, such as concrete.\n    *   You run too often.\n    *   You jump a lot (such as when playing basketball).\n    *   You do not wear shoes that give your feet proper support.\n    *   Your foot suddenly turns in or out.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Symptoms include pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running.\n*   The area may feel painful and stiff in the morning.\n*   The tendon may be painful to touch or move. The area may be swollen and warm.\n*   You may have trouble standing up on your toes.\n*   You may also have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably due to pain in the back of your heel.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   The health care provider will perform a physical exam. They will look for tenderness along the tendon and pain in the area of the tendon when you stand on your toes.\n*   X-rays can help diagnose bone problems.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main treatments for Achilles tendinitis do not involve surgery. It is important to remember that it may take at least 2 to 3 months for the pain to go away.\n\nTry putting ice on the Achilles tendon area for 15 to 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times per day. Remove the ice if the area gets numb.\n\nChanges in activity may help manage the symptoms:\n\n*   Decrease or stop any activity that causes pain.\n*   Run or walk on smoother and softer surfaces.\n*   Switch to biking, swimming, or other activities that put less stress on the Achilles tendon.\n\nYour provider or physical therapist can show you stretching exercises or eccentric loading exercises for the Achilles tendon.\n\nYou may also need to make changes in your footwear, such as:\n\n*   Using a brace, boot or cast to keep the heel and tendon still and allow the swelling to go down\n*   Placing heel lifts in the shoe under the heel\n*   Wearing shoes that are softer in the areas over and under the heel cushion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can help ease pain or swelling.\n\nOther treatments include injections, such as platelet rich plasma or steroids, to reduce the inflammation. However, the tendon can become even weaker following injection and should be protected after the injections.\n\nIf these treatments do not improve symptoms, you may need surgery to remove inflamed tissue and abnormal areas of the tendon. If there is a bone spur irritating the tendon, surgery can be used to remove the spur.\n\nExtracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may be an alternative to surgery for people who have not responded to other treatments. This treatment uses low-dose sound waves.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn most cases, lifestyle changes help improve symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms may return if you do not limit activities that cause pain, or if you do not maintain the strength and flexibility of the tendon.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAchilles tendinitis may make you more likely to have an Achilles rupture. This condition most often causes a sharp pain that feels as if you have been hit in the back of the heel with a stick. Surgical repair is often necessary. However, the surgery may not be as successful as usual because there is already damage to the tendon due to pre-existing tendonitis.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have pain in the heel around the Achilles tendon that is worse with activity.\n*   You have sharp pain and are unable to walk or push-off without extreme pain or weakness.\n\n---\n\n**Achilles Tendinitis**\n\n_Achilles tendinitis occurs when the tendon that connects the back of your leg to your heel becomes swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot._\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Overuse of the foot, particularly in younger people\n*   Sudden increase in activity or intensity\n*   Tight calf muscles\n*   Running on hard surfaces\n*   Flat feet\n*   Arthritis, leading to bone spurs or growths that irritate the tendon\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running\n*   Stiffness and pain in the morning\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main treatments for Achilles tendinitis do not involve surgery.

You can tear your Achilles tendon if you land hard on your heel during sports, from a jump, accelerating when you are pushing off, or when stepping into a hole.\n\n**Surgery to Repair the Achilles Tendon**\n\nSurgery to repair the Achilles tendon is done if your Achilles tendon has a complete tear.\n\n**Description of the Procedure**\n\nTo fix your torn Achilles tendon, the surgeon will:\n\n*   Make a cut down the back of your heel\n*   Make several small cuts rather than one large cut\n\nAfter that, the surgeon will:\n\n*   Bring the ends of your tendon together\n*   Sew the ends together\n*   Stitch the wound closed\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nBefore surgery is considered, you and your health care provider will talk about ways to take care of your Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nYou may need this surgery if your Achilles tendon has torn and separated.\n\nYou need your Achilles tendon to point your toes and push off your foot when walking. If your Achilles tendon is not fixed, you can have problems walking up stairs or rising up on your toes. However, studies have shown that Achilles tendon tears can be treated without surgery and have similar outcomes. Talk to your provider about which course of treatment is best for you.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks from anesthesia and surgery are:\n\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Bleeding or infection\n\nPossible problems from Achilles tendon repair are:\n\n*   Damage to nerves in the foot\n*   Foot swelling\n*   Problems with blood flow to the foot\n*   Wound healing problems, which may require more surgeries\n*   Scaring of the Achilles tendon\n*   Blood clot or deep vein thrombosis\n*   Some loss of calf muscle strength\n\nThere is a small chance that your Achilles tendon could tear again. About 5 out of 100 people will have their Achilles tendon tear again.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your surgeon:\n\n*   If you could be pregnant\n*   What medicines you are taking, including medicines, herbs, or supplements you bought without a prescription\n*   If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol\n\nDuring the days before the surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.\n*   Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n*   If you smoke, ask your provider for help quitting.\n*   You should elevate your ankle to decrease swelling.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n*   You will probably be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n*   Your surgeon will tell you when to arrive.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nWork with your surgeon to keep your pain in control. Your heel may be very sore.\n\nYou will be wearing a cast or splint for a period of time.\n\nMany people can be discharged the same day of the surgery. Some people may require a short stay in the hospital.\n\nKeep your leg elevated for as much as possible during the first 2 weeks to reduce swelling and promote wound healing.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou will be able to resume full activity in about 6 months. Expect full recovery to take about 9 months.\n\n---\n\n**Achilles Tendon Repair**\n\n**Description**\n\nTo fix your torn Achilles tendon, the surgeon will:\n\n*   Make a cut down the back of your heel\n*   Make several small cuts rather than one large cut\n\nAfter that, the surgeon will:\n\n*   Bring the ends of your tendon together\n*   Sew the ends together\n*   Stitch the wound closed\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nBefore surgery is considered, you and your health care provider will talk about ways to take care of your Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nYou may need this surgery if your Achilles tendon has torn and separated.\n\nYou need your Achilles tendon to point your toes and push off your foot when walking.

    "content": "**Achilles Tendon Rupture - Aftercare**\n\nThe Achilles tendon connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. Together, they help you push your heel off the ground and go up on your toes. You use these muscles and your Achilles tendon when you walk, run, and jump.\n\nIf your Achilles tendon stretches too far, it can tear or rupture. If this happens, you may:\n\n* Hear a snapping, cracking, or popping sound and feel a sharp pain in the back of your leg or ankle\n* Have trouble moving your foot to walk or go up stairs\n* Have difficulty standing on your toes\n* Have bruising or swelling in your leg or foot\n* Feel like someone hit you at the back of your ankle with a bat\n\n**About Your Injury**\n\nMost likely your injury occurred when you:\n\n* Suddenly pushed your foot off the ground, to go from walking to running, or to running uphill\n* Tripped and fell, or had another accident\n* Played a sport like tennis or basketball, with a lot of stopping, sharp turns, and jumping\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nMost injuries can be diagnosed during a physical exam. You may need an MRI scan or ultrasound to see the location of your Achilles tendon tear. MRI and ultrasound are types of imaging tests.\n\nA partial tear means at least some of the tendon is still OK.\nA full tear means your tendon is torn completely and the 2 sides are not attached to each other.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nIf you have a complete tear, you may need surgery to repair your tendon. Your health care provider will discuss the pros and cons of surgery with you. Before surgery, you will wear a special boot that keeps you from moving your lower leg and foot.\n\nFor a partial tear:\n\n* You may need surgery.\n* Instead of surgery, you may need to wear a splint or boot for about 6 weeks. During this time, your tendon grows back together.\n\nIf you have a leg brace, splint, or boot, it will keep you from moving your foot. This will prevent further injury. You can walk once your provider says it is OK.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nTo relieve swelling:\n\n* Put an ice pack on the area right after you injure it.\n* Use pillows to raise your leg above the level of your heart when you sleep.\n* Keep your foot elevated when you are sitting.\n* Use a boot for walking or crutches to take weight off your ankle.\n\nYou can take ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), naproxen (such as Aleve or Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) for pain.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Talk with your provider if you have heart disease, liver disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or bleeding.\n* Quit smoking (smoking can affect healing after surgery).\n* Not give aspirin to children under 19.\n* Not take more pain killer than the dosage recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Rehab and Activity**\n\nAt some point as you recover, your provider will ask you to begin moving your heel. This may be as soon as 2 to 3 weeks or as long 6 weeks after your injury.\n\nWith the help of physical therapy, most people can return to normal activity in 4 to 6 months. In physical therapy, you will learn exercises to make your calf muscles stronger and your Achilles tendon more flexible.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of these symptoms:\n\n* Swelling or pain in your leg, ankle, or foot becomes worse\n* Purple color to leg or foot\n* Fever\n* Swelling in your calf and foot\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nAlso contact your provider if you have questions or concerns that cannot wait until your next visit.\n\n---\n\n**Achilles Tendon Rupture - Aftercare**\n\nAfter rupturing your Achilles tendon, you'll need to follow a specific aftercare plan to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of further complications.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nMost people can return to normal activity in 4 to 6 months. In physical therapy, you will learn exercises to make your calf muscles stronger and your Achilles tendon more flexible.\n\nWhen you stretch your calf muscles, do so slowly. Also, do not bounce or use too much force when you use your leg.\n\n**Preventing Future Injuries**\n\nAfter you heal, you are at greater risk for injuring your Achilles tendon again. You will need to:\n\n* Stay in good shape and stretch before any exercise\n* Avoid high-heeled shoes\n* Ask your provider if it is OK for you to play tennis, racquetball, basketball, and other sports where you stop and start\n* Do a proper amount of warm up and stretching ahead of time\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of these symptoms:\n\n* Swelling or pain in your leg, ankle, or foot becomes worse\n* Purple color to leg or foot\n* Fever\n* Swelling in your calf and foot\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nAlso contact your provider if you have questions or concerns that cannot wait until your next visit.\n\n**Rehab and Activity**\n\nAt some point as you recover, your provider will ask you to begin moving your heel. This may be as soon as 2 to 3 weeks or as long 6 weeks after your injury.\n\nNote: The original content has been reformatted to improve readability and clarity, while maintaining the essential medical information and structure.\n\n---\n\n**Achilles Tendon Rupture - Aftercare**\n\n**Rehab and Activity**\n\nAt some point as you recover, your provider will ask you to begin moving your heel.

    "content": "**Achondrogenesis**\n\n_A group of severe disorders that affect cartilage and bone development_\n\nAchondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that affect cartilage and bone development. These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities that cause serious health problems. As a result, most infants with achondrogenesis die before birth or soon after, often due to respiratory failure.\n\n**Types of Achondrogenesis**\n\nResearchers have described three main types of achondrogenesis: type 1A, type 1B, and type 2. While these types differ in their genetic causes and inheritance patterns, they often have overlapping signs and symptoms. Genetic testing and medical imaging are often needed to tell them apart.\n\n* **Type 1A (TRIP11-related achondrogenesis)**: Infants with this type typically have ribs that fracture easily. Bone formation (ossification) is also severely reduced in the skull and spine.\n* **Type 1B (SLC26A2-related achondrogenesis)**: Infants with this type often have short fingers and toes and feet that may turn inward and upward (clubfeet). They may also have a sac (pouch) formed from the inner lining of the abdominal cavity that pushes through a hole in the abdominal wall around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or near the groin (inguinal hernia).\n* **Type 2 (COL2A1-related achondrogenesis)**: The ossification of the spine and pelvis may be severely reduced in infants with this type. The distinctive facial features seen in infants with this type include a prominent forehead, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).\n\n**Overlapping Features**\n\nAchondrogenesis type 2 and a similar skeletal disorder called hypochondrogenesis were once thought to be distinct conditions. However, because these conditions have overlapping features and a shared genetic cause, they are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Most infants with achondrogenesis die before birth or soon after, often due to respiratory failure.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Genetic causes: different types of achondrogenesis have distinct genetic causes.\n* Inheritance patterns: the inheritance patterns of achondrogenesis vary depending on the type.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Achondrogenesis is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Hypochondrogenesis: a similar skeletal disorder that was once thought to be distinct from achondrogenesis type 2.\n* TRIP11-related achondrogenesis: another name for achondrogenesis type 1A.\n* SLC26A2-related achondrogenesis: another name for achondrogenesis type 1B.\n* COL2A1-related achondrogenesis: another name for achondrogenesis type 2.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic testing and medical imaging are often needed to diagnose and differentiate between the different types of achondrogenesis.\n* Support groups and online resources may be helpful for families affected by achondrogenesis.\n\n---\n\n**Achondrogenesis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Achondrogenesis?**\n\nAchondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that affect cartilage and bone development. These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities that cause serious health problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Achondrogenesis**\n\nResearchers have described three main types of achondrogenesis: type 1A, type 1B, and type 2. While these types differ in their genetic causes and inheritance patterns, they often have overlapping signs and symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Achondrogenesis**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in different genes cause the three main types of achondrogenesis. Variants in the TRIP11 gene cause achondrogenesis type 1A. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called thyroid receptor-interacting protein 11 (TRIP-11). TRIP-11 helps maintain the Golgi apparatus, a cell structure in which proteins are modified.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Achondrogenesis**\n\nAchondrogenesis occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 newborns.\n\n---\n\n**Achondrogenesis**\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\n* Achondrogenesis type 1A is caused by variants in the TRIP11 gene. This condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning a variant must be present in both copies of the gene in each cell to cause the condition.\n* Achondrogenesis type 1B is caused by variants in the SLC26A2 gene. This condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\n* Achondrogenesis type 2 is considered to be an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\n* COL2A1: a gene that provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen, which is found in cartilage.\n* SLC26A2: a gene that provides instructions for making a protein that transports charged molecules (ions), particularly sulfate ions, across cell membranes.\n* TRIP11: a gene that plays a role in the characteristic features of achondrogenesis type 1A.\n\n**Other Names and Resources**\n\n* Achondrogenesis type IA (Houston-Harris type)\n* Achondrogenesis type IB (Fraccaro type)\n* Achondrogenesis type II (Langer-Saldino type)\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Achondrogenesis type II\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Achondrogenesis, type IA\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Achondrogenesis, type IB\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Achondrogenesis**\n\n**What is Achondrogenesis?**\n\nAchondrogenesis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of bones and cartilage. It is characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, with individuals typically having a height of less than 60 cm (24 in).\n\n**Types of Achondrogenesis**\n\nThere are four types of achondrogenesis:\n\n* Type IA: This is the most severe form of the disorder, and individuals with this type typically do not survive beyond infancy.\n* Type IB: This type is also severe, but individuals may survive for a few months after birth.\n* Type II: This type is less severe than Types IA and IB, and individuals may survive for several years after birth.\n* Hypochondrogenesis: This type is characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, but with fewer skeletal abnormalities than the other types.\n\n**Causes of Achondrogenesis**\n\nAchondrogenesis is caused by mutations in one of three genes:\n\n* COL2A1: This gene provides instructions for making a protein called collagen type II, which is essential for bone and cartilage development.\n* DTDST (SLC26A2): This gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the transport of sulfate ions, which are necessary for bone growth.\n* GMAP-210: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the movement of molecules within cells.\n\n**Symptoms of Achondrogenesis**\n\nIndividuals with achondrogenesis typically have short-limbed dwarfism, with bowed long bones and underdeveloped cartilage. They may also experience respiratory problems due to underdeveloped lungs and ribcage.\n\n**Diagnosis of Achondrogenesis**\n\nAchondrogenesis can be diagnosed prenatally using ultrasound or amniocentesis. After birth, diagnosis is typically made through physical examination and genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Achondrogenesis**\n\nThere is no cure for achondrogenesis, but treatment may involve managing respiratory problems, preventing infections, and providing supportive care to improve quality of life.\n\n**References**\n\n* Barat-Houari M, Sarrabay G, Gatinois V, Fabre A, Dumont B, Genevieve D, Touitou I.

The word achondroplasia means \"without cartilage formation.\" Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development.\n\n**Causes of Achondroplasia**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the FGFR3 gene cause achondroplasia. The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific variants in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia.\n\n**Characteristics of Achondroplasia**\n\nAll people with achondroplasia have short stature. Without treatment, the average height of an adult male with achondroplasia is 131 centimeters (4 feet, 4 inches), and the average height for adult females is 124 centimeters (4 feet, 1 inch). Characteristic features of achondroplasia include:\n\n*   An average-size trunk\n*   Short arms and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs\n*   Limited range of motion at the elbows\n*   An enlarged head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead\n*   Fingers are typically short and the ring finger and middle finger may diverge, giving the hand a three-pronged (trident) appearance\n\n**Health Problems Associated with Achondroplasia**\n\nHealth problems commonly associated with achondroplasia include:\n\n*   Obesity\n*   Recurrent ear infections\n*   Spinal stenosis: a narrowing of the spinal canal that can pinch (compress) the upper part of the spinal cord, causing pain, tingling, and weakness in the legs\n*   Stenosis of the hole at the base of the skull where the spinal cord comes out of brain (foramen magnum): an uncommon but serious complication of achondroplasia in early childhood that can cause compression of the brain stem, leading to pauses in breathing during sleep (sleep apnea) or a condition known as hydrocephalus\n\n**Frequency of Achondroplasia**\n\nAchondroplasia is the most common type of short-limbed dwarfism. The condition occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns.\n\n---\n\n**Achondroplasia**\n\n**What is Achondroplasia?**\n\nAchondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone development, leading to short stature and other skeletal abnormalities.\n\n**Causes of Achondroplasia**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the FGFR3 gene cause achondroplasia. The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific variants in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAchondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents who do not have the condition and are of average heights; these cases are caused by new variants in the FGFR3 gene.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIndividuals who inherit two altered copies of the FGFR3 gene typically have a severe form of achondroplasia that causes extreme shortening of the bones and an underdeveloped rib cage. These individuals are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ACH\n* Achondroplastic dwarfism\n* Dwarf, achondroplastic\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Achondroplasia\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Achondroplasia\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ACHONDROPLASIA; ACH\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Horton WA, Hall JG, Hecht JT.

This means that two parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Achondroplasia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Achondroplasia?**\n\nAchondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue. It is one of a group of conditions called chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Achondroplasia**\n\nAchondroplasia is caused by a change (mutation) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.

Examination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn.\n\nCT scan or MRI of the brain may be done if there are signs of \"water on the brain\" (hydrocephalus). Neuroimaging is needed to check the base of the head to look for signs of spinal cord compression. Sleep studies help detect problems with sleep apnea.\n\nChildren with achondroplasia will need ongoing monitoring as they grow to check for health problems that can develop.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for achondroplasia. The disorder may cause certain health conditions, which need to be treated when they cause problems. Obstructive sleep apnea can be treated with surgery and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices.\n\nChildren who have recurring ear infections may need surgery to place tubes in their eardrums. Obesity can put extra strain on the body, so learning to eat a healthy diet and avoid weight gain from a young age is important.\n\nBracing may be needed to help correct upper spine curvature (kyphosis). Hydrocephalus can be treated with surgery (ventriculoperitoneal shunting). Physical therapy can help if gait is affected due to lordosis (curving of the lower back).\n\nCorrective surgery may be needed if there are problems walking due to bowed legs. Spine surgery may be needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord due to spinal stenosis or spinal cord compression at the base of the skull.\n\nVosoritide (Voxzogo) is a new medicine approved for use in children age 5 years and older who are still growing. This once daily injection may slightly improve bone growth.\n\nChildren and adults will need adaptations to their home, school, and work environment to accommodate a shorter stature.\n\n---\n\n**Achondroplasia**\n\n**What is Achondroplasia?**\n\nAchondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone development, causing short stature and other skeletal abnormalities.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAchondroplasia is usually caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which codes for a protein involved in bone growth. The mutation can occur spontaneously or be inherited from one's parents.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Short stature: Adults with achondroplasia typically range in height from 46 to 57 inches (1.18 to 1.45 meters) for men and 44 to 54 inches (1.12 to 1.36 meters) for women.\n* Skeletal abnormalities: People with achondroplasia may have a variety of skeletal issues, including:\n\t+ Breathing problems due to a small upper airway\n\t+ Lung problems due to a small ribcage\n\t+ Narrowing of the spinal column (spinal stenosis)\n\t+ Pressure on the spinal column at the base of the neck\n\t+ Hydrocephalus\n\t+ Back pain and joint problems\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAchondroplasia can be diagnosed prenatally through ultrasound or amniocentesis, or after birth through physical examination and genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for achondroplasia, treatment may involve:\n\n* Regular checkups to monitor for potential health problems\n* Surgery to correct skeletal abnormalities or relieve pressure on the spinal column\n* Physical therapy to improve mobility and reduce back pain\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nWith proper care and management, people with achondroplasia can lead long and healthy lives. However, they may face challenges related to their physical appearance and potential health issues.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nConnecting with others affected by the disorder can help children and their families feel less alone. Support groups, such as the Human Growth Foundation, Little People of America, and the MAGIC Foundation, provide resources and community for individuals with achondroplasia and their families.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling may be helpful for prospective parents when one or both have achondroplasia. However, because achondroplasia most often develops spontaneously, prevention is not always possible.\n\n**References**\n\nHoover-Fong JE, Horton WA, Hecht JT.

    "content": "**Achromatopsia**\n\n_Achromatopsia_ is a condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision. People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination.\n\n_Achromatopsia_ also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). Affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). These vision problems develop in the first few months of life.\n\n_Achromatopsia_ is different from the more common forms of color vision deficiency (also called color blindness), in which people can perceive color but have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, such as red and green.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n_Achromatopsia_ affects an estimated 1 in 30,000 people worldwide. Complete achromatopsia is more common than incomplete achromatopsia. Complete achromatopsia occurs frequently among Pingelapese islanders, who live on one of the Eastern Caroline Islands of Micronesia. Between 4 and 10 percent of people in this population have a total absence of color vision.\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Achromatopsia_ results from changes in one of several genes: CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C, or PDE6H. A particular CNGB3 gene mutation underlies the condition in Pingelapese islanders. _Achromatopsia_ is a disorder of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones. These cells transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain through a process called phototransduction. Rods provide vision in low light (night vision). Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision.\n\nMutations in any of the genes listed above prevent cones from reacting appropriately to light, which interferes with phototransduction. In people with complete achromatopsia, cones are nonfunctional, and vision depends entirely on the activity of rods. The loss of cone function leads to a total lack of color vision and causes the other vision problems. People with incomplete achromatopsia retain some cone function. These individuals have limited color vision, and their other vision problems tend to be less severe.\n\nSome people with achromatopsia do not have identified mutations in any of the known genes. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Other genetic factors that have not been identified likely contribute to this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Achromatopsia**\n\n**What is Achromatopsia?**\n\nAchromatopsia is a disorder of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

The loss of cone function leads to a total lack of color vision and causes other vision problems.\n\n**Types of Achromatopsia**\n\nThere are two types of achromatopsia: complete and incomplete. People with complete achromatopsia have no functional cones, while those with incomplete achromatopsia retain some cone function.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAchromatism, Rod monochromatism, Total color blindness\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Achromatopsia 1-6\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n---\n\n**Achromatopsia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Definition**: A rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes and causes complete color blindness.\n*   **Causes**: Mutations in specific genes, such as PDE6C or GNAT2, which are responsible for the production of cone cells in the retina.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Chang et al.

This soon goes away.\n\nThe urine test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to see how well your kidneys control the body's acid-base balance.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nUrine with a pH less than 5.3 is normal.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe most common disorder associated with an abnormal result is renal tubular acidosis.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks with providing a urine sample.\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Acid Loading Test (pH)**\n\nThis test is done to see how well your kidneys control the body's acid-base balance.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to see how well your kidneys control the body's acid-base balance.

They are often found in mucus and in fluid around the joints.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nFor the 24-hour test, you must urinate into a special bag or container every time you use the bathroom. Most often, you will be given two containers. You will urinate directly into the smaller special container and then transfer that urine into the other larger container.\n\n*   On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you wake up in the morning.\n*   After the first urination, urinate into the special container every time you use the bathroom for the next 24 hours. Transfer the urine into the larger container and keep the larger container in a cool place or in a refrigerator. Keep this container tightly capped.\n*   On day 2, urinate into the container in the morning again when you wake up and transfer this urine to the larger container.\n*   Label the larger container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.\n\nFor an infant:\n\n*   Thoroughly wash the area around the urethra (the hole where urine flows out). Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\n*   For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive paper to the skin.\n*   For females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia). Put a diaper on the baby (over the bag).\n*   Check the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated.

    "content": "**Acid Soldering Flux Poisoning**\n\n**What is Acid Soldering Flux Poisoning?**\n\nAcid soldering flux poisoning occurs when someone swallows acid soldering flux, a chemical used to clean and protect the area where two pieces of metal are joined together.\n\n**This Article is for Information Only**\n\nDO NOT use this article to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nThe harmful substances in soldering fluxes are called hydrocarbons. They include:\n\n*   Ammonium chloride\n*   Rosin\n*   Hydrochloric acid\n*   Zinc chloride\n\n**Where Found**\n\nSoldering flux contains the above substances. Other products may also contain fluxes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBelow are symptoms of flux poisoning in different parts of the body.\n\n*   **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n    *   Loss of vision\n    *   Severe pain in the throat\n    *   Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n*   **KIDNEYS AND BLADDER**\n    *   Decreased urine output\n    *   Kidney failure\n*   **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n    *   Blood in the stool\n    *   Burns of the food pipe (esophagus)\n    *   Severe abdominal pain\n    *   Nausea and vomiting\n    *   Vomiting blood\n*   **HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS**\n    *   Collapse\n    *   Irregular heart beat\n    *   Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n*   **LUNGS AND AIRWAYS**\n    *   Breathing difficulty (from breathing in the chemical)\n    *   Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty)\n*   **SKIN**\n    *   Burn\n    *   Holes in the skin or tissues under the skin\n    *   Irritation\n\n**Home Care**\n\nGet medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the flux is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the person swallowed the flux, give them water or milk right away if poison control or a provider tells you to do so. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, seizures, or a decreased level of alertness.\n\nIf the person breathed in fumes of the flux, move them to fresh air right away.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n*   Person's age, weight, and condition\n*   Name of the product (and ingredients, if known)\n*   Time it was swallowed\n*   Amount swallowed\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n*   Fluids through the vein (by IV)\n*   Medicine to treat symptoms\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage)\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days\n*   Surgery to remove burned skin\n*   Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well someone does depends on how severe their poisoning is and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Damage can continue to occur for several weeks after swallowing soldering flux.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/acid-fast-bacillus-afb-tests/",
    "content": "**Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Tests**\n\n**What are acid-fast bacillus (AFB) tests?**\n\nAcid-fast bacillus (AFB) is a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and other types of mycobacterial infections, such as leprosy (Hansen's disease). AFB tests are usually ordered for people with symptoms of active tuberculosis, commonly known as TB. TB is a serious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It mainly affects the lungs. But can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB bacteria spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing.\n\nTB can be latent or active. If you have latent TB, you'll have TB bacteria in your body but won't feel sick and can't spread the disease to others because the germs aren't active. If you have active TB, you'll have symptoms of the disease and could spread the infection to others.\n\nAFB tests look for AFB bacteria in your sputum. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva. There are four tests used to identify AFB:\n\n* **AFB smear**: In this test, your sputum sample is \"smeared\" on a glass slide and looked at under a microscope. It can provide results in 1-2 days.\n* **AFB culture**: In this test, your sample is sent to a lab to allow the cells to grow until there are enough to test. An AFB culture can positively confirm a diagnosis of TB or other mycobacterial infection. But it takes 6-8 weeks to grow enough bacteria to detect an infection.\n* **Molecular test**: In this test, your sample is tested using nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) with AFB smear and culture. The NAAT test is done directly on sputum samples and can detect TB bacteria. If there is TB bacteria, the test can also check whether the bacteria are resistant to rifampicin, a common treatment for TB.\n* **Susceptibility test**: This test is usually ordered along with an AFB culture. It is used to figure out the most effective antibiotic to treat your infection.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nAFB tests are most often used to diagnose an active tuberculosis (TB) infection. They may also be used to help diagnose other types of AFB infections, such as leprosy or Mycobacterium avium infections.\n\n**Why do I need an AFB test?**\n\nYou may need an AFB test if you have symptoms of active TB (TB disease). These symptoms include:\n\n* Cough that lasts for three weeks or more\n* Coughing up blood and/or sputum\n* Chest pain\n* Chills and fever\n* Fatigue\n* Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\n* Losing weight without trying\n* Back pain and paralysis (for spinal TB)\n* Blood in your urine\n* Headache and coma (for TB meningitis)\n* Joint pain\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\nCertain people are more likely to develop TB disease, including:\n\n* People who have recently been infected with TB bacteria\n* People with medical conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV, substance use, silicosis, diabetes, severe kidney disease, low body weight, or organ transplants.\n* Babies and young children\n\nYou may also need testing if you are at higher risk of getting TB because you:\n\n* Have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB\n* Have HIV or another disease that weakens your immune system\n* Live or work in a place with a high rate of TB infection, such as a homeless shelter, nursing home, or prison\n\n**What happens during AFB testing?**\n\nYour health care provider will need a sample of your sputum for all AFB tests. The AFB smear and AFB culture are usually done at the same time.\n\nTo get sputum samples:\n\n* You will be asked to breathe deeply and then cough and spit into a sterile container.\n* If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a sterile saline (salt) mist that can help you cough more deeply.\n* If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you will first get medicine so you won't feel any pain. Then, a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into your airways. The sample may be collected by suction or with a small brush.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for AFB testing.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no risk to providing a sputum sample by coughing into a container. If you have a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure. There is also a small risk of infection and bleeding at the site where the sample is taken.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results on an AFB smear or culture were negative, you probably don't have active TB. But it could also mean there weren't enough bacteria in the sample for your provider to make a diagnosis.\n\nIf your AFB smear was positive, it means you probably have TB or other infection, but an AFB culture is needed confirm the diagnosis. Culture results can take several weeks, so your provider may decide to treat your infection in the meantime.\n\nIf your AFB culture was positive, it means you have active TB or another type of AFB infection. The culture can identify which type of infection you have.\n\nIf your molecular (NAAT) test was positive, it means you probably have TB.\n\nOnce you have been diagnosed, your provider may order a \"susceptibility test\" on your sample. A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will provide the most effective treatment.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about AFB testing?**\n\nIf not treated, TB can be deadly. But most cases of TB can be cured if you take antibiotics as directed by your provider. Treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections. After a few weeks on antibiotics, you will no longer be contagious, but you will still have TB. To cure active TB, you usually need to take antibiotics for six to twelve months. How long you need to take it will depend on your overall health, age, and other factors. It's important to take the antibiotics for as long as your provider tells you, even if you feel better. Stopping early can cause the infection to come back.\n\n---\n\n**Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Tests**\n\n**What are acid-fast bacillus (AFB) tests?**\n\nAcid-fast bacillus (AFB) is a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and other types of mycobacterial infections, such as leprosy (Hansen's disease). AFB tests are usually ordered for people with symptoms of active tuberculosis, commonly known as TB. TB is a serious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It mainly affects the lungs. But can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB bacteria spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing.\n\nTB can be latent or active. If you have latent TB, you'll have TB bacteria in your body but won't feel sick and can't spread the disease to others because the germs aren't active. If you have active TB, you'll have symptoms of the disease and could spread the infection to others.\n\nAFB tests look for AFB bacteria in your sputum. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva. There are four tests used to identify AFB:\n\n*   **AFB smear**: In this test, your sputum sample is \"smeared\" on a glass slide and looked at under a microscope. It can provide results in 1-2 days. These results can show a possible or likely infection but cannot be used to provide a diagnosis.\n*   **AFB culture**: In this test, your sample is sent to a lab to allow the cells to grow until there are enough to test. An AFB culture can positively confirm a diagnosis of TB or other mycobacterial infection. But it takes 6-8 weeks to grow enough bacteria to detect an infection.\n*   **Molecular test**: In this test, your sample is tested using nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) with AFB smear and culture. The NAAT test is done directly on sputum samples and can detect TB bacteria. If there is TB bacteria, the test can also check whether the bacteria are resistant to rifampicin, a common treatment for TB. This test can be done in less than two hours.\n*   **Susceptibility test**: This test is usually ordered along with an AFB culture. It is used to figure out the most effective antibiotic to treat your infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be resistant to one or more of the medicines that are used to treat TB.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nAFB tests are most often used to diagnose an active tuberculosis (TB) infection. They may also be used to help diagnose other types of AFB infections. These include:\n\n*   Leprosy, a once feared, but rare and easily treatable disease that affects the nerves, eyes, and skin. The skin often becomes red and flaky, with a loss of feeling.\n*   An infection similar to TB, such as Mycobacterium avium, that mostly affects people with HIV and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nAFB tests may also be used for people who have already been diagnosed with TB. The tests can show if the treatment is working and whether the infection can still be spread to others.\n\n**Why do I need an AFB test?**\n\nYou may need an AFB test if you have symptoms of active TB (TB disease). Which symptoms you have will depend on where in the body the TB bacteria are growing.\n\nIf TB disease is in the lungs (pulmonary), symptoms may include:\n\n*   Cough that lasts for three weeks or more\n*   Coughing up blood and/or sputum\n*   Chest pain\n\nOther symptoms of TB disease may include:\n\n*   Chills and fever\n*   Fatigue\n*   Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\n*   Losing weight without trying\n*   Back pain and paralysis (for spinal TB)\n*   Blood in your urine\n*   Headache and coma (for TB meningitis)\n*   Joint pain\n*   Abdominal (belly) pain\n\nGenerally, certain people are more likely to develop TB disease. They include:\n\n*   People who have recently been infected with TB bacteria\n*   People with medical conditions that weaken the immune system\n\nBabies and young children often have weakened immune systems. Others can have weakened immune systems, too, especially people with any of these conditions:\n\n*   HIV\n*   Substance use\n*   Silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust\n*   Diabetes\n*   Severe kidney disease\n*   Low body weight\n*   Organ transplants\n*   Head and neck cancer\n\nPeople can also have weakened immune systems due to certain treatments:\n\n*   Medical treatments such as corticosteroids\n*   Specialized treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease\n\nYou may also need testing if you are at higher risk of getting TB because you:\n\n*   Have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB\n*   Have HIV or another disease that weakens your immune system\n*   Live or work in a place with a high rate of TB infection, such as a homeless shelter, nursing home, or prison\n\nIf you are currently being treated for TB, you might need testing to see if your treatment is working and if you could still spread the TB bacteria to others.\n\n**What happens during AFB testing?**\n\nYour health care provider will need a sample of your sputum for all AFB tests. The AFB smear and AFB culture are usually done at the same time. To get sputum samples:\n\n*   You'll be asked to cough deeply into a special container.\n*   Your healthcare provider may also use a device that helps loosen up mucus in your lungs, making it easier to get a good sample.\n\nThe type of test you need will determine how long it takes to get results. The AFB smear can provide results in 1-2 days, while the AFB culture can take 6-8 weeks. The molecular test and susceptibility test can be done in less than two hours and usually along with an AFB culture.\n\nRemember, early detection is key to effective treatment and preventing the spread of TB bacteria. If you're experiencing symptoms or are at higher risk of getting TB, talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested.\n\n---\n\n**Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Tests: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What happens during AFB testing?**\n\nTo get a sputum sample, you will be asked to breathe deeply and then cough and spit into a sterile container. If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a sterile saline (salt) mist that can help you cough more deeply. If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for AFB testing.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is no risk to providing a sputum sample by coughing into a container. If you have a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure. There is also a small risk of infection and bleeding at the site where the sample is taken.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\n*   If your results on an AFB smear or culture were negative, you probably don't have active TB.\n*   If your AFB smear was positive, it means you probably have TB or other infection, but an AFB culture is needed confirm the diagnosis.\n*   If your AFB culture was positive, it means you have active TB or another type of AFB infection.\n*   If your molecular (NAAT) test was positive, it means you probably have TB.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about AFB testing?**\n\nIf not treated, TB can be deadly. But most cases of TB can be cured if you take antibiotics as directed by your provider. Treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections.

The test detects the presence of these bacteria in a patient's body.\n\n**How is an AFB Test Performed?**\n\nThere are several types of AFB tests, including:\n\n* **Sputum Culture**: This test involves collecting a sample of sputum from the patient and culturing it to detect the presence of mycobacteria.\n* **Bacteria Culture Test**: This test involves collecting a sample of tissue or fluid from the patient and culturing it to detect the presence of mycobacteria.\n\n**What are the Benefits of an AFB Test?**\n\nThe benefits of an AFB test include:\n\n* **Early Detection**: An AFB test can help diagnose infections caused by mycobacteria early, which is essential for effective treatment.\n* **Accurate Diagnosis**: An AFB test provides accurate results, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions about patient care.\n\n**How to Prepare for an AFB Test**\n\nTo prepare for an AFB test, patients should:\n\n* **Follow Instructions**: Patients should follow the instructions provided by their healthcare provider regarding test preparation and sample collection.\n* **Be Honest About Symptoms**: Patients should be honest with their healthcare provider about their symptoms and medical history.\n\n**How to Understand Your Lab Results**\n\nAfter an AFB test, patients will receive lab results indicating whether mycobacteria were detected in their body. If the test is positive, it may indicate a mycobacterial infection, such as TB. If the test is negative, it does not rule out the presence of a mycobacterial infection.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Antibiotic Resistance**\n* **Antibiotics**\n* **Bacterial Infections**\n* **Mycobacterial Infections**\n* **Tuberculosis**\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* **Antibiotic Sensitivity Test**\n* **Bacteria Culture Test**\n* **Bronchoscopy and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)**\n* **Legionella Tests**\n* **Sputum Culture**\n* **Tuberculosis Screening**",

Acidosis occurs when acid builds up or when bicarbonate (a base) is lost. Acidosis is classified as either respiratory or metabolic acidosis.\n\n* **Respiratory Acidosis**: develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body.\n\t+ Causes:\n\t\t- Chest deformities, such as kyphosis\n\t\t- Chest injuries\n\t\t- Chest muscle weakness\n\t\t- Long-term (chronic) lung disease\n\t\t- Neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or muscular dystrophy\n\t\t- Overuse of sedative drugs, causing decreased respiration\n\t\t- Acute lung disease, such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe medical illness\n* **Metabolic Acidosis**: develops when too much acid is produced in the body.\n\t+ Types:\n\t\t- Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes).\n\t\t- Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\n\t\t- Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis).\n\t\t- Lactic acidosis.\n\t\t- Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.\n\t\t- Severe dehydration.\n\n_Lactic Acidosis_\n\nLactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid. Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. This can be caused by:\n\n* Cancer\n* Carbon monoxide poisoning\n* Drinking too much alcohol\n* Exercising vigorously for a very long time\n* Liver failure\n* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n* Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals\n* MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production)\n* Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia\n* Seizures\n* Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs\n* Severe asthma\n\n---\n\n**Acidosis**\n\n**What is Acidosis?**\n\nAcidosis occurs when there is too much acid in the body, which can happen when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body or when too much acid is produced.\n\n**Types of Acidosis**\n\nThere are two main types of acidosis:\n\n*   **Respiratory Acidosis**: This type of acidosis develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body. It usually occurs when the body is unable to remove enough carbon dioxide through breathing.\n*   **Metabolic Acidosis**: This type of acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body or when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body.\n\n**Causes of Respiratory Acidosis**\n\nRespiratory acidosis can be caused by:\n\n*   Chest deformities, such as kyphosis\n*   Chest injuries\n*   Chest muscle weakness\n*   Long-term (chronic) lung disease\n*   Neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or muscular dystrophy\n*   Overuse of sedative drugs, causing decreased respiration\n*   Acute lung disease, such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe medical illness\n\n**Causes of Metabolic Acidosis**\n\nMetabolic acidosis can be caused by:\n\n*   Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes).\n*   Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\n*   Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis).\n*   Lactic acidosis.\n*   Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.\n*   Severe dehydration.\n\n**Symptoms of Acidosis**\n\nThe symptoms of acidosis depend on the underlying disease or condition. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition.\n\nRespiratory acidosis symptoms can include:\n\n*   Confusion\n*   Fatigue\n*   Lethargy\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Sleepiness\n\n**Diagnosing Acidosis**\n\nTo diagnose acidosis, your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. The following tests can help diagnose acidosis:\n\n*   Arterial or venous blood gas analysis\n*   Basic metabolic panel (group of blood tests that measure sodium and potassium levels, kidney function, and other chemicals and functions) to show whether the type of acidosis is metabolic or respiratory\n*   Blood ketones\n*   Lactic acid test\n*   Urine ketones\n*   Urine pH\n\n**Treatment for Acidosis**\n\nTreatment is aimed at the health problem causing the acidosis. In some cases, sodium bicarbonate (the chemical in baking soda) may be given to reduce the acidity of the blood. Often, you will receive lots of fluids through your vein.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAcidosis can be dangerous if untreated. Many cases respond well to treatment. The outlook will depend on the underlying disease causing the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Acidosis**\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications depend on the specific type of acidosis.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nAll the types of acidosis will cause symptoms that require treatment by your provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention depends on the cause of the acidosis. Many causes of metabolic acidosis can be prevented, including diabetic ketoacidosis and some causes of lactic acidosis. Normally, people with healthy kidneys and lungs do not have serious acidosis.\n\n**References**\n\nOh MS, Briefel G, Pincus MR.
