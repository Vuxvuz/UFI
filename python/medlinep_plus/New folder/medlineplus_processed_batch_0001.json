    "content": "**ABHD5 Gene**\n\nThe ABHD5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) an enzyme called adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The ATGL enzyme plays a role in breaking down fats called triglycerides, which are a major source of stored energy in cells. Cells primarily store triglycerides in structures called lipid droplets (also called adiposomes). The ABHD5 protein and the ATGL enzyme are found on the surface of lipid droplets. Once activated, the ATGL enzyme breaks down triglycerides in these structures to provide energy for the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral variants (also called mutations) in the ABHD5 gene have been found to cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a condition in which triglycerides build up in the body. These variants impair the ABHD5 protein's ability to activate the ATGL enzyme. If there is not enough activated ATGL enzyme to break down triglycerides, these fats can accumulate in various organs and tissues throughout the body. Over time, the buildup of triglycerides can damage cells and tissues, leading to the signs and symptoms of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nCGI58 comparative gene identification 58 IECN2 NCIE2\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: ABHD5\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ABHYDROLASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5, LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID ACYLTRANSFERASE; ABHD5\n\n---\n\n**ABHD5 Gene**\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**: A comprehensive database of genes, including the ABHD5 gene.\n*   **ClinVar**: A repository of genetic variants, including those associated with the ABHD5 gene.\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of ABHD5**: Various genetic tests available for detecting mutations in the ABHD5 gene.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome: A comprehensive review.**\n    *   Cakmak E, Bagci G.

The ABL1 protein functions as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ABL1 kinase is normally turned off (inactive) and must be turned on (activated) to perform its functions. It can be turned on by a number of different triggers and can add a phosphate group to many different proteins (also called substrates). This diversity allows ABL1 to be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including:\n\n* Cell growth and division (proliferation)\n* Maturation (differentiation)\n* Movement (migration)\n* Cell survival or triggered controlled cell death (apoptosis), depending on cellular conditions\n\nThe ABL1 kinase interacts with several proteins involved in the network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. These interactions help control:\n\n* Cell migration\n* The attachment of cells to one another (adhesion)\n* Many other processes\n\nABL1 can also help regulate the activity of other genes.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nThe ABL1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes.

When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**: A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving the ABL1 gene causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.\n*   **Other Cancers**: The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is also involved in fast-growing blood cell cancers called acute leukemias.\n\n**Philadelphia Chromosome**\n\nThe translocation involved in chronic myeloid leukemia, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n**Target for Molecular Therapies**\n\nThe presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies.\n\n---\n\n**ABL1 Gene**\n\nThe ABL1 gene is a crucial component in the development of certain types of leukemia, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This gene encodes for a protein called tyrosine kinase, which plays a vital role in cell signaling. In CML, a genetic mutation occurs when part of chromosome 9 fuses with part of chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1.\n\n**The Philadelphia Chromosome**\n\nThe abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. It is not inherited, making it a somatic mutation.\n\n**The BCR-ABL1 Protein**\n\nThe protein produced from the abnormal fusion gene, called BCR-ABL1, functions as a kinase. Unlike the ABL1 kinase, it does not require signals in the cell to turn it on. The constantly active BCR-ABL1 protein signals cells to continue dividing abnormally and prevents them from self-destructing, leading to overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nThe BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is also involved in fast-growing blood cell cancers called acute leukemias. It has been found in 5% of children and up to 30% of adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and very rarely in acute myeloid leukemia. The exact mechanisms by which these rare fusion genes lead to blood cancer are not completely understood, although it is likely that the proteins produced from them promote uncontrolled growth of cells.\n\n**Rare Fusion Genes**\n\nRarely, translocations that lead to fusion of the ABL1 gene with genes other than BCR are associated with acute leukemias. For example, the ETV6-ABL1 fusion gene has been found in a small number of cases of B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia and a chronic leukemia that can resemble CML.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe ABL1 gene is also known by other names, including:\n\n* Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1\n* ABL bcr/abl\n* BCR/c-abl oncogene protein c-ABL\n* C-abl oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase\n* C-ABL1 JTK7\n* P150 proto-oncogene c-Abl\n* Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1\n* Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 isoform a\n* Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 isoform b\n* V-abl\n* Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on the ABL1 gene and its role in leukemia, refer to the following scientific articles:\n\n* Chereda B, Melo JV.

This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   People with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood.\n*   People with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood.\n*   People with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood.\n*   People with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood.\n\nType O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood.\n\nBoth blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction. Usually, a reaction occurs because of a clerical error causing someone to receive incompatible blood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe following are symptoms of ABO incompatible transfusion reactions:\n\n*   Low back pain\n*   Blood in urine\n*   Chills\n*   Feeling of impending doom\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Increased heart rate\n*   Pain at infusion site\n*   Chest pain\n*   Dizziness\n*   Bronchospasm (spasm of the muscles lining the lung; causes cough)\n*   Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n*   Acute kidney failure\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

This can happen if the mother has a different ABO blood type than her fetus, or if she has been sensitized to a particular ABO blood type through previous pregnancies or transfusions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is ABO incompatibility a problem?**\n\nABO incompatibility can cause problems during pregnancy and childbirth. If the mother's antibodies attack the fetus's red blood cells, it can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). HDN can be severe and even life-threatening if left untreated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is ABO incompatibility diagnosed?**\n\nDiagnosing ABO incompatibility typically involves a series of tests, including:\n\n*   Determining the mother's and fetus's ABO blood types\n*   Checking for the presence of antibodies against the fetus's ABO blood type\n*   Performing a Coombs test to detect any evidence of hemolysis\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatment options for ABO incompatibility?**\n\nTreatment for ABO incompatibility depends on the severity of the condition. In some cases, simply monitoring the pregnancy and being prepared for potential complications may be sufficient. In more severe cases, treatments such as exchange transfusions or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be necessary to reduce the risk of HDN.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing ABO incompatibility**\n\nTo prevent ABO incompatibility, pregnant women should inform their healthcare provider about any previous pregnancies, blood transfusions, or other potential sensitizing events. This information can help identify at-risk mothers and take steps to minimize the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nABO incompatibility is a serious condition that requires prompt attention from medical professionals. By understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prevention strategies, pregnant women and their healthcare providers can work together to ensure the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby.",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/acad9-deficiency/",
    "content": "**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is a condition that varies in severity and can cause muscle weakness (myopathy), heart problems, and intellectual disability. Nearly all affected individuals have a buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). Additional signs and symptoms that affect other body systems occur in rare cases.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Mildly affected individuals with ACAD9 deficiency usually experience nausea and extreme fatigue in response to physical activity (exercise intolerance).\n* People with ACAD9 deficiency who are moderately affected have low muscle tone (hypotonia) and weakness in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).\n* Severely affected individuals have brain dysfunction combined with myopathy (encephalomyopathy); these individuals usually also have an enlarged and weakened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which is typically fatal in infancy or childhood.\n* Individuals with ACAD9 deficiency who survive past early childhood often have intellectual disability and may develop seizures.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of ACAD9 deficiency is unknown. At least 25 people with this condition have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures inside cells. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy.\n\n---\n\n**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\n**What is ACAD9 deficiency?**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is critical in helping assemble complex I, a group of proteins found in mitochondria.\n\n**How does ACAD9 deficiency affect the body?**\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a process that occurs within mitochondria to break down fats and convert them into energy. Some ACAD9 gene mutations disrupt complex I assembly as well as long-chain fatty acid oxidation, while others affect only complex I assembly.\n\n**What are the symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency?**\n\nThe symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency can vary in severity, but may include encephalomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it is thought that cells that are less able to produce energy die off, particularly cells in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and organs that require a lot of energy.\n\n**How is ACAD9 deficiency inherited?**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other names for ACAD9 deficiency**\n\n* Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency\n* Deficiency of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9\n* Mitochondrial complex I deficiency due to ACAD9 deficiency\n\n**Additional information & resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 20; MC1DN20\n\n---\n\n**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\n**What is ACAD9 deficiency?**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. It affects the production of energy in cells, leading to various symptoms and complications.\n\n**Symptoms and Complications**\n\nThe symptoms and complications of ACAD9 deficiency can vary widely among individuals, but may include:\n\n* Cardiac hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart muscle)\n* Exercise intolerance\n* Lactic acidosis (a condition characterized by high levels of lactic acid in the blood)\n* Respiratory problems\n* Developmental delays\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in the production of energy in cells. The risk factors for developing this condition include:\n\n* Family history of the disorder\n* Genetic mutations in the ACAD9 gene\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of ACAD9 deficiency is typically made through genetic testing, which involves analyzing the ACAD9 gene for mutations. Other diagnostic tools may include:\n\n* Imaging studies (e.g., echocardiogram) to evaluate heart function\n* Electromyography (EMG) to assess muscle function\n* Blood tests to measure lactic acid levels and other biomarkers\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ACAD9 deficiency, but various treatments and management strategies can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* Riboflavin supplements to reduce the severity of symptoms\n* Exercise therapy to improve muscle function and endurance\n* Respiratory support (e.g., oxygen therapy) to manage respiratory complications\n* Genetic counseling to inform family members about the risk of inheriting the disorder\n\n**References**\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of ACAD9 deficiency, consult the following scientific articles:\n\n* Aintablian et al.

The ACAD9 enzyme is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I.

The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize two fats called palmitate and oleate, which belong to a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **ACAD9 Deficiency**: At least 30 ACAD9 gene mutations have been found to cause ACAD9 deficiency.

Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for the body. In cells throughout the body, SBCAD is found within specialized structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.\n\nThe SBCAD enzyme helps break down a particular amino acid called isoleucine. Specifically, this enzyme helps with the third step of the process, performing a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to another molecule, tiglyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert tiglyl-CoA into molecules that are used for energy. Through similar chemical reactions, the SBCAD enzyme also aids in the breakdown of other amino acids.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency**\n    Researchers have identified more than 10 ACADSB gene mutations in people with short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency.

As a result, very little functional enzyme is produced.\n\nWith a shortage (deficiency) of functional VLCAD enzyme, very-long chain fatty acids are not broken down properly.  As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to signs and symptoms of this disorder such as the lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood glucose (hypoglycemia).

    "content": "**ACAN Gene**\n\nThe ACAN gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein. Aggrecan is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. It is the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nAggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. These interactions occur at a specific region of the aggrecan protein called the C-type lectin domain (CLD). Because of the attached sugars, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Familial Osteochondritis Dissecans**\n    At least one variant (also known as a mutation) in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint.\n    The ACAN gene variant associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M). The abnormal aggrecan protein is unable to attach to other components of cartilage. As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak.\n    It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage is involved in the development of the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. Researchers have suggested that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their growth, leading to short stature.\n\n*   **Intervertebral Disc Disease**\n    MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Intervertebral disc disease\n\n---\n\n**ACAN Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **Other Disorders**\n    Two other conditions associated with short stature, called spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type, are caused by variants in the ACAN gene.\n\n        *   **Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia, Aggrecan Type**\n            People with this condition have extremely short stature, short fingers and toes, and distinctive facial features. This condition is caused by a variant that changes the amino acid at position 2267 in the aggrecan protein from aspartic acid to asparagine (written as Asp2267Asn or D2267N). The amino acid change, which occurs in the CLD, alters aggrecan's interaction with at least one component of the cartilage network.\n\n        *   **Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia, Kimberley Type**\n            This condition is characterized by short stature and early development of osteoarthritis, particularly in the knees, ankles, and hips. It is caused by a variant in which a single DNA building block is inserted into the ACAN gene, which could disrupt the gene's instructions and lead to the production of an abnormally short aggrecan protein that is missing the CLD.\n\n*   **Familial Osteochondritis Dissecans**\n    At least one variant (also known as a mutation) in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint.\n\n        *   **Symptoms**\n            People with this condition have multiple lesions that affect the knees, elbows, hips, or ankles. Other common features are short stature and early development of a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis.\n\n        *   **Genetic Cause**\n            The ACAN gene variant associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M).

    "content": "**ACE Gene**\n\nThe ACE gene provides instructions for making the angiotensin-converting enzyme. This enzyme is able to cut (cleave) proteins. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nBy cutting a protein called angiotensin I at a particular location, the angiotensin-converting enzyme converts this protein to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This protein also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys.\n\nThe increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.\n\nThe angiotensin-converting enzyme can cleave other proteins, including bradykinin. Bradykinin causes blood vessels to widen (dilate), which decreases blood pressure. Cleavage by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inactivates bradykinin, helping to increase blood pressure.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Renal tubular dysgenesis: Mutations in the ACE gene are the most common cause of a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis; at least 33 ACE gene mutations have been found in people with this disorder. Renal tubular dysgenesis is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension).\n\n---\n\n**ACE Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n\nMutations in the ACE gene are the most common cause of a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis; at least 33 ACE gene mutations have been found in people with this disorder. Renal tubular dysgenesis is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.\n\nRenal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The ACE gene mutations that cause this disorder prevent the production of functional angiotensin-converting enzyme, which impairs the formation of angiotensin II and results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nA certain variation in the ACE gene has been associated with increased risk of several conditions, including stroke and complications of diabetes. This genetic variation, called the ACE I/D polymorphism, involves a region of DNA that spans 287 DNA building blocks (nucleotides). One variant of the ACE gene includes this region; it is called the insertion, or I, allele. Another variant is missing this region of DNA and is called the deletion, or D, allele.\n\nBecause people have two copies of each gene, each individual can have two I alleles (II), two D alleles (DD), or one allele of each (ID). The DD pattern is associated with higher levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme than the II pattern. The ID pattern is associated with intermediate levels.\n\nPeople with the DD pattern of alleles have an increased risk of stroke. Stroke can be caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage). Susceptibility to both types is associated with the ACE gene variation. However, many genetic and environmental risk factors likely contribute to this complex condition.\n\nIn people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, the DD pattern of alleles is associated with an increased risk of developing a kidney disorder called diabetic nephropathy. Damage to the kidneys caused by this condition worsens over time and can lead to kidney failure.\n\n---\n\n**ACE Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\nThe ACE gene, also known as the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene, plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. The gene is responsible for producing an enzyme that converts a hormone called angiotensin I into another hormone called angiotensin II.\n\n**Variants of the ACE Gene**\n\nThe ACE gene has two main variants: the insertion (I) allele and the deletion (D) allele. The insertion allele includes a region of DNA that spans 287 nucleotides, while the deletion allele is missing this region. Because people have two copies of each gene, they can have two I alleles (II), two D alleles (DD), or one allele of each (ID).\n\n**Patterns of Alleles and Their Effects**\n\nThe pattern of alleles an individual has can affect their levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The DD pattern is associated with higher levels of the enzyme than the II pattern, while the ID pattern is associated with intermediate levels.\n\n**Increased Risk of Stroke and Diabetic Nephropathy**\n\nPeople with the DD pattern of alleles have an increased risk of stroke. Stroke can be caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage). Susceptibility to both types is associated with the ACE gene variation.\n\nIn people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, the DD pattern of alleles is associated with an increased risk of developing a kidney disorder called diabetic nephropathy. Damage to the kidneys caused by this condition worsens over time and can lead to kidney failure.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ACE1\n* ACE_HUMAN\n* angiotensin converting enzyme, somatic isoform\n* angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 1\n* angiotensin I converting enzyme peptidyl-dipeptidase A 1 transcript\n* CD143\n* CD143 antigen\n* DCP\n* DCP1\n* dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase 1\n* dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I\n* EC 3.4.15.1\n* ICH\n* kininase II\n* MVCD3\n\n**References**\n\n* Gribouval O, Gonzales M, Neuhaus T, Aziza J, Bieth E, Laurent N, Bouton JM, Feuillet F, Makni S, Ben Amar H, Laube G, Delezoide AL, Bouvier R, Dijoud F, Ollagnon-Roman E, Roume J, Joubert M, Antignac C, Gubler MC.

    "content": "**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery to repair a damaged ligament in your knee called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This article tells you how to care for yourself when you go home from the hospital.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had surgery to reconstruct your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The surgeon drilled sockets and tunnels in the bones of your knee and attached the new ligament to the bone. You may also have had surgery to repair other tissue in your knee.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home. Plan for a spouse, friend, or neighbor to help you. It can take from a few days to a few months to be ready to return to work. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It often takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and take part in sports again after surgery.\n\n**Activity**\n\nYour surgeon will ask you to rest when you first go home. You will be told to:\n\n* Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows, placing them under your foot or calf muscle, for 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery.\n* Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet.\n* Do not use a heating pad.\n\nYou may need to wear special support stockings to help prevent blood clots from forming. Your surgeon will also give you exercises to keep the blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg. These exercises will also lower your risk for blood clots.\n\nYou will need to use crutches when you go home. You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it is OK. If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee. Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches.\n\nYou may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction. Do not change the settings on the brace yourself. The brace is usually locked when you are using crutches when walking for the first few weeks. You can unlock to work on range of motion if it's OK with your surgeon.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, however you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery. The duration of physical therapy may be 2 to 6 months. You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends. Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury.\n\n**Staying Active**\n\nGetting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important. Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the surgeon says it is OK. Until then, keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.\n\nYou can shower again after your dressing is removed. When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape strips (Steri-Strips) have been removed. Make sure that your surgeon says this is OK.\n\n**Pain**\n\nPain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should ease up over time. Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine before your surgery. Get it filled ahead of time so that you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain doesn't get too bad.\n\nYou may also be given a nerve block during surgery, which can make your leg feel numb. Make sure you take your pain medicine, even when the block is working, as the block will wear off and pain can return quickly.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area\n* Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n\n---\n\n**Recovery After ACL Reconstruction**\n\nAfter surgery, it takes 4 to 6 months for your full level of activity to return and for you to participate in sports again.\n\n**Activity**\n\nWhen you first go home, your surgeon will ask you to rest. You'll need to:\n\n* Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows, placing them under your foot or calf muscle, to reduce swelling.\n* Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery.\n* Avoid putting the pillow behind your knee.\n* Keep your knee straight.\n\nYou may need to wear special support stockings to prevent blood clots. Your surgeon will also give you exercises to keep blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg, which will lower your risk for blood clots.\n\nYou'll need to use crutches when you go home. You can begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it's OK. If you had work done on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee.\n\nYou may also need to wear a special knee brace set to limit your knee's movement. Don't change the settings yourself. The brace is usually locked when using crutches for walking during the first few weeks.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy typically starts 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, but you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery.

The numbness can last for hours and sometimes up to a day. Make sure you take your pain medicine even when the block is working.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding doesn't stop when you apply pressure.\n* Pain doesn't go away after taking pain medicine.\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle.\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch.\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions.\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C).\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home.

It is normal that your leg will feel a bit numb after the nerve block. The numbness can last for hours and sometimes up to a day. Make sure you take your pain medicine, even when the block is working. The block will wear off, and pain can return very quickly.\n\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another medicine like it may also help. Ask your surgeon or health care provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine.\n\nDo not drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine may make you too sleepy to drive safely.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area\n* Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n\n**References**\n\nBrotzman SB.

    "content": "**ACL Reconstruction**\n\nACL reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the ligament in the center of your knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects your shin bone (tibia) to your thigh bone (femur). A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements.\n\n**Description**\n\nMost people have general anesthesia right before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Other kinds of anesthesia, like regional anesthesia or a block, may also be used for this surgery.\n\nThe tissue to replace your damaged ACL will come from your own body or from a donor. A donor is a person who has died and chose to give all or part of their body to help others.\n\nTissue taken from your own body is called an autograft. The most common places to take tissue from are the knee cap tendon, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon. Your hamstrings are the muscles behind your knee.\nTissue taken from a donor is called an allograft or cadaver graft.\n\nThe procedure is usually performed with the help of knee arthroscopy. With arthroscopy, a tiny camera is inserted into the knee through a small surgical cut. The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon will use the camera to check the ligaments and other tissues of your knee.\n\nYour surgeon will make other small cuts around your knee and insert other medical instruments. Your surgeon will fix any other damage found, and then will replace your ACL by following these steps:\n\nThe torn ligament will be removed with a shaver or other instruments.\nIf your own tissue is being used to make your new ACL, your surgeon will make a larger cut. Then, the autograft will be removed through this cut.\nYour surgeon will make tunnels and sockets in your bone through which to bring the new tissue. This new tissue will be put at the same place as your old ACL.\nYour surgeon will attach the new ligament to the bone with screws or other devices to hold it in place. As it heals, the graft will remodel to become your new ligament.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, your surgeon will close your cuts with sutures (stitches) and cover the area with a dressing. You may be able to view pictures after the procedure of what the surgeon saw and what was done during the surgery.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nIf you do not have your ACL reconstructed, your knee may continue to be unstable. This increases the chance you may have a meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction may be used for these knee problems:\n\n* Knee that gives way or feels unstable during daily activities\n* Knee pain\n* Inability to return to sports or other activities\n* When other ligaments are also injured\n* When your meniscus is torn\n\n**Before Surgery**\n\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.\nAsk your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions.\nTell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing. Ask your providers for help if you need it.\nAlways let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses you may have before your surgery.\n\n**After Surgery**\n\nMost people can go home the day of the surgery. You may have to wear a knee brace for the first 1 to 6 weeks. You also may need crutches for 1 to 6 weeks. How long you will need to use a crutch and brace will depend on the type of surgery you had and the extent of the reconstruction. Most people are allowed to move their knee right after surgery. This may help prevent stiffness. You may need medicine for your pain.\n\nPhysical therapy can help many people regain motion and strength in their knee. Therapy can last up to 4 to 6 months.\n\nHow soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It can be from a few days to a few months. A full return to activities and sports will often take 4 to 6 months. Sports that involve quick changes in direction, such as soccer, basketball, and football, may require up to 9 to 12 months of rehabilitation.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people will have a stable knee that does not give way after ACL reconstruction. Better surgical methods and rehabilitation have led to:\n\n* Less pain and stiffness after surgery\n* Fewer complications with the surgery itself\n* Faster recovery time\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction**\n\n**What is it?**\nACL reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the ligament in the center of your knee.\n\n**The Ligament**\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects your shin bone (tibia) to your thigh bone (femur).\n\n**Causes of Injury**\nA tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements.\n\n**Preparation for Surgery**\n\n* Most people have general anesthesia right before surgery.

This enzyme is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of certain fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Specifically, it is involved in the first step of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the VLCFA molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the VLCFAs are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA Oxidase Deficiency**\n\t+ More than 20 ACOX1 gene mutations have been identified in people with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.\n\t+ These mutations prevent the peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme from breaking down VLCFAs efficiently, leading to their accumulation in the body.\n\t+ The abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system, resulting in the breakdown of myelin and leukodystrophy.\n\t+ Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the neurological abnormalities that occur in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**ACOX1 Gene**\n\nThe ACOX1 gene is responsible for producing an enzyme called acyl-CoA oxidase 1, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of fatty acids in the body.\n\n**Function of the ACOX1 Gene**\n\nThe ACOX1 gene helps to break down very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. It is unclear exactly how VLCFA accumulation leads to the specific features of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.\n\n**Leukodystrophy and Neurological Abnormalities**\n\nResearchers suggest that the abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system that leads to the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy.

This condition is characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and immune system function. The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRAP enzyme or result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme. These mutations affect both TRAP isoforms and impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin.\n\n**SPENCDI Features**\n\nIn people with SPENCDI, increased bone breakdown contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature. An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Immune system abnormalities also impair the body's normal response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections.

Within skeletal muscle cells, skeletal α-actin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are composed of thin filaments made up of actin and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin. Attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Actin-accumulation Myopathy**\n    At least nine variants in the ACTA1 gene have been identified in people with actin-accumulation myopathy. Most of these variants change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.\n    Researchers suggest that ACTA1 gene variants that cause actin-accumulation myopathy may affect the way the actin binds to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities and is important in the formation of thin filaments from individual actin molecules. Dysfunctional actin-ATP binding may result in abnormal thin filament formation and impair muscle contraction, leading to muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of actin-accumulation myopathy.\n*   **Cap Myopathy**\n    At least one ACTA1 gene variant has been identified as a cause of cap myopathy. The variant replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid valine at position 47 in the protein sequence, written as Met47Val or M47V. The resulting abnormal protein may interfere with the proper assembly of thin filaments. Cap myopathy is characterized by the presence of cap-like structures in muscle cells, and these structures are composed of disorganized thin filaments.\n*   **Congenital Fiber-Type Disproportion**\n    At least seven variants in the ACTA1 gene have been found to cause congenital fiber-type disproportion, a disorder that causes general muscle weakness that typically does not worsen over time. The variants that cause this condition change single amino acids in skeletal α-actin. These variants lead to the production of an abnormal actin protein, which interferes with the function of normal actin proteins in the sarcomere. As a result, the function of the sarcomere is impaired, which disrupts muscle contraction. Inefficient muscle contraction leads to muscle weakness in people with congenital fiber-type disproportion.\n\n---\n\n**ACTA1 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n*   **Intranuclear Rod Myopathy**\n    At least 13 variants in the ACTA1 gene have been identified in people with intranuclear rod myopathy. These variants change single amino acids in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.\n    The abnormal accumulation of actin in the nucleus of muscle cells and a corresponding reduction of available actin in muscle fibers may impair muscle contraction and lead to the muscle weakness seen in intranuclear rod myopathy.\n*   **Nemaline Myopathy**\n    More than 170 variants in the ACTA1 gene have been found to cause nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common muscle disorder associated with ACTA1 gene variants.\n    Some of the variants that cause this disorder alter the structure or function of skeletal α-actin, causing the protein to cluster together and form clumps (aggregates).\n*   **Actin-Accumulation Myopathy**\n    At least nine variants in the ACTA1 gene have been identified in people with actin-accumulation myopathy. Most of these variants change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.\n    Researchers suggest that ACTA1 gene variants that cause actin-accumulation myopathy may affect the way the actin binds to ATP.\n*   **Cap Myopathy**\n    At least one ACTA1 gene variant has been identified as a cause of cap myopathy.

These variants change single amino acids in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.\n\nACTA1 gene variants that cause intranuclear rod myopathy result in rod-shaped accumulations of actin in the nucleus of muscle cells. Normally, most actin is found in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm), with small amounts in the nucleus itself. Researchers suggest that the ACTA1 gene variants that cause intranuclear rod myopathy may interfere with the normal transport of actin between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, resulting in the accumulation of actin in the nucleus and the formation of intranuclear rods.\n\nAbnormal accumulation of actin in the nucleus of muscle cells and a corresponding reduction of available actin in muscle fibers may impair muscle contraction and lead to the muscle weakness seen in intranuclear rod myopathy. A few ACTA1 gene variants that have been identified in people with intranuclear rod myopathy have also been found in people with actin-accumulation myopathy (described above). It is unclear how the same variants can cause two different conditions.\n\n**Nemaline Myopathy**\n\nMore than 170 variants in the ACTA1 gene have been found to cause nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common muscle disorder associated with ACTA1 gene variants. Some of the variants that cause this disorder alter the structure or function of skeletal α-actin, causing the protein to cluster together and form clumps (aggregates). These aggregates interfere with the normal functioning of muscle cells.\n\nOther ACTA1 gene variants prevent the production of any skeletal α-actin, impairing the muscle cells' ability to contract. ACTA1 gene variants that cause nemaline myopathy impair muscle contraction, causing weakness and the other features of this condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ACTA\n* ACTS_HUMAN\n* alpha skeletal muscle actin\n* ASMA\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ACTA1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ACTIN, ALPHA-1, SKELETAL MUSCLE; ACTA1\n\n---\n\n**ACTA1 Gene**\n\nThe ACTA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal muscle alpha-actin.

    "content": "**ACTA2 Gene**\n\nThe ACTA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nSmooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.\n\nLayers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n    More than 30 ACTA2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.\n\n    ACTA2 gene mutations that are associated with familial TAAD change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the smooth muscle α-2 actin protein. These changes likely affect the way the protein functions in smooth muscle contraction, interfering with the sarcomeres' ability to prevent arteries from stretching. The aorta, where the force of pumping blood coming directly from the heart is most intense, is particularly vulnerable to this stretching, resulting in the aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with familial TAAD.\n\n---\n\n**ACTA2 Gene**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nAt least one mutation in the ACTA2 gene causes multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome. This disorder impairs the activity of smooth muscles throughout the body and leads to widespread problems including blood vessel abnormalities, decreased response of the pupils to light, a weak (hypotonic) bladder, and impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (hypoperistalsis).\n\nThe mutation that causes multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at protein position 179, written as Arg179His or R179H. This mutation results in impaired contraction of smooth muscles in many organs, leading to the signs and symptoms of multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome. It is unclear why this ACTA2 gene mutation has effects on smooth muscles throughout the body while others affect only the aorta.\n\n**Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**\n\nMore than 30 ACTA2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

    "content": "**ACTG2 Gene**\n\nThe ACTG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are organized into filaments, which are important for the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) and cell movement. These filaments also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.\n\nThe γ-2 actin protein is found in smooth muscle cells of the urinary and intestinal tracts. Smooth muscles line the internal organs; they contract and relax without being consciously controlled. The γ-2 actin protein is necessary for contraction of the smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines. These contractions empty urine from the bladder and move food through the intestines as part of the digestive process.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral inherited mutations in the ACTG2 gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition that impairs the smooth muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis). This condition mimics a physical blockage of the intestines without an actual obstruction. Problems with emptying the bladder can also occur in people with this disorder.\n\nThe ACTG2 gene mutations that cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction are thought to hinder the formation of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the intestines and bladder to contract. As a result, peristalsis in the intestines is impaired and the bladder is less able to contract and expel urine, leading to the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\nAt least 22 ACTG2 gene mutations have been found to cause megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), which is characterized by impairment of peristalsis and emptying the bladder. The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause MMIHS are not inherited; rather they occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. The alterations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the γ-2 actin protein. These changes hinder the formation of actin filaments and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines to contract. As a result, the bladder cannot empty normally, leading to an enlarged bladder (megacystis) and painful abdominal swelling (distention). In addition, partially digested food can build up in the intestines, which also contributes to distention. Poor digestion may lead to malnutrition in people with MMIHS.\n\n---\n\n**ACTG2 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n*Other Disorders*\n\nACTG2 gene mutations cause a spectrum of disorders, with MMIHS at the severe end. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the γ-2 actin protein. However, in less severely affected individuals, the mutations are usually inherited.\n\nThese mutations often cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In some affected individuals, the smooth muscle problems are episodic and come and go throughout life. Intestinal malrotation can also occur in people with ACTG2 gene mutations. This condition occurs when the intestines do not fold properly; instead, they twist abnormally, which can impede the movement of food.\n\nEffects on the urinary tract include recurrent urinary tract infections and impaired bladder function. Individuals with inherited ACTG2 gene mutations can have one or more of these intestinal or urinary tract abnormalities; they are usually milder than MMIHS, or they begin later in life.\n\n**Megacystis-Microcolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome**\n\nAt least 22 ACTG2 gene mutations have been found to cause megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), which is characterized by impairment of peristalsis and emptying the bladder.\n\nThe ACTG2 gene mutations that cause MMIHS are not inherited; rather they occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.

    "content": "**ACVR1 Gene**\n\nThe **ACVR1 gene** provides instructions for making the activin receptor type-1 (ACVR1) protein, which is a member of a protein family called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The ACVR1 protein is found in many tissues of the body including skeletal muscle and cartilage.\n* It helps to control the growth and development of the bones and muscles, including the gradual replacement of cartilage by bone (ossification).\n* This process occurs in normal skeletal maturation from birth to young adulthood.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Variants (also known as mutations) in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified).\n* The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals.\n* The most common variant, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitutes the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H).\n* Other variants in the ACVR1 gene cause rarer forms of the condition that can be more severe and often involve skeletal abnormalities, such as multiple abnormally formed fingers and toes.\n* The variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected person's parent or in early embryonic development.\n\n---\n\n**ACVR1 Gene**\n\n**Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals. The most common variant, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitutes the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H). Other variants in the ACVR1 gene cause rarer forms of the condition that can be more severe and often involve skeletal abnormalities, such as multiple abnormally formed fingers and toes. The variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected person's parent or in early embryonic development. The genetic change is found in all of the affected person's cells.\n\nStudies show that the R206H variant changes the shape of the ACVR1 protein. This shape change disrupts the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12. As a result, the receptor is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even in the absence of ligands. Other ACVR1 gene variants result in a receptor protein that is turned on by ligands more easily than the normal version of the protein. Too much receptor activity causes overgrowth of bone and cartilage, resulting in the signs and symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Although the same ACVR1 gene variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are associated with a rare brain cancer (described below), people with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva do not have an increased risk of developing cancer.\n\n**Rare Brain Cancer**\n\nVariants in the ACVR1 gene contribute to the development of a rare brain cancer in children called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Most people with DIPG have a particular genetic change in another gene, but a second variant in a different gene (such as ACVR1) is required for a tumor to develop.\n\n---\n\n**ACVR1 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Variants in the ACVR1 gene contribute to the development of a rare brain cancer in children called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).**\n\nMost people with DIPG have a particular genetic change in another gene, but a second variant in a different gene (such as ACVR1) is required for a tumor to develop. ACVR1 variants are found in around 25 percent of children with DIPG.\n\n**Most of the ACVR1 gene variants involved in DIPG are the same as those that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (described above).**\n\nHowever, in DIPG, the variant occurs during a person’s lifetime and is found only in cells that become cancerous. (This type of genetic change is called a somatic variant.) As in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, the ACVR1 variant increases the activity of the ACVR1 receptor.\n\nIn combination with other cellular changes, abnormal ACVR1 receptor activity can make cells grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* activin A receptor type I\n* activin A receptor, type I\n* activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2\n* activin A type I receptor\n* activin A type I receptor precursor\n* ActR-IA protein, human\n* ACTRI\n* ACVR1_HUMAN\n* ACVR1A\n* ACVRLK2\n* ALK2 hydroxyalkyl-protein kinase\n* SKR1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of ACVR1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ACTIVIN A RECEPTOR, TYPE I; ACVR1\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Chen D, Zhao M, Mundy GR.

This protein is found on the surface of cells, especially in the lining of developing arteries.\n\nThe ACVRL1 protein is a receptor that acts as a \"lock\" waiting for a specific protein, called its ligand, to serve as the \"key.\" In the case of the ACVRL1 protein, the ligand is called transforming growth factor beta. The interaction between these proteins plays a role in the development of blood vessels. In particular, this protein interaction is involved in the specialization of new blood vessels into arteries or veins.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2**: Dozens of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene have been found to cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. Many ACVRL1 gene mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the ACVRL1 protein, which impairs the protein's function. Other mutations prevent production of the ACVRL1 protein or result in an abnormally small protein that cannot function. The shortage of functional ACVRL1 protein appears to interfere with the development of boundaries between arteries and veins, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2.\n* **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n* **Other Disorders**: A common genetic variation (polymorphism) in the ACVRL1 gene has been found to appear more often in people who develop arteriovenous malformations in the brain, but who do not have other signs or symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, than in the general population.\n\n---\n\n**ACVRL1 Gene**\n\nThe ACVRL1 gene is associated with an increased risk of arteriovenous malformations in the brain, particularly in individuals without other signs or symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.\n\n**Genetic Variation**\n\nA common genetic variation (polymorphism) in the ACVRL1 gene has been found to appear more often in people who develop arteriovenous malformations in the brain than in the general population.

The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor. This protein is involved in the first step of blood clotting at the site of injury, which is to help cells called platelets stick together and attach to the walls of blood vessels, forming temporary clots.\n\nThe ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts von Willebrand factor into smaller pieces to regulate its interaction with platelets. By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of blood clots in normal circulation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)**: More than 150 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported in people with the familial form of TTP. This condition causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart.\n\n    Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTS13 enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the enzyme that cannot function properly. These mutations severely reduce the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme, resulting in abnormal clots throughout the body.\n\n    The uncut version of von Willebrand factor is hyperactive and may induce platelets to stick together, even in the absence of injury, leading to the signs and symptoms of TTP.\n\n---\n\n**ADAMTS13 Gene**\n\nThe ADAMTS13 gene is responsible for producing an enzyme that helps regulate blood clotting. Mutations in this gene can lead to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare disorder characterized by the formation of abnormal blood clots throughout the body.\n\n**What is Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura?**\n\nTTP is a serious medical condition that occurs when the ADAMTS13 enzyme is not functioning properly. This can lead to the formation of abnormal blood clots in small blood vessels, which can cause a range of symptoms including:\n\n* Neurological problems such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech\n* Fever\n* Abnormal kidney function\n* Abdominal pain\n* Heart problems\n\n**How Do Mutations in the ADAMTS13 Gene Cause TTP?**\n\nMost mutations that lead to TTP change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTS13 enzyme.

Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, which are complex molecules found in the spaces between cells that add strength, support, and stretchiness (elasticity) to many body tissues.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADAMTS2 enzyme cuts a short chain of protein building blocks (amino acids) off one end of procollagens. This clipping step is necessary for the resulting collagen molecules to assemble into strong, slender fibrils.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene have been identified in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the dermatosparaxis type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues.\n\nThe dermatosparaxis type is characterized by soft, fragile skin that sags and wrinkles; easy bruising; and distinctive facial features. Mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene greatly reduce the production or activity of the ADAMTS2 enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, procollagens cannot be processed correctly. As a result, collagen fibrils are not assembled properly.

The **ADAMTSL2** protein is active in many different tissues and is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.\n\nStudies suggest that the **ADAMTSL2** protein interacts with a protein called latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1).

    "content": "**ADAR Gene**\n\nThe ADAR gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1). This protein is involved in making changes to (editing) RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Specifically, it attaches (binds) to RNA and changes an RNA building block (nucleotide) called adenosine to another nucleotide called inosine.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADAR1 protein is involved in the control of the innate immune response, which is the immune system's early response to foreign invaders (pathogens). The immune system sometimes fails to recognize the body’s own RNA and may act as though it belongs to a pathogen that should be attacked. By changing adenosine to inosine, ADAR1 may prevent the immune system from targeting the body's own tissues.\n\nThe ADAR1 protein is also thought to inhibit the replication and spread of certain viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, by modifying their RNA. In addition, the ADAR1 protein controls the function of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters at particular sites in the body by modifying the RNA blueprint for the receptor proteins that interact with the neurotransmitters.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Aicardi-Goutières syndrome: Variants (also called mutations) in the ADAR gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that typically involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, immune system abnormalities, and other health problems. Some of these variants lead to the production of an ADAR1 protein that is less able to bind to RNA; others impair the protein's RNA editing function. As a result, control of the immune response is impaired and the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, leading to the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**ADAR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\n* ADAR gene variants have been identified in people with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria. This disorder is characterized by freckle-like spots (macules) on the face, hands, and feet that are darker or lighter than the surrounding skin. These macules generally appear in infancy or early childhood.\n* Variants in the ADAR gene that lead to dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria cause cells to produce a version of the ADAR1 protein that does not function properly. While the function of this protein in the skin is unknown, researchers suggest that incorrect RNA editing may result in pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) that are more or less active than normal, causing the skin spots that occur in people with this disorder.\n\n**Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\n* Variants (also called mutations) in the ADAR gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that typically involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, immune system abnormalities, and other health problems. Some of these variants lead to the production of an ADAR1 protein that is less able to bind to RNA; others impair the protein's RNA editing function. As a result, control of the immune response is impaired and the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, leading to the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ADAR1\n* adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-A\n* DRADA\n* DSH\n* DSRAD\n* dsRNA adenosine deaminase\n* dsRNA adeonosine deaminase\n* IFI-4\n* interferon-induced protein 4\n* interferon-inducible protein 4\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ADAR\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: DYSCHROMATOSIS SYMMETRICA HEREDITARIA; DSH, ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, RNA-SPECIFIC; ADAR\n\n---\n\n**ADAR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **DYSCHROMATOSIS SYMMETRICA HEREDITARIA; DSH**\n*   **ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, RNA-SPECIFIC; ADAR**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of ADAR**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n1.

    "content": "**ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\n**Description**\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements. These movements typically appear as sudden (paroxysmal) jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing (dystonia), or writhing (choreiform) movements and can affect the limbs, neck, and face.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe abnormal movements associated with ADCY5-related dyskinesia usually begin between infancy and late adolescence. They can occur continually during waking hours and frequently disturb sleep. The involuntary movements often occur when changing position or deliberately making other movements.\n\nSeverely affected infants may experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and delay in development of motor skills such as crawling and walking. Later, these individuals may have difficulties with activities of daily living and eventually require a wheelchair. In more mildly affected individuals, the condition has little impact on walking and other motor skills, although the abnormal movements can lead to clumsiness or difficulty with social acceptance.\n\n**Course of the Disorder**\n\nIn some people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, the disorder is generally stable throughout their lifetime. In others, it slowly gets worse (progresses) in both frequency and severity before stabilizing or even improving in middle age. Anxiety, fatigue, and other stress can temporarily increase the severity of the signs and symptoms of ADCY5-related dyskinesia, while some affected individuals may experience remission periods of days or weeks without abnormal movements.\n\n**Life Expectancy and Intelligence**\n\nLife expectancy is not usually affected by ADCY5-related dyskinesia, and most people with this condition have normal intelligence.\n\n---\n\n**ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\n**What is ADCY5-related Dyskinesia?**\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements. The condition is caused by mutations in the ADCY5 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe abnormal movements associated with ADCY5-related dyskinesia typically appear as sudden (paroxysmal) jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing (dystonia), or writhing (choreiform) movements. These movements can affect the limbs, neck, and face.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAt least 400 people have been diagnosed with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, but its prevalence is unknown. The disorder is thought to be underdiagnosed because its features can resemble those of other conditions such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAs its name suggests, ADCY5-related dyskinesia is caused by mutations in the ADCY5 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5. Some ADCY5 gene mutations that cause ADCY5-related dyskinesia are thought to increase adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and the level of cAMP within cells. Others prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nFamilial dyskinesia with facial myokymia (FDFM)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Dyskinesia with orofacial involvement, autosomal dominant\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia\n\n---\n\n**ADCY5-related dyskinesia**\n\n**What is ADCY5-related dyskinesia?**\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, trunk, and limbs.\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the ADCY5 gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in signaling pathways that regulate muscle tone. The mutation leads to an overactive signaling pathway, resulting in excessive muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Involuntary movements of the face, trunk, and limbs\n* Facial myokymia (involuntary twitching of facial muscles)\n* Chorea (involuntary dance-like movements)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which identifies mutations in the ADCY5 gene.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nThere is no cure for ADCY5-related dyskinesia, but treatment options may include:\n\n* Medications to reduce muscle tone and alleviate symptoms\n* Physical therapy to improve mobility and balance\n* Lifestyle modifications to manage stress and prevent exacerbation of symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ADCY5-related dyskinesia varies depending on the severity of symptoms and response to treatment. Some individuals may experience a significant improvement in symptoms, while others may require ongoing management to maintain quality of life.\n\n**Genetic inheritance**\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.\n\n**References**\n\n* Carapito R, et al. (2015).

    "content": "**ADGRE2 Gene**\n\nThe ADGRE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in several types of immune system cells, including mast cells. Mast cells, which are found in many body tissues including the skin, are important for the normal protective functions of the immune system. They also play a role in allergic reactions, which occur when the immune system overreacts to stimuli that are not harmful.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADGRE2 protein consists of two parts (subunits) that interact with each other: an alpha subunit that lies on the outside surface of the cell and a beta subunit that crosses the cell membrane and extends into the cell. The specific role of the ADGRE2 protein in mast cells is not well understood.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Vibratory Urticaria**: At least one mutation in the ADGRE2 gene has been identified in people with vibratory urticaria, a condition in which vibration, repetitive stretching, or friction on the skin results in allergy symptoms such as hives (urticaria), swelling (angioedema), redness (erythema), and itching (pruritus) in the affected area. The reaction can be brought on by towel drying, hand clapping, running, a bumpy ride in a vehicle, or other repetitive stimulation.\n*   The ADGRE2 gene mutation that causes vibratory urticaria, written as Cys492Tyr or C492Y, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) cysteine with the amino acid tyrosine at position 492 of the protein sequence. The substitution alters the protein structure and leads to a less stable interaction between the two subunits. This fragile connection can be more easily broken; vibration, friction, or stretching of the skin can disrupt the association between subunits in mast cells.\n\n---\n\n**ADGRE2 Gene**\n\n**What is ADGRE2?**\n\nThe ADGRE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called F4/80, which plays a crucial role in the immune system.

    "content": "**ADHD Screening**\n\n**What is ADHD screening?**\n\nADHD screening, also called ADHD testing, helps find out if a child, teen, or adult has ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). It's used to check for ADHD in people who have frequent, serious problems with attention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsive behavior.\n\n**Types of ADHD**\n\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n\n* Mostly Inattentive ADHD: trouble paying attention and being easily distracted\n* Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD: symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity (e.g., fidgeting, interrupting others)\n* Combined ADHD: a mix of inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms\n\n**Why do I need ADHD screening?**\n\nYou may need screening if you or someone else notices symptoms of ADHD, such as:\n\n* Attention problems:\n\t+ Missing details or making careless mistakes\n\t+ Trouble staying focused on tasks\n\t+ Not seeming to listen when spoken to directly\n\t+ Difficulty following instructions or finishing tasks\n\t+ Avoiding tasks that require long periods of mental effort\n\t+ Losing important items\n\t+ Forgetting daily activities\n* Hyperactivity-impulsivity:\n\t+ Fidgeting and squirming while seated\n\t+ Getting up when staying seated is expected\n\t+ Running around or climbing (children) or feeling restless (teens and adults)\n\t+ Trouble doing quiet activities\n\t+ Constant movement or \"on the go\"\n\t+ Talking too much\n\t+ Blurring out answers before questions are completed\n\t+ Interrupting others\n\n**What happens during an ADHD screening?**\n\nThe general screening process involves several steps:\n\n1. Physical exam: checking for certain health conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD.\n2. Review of medical history, family health history, and other records.\n3. Gathering information using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions.\n4. Screening for other mental health disorders.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for ADHD screening?**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for ADHD screening. Your provider will let you know what health and school records you may need to gather.\n\n**Are there any risks to screening?**\n\nThere is no risk to a physical exam, written test, or questionnaire.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe provider will write up the results of an ADHD screening in a report that includes a diagnosis. To diagnose ADHD, the screening must find:\n\n* Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12.\n* Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems.\n* Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings (e.g., at home and at work or school).\n* Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations.\n\nIf there is a diagnosis of ADHD, the report will include the type of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined) and whether it's mild, moderate, or severe. Any other disorders that may have been found will be included in the report.\n\n---\n\n**ADHD Screening**\n\nThere's no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help reduce symptoms. Treatment may include medicine, talk therapy, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Usually, two or more treatments are combined. Parents of children with ADHD may also receive training to help their children manage ADHD.\n\n**What is ADHD?**\n\nADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It used to be called ADD (attention-deficit disorder). A person who has ADHD has a hard time paying attention and focusing on tasks. ADHD is a common developmental disorder that begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Although it's usually diagnosed in childhood, some people with ADHD don't get diagnosed with ADHD until they are adults.\n\n**Types of ADHD**\n\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n\n* Mostly Inattentive ADHD: People have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted.\n* Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD: People have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity, including a need to always be moving and trouble controlling their actions and words.\n* Combined ADHD: People have a mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.\n\n**Why is ADHD Screening Important?**\n\nADHD screening is used to check for ADHD in people who have frequent, serious problems with attention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsive behavior. The screening also checks for other mental disorders that often happen with ADHD. Sometimes symptoms of these other disorders are mistaken for ADHD.\n\n**Who Needs ADHD Screening?**\n\n* Children as young as age four\n* Adults who have had challenges since childhood (before age 12) with focusing, impulsive behavior, restlessness, and/or being organized\n\n**Symptoms of ADHD**\n\nPeople with symptoms of attention problems may often:\n\n* Miss details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or in other activities\n* Have trouble staying focused on play activities or work tasks\n* Not seem to listen when spoken to directly\n* Find it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, or may start but get easily sidetracked\n* Have trouble being organized, keeping belongings in order, and managing time\n* Avoid doing tasks that require long periods of mental effort\n* Lose important items, such as books, wallets, keys, eyeglasses, and cellphones\n* Forget about doing daily activities\n\nPeople with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity may often:\n\n* Fidget and squirm while seated\n* Get up when staying seated is expected, such as at school or work\n* Run around or climb when it's not appropriate (children) or feel restless (teens and adults)\n* Have trouble doing quiet activities\n* Be constantly moving or \"on the go\"\n* Talk much more than is normal\n* Blurt out answers before questions are completed\n* Have trouble waiting for their turn\n* Interrupt others, for example during conversations or games\n\n**What Happens During an ADHD Screening?**\n\nThe general screening process involves several steps. A primary care provider may do the entire screening or refer the person to a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.\n\nDuring an ADHD screening, the provider will:\n\n* Gather information about the person's symptoms and behavior\n* Do tests to help diagnose the cause of the person's symptoms\n* Follow a set of professional guidelines for gathering information, doing tests, and diagnosing the cause of a person's symptoms\n\n---\n\n**ADHD Screening**\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child has ADHD, it's essential to see a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a healthcare professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.\n\n**The Screening Process**\n\nDuring an ADHD screening, the provider will:\n\n* Do a physical exam. An exam by a primary care provider checks for certain health conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. The exam may include vision and hearing tests (for children and adults), thyroid tests, and other tests.\n* Review medical history, family health history, and other records. The cause of ADHD isn't known, but it often runs in families. So, family history is important. The results of any past tests and school reports provide valuable information, too. For adults, old school records can help a provider find out if symptoms began in childhood.\n* Gather information using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions. A provider will use one or more tools to gather, organize, and evaluate information during an ADHD screening. These tools have rating scales (scoring systems) that help the provider see if a person's symptoms and history fit a diagnosis of ADHD.\n\n**The Screening Process for Children**\n\nFor children, the screening process involves:\n\n* Interviewing the child about their symptoms. Questions and activities are geared toward their age.\n* Gathering information from others, such as:\n\t+ Teachers\n\t+ Babysitters\n\t+ Coaches\n\t+ Other family members who spend time with the child\n\t+ Parents completing checklists and/or questionnaires\n\n**The Screening Process for Adults**\n\nFor adults, the screening process involves:\n\n* Interviewing the adult about their symptoms.\n* Gathering information from others, such as:\n\t+ Family members who know the person from childhood\n\t+ Spouses\n\t+ Friends\n\t+ Co-workers\n\n**Screening for Other Mental Health Disorders**\n\nPeople who have ADHD often have other mental health disorders. It's also possible that another disorder, and not ADHD, is causing symptoms. So, mental health screening tests are often done as needed to check for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.\n\n**Preparing for the Screening**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for ADHD screening. Your provider will let you know what health and school records you may need to gather.\n\n**Risks of the Screening**\n\nThere is no risk to a physical exam, written test, or questionnaire.\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nThe provider will usually write up the results of an ADHD screening in a report that includes a diagnosis. To diagnose ADHD, the screening must find all of these things:\n\n* Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12.\n* Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems.\n* Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings (e.g., at home and at work or school).\n* Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations.\n\nIf there is a diagnosis of ADHD, the report will include the type of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined). It will also say whether ADHD is mild, moderate, or severe. Any other disorders that may have been found will be included in the report.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere's no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help reduce symptoms. Treatment may include medicine, talk therapy, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Usually, two or more treatments are combined. Parents of children with ADHD may also receive training to help their children manage ADHD.\n\n---\n\n**ADHD Screening**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is ADHD?**\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It affects both children and adults, and its exact cause is still unknown.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of ADHD**\n\nThe symptoms of ADHD can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n*   Inattention: difficulty paying attention to details, following instructions, or completing tasks\n*   Hyperactivity: excessive fidgeting, running, or feeling constantly \"on the go\"\n*   Impulsivity: difficulty controlling impulses, leading to impulsive behaviors such as interrupting others or blurting out answers\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing ADHD**\n\nTo diagnose ADHD, healthcare providers typically use a combination of:\n\n*   Clinical evaluation: a thorough medical and psychological examination\n*   Behavioral observations: observing the child's behavior in different settings\n*   Rating scales: using standardized questionnaires to assess symptoms and their impact on daily life\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options for ADHD**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ADHD, various treatment options can help manage its symptoms. These include:\n\n*   Medications: stimulants, non-stimulants, or combination therapy\n*   Behavioral therapies: behavioral modification, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or parent training\n*   Lifestyle changes: regular exercise, balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and stress management\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Screening Tools for ADHD**\n\nSeveral screening tools can help identify children at risk of developing ADHD. These include:\n\n*   Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (VAS)\n*   Conners' Rating Scales\n*   Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Seek Help**\n\nIf you suspect your child might have ADHD, don't hesitate to consult a healthcare provider. Early detection and intervention can make a significant difference in their quality of life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n*   Child Mental Health\n*   Mental Disorders\n*   Mental Health",

    "content": "**ADSL Gene**\n\nThe ADSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylosuccinate lyase. This enzyme performs two steps in the process that produces (synthesizes) purine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylosuccinate lyase. This enzyme performs two steps in the process that produces (synthesizes) purine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n    More than 50 mutations in the ADSL gene have been found to cause adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. This condition causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that leads to delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction, and seizures.\n\n        Most of the mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme.

    "content": "**AFF2 Gene**\n\nThe **AFF2 gene** provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the nucleus of cells but whose function is not well understood. Some studies suggest that it acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of other genes, although the identity of these genes is unknown. Other studies show that the protein can attach to specific regions of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. It is thought that the AFF2 protein helps control the process by which the mRNA blueprint is cut and rearranged to produce different versions of proteins (alternative splicing).\n\nOne region of the **AFF2 gene** contains a particular DNA segment known as a CCG trinucleotide repeat, so called because this segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times within the gene. In most people, the number of CCG repeats ranges from 6 to about 30.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Fragile XE syndrome**: Variants (also called mutations) in the AFF2 gene cause fragile XE syndrome, a condition characterized by mild intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Nearly all cases are caused by a variant called a CCG trinucleotide repeat expansion, in which the CCG trinucleotide is abnormally repeated more than 200 times, which makes this region of the gene unstable. As a result, the AFF2 gene is turned off (silenced), and no protein is produced from it. It is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to problems with intellectual functioning.\n* **Rare deletions**: Rarely, small deletions of genetic material from the AFF2 gene are associated with fragile XE syndrome, although how these deletions affect the protein and lead to intellectual disability is unknown.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More about fragile XE syndrome: [link]\n\n---\n\n**AFF2 Gene**\n\nThe AFF2 gene is located on the X chromosome.\n\n**Variants in the AFF2 Gene**\n\nVariants in the AFF2 gene cause fragile XE syndrome, a condition characterized by mild intellectual disability and learning difficulties.

    "content": "**AFF4 Gene**\n\nThe AFF4 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex called the super elongation complex (SEC). During embryonic development, the SEC is involved in an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. By re-starting the transcription of certain genes after pauses that normally occur during the process, the SEC helps ensure that development proceeds appropriately before birth.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **CHOPS Syndrome**: Mutations in the AFF4 gene cause CHOPS syndrome, a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). The name \"CHOPS\" is an abbreviation for a list of features of the disorder including cognitive impairment, coarse facial features, heart defects, obesity, lung (pulmonary) involvement, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities.\n* **Cancers**: The AFF4 gene is occasionally involved in chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) that are found in certain blood cancers called infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mixed lineage leukemia.\n\n---\n\n**AFF4 Gene**\n\nThe AFF4 gene is involved in chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) that are found in certain blood cancers called infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mixed lineage leukemia.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nThe translocations fuse the AFF4 gene with another gene called KMT2A (formerly known as MLL). The fusion gene provides instructions for making an abnormal protein that combines features of the proteins produced from AFF4 and KMT2A.

    "title": "AGA gene: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/aga/",
    "content": "**AGA Gene**\n\nThe AGA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). Specifically, this enzyme cuts (cleaves) glycoproteins between a protein building block (amino acid) called asparagine and a sugar molecule called N-acetylglucosamine. This cut is one of the last steps in breaking down a glycoprotein in the lysosome.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMany variants (also known as mutations) in the AGA gene have been found to cause aspartylglucosaminuria. This condition primarily affects mental functioning and movement. Aspartylglucosaminuria worsens over time. Most AGA gene variants change one amino acid in aspartylglucosaminidase. One variant, found in 98 percent of people with this condition in Finland, replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid serine at position 163 in the enzyme (written as Cys163Ser or C163S). Many AGA gene variants, including C163S, disrupt the structure of aspartylglucosaminidase, resulting in an enzyme that cannot effectively break down glycoproteins because it cannot make the cut between asparagine and N-acetylglucosamine. A buildup of glycoproteins seems to particularly affect nerve cells in the brain; loss of these cells causes a progressive decline in mental functioning and the other signs and symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nASRG glycosylasparaginase N(4)-(beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)-L-asparagine amidase\n\n---\n\n**AGA Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Aronson NN Jr. Aspartylglycosaminuria: biochemistry and molecular biology.
