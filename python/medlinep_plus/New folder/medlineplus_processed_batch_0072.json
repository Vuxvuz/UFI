But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.\n\n**What Causes the Flu?**\n\nThe flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Fever or feeling feverish/chills\n* Cough\n* Sore throat\n* Runny or stuffy nose\n* Muscle or body aches\n* Headaches\n* Fatigue (tiredness)\n* Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.\n\n**Distinguishing Between the Flu and a Cold**\n\n| Signs and Symptoms | Cold | Flu |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Start of symptoms | Slowly | Suddenly |\n| Fever | Rarely | Usually |\n| Aches | Sometimes (slight) | Usually |\n| Fatigue, weakness | Sometimes | Usually |\n| Headache | Rarely | Common |\n| Stuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throat | Common | Sometimes |\n\n**Complications**\n\nSome people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:\n\n* Bronchitis\n* Ear infection\n* Sinus infection\n* Pneumonia\n* Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)\n\nThe flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu.\n\n**Who is at Higher Risk?**\n\nCertain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including:\n\n* Adults 65 and older\n* Pregnant women\n* Children younger than 5\n* People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nMost people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.\n\nBut if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.\n\n---\n\n**Flu**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the Flu?**\n\nThe flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses.

    "content": "**Flu**\n\nThe flu (influenza) is a viral respiratory illness that causes fever, chills, runny nose, body aches, and cough. It spreads easily from person to person.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   The flu is caused by an influenza virus.\n*   Most people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu.\n*   You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nFlu symptoms often start quickly. You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time, symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days.\n\n*   The first symptom is often a fever between 100°F (37.8°C) and 104°F (40°C) that comes on suddenly.\n*   Other common symptoms include:\n    *   Body aches\n    *   Chills\n    *   Headache\n    *   Lack of energy\n    *   Cough\n    *   Runny or stuffy nose\n    *   Sneezing\n    *   Sore throat\n    *   Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost people do not need to see a provider when they have flu symptoms. This is because most people are not at risk for a severe case of the flu.\n\nIf you are very sick with the flu, or you are at high risk for severe illness, you should contact your provider.\n\nThere is a test to detect the flu. It is done by swabbing the nose or throat. Most of the time, test results are available very fast. The test can help your provider determine the best treatment.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHOME CARE\n\n*   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches.\n*   Providers sometimes suggest that you use both types of medicine.\n*   Aspirin can also reduce fever and aches, but it may have potential serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding. So it's best to avoid using aspirin and it should never be given to treat flu in someone age 18 or less.\n\nCertain medicines should not be given to children, or only after a certain age.\n\n*   Do not give cold medicines to children younger than 4 years old.\n*   Only give cold medicines to children ages 4 to 6 years if your provider recommends it.\n*   Do not give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months unless directed by your provider.\n*   Aspirin should not be used in children and teens due to the risk of Reye syndrome.\n\nANTIVIRAL DRUGS\n\nMost people with milder symptoms do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines. Your provider may recommend antiviral treatment if you are very sick with the flu. You also may be given antivirals if you are at risk for serious illness. Children at risk for a severe case of the flu may also need these medicines.\n\nThe health problems below may increase the risk of getting sicker with the flu:\n\n*   Being younger than age 5 years (those under age 2 are even more at risk) or age 65 or older\n*   Lung disease (including asthma)\n*   Heart conditions (except high blood pressure)\n*   Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions\n*   Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease)\n*   Diabetes\n*   A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids\n*   Neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and muscular dystrophy\n*   Other long-term medical problems\n\nThese medicines may shorten the time you have symptoms by about 1 day. They work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms.\n\nAntibiotics are NOT used to treat the flu. Antibiotics kill bacteria. They won't work on the viruses that cause the flu.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMillions of people in the United States get the flu each year. Most people get better within a week or two, but thousands of people with the flu develop pneumonia or a brain infection. They may need to stay in the hospital. About 21,000 people in the United States die each year of problems from the flu.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Ear infection\n*   Sinus infection\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Myocarditis\n*   Encephalitis (infection of the brain)\n*   Meningitis\n*   Seizures\n*   Multi-organ failure\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child get the flu and are at risk for having complications.\n\nAlso contact your provider if flu symptoms are very bad and not getting better.\n\nContact your provider right away if you or your child have:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   High fever\n*   Shortness of breath\n\nAny breathing problems are an emergency. Seek medical help right away.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can take steps to avoid catching or spreading the flu. The best step is for everyone age 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine. There are two types:\n\nInfluenza (flu) vaccine (live, intranasal): This vaccine is a nasal spray. People ages 2 through 49 years who are not pregnant may receive LAIV.\n\nInfluenza (flu) vaccine (inactivated or recombinant): This vaccine is delivered by injection. Everyone 6 months and older can get the vaccine.\n\nTo help prevent spreading the flu when you are sick, stay home and away from others both inside and outside your household\n\n---\n\n**Flu: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/8)**\n\n**Staying Home**\n\nAs much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from others in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.\n\n**Tracking Symptoms**\n\nKeep track of your symptoms. You may receive instructions from your provider on how to check and report your symptoms.\n\n**Protecting Others**\n\nWear a well-fitted face mask or respirator that fits well over your nose and mouth without gaps when you see your provider and anytime other people are in the same room with you. If you can't wear a mask, for example, due to breathing problems, people in your home should wear a mask if they need to be in the same room with you.\n\n**Good Hygiene**\n\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue after use.\n\nWash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before eating or preparing food, after using the toilet, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) if soap and water are not available.\n\n**Cleaning and Disinfecting**\n\nDo not share personal items such as cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding. Wash anything you have used in soap and water.\n\nClean all \"high-touch\" areas in the home, such as doorknobs, bathroom and kitchen fixtures, toilets, phones, tablets, counters, and other surfaces. Use a household cleaning spray and follow instructions for use.\n\n**Cleaning Air**\n\nTake steps for cleaner air in your home. You can do this by opening windows, turning on exhaust fans in your bathrooms and kitchen, using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners, and setting the fan on your furnace or air conditioning to \"on\" if you have central heating and cooling in your home.\n\n**Returning to Normal Activities**\n\nYou can go back to your normal activities if both of the following things are true:\n\nFor at least 24 hours, you have been feeling better and your symptoms are improving AND\nYou have not had a fever for at least 24 hours (and you are not using fever-reducing medicine)\n\n**Protecting Others After Recovery**\n\nEven though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days. For this reason, once you go back to your normal activities, continue to protect others from illness by taking these steps for 5 days:\n\nPractice good hygiene\nTake steps for cleaner air\nWear a mask around others\nPractice physical distancing by avoiding close contact and avoiding crowds\n\nIf your fever returns after resuming normal activities, you should go back to staying home and away from others. Once your fever and symptoms improve for more than 24 hours, you can resume activities while taking steps to protect others for 5 more days.\n\n**References**\n\nAoki FY.

Also contact your provider if flu symptoms are very bad and not getting better.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Ear infection\n* Sinus infection\n* Pneumonia\n* Myocarditis\n* Encephalitis (infection of the brain)\n* Meningitis\n* Seizures\n* Multi-organ failure\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can take steps to avoid catching or spreading the flu. The best step is for everyone age 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nHOME CARE\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches. Providers sometimes suggest that you use both types of medicine. Aspirin can also reduce fever and aches, but it may have potential serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMillions of people in the United States get the flu each year. Most people get better within a week or two, but thousands of people with the flu develop pneumonia or a brain infection. They may need to stay in the hospital. About 21,000 people in the United States die each year of problems from the flu.\n\n**When can I go back to my normal activities?**\n\nYou can go back to your normal activities if both of the following things are true:\n\n* For at least 24 hours, you have been feeling better and your symptoms are improving\n* You have not had a fever for at least 24 hours (and you are not using fever-reducing medicine)\n\nEven though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days. For this reason, once you go back to your normal activities, continue to protect others from illness by taking these steps for 5 days:\n\n* Practice good hygiene\n* Take steps for cleaner air\n* Wear a mask around others\n* Practice physical distancing by avoiding close contact and avoiding crowds\n\n---\n\n**The Flu**\n\nThe flu, also known as influenza, is a viral respiratory illness that causes fever, chills, runny nose, body aches, and cough. It spreads easily from person to person through tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   The flu is caused by an influenza virus.\n*   Most people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu.\n*   You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nFlu symptoms often start quickly. You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time, symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days.\n\nThe first symptom is often a fever between 100°F (37.8°C) and 104°F (40°C) that comes on suddenly. An adult often has a lower fever than a child. But not everyone with the flu has a fever.\n\nOther common symptoms include:\n\n*   Runny nose\n*   Body aches\n*   Cough\n\n**Who is at Risk**\n\nWhile certain people are at a higher risk, anyone at any age can develop serious complications from the flu. Those at highest risk include:\n\n*   People age 65 and older\n*   Children younger than 5 years old\n*   Women who are more than 3 months pregnant\n*   Anyone living in a long-term care facility\n*   Anyone with chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions, diabetes, or a weakened immune system\n*   People with severe obesity (BMI of 40 or higher)\n\n---\n\n**Flu: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 5/8)**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Fever between 100°F (37.8°C) and 104°F (40°C) that comes on suddenly\n*   Body aches\n*   Chills\n*   Headache\n*   Lack of energy\n*   Cough\n*   Runny or stuffy nose\n*   Sneezing\n*   Sore throat\n*   Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   Most people do not need to see a provider when they have flu symptoms.\n*   If you are very sick with the flu, or you are at high risk for severe illness, you should contact your provider.\n*   There is a test to detect the flu. It is done by swabbing the nose or throat.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n### Home Care\n\n*   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches.\n*   A fever does not need to come all the way down to a normal temperature to make a difference in how a person feels.\n*   Over-the-counter cold medicines may make some of your symptoms better.\n*   Cough drops or throat sprays will help with your sore throat.\n*   Get plenty of rest.\n*   Drink plenty of liquids.\n\n### Antiviral Drugs\n\n*   Most people with milder symptoms do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines.\n*   Your provider may recommend antiviral treatment if you are very sick with the flu.\n*   You also may be given antivirals if you are at risk for serious illness.\n\n---\n\n**Flu: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 6/8)**\n\n**Who Should Take Medicines?**\n\nIf you are at risk for serious illness, your provider may recommend antiviral medicines to help shorten the time you have symptoms. These medicines may work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms.\n\nThe health problems below may increase the risk of getting sicker with the flu:\n\n* Being younger than age 5 years (those under age 2 are even more at risk) or age 65 or older\n* Lung disease (including asthma)\n* Heart conditions (except high blood pressure)\n* Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions\n* Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease)\n* Diabetes\n* A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids\n* Neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and muscular dystrophy\n* Other long-term medical problems\n\n**Home Care**\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches. Providers sometimes suggest that you use both types of medicine. Aspirin can also reduce fever and aches, but it may have potential serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding. So it's best to avoid using aspirin and it should never be given to treat flu in someone age 18 or less.\n\nA fever does not need to come all the way down to a normal temperature to make a difference in how a person feels. Most people feel at least somewhat better when their temperature drops by 1 degree Fahrenheit.\n\nHere are other ways to relieve symptoms:\n\n* Certain medicines should not be given to children, or only after a certain age.\n\n**Antiviral Drugs**\n\nMost people with milder symptoms do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines. Your provider may recommend antiviral treatment if you are very sick with the flu. You also may be given antivirals if you are at risk for serious illness. Children at risk for a severe case of the flu may also need these medicines.\n\nThese medicines may shorten the time you have symptoms by about 1 day. They work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms.\n\nAntibiotics are NOT used to treat the flu. Antibiotics kill bacteria. They won't work on the viruses that cause the flu.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMillions of people in the United States get the flu each year. Most people get better within a week or two, but thousands of people with the flu develop pneumonia or a brain infection. They may need to stay in the hospital. About 21,000 people in the United States die each year of problems from the flu.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Ear infection\n* Sinus infection\n* Pneumonia\n* Myocarditis\n* Encephalitis (infection of the brain)\n* Meningitis\n* Seizures\n* Multi-organ failure\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child get the flu and are at risk for having complications.\n\nAlso contact your provider if flu symptoms are very bad and not getting better.\n\nContact your provider right away if you or your child have:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* High fever\n* Shortness of breath\n\nAny breathing problems are an emergency. Seek medical help right away.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can take steps to avoid catching or spreading the flu. The best step is for everyone age 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine. There are two types:\n\n* Influenza (flu) vaccine (live, intranasal): This vaccine is a nasal spray. People ages 2 through 49 years who are not pregnant may receive LAIV.\n* Influenza (flu) vaccine (inactivated or recombinant): This vaccine is delivered by injection. Everyone 6 months and older can get the vaccine.\n\nTo help prevent spreading the flu when you are sick, stay home and away from others both inside and outside your household\n\nAs much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from others in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.\n\nKeep track of your symptoms. You may receive instructions from your provider on how to check and report your symptoms.\n\nWear a well-fitted face mask or respirator that fits well over your nose and mouth without gaps when you see your provider and anytime other people are in the same room with you. If you can't wear a mask, for example, due to breathing problems, people in your home should wear a mask if they need to be in the same room with you.\n\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue after use.\n\nWash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before eating or preparing food, after using the toilet, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) if soap and water are not available.\n\nDo not share personal items such as cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding. Wash anything you have used in soap and water.\n\nClean all \"high-touch\" areas in the home, such as doorknobs, bathroom and kitchen fixtures, toilets, phones, tablets, counters, and other surfaces. Use a household cleaning spray and follow instructions for use.\n\nTake steps for cleaner air in your home. You can do this by opening windows, turning on exhaust fans in your bathrooms and kitchen, using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners, and setting the fan on your furnace or air conditioning to \"on\" if you have central heating and cooling in your home.\n\nYou can go back to your normal activities if both of the following things are true:\n\n* For at least 24 hours, you have been feeling better and your symptoms are improving\n* You have not had a fever for at least 24 hours (and you are not using fever-reducing medicine)\n\nEven though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days.

Once your fever and symptoms improve for more than 24 hours, you can resume activities while taking steps to protect others for 5 more days.\n\n**Protecting Others**\n\nEven though you feel better, you may still be able to spread the virus to others for several days.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu can cause mild to severe illness, and in some cases, it can lead to serious health complications.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of the flu are still not fully understood, but research suggests that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people may be more susceptible to the flu due to their age, health status, or other underlying conditions.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of the flu can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Cough\n* Sore throat\n* Runny or stuffy nose\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n\nIn some cases, the flu can lead to more severe complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or sinus and ear infections.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best way to prevent the flu is through vaccination. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age or older get a flu vaccine each year. Other preventive measures include:\n\n* Practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently\n* Avoiding close contact with people who are sick\n* Staying home from work or school if you are feeling unwell\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you do contract the flu, there are several treatment options available. These may include:\n\n* Antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza)\n* Rest and hydration\n* Over-the-counter medications, such as pain relievers or decongestants\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Test Your Knowledge**\n\nTake our quiz to test your knowledge on flu prevention!\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n* Flu\n* Colds and the flu - what to ask your doctor - adult\n* Colds and the flu - what to ask your doctor - child\n* Pneumonia in adults - discharge\n* Pneumonia in children - discharge\n\n**Images**\n\n* Normal lung anatomy\n* Influenza\n* Nasal spray flu vaccine",

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other health care provider to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nUse fluconazole injection exactly as directed. Do not infuse it more quickly than directed, and do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you will be using fluconazole injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your health care provider if you have any questions.\n\nBefore you administer fluconazole, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks.

    "content": "**Fludrocortisone Acetate**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFludrocortisone, a corticosteroid, is used to help control the amount of sodium and fluids in your body. It is used to treat Addison's disease and syndromes where excessive amounts of sodium are lost in the urine. It works by decreasing the amount of sodium that is lost (excreted) in your urine.\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFludrocortisone comes as a tablet to be taken by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fludrocortisone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not stop taking fludrocortisone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, an upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for these side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose temporarily or start taking the tablets again.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nFludrocortisone is also used to increase blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this drug for your condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking fludrocortisone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fludrocortisone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking fludrocortisone. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nIf you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take fludrocortisone without talking to your doctor. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking fludrocortisone, call your doctor. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking fludrocortisone. If you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take a dose of fludrocortisone, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at one time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nFludrocortisone may cause the following side effects:\n\n* Loss of appetite\n* Upset stomach\n* Vomiting\n* Drowsiness\n* Confusion\n* Headache\n* Fever\n* Joint and muscle pain\n* Peeling skin\n* Weight loss\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose temporarily or start taking the tablets again.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep fludrocortisone in its original container at room temperature (about 77°F) away from moisture and heat. Do not store it in the bathroom, near a sink, or in direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.\n\nWhen you no longer need fludrocortisone, ask your pharmacist how to safely dispose of it.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much fludrocortisone, call your doctor immediately. If the overdose is severe, you may need to be treated in a hospital. Symptoms of an overdose include:\n\n* Loss of appetite\n* Upset stomach\n* Vomiting\n* Drowsiness\n* Confusion\n* Headache\n* Fever\n* Joint and muscle pain\n* Peeling skin\n* Weight loss\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nFludrocortisone is a prescription medication that comes in tablet form. It is used to treat Addison's disease and syndromes where excessive amounts of sodium are lost in the urine. It works by decreasing the amount of sodium that is lost (excreted) in your urine.\n\nThis medication may be habit-forming, so do not take it more often or in larger amounts than prescribed by your doctor.

Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Staying Healthy**\n\n* Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady\n* Keep your blood pressure stable\n* Keep your bones and teeth healthy\n\n**Electrolytes: The Key Players**\n\nThe main electrolytes in your body include:\n\n* Bicarbonate: helps maintain the body's acid and base balance (pH)\n* Calcium: builds strong bones and teeth\n* Chloride: controls fluid levels, blood volume, and blood pressure\n* Magnesium: regulates muscle, nerve, and heart function\n* Phosphate: works with calcium to build strong bones and teeth\n* Potassium: helps cells, heart, and muscles work properly\n* Sodium: regulates fluid levels and nerve function\n\nYou get these electrolytes from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink.\n\n**Electrolyte Imbalance: A Delicate Balance**\n\nAn electrolyte imbalance occurs when the level of one or more electrolytes in your body is too low or too high. This can happen when the amount of water in your body changes, leading to dehydration or overhydration. Some common reasons for an electrolyte imbalance include:\n\n* Certain medicines\n* Severe vomiting and/or diarrhea\n* Heavy sweating\n* Heart, liver, or kidney problems\n* Not drinking enough fluids (especially during intense exercise or hot weather)\n* Drinking too much water\n\n**Diagnosing Electrolyte Imbalances**\n\nA test called an electrolyte panel can check the levels of your body's main electrolytes. A related test, the anion gap blood test, checks whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough.\n\n**Treating Electrolyte Imbalances**\n\nThe treatment for an electrolyte imbalance depends on which electrolytes are out of balance, how much they're off, and what's causing the imbalance. In minor cases, you may just need to make some changes to your diet. In other cases, you may need other treatments, such as:\n\n* Electrolyte replacement therapy: giving you more of a specific electrolyte\n* Medicines or fluids to help remove excess electrolytes from your body\n* Dialysis in severe cases\n\n**Electrolytes: The Basics**\n\nElectrolytes are minerals that have an electric charge when dissolved in water or body fluids. They're essential for various bodily functions, including:\n\n* Regulating fluid balance and blood pressure\n* Maintaining proper muscle and nerve function\n* Supporting healthy heart function\n* Building strong bones and teeth\n\nYou get these electrolytes from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink.\n\n**Staying Hydrated**\n\nDrinking enough water is crucial for maintaining a stable balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. Some tips for staying hydrated include:\n\n* Drinking plenty of water throughout the day\n* Eating foods that are rich in electrolytes (such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains)\n* Avoiding excessive sweating or losing too much fluid through vomiting or diarrhea\n\nBy understanding the importance of electrolytes and maintaining a stable balance of fluids and electrolytes, you can help keep your body healthy and functioning properly.\n\n---\n\n**Fluid and Electrolyte Balance**\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* Effect of the Chronic Kidney Disease-Peritoneal Dialysis (CKD-PD) App on Improvement...\n* Electrolyte Imbalance and Its Prognostic Impact on All-Cause Mortality in ICU...\n* Electrolyte Inertia In Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Also in Spanish\n* Food and Nutrition Information Center\n* National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements\n\n**Children**\n\n* Basic Blood Chemistry Tests (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n* Aldosterone blood test (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Antidiuretic hormone blood test (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Basic metabolic panel (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Electrolytes (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Fluid imbalance (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Magnesium deficiency (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Osmolality blood test (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Urine specific gravity test (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\n**Topic Image**\n\n* MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\t+ Aldosterone blood test\n\t+ Antidiuretic hormone blood test\n\t+ Basic metabolic panel\n\t+ Capillary nail refill test\n\t+ Chloride - urine test\n\t+ Chloride test - blood\n\t+ CO2 blood test\n\t+ Electrolytes\n\t+ Fluid imbalance\n\t+ Hypophosphatemia\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Dehydration",

    "content": "**Fluid Imbalance**\n\nEvery part of your body needs water to function. When you are healthy, your body is able to balance the amount of water that enters or leaves your body.\n\nA fluid imbalance may occur when you lose more water or fluid than your body can take in. It can also occur when you take in more water or fluid than your body is able to get rid of.\n\n**Causes**\n\nYour body is constantly losing water through breathing, sweating, and urinating.

    "content": "**Flunisolide Nasal Spray**\n\n*pronounced as (floo niss' oh lide)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFlunisolide nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose caused by hay fever or other allergies. It should not be used to treat symptoms caused by the common cold.\n\nIt is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFlunisolide comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril 2 to 3 times a day, but may be used less frequently after your symptoms are controlled.\n\nUse flunisolide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nUse flunisolide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAn adult should help children younger than 12 years old to use flunisolide nasal spray. Children younger than 6 years of age should not use this medication.\n\nFlunisolide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your mouth or eyes.\n\nEach bottle of flunisolide nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share flunisolide nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\nFlunisolide nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may improve several days after you first use flunisolide, but it may take 1 to 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of flunisolide.\n\nFlunisolide works best when used regularly. Use flunisolide on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use flunisolide nasal spray for 3 weeks.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using flunisolide nasal spray, read the written directions that come with it. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove the dust cover.\n2. If you are using the pump for the first time, have not used it for 5 days or more, or have just cleaned the nozzle, you must prime it by following steps 3 to 4 below. If you have used the pump in the past 5 days, skip to step 5.\n3. Hold the spray with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your face.\n4. If you are using the spray for the first time, have used the pump before but not within the past 5 days, or have just cleaned the nozzle, press down and release the pump 5 or 6 times until you see a fine spray.\n5. Gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils.\n6. Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the nasal applicator tip into your nostril. Be sure to keep the bottle upright.\n7. Hold one nostril closed with your finger.\n8. Begin to breathe in through your nose.\n9. While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly and quickly down on the applicator and release a spray.\n10. Breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.\n11. Remove the pump from the nostril and bend your head back to let the medication spread over the back of the nose.\n\nIf your doctor told you to use two sprays in that nostril, repeat steps 6 to 12. Repeat steps 6 to 13 in the other nostril.\n\nWipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the dust cover.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take your medication at the usual time, use it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then to use the medication. Do not use extra doses or stop using the medication without consulting your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of flunisolide nasal spray include:\n\n* Nosebleeds\n* Dryness in the nose and throat\n* Headache\n* Stomach upset\n\nLess common side effects may include:\n\n* Allergic reactions, such as hives or itching\n* Increased risk of infections, such as sinusitis or pneumonia\n\nIf you experience any side effects, talk to your doctor. They can help you manage any problems that may arise.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore flunisolide nasal spray in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children and pets.\n\nDo not share flunisolide nasal spray with others, as this may spread germs.\n\nAfter using the marked number of sprays, throw away the bottle even if it still contains some liquid.\n\n---\n\n**Flunisolide Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**To Use the Nasal Spray**\n\nBefore you use flunisolide nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it.

If you are using the pump for the first time, have not used it for 5 days or more, or have just cleaned the nozzle, you must prime it by following steps 3 to 4 below.

    "content": "**Flunisolide Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFlunisolide oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older. It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. Flunisolide works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFlunisolide comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth. It usually is inhaled twice daily. Try to use flunisolide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use flunisolide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with flunisolide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale flunisolide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use flunisolide inhalation.\n\nFlunisolide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use flunisolide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of flunisolide inhalation. Your doctor may increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 4 weeks and later may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nFlunisolide oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore you use your flunisolide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.\n\nDo not use your flunisolide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of flunisolide, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not double the dose to catch up.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nFlunisolide oral inhalation may cause side effects such as hoarseness, sore throat, coughing, or a bad taste in your mouth. These side effects are usually mild and temporary.\n\nHowever, if you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop using flunisolide and seek medical attention immediately:\n\n* Severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty breathing; closing of your throat; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or hands)\n* Increased pressure in your eyes\n* Glaucoma\n* Cataracts\n* Bone thinning (osteoporosis)\n* Adrenal gland problems\n* Immune system problems\n\nCall your doctor if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nEach canister of flunisolide aerosol is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.\n\nIf your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nFlunisolide oral inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 2 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use flunisolide oral inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using flunisolide oral inhalation without talking to your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.\n\n---\n\n**Flunisolide Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using Your Flunisolide Aerosol Inhaler**\n\nBefore you use your flunisolide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it.

The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\n**Using Your Flunisolide Aerosol Inhaler for the First Time**\n\nIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 14 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\n1. Place the bottom of the gray spacer on the base of your thumb and your index finger on the canister.\n2. Check to make sure that the canister is placed into the purple actuator.\n3. Hold the canister between your thumb and index finger and shake the inhaler.\n4. Breathe in and out through your mouth.\n5. After breathing out, place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it.\n6. Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.\n7.

You will be asked to place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar to keep your head still during the test.\n\nThe health care provider will take pictures of the inside of your eye including the back of your eye (retina).

    "content": "**Fluoride in Diet**\n\n**What is Fluoride?**\n\nFluoride occurs naturally in the body as calcium fluoride, which is mostly found in bones and teeth.\n\n**Function of Fluoride**\n\nSmall amounts of fluoride help reduce tooth decay. Adding fluoride to tap water (called fluoridation) helps reduce cavities in children by more than half.\n\n**Food Sources of Fluoride**\n\n*   Fluoridated water is found in most community water systems.\n*   Well water often does not contain enough fluoride to prevent tooth decay.\n*   Food prepared in fluoridated water contains fluoride.\n*   Natural sodium fluoride is in the ocean, so most seafood contains fluoride. Tea and gelatin also contain fluoride.\n\n**Infant Fluoride Intake**\n\nInfants can only get fluoride through drinking infant formulas. Breast milk has a negligible amount of fluoride in it.\n\n**Side Effects of Fluoride Deficiency or Excess**\n\n*   A lack (deficiency) of fluoride may lead to increased cavities, and weak bones and teeth.\n*   Too much fluoride in the diet is very rare. Rarely, infants who get too much fluoride before their teeth have broken through the gums have changes in the enamel that covers the teeth.\n\n**Recommendations for Fluoride Intake**\n\nThe Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends the following dietary intake for fluoride:\n\n*   Infants\n    *   0 to 6 months: 0.01 milligrams per day (mg/day)\n    *   7 to 12 months: 0.5 mg/day\n*   Children\n    *   1 to 3 years: 0.7 mg/day\n    *   4 to 8 years: 1.0 mg/day\n    *   9 to 13 years: 2.0 mg/day\n*   Adolescents and adults\n    *   Males ages 14 to 18 years: 3.0 mg/day\n    *   Males over 18 years: 4.0 mg/day\n    *   Females over 14 years: 3.0 mg/day\n\n**Precautions for Fluoride Intake**\n\nTo help make sure infants and children do not get too much fluoride:\n\n*   Ask your provider about the type of water to use in concentrated or powdered formulas.\n*   DO NOT use any fluoride supplement without talking to your provider.\n*   Avoid using fluoride toothpaste in infants younger than 2 years.\n*   Use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste in children older than 2 years.\n*   Avoid fluoride mouth rinses in children younger than 6 years.\n\n---\n\n**Fluoride in Diet**\n\n**Function**\n\nSmall amounts of fluoride help reduce tooth decay. Adding fluoride to tap water (called fluoridation) helps reduce cavities in children by more than half.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\n* Fluoridated water is found in most community water systems.\n* Well water often does not contain enough fluoride to prevent tooth decay.\n* Food prepared in fluoridated water contains fluoride.\n* Natural sodium fluoride is in the ocean, so most seafood contains fluoride. Tea and gelatin also contain fluoride.\n* Infants can only get fluoride through drinking infant formulas. Breast milk has a negligible amount of fluoride in it.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nA lack (deficiency) of fluoride may lead to increased cavities, and weak bones and teeth.\n\nToo much fluoride in the diet is very rare. Rarely, infants who get too much fluoride before their teeth have broken through the gums have changes in the enamel that covers the teeth. Faint white lines or streaks may appear, but they are usually not easy to see.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends the following dietary intake for fluoride:\n\n* Infants\n\t+ 0 to 6 months: 0.01 milligrams per day (mg/day)\n\t+ 7 to 12 months: 0.5 mg/day\n* Children\n\t+ 1 to 3 years: 0.7 mg/day\n\t+ 4 to 8 years: 1.0 mg/day\n\t+ 9 to 13 years: 2.0 mg/day\n* Adolescents and adults\n\t+ Males ages 14 to 18 years: 3.0 mg/day\n\t+ Males over 18 years: 4.0 mg/day\n\t+ Females over 14 years: 3.0 mg/day\n\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate food guide.\n\nSpecific recommendations depend on age and sex. Ask your health care provider which amount is best for you.\n\nTo help make sure infants and children do not get too much fluoride:\n\n* Ask your provider about the type of water to use in concentrated or powdered formulas.\n* DO NOT use any fluoride supplement without talking to your provider.\n* Avoid using fluoride toothpaste in infants younger than 2 years.\n* Use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste in children older than 2 years.\n* Avoid fluoride mouth rinses in children younger than 6 years.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDiet - fluoride\n\n**References**\n\nBerg J, Gerweck C, Hujoel PP, et al; American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs Expert Panel on Fluoride Intake From Infant Formula and Fluorosis.

A study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that excessive fluoride intake can lead to dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis (Palmer et al., 2012). Another study published in the same journal emphasized the importance of monitoring fluoride levels in drinking water to prevent adverse health effects (Berg et al., 2011).\n\n**Dietary Sources of Fluoride**\n\nFluoride can be found in various food products, including infant formula and toothpaste. The American Dental Association recommends that parents use fluoride-free toothpaste for children under the age of 3 (Chin et al., 2022). Additionally, some foods such as tea, seaweed, and fish contain high levels of fluoride.\n\n**Precautions and Recommendations**\n\nTo minimize the risk of excessive fluoride intake, it is essential to follow proper usage guidelines for fluoride-containing products. Parents should consult with their pediatrician or a healthcare professional before administering any fluoride supplements to children. Furthermore, individuals with kidney disease or other underlying medical conditions should be cautious when consuming foods high in fluoride.\n\n**References**\n\nBerg J, Gerweck C, Hujoel PP, et al; American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs Expert Panel on Fluoride Intake From Infant Formula and Fluorosis.

    "content": "**Fluoride: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\t+ Fluoride is used to prevent tooth decay. It is taken up by teeth and helps to strengthen teeth, resist acid, and block the cavity-forming action of bacteria. Fluoride usually is prescribed for children and adults whose homes have water that is not fluoridated (already has fluoride added).\n* **How should this medicine be used?**\n\t+ Fluoride comes as a liquid, tablet, and chewable tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once daily. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fluoride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\t+ The fluoride liquid may be taken straight from the bottle or mixed with cereal, fruit juice, or other foods. Use a dropper or an oral syringe to measure out your dose. Tablets may be dissolved in the mouth, chewed, or added to drinking water or fruit juice. Tablets also may be added to water for use in infant formulas or other food.\n\t+ Fluoride helps to strengthen teeth and prevent cavities; it is not a substitute for brushing or flossing.\n* **What special precautions should I follow?**\n\t+ Before taking fluoride, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluoride, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. Also, inform them of all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking fluoride.\n\t+ The following nonprescription products may interact with fluoride: calcium, magnesium, or iron supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking fluoride. Do not start any of these medications while taking fluoride without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\t+ Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking fluoride, call your doctor.\n\t+ Also, inform your doctor if you are on a low-sodium or sodium-free diet.\n* **What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\t+ Do not eat or drink dairy products 1 hour before or 1 hour after taking fluoride.\n* **What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\t+ Side effects of fluoride may include nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately.\n* **In case of emergency/overdose**\n\t+ In case of an overdose or if you experience severe side effects, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 (US only) for guidance.\n* **What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\t+ Store fluoride in a tight container at room temperature. Keep it away from children and pets. Dispose of any unused fluoride responsibly, following the instructions provided by your pharmacist or local waste management guidelines.\n* **Brand names**\n\t+ Fluoride is available under several brand names, including ACT FLUORIDE VARNISH, ACT FLUORIDE VARNISH PLUS, and others. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist for more information on specific brands and their uses.\n* **What other information should I know?**\n\t+ This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Fluoride: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   **Staining of teeth**: Tell your doctor if this symptom is severe or does not go away.\n*   If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n    *   Unusual increase in saliva\n    *   Salty or soapy taste\n    *   Stomach pain\n    *   Upset stomach\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Diarrhea\n    *   Rash\n    *   Weakness\n    *   Tremor\n    *   Seizures\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\n*   Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/fluoroscopy/",
    "content": "**Fluoroscopy**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Fluoroscopy?**\n\nFluoroscopy is a type of x-ray that shows organs, tissues, or other internal structures moving in real time. Standard x-rays are like still photographs. Fluoroscopy is like a video. It shows your body systems in action. These include the cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels), digestive, and reproductive systems. Fluoroscopy allows your health care provider to watch your organs or structures as they function, such as your heart beating, lungs inflating, or intestines moving food. The procedure can help your provider evaluate and diagnose a variety of conditions.\n\n\\n\\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nFluoroscopy is used in many types of imaging procedures. It can be used to guide your provider during a procedure visually or to help diagnose a health condition. Some of the most common uses of fluoroscopy include:\n\n*   **Barium Swallow or Barium Enema**: In these procedures, fluoroscopy shows the movement of the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract.\n*   **Cardiac Catheterization**: In this procedure, fluoroscopy shows blood flowing through the arteries. It is used to diagnose and treat some heart diseases.\n*   **Placement of a Catheter or Stent Inside the Body**: Catheters are thin, hollow tubes. They are used to get fluids into the body or to drain excess fluids from the body. Stents are devices that help open narrow or blocked blood vessels. Fluoroscopy helps ensure the proper placement of these devices.\n*   **Guidance in Orthopedic Surgery**: A surgeon may use fluoroscopy to help guide procedures such as joint replacement and fracture (broken bone) repair.\n*   **Hysterosalpingogram**: In this procedure, fluoroscopy is used to provide images of female reproductive organs.\n\n\\n\\n**Why Do I Need Fluoroscopy?**\n\nYou may need a fluoroscopy if your provider wants to check the function of a particular organ, system, or other internal part of your body. You may also need fluoroscopy for certain medical procedures that require imaging guidance. This could include surgery or the placement of a stent.\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens During Fluoroscopy?**\n\nDepending on the type of procedure, a fluoroscopy may be done at an outpatient radiology center or as part of your stay in a hospital. The procedure may include some or most of the following steps:\n\n*   You may need to remove any jewelry, removable dental appliances, eyeglasses, and metal objects that may interfere with the procedure.\n*   You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.\n*   You may be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area or another part of your body, depending on the type of fluoroscopy. The shield or apron protects from unnecessary radiation.\n*   For certain procedures, you may be asked to drink a liquid containing contrast dye. Contrast dye is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray.\n*   If you are not asked to drink a liquid with the dye, you may be given the dye through an intravenous (IV) line or enema. An IV line will send the dye directly to your vein. An enema is procedure that flushes the dye into your rectum.\n*   You will be positioned on an x-ray table. Depending on the type of procedure, you may be asked to move your body in different positions or move a certain body part. You may also be asked to hold your breath for a brief period of time.\n*   If your procedure involves getting a catheter, your provider will insert a needle in the appropriate body part. This may be your groin, elbow, or other site.\n*   Your provider will use a special x-ray scanner to make the fluoroscopic images. They will be able to view them on a computer screen.\n*   If a catheter was placed, your provider will remove it.\n\n\\n\\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour preparation will depend on the type of fluoroscopy procedure. Your provider will let you know if you need to do any special preparations. For example, for certain procedures, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. You may also need to avoid certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don’t stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n\\n\\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nYou should not have a fluoroscopy procedure if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to a developing baby.\n\nFor others, there is little risk to having this test. The radiation dose depends on the procedure, but fluoroscopy is not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.\n\nIf your procedure involves using contrast dye, there is a small risk of an allergic reaction. Tell your provider if you have any allergies, especially to shellfish or iodine, or if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material.\n\n\\n\\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour results will depend on what type of procedure you had. Several conditions and disorders can be diagnosed by fluoroscopy. Your provider may need to send your results to a specialist or do more tests to help make a diagnosis.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. To understand the results of your fluoroscopy procedure, your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Fluoroscopy: A Guide to Medical Imaging**\n\n**What is Fluoroscopy?**\n\nFluoroscopy is a type of medical imaging that uses x-rays to produce images of the inside of the body. It can be used to guide your provider during a procedure visually or to help diagnose a health condition.\n\n**Common Uses of Fluoroscopy**\n\n*   Barium swallow or barium enema: shows the movement of the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract\n*   Cardiac catheterization: shows blood flowing through the arteries and is used to diagnose and treat some heart diseases\n*   Placement of a catheter or stent inside the body: ensures the proper placement of these devices\n*   Guidance in orthopedic surgery: helps guide procedures such as joint replacement and fracture (broken bone) repair\n*   Hysterosalpingogram: provides images of female reproductive organs\n\n**Why Do I Need Fluoroscopy?**\n\nYou may need a fluoroscopy if your provider wants to check the function of a particular organ, system, or other internal part of your body. You may also need fluoroscopy for certain medical procedures that require imaging guidance.\n\n**What Happens During Fluoroscopy?**\n\nDepending on the type of procedure, a fluoroscopy may be done at an outpatient radiology center or as part of your stay in a hospital. The procedure may include some or most of the following steps:\n\n*   Removing any jewelry, removable dental appliances, eyeglasses, and metal objects that may interfere with the procedure\n*   Drinking a liquid containing contrast dye for certain procedures\n*   Receiving the contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) line or enema\n*   Positioning on an x-ray table and moving your body in different positions or moving a certain body part\n*   Holding your breath for a brief period of time\n*   Inserting a needle in the appropriate body part for catheter placement\n*   Using a special x-ray scanner to make the fluoroscopic images\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour preparation will depend on the type of fluoroscopy procedure. Your provider will let you know if you need to do any special preparations, such as fasting (not eating or drinking) for several hours before the test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nYou should not have a fluoroscopy procedure if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to a developing baby. For others, there is little risk to having this test. The radiation dose depends on the procedure, but fluoroscopy is not considered harmful for most people.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nYour results will depend on what type of procedure you had. Several conditions and disorders can be diagnosed by fluoroscopy. Your provider may need to send your results to a specialist or do more tests to help make a diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Fluoroscopy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Fluoroscopy?**\n\nFluoroscopy is a medical imaging procedure that uses X-rays to produce real-time images of the internal structures of the body. It is commonly used in hospitals and clinics to diagnose and treat various medical conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does Fluoroscopy Work?**\n\nDuring a fluoroscopy procedure, your provider will place a special device called a fluoroscope over the area of the body being imaged. The fluoroscope emits X-rays that pass through the body, producing images on a screen or digital display. The images are then recorded and analyzed by your healthcare provider to diagnose any abnormalities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits of Fluoroscopy?**\n\nFluoroscopy has several benefits, including:\n\n*   **Real-time imaging**: Fluoroscopy allows for real-time imaging, which enables your healthcare provider to monitor the movement of internal structures and make adjustments as needed.\n*   **High-resolution images**: Fluoroscopy produces high-quality images that provide detailed information about the internal structures of the body.\n*   **Minimally invasive**: Fluoroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that does not require surgical incisions or insertion of instruments into the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Risks and Side Effects of Fluoroscopy?**\n\nWhile fluoroscopy is generally safe, there are some risks and side effects to be aware of:\n\n*   **Radiation exposure**: Fluoroscopy involves exposure to X-rays, which can increase your risk of radiation-related health problems.\n*   **Allergic reactions**: Some people may experience allergic reactions to the contrast agents used in fluoroscopy.\n*   **Nausea and vomiting**: The procedure may cause nausea and vomiting in some individuals.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Prepare for a Fluoroscopy Procedure?**\n\nTo prepare for a fluoroscopy procedure, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Discuss your medical history**: Inform your healthcare provider about any pre-existing medical conditions or allergies you may have.\n2.  **Follow instructions**: Adhere to any specific instructions provided by your healthcare provider regarding food and fluid intake, medication, and other preparations.\n3.  **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask your healthcare provider any questions or concerns you may have about the procedure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During a Fluoroscopy Procedure?**\n\nDuring a fluoroscopy procedure:\n\n1.  **Positioning**: You will be positioned on an examination table or in a specialized imaging device.\n2.  **Contrast agent administration**: A contrast agent may be administered to enhance the visibility of internal structures.\n3.  **Image capture**: The fluoroscope will emit X-rays, and images will be recorded and displayed on a screen or digital display.\n4.  **Analysis**: Your healthcare provider will analyze the images to diagnose any abnormalities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Different Types of Fluoroscopy Procedures?**\n\nThere are several types of fluoroscopy procedures, including:\n\n*   **Upper GI tract fluoroscopy**: This procedure involves imaging the upper digestive system using a barium swallow or other contrast agents.\n*   **Lower GI tract fluoroscopy**: This procedure involves imaging the lower digestive system using a barium enema or other contrast agents.\n*   **Swallowing disorders fluoroscopy**: This procedure involves imaging the swallowing process to diagnose and treat conditions such as dysphagia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Cope with Medical Test Anxiety?**\n\nIf you experience anxiety related to medical tests, consider the following:\n\n1.  **Communicate with your healthcare provider**: Inform your healthcare provider about your concerns and ask questions.\n2.  **Prepare yourself**: Learn as much as you can about the procedure and what to expect.\n3.  **Bring a support person**: Having a trusted friend or family member present during the procedure may help alleviate anxiety.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Understand My Lab Results?**\n\nTo understand your lab results:\n\n1.  **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask your healthcare provider about any test results or concerns you may have.\n2.  **Learn about laboratory tests**: Familiarize yourself with common laboratory tests and their corresponding reference ranges.\n3.  **Consult reliable sources**: Refer to reputable health resources, such as MedlinePlus or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for accurate information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are Related Health Topics?**\n\nSome related health topics include:\n\n*   **Coronary artery disease**\n*   **Fractures**\n*   **Hiatal hernia**\n*   **Hip replacement**\n*   **Knee replacement**\n*   **Peptic ulcer**\n*   **X-rays**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are Related Medical Tests?**\n\nSome related medical tests include:\n\n*   **Barium swallow**\n*   **Dysphagia tests**\n*   **Gastric emptying tests**\n*   **How to cope with medical test anxiety**\n*   **How to understand your lab results**\n*   **Myelography**",

Fluoxetine is also used to relieve the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, including mood swings, irritability, bloating, and breast tenderness. It is also used along with olanzapine (Zyprexa) to treat depression that did not respond to other medications and episodes of depression in people with bipolar I disorder (manic-depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods). Fluoxetine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFluoxetine comes as a capsule, a tablet, a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine) capsule, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Fluoxetine may be taken with or without food. Fluoxetine capsules, tablets, and liquid are usually taken once a day in the morning or twice a day in the morning and at noon. Fluoxetine delayed-released capsules are usually taken once a week. Take fluoxetine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fluoxetine exactly as directed.

    "content": "**Flushable Reagent Stool Blood Test**\n\nThe flushable reagent stool blood test is an at-home test designed to detect invisible blood in the stool.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is performed at home using disposable pads, which can be purchased at a drug store without a prescription. Brand names include EZ-Detect, HomeChek Reveal, and ColoCARE. You do not handle stool directly with this test; instead, you note any changes on a card and mail the results to your healthcare provider.\n\nTo perform the test:\n\n1. Urinate if needed, then flush the toilet before having a bowel movement.\n2. Place the disposable pad in the toilet after the bowel movement.\n3. Watch for a change of color on the test area of the pad; results will appear in about 2 minutes.\n4. Note the results on the provided card, then flush the pad away.\n5. Repeat for the next two bowel movements.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nSome medicines may interfere with this test. Check with your provider about changes in your medications you may need to make. Never stop taking a medicine or change how you take it without first talking to your provider. Additionally, check the test package to see if there are any foods you need to stop eating before doing the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThis test involves only normal bowel functions and is free of discomfort.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is mainly performed for colorectal cancer screening. It may also be done in cases of low levels of red blood cells (anemia).\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA negative result is normal, indicating no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs; talk to your provider about your test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results of the flushable pad indicate there is bleeding present somewhere in the digestive tract, which may be caused by:\n\n* Swollen, fragile blood vessels in the colon\n* Colon cancer\n* Colon polyps\n* Enlarged veins (varices) in the esophagus that bleed\n* Inflamed or swollen lining of the stomach or esophagus\n* Infections in the stomach or intestines\n* Hemorrhoids\n* Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis\n* Ulcer in the stomach or first part of the intestines\n\nOther causes of a positive test, which do not indicate a problem in the gastrointestinal tract, include:\n\n* Coughing up and then swallowing blood\n* Nose bleed\n\nAbnormal test results require follow-up with your doctor.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe test can have false-positive (indicating a problem when there is none) or false-negative (indicating no problem when there is one) results. This is similar to other stool smear tests, which can also give false results.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nStool occult blood test - flushable home test; Fecal occult blood test - flushable home test\n\n**References**\n\nGarber JJ, Chung DC.

    "content": "**Flutamide**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFlutamide is used together with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH; a type of hormonal injection such as leuprolide [Lupron, Eligard], goserelin [Zoladex], or triptorelin [Trelstar]) to treat certain types of prostate cancer. Flutamide is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFlutamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 8 hours (three times a day.) Take flutamide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take flutamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nContinue to take flutamide along with the LHRH agonist treatment even if you feel well. Do not stop taking either medication without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nFlutamide may cause liver damage that can be serious or life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, soreness, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or dark urine.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain blood tests to check how well your liver is working before you begin taking flutamide, every month for the first 4 months of your treatment, and periodically for as long as your treatment continues.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking flutamide.\n\n---\n\n**Flutamide: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking flutamide, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to flutamide or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking flutamide. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Tell your doctor if you smoke and if you have or have ever had any inherited blood diseases such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency or hemoglobin M disease.\n\nYou should know that flutamide is only for use in men. If taken by pregnant women, flutamide can harm the fetus. Women who are or may become pregnant should not take flutamide. If you take flutamide while you are pregnant, call your doctor. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking flutamide. Flutamide may cause facial flushing, and drinking alcohol can make it worse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nFlutamide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hot flashes, decrease in sexual ability or desire, breast enlargement in men, drowsiness, confusion, depression, anxiety, swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs, blue-green or orange-colored urine.\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the symptoms listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately. Although it is rare, some men taking flutamide have developed breast cancer. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking this medication. Flutamide may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. Dispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program.

    "content": "**Fluticasone Nasal Spray**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nNonprescription (over the counter) fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of rhinitis such as sneezing and a runny, stuffy, or itchy nose and itchy, watery eyes caused by hay fever or other allergies (caused by an allergy to pollen, mold, dust, or pets). Prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis such as sneezing and runny or stuffy nose which are not caused by allergies. Prescription fluticasone nasal spray (Xhance) is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps (ongoing runny nose, sinus swelling and/or nasal congestion, with or without a reduced sense of smell or pain and pressure in the face). Fluticasone nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Fluticasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFluticasone comes as a (prescription and nonprescription) liquid to spray in the nose. When nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve hay fever and other allergy symptoms, it is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to treat nonallergic rhinitis, it is usually sprayed in each nostril one or two times a day. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray (Xhance) is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, it is usually sprayed in each nostril two times a day.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth. Each bottle of fluticasone nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share fluticasone nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever, allergies, nonallergic rhinitis, or chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve 1 to 2 days after you first use fluticasone, but it may take longer before you feel the full benefit of fluticasone nasal spray.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nUse fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and dispose of the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nCall your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray daily for 1 week.\n\n---\n\n**Fluticasone Nasal Spray Instructions**\n\nIf you are using fluticasone nasal spray to treat hay fever, other allergy symptoms, or nonallergic rhinitis, follow these steps:\n\n* Shake the bottle gently before each use.\n* Remove the dust cover.\n* If you are using the nasal spray pump for the first time or if you haven't used your nasal spray for a period of time, you must prime the pump. Carefully read the instructions that come with your nasal spray pump, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how and when to prime the nasal spray pump.\n* Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.\n* Close one nostril by gently placing your finger against the side of your nose, tilt your head slightly forward and, keeping the bottle upright, insert the nasal tip into the other nostril. Begin to breathe in through your nose. While you are breathing, pump the spray bottle to release a spray according to the instructions that come with your nasal spray pump. Breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.\n* If your doctor told you to use two sprays in each nostril, repeat step 5.\n* Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and replace the plastic cap on the bottle.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nFluticasone comes as a (prescription and nonprescription) liquid to spray in the nose. When nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve hay fever and other allergy symptoms, it is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to treat nonallergic rhinitis, it is usually sprayed in each nostril one or two times a day. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray (Xhance) is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, it is usually sprayed in each nostril two times a day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription or product label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth.\n\nEach bottle of fluticasone nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share fluticasone nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\n**How Long Will It Take to Notice Improvement?**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever, allergies, nonallergic rhinitis, or chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve 1 to 2 days after you first use fluticasone, but it may take longer before you feel the full benefit of fluticasone nasal spray.\n\n**Regular Use is Key**\n\nFluticasone works best when used regularly. Use fluticasone on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray daily for 1 week.\n\n**Disposing of the Bottle**\n\nFluticasone nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and dispose of the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.\n\n**Before First Use**\n\nBefore you use fluticasone nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it.

    "content": "**Fluticasone Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFluticasone oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children. It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. Fluticasone works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFluticasone comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. Fluticasone aerosol oral inhalation (Flovent HFA) is usually inhaled twice daily. Fluticasone powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once daily (Armonair, Arnuity Ellipta) or twice daily (Armonair Respiclick, Flovent Diskus). Try to use fluticasone at around the same times every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with fluticasone inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale fluticasone inhalation.\n\nIf you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use fluticasone.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nFluticasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use fluticasone during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fluticasone. Your doctor may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled or increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 2 weeks.\n\nFluticasone controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve 24 hours after you begin using fluticasone, but it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use fluticasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using fluticasone without talking to your doctor.\n\nIf your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that they know how to use it. Watch your child each time they use the inhaler to be sure that they are using it correctly.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nUse fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nThe most common side effects of fluticasone oral inhalation include:\n\n* Headache\n* Coughing\n* Stomach upset\n* Muscle pain\n\nLess common but serious side effects may include:\n\n* Increased risk of pneumonia\n* Worsening asthma symptoms\n* Allergic reactions (such as hives, itching, or difficulty breathing)\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nEach product is designed to provide 30, 60, or120 inhalations, depending on the type of inhaler. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication.\n\nYou should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last.\n\nDispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nDo not use your fluticasone aerosol inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\nBefore you use fluticasone the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while they watch you.\n\n**Brand names**\n\nFluticasone oral inhalation is available under several brand names, including:\n\n* Flovent HFA\n* Armonair\n* Arnuity Ellipta\n* Armonair Respiclick\n* Flovent Diskus\n\n---\n\n**Fluticasone Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **How to Use Fluticasone**\n    *   Read the written instructions that come with fluticasone before using it for the first time.\n    *   Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler.\n    *   Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.\n    *   Practice using the inhaler while they watch you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Important Safety Information**\n    *   The inhaler that comes with fluticasone aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of fluticasone.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using fluticasone oral inhalation. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nDo not use fluticasone inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when using the fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of the fast-acting medication than usual.\n\nIf you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before or after you inhale fluticasone inhalation.\n\nTell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) and if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (TB; a type of lung infection) in your lungs, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), glaucoma (an eye disease), or liver disease. Also tell your doctor if you have any type of untreated infection anywhere in your body or a herpes eye infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface), if you smoke or use tobacco products, or if you are on bedrest or unable to move around.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

Your body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury during this time. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all healthcare providers who treat you know that you recently replaced your oral steroid with fluticasone inhalation. Carry a card or wear a medical identification bracelet to let emergency personnel know that you may need to be treated with steroids in an emergency.\n\nTell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and you have not been vaccinated against these infections. Stay away from people who are sick, especially people who have chickenpox or measles. If you are exposed to one of these infections or if you develop symptoms of one of these infections, call your doctor right away. You may need treatment to protect you from these infections.\n\nYou should know that fluticasone inhalation sometimes causes wheezing and difficulty breathing immediately after it is inhaled.

    "content": "**Fluvastatin**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFluvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood.\n\nFluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).\n\nIt works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.\n\nAccumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with fluvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFluvastatin comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The capsule is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food.\n\nTake fluvastatin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fluvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of fluvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.\n\nContinue to take fluvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fluvastatin without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Fluvastatin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking fluvastatin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluvastatin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fluvastatin capsules or extended release tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with fluvastatin. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting fluvastatin with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking fluvastatin, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nTell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor will order laboratory tests to see how well your liver is working even if you do not think you have liver disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fluvastatin if you have liver disease or if the tests show that you may be developing liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages per day, if you are 65 years of age or older, and if you have ever had liver disease or have or ever had muscle aches or weakness, diabetes, low blood pressure, seizures, or thyroid or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking fluvastatin, stop taking fluvastatin and call your doctor. Your doctor will discuss risks and benefits of fluvastatin therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDo not breast-feed while you are taking this medication.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking fluvastatin. If you are hospitalized due to infection or serious injury, tell the doctor who treats you that you are taking fluvastatin.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking fluvastatin.

    "content": "**Fluvoxamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nFluvoxamine is used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\nTake fluvoxamine exactly as directed by your doctor. The usual dose for adults is 50-300 mg per day, taken in divided doses of 25-100 mg two or three times a day. For children, the dosage is based on weight and age.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\nFluvoxamine may also be used to treat social anxiety disorder.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\nTell your doctor if you have any medical conditions, especially liver disease, kidney disease, or heart problems. Also, inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking, including prescription and nonprescription drugs.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\nCommon side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, and tremors. Less common but serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts or behaviors, particularly in children, teenagers, and young adults.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Also, inform your family or caregiver about the potential side effects, especially suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Fluvoxamine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Warning: Antidepressant Risks**\n\nNo matter your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide.\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts in Children and Teenagers**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as fluvoxamine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions.\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts in Adults**\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take fluvoxamine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.\n\n**Monitoring Your Treatment**\n\nYour healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking fluvoxamine, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFluvoxamine is used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (bothersome thoughts that won't go away and the need to perform certain actions over and over) and social anxiety disorder (extreme fear of interacting with others or performing in front of others that interferes with normal life). Fluvoxamine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFluvoxamine comes as a tablet and an extended-release capsule to take by mouth. The tablet usually is taken either once daily at bedtime or twice daily, once in the morning and once at bedtime. The extended-release capsule usually is taken, with or without food , once daily at bedtime.\n\n**Important: Do not crush or chew the extended-release capsules.**\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of fluvoxamine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week, depending on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience.\n\n**It may take several weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of fluvoxamine. Continue to take fluvoxamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fluvoxamine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking fluvoxamine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability; agitation; dizziness; extreme worry; uneasiness; confusion; headache; tiredness; mood changes; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; or pain, burning, numbness, tingling or 'electric shock' sensations in the hands or feet.

    "content": "**Focal Seizure**\n\nAll seizures are caused by abnormal electrical disturbances in the brain. Focal seizures occur when this electrical activity is in a limited area of the brain. Sometimes the seizures stay only in one part of the brain, while at other times, the seizures can turn into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, which affect the whole brain. This is called secondary generalization.\n\n**Classification**\n\nFocal seizures can be divided into whether they affect awareness or not:\n\n* Focal, aware\n* Focal, awareness impaired\n\nFocal seizures are also classified by whether they are motor (movements with the seizures) or not.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFocal seizures are the most common type of seizure in people 1 year and older. In people older than 65 who have blood vessel disease of the brain or brain tumors, focal seizures are very common. Focal seizures are usually associated with an area of the brain in which nerve cells are easily excitable. This is often due to brain injury that can result from conditions such as stroke, infection, trauma, or from problems present at birth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with focal, awareness impaired seizures may or may not remember any or all of the symptoms or events during the seizure.\n\nDepending on where in the brain the seizure starts, symptoms may include:\n\n* Abnormal muscle contraction, such as abnormal head or limb movements\n* Staring spells, sometimes with repetitive movements such as picking at clothes or lip smacking\n* Eyes moving from side to side\n* Abnormal sensations, such as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation (like ants crawling on the skin)\n* Seeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there (hallucinations)\n* Abdominal pain or discomfort\n* Nausea\n* Sweating\n* Flushed face\n* Dilated pupils\n* Rapid heart rate/pulse\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Blackout spells, periods of time lost from memory\n* Changes in vision\n* Sensation of déjà vu (feeling like current place and time have been experienced before)\n* Changes in mood or emotion\n* Temporary inability to speak\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

    "content": "**Folate Deficiency**\n\nFolate deficiency means you have a lower-than-normal amount of folic acid, a type of vitamin B, in your blood.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFolic acid (vitamin B9) works with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and make new proteins. The vitamin helps form red and white blood cells. It also helps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information.\n\nFolic acid is a water-soluble type of vitamin B. This means it is not stored in the fat tissues of the body. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine.\n\nBecause folate is not stored in the body in large amounts, your blood levels will get low after only a few weeks of eating a diet low in folate. Folate is found primarily in legumes, leafy greens, eggs, beets, bananas, citrus fruits, and liver.\n\nContributors to folate deficiency include:\n\n*   Diseases in which folic acid is not well absorbed in the digestive system (such as celiac disease or Crohn disease)\n*   Drinking too much alcohol\n*   Eating overcooked fruits and vegetables. Folic acid can be easily destroyed by heat.\n*   Hemolytic anemia\n*   Certain medicines (such as phenytoin, sulfasalazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)\n*   Eating a diet that does not include enough fruits and vegetables\n*   Kidney dialysis\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nFolic acid deficiency may cause:\n\n*   Fatigue, irritability, or diarrhea\n*   Poor growth\n*   Smooth and tender tongue\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nFolate deficiency can be diagnosed with a blood test.

The vitamin is important to the growth of the fetus's spinal cord and brain. Folic acid deficiency can cause severe birth defects known as neural tube defects. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate during pregnancy is 600 micrograms (µg)/day.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best way to get vitamins your body needs is to eat a balanced diet.

    "content": "**Folate-Deficiency Anemia**\n\n**What is Folate-Deficiency Anemia?**\n\nFolate-deficiency anemia is a decrease in red blood cells (anemia) due to a lack of folate. Folate is a type of B vitamin also called folic acid.\n\n**Causes**\n\nFolate (folic acid) is needed for red blood cells to form and grow. You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver. However, your body does not store folate in large amounts. So, you need to eat plenty of folate-rich foods to maintain normal levels of this vitamin.\n\nIn folate-deficiency anemia, the red blood cells are abnormally large. Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow. That is why this anemia is also called a type of megaloblastic anemia.\n\nCauses of this type of anemia include:\n\n* Too little folic acid in your diet\n* Hemolytic anemia\n* Long-term alcoholism\n* Use of certain medicines (such as phenytoin [Dilantin], methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates)\n\nThe following raise your risk for this type of anemia:\n\n* Alcoholism\n* Eating overcooked food\n* Poor diet (often seen in the poor, the older people, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables)\n* Pregnancy\n* Weight loss diets\n\nFolic acid is needed to help a baby in the womb grow properly. Too little folic acid during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in a baby.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Headache\n* Pallor\n* Sore mouth and tongue\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Red blood cell folate level\n\nIn rare cases, a bone marrow aspiration may be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal is to identify and treat the cause of the folate deficiency.\n\nYou may receive folic acid supplements by mouth, injected into muscle, or through a vein (in rare cases). If you have low folate levels because of a problem with your intestines, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.\n\nDiet changes can help boost your folate level. Eat more green, leafy vegetables and citrus fruits.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFolate-deficiency anemia most often responds well to treatment within 3 to 6 months. It will likely get better when the underlying cause of the deficiency is treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSymptoms of anemia can cause discomfort. In pregnant women, folate deficiency has been associated with neural tube or spinal defects (such as spina bifida) in the infant.\n\nOther more severe complications may include:\n\n* Curly graying hair\n* Increased skin color (pigment)\n* Infertility\n* Worsening of heart disease or heart failure\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of folate deficiency anemia.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nEating plenty of folate-rich foods can help prevent this condition.\n\nExperts recommend that women take 400 to 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day before they get pregnant and through the first 3 months of their pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n**Folate-Deficiency Anemia**\n\n**What is Folate-Deficiency Anemia?**\n\nFolate-deficiency anemia is a decrease in red blood cells (anemia) due to a lack of folate.

    "content": "**Folic Acid**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFolate and folic acid are forms of vitamin B9 used for deficiency and to prevent pregnancy complications. Many foods contain folate or have folic acid added.\n\nSince 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law. Foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables, okra, asparagus, certain fruits, beans, yeast, mushrooms, animal liver and kidney, orange juice, and tomato juice. Folic acid is also available as a supplement, and is often used in combination with other B vitamins.\n\nFolic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). Folic acid is also taken during pregnancy to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida. Folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression, stroke, decline in memory and thinking skills, and many others.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for FOLIC ACID are as follows:\n\n* **Effective for...**\n\t+ Folate deficiency. Taking folic acid improves folate deficiency.\n* **Likely effective for...**\n\t+ High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). This condition has been linked to heart disease and stroke. Taking folic acid by mouth lowers homocysteine levels in people with normal or high homocysteine levels and in people with kidney failure.\n\t+ Toxicity caused by the drug methotrexate. Taking folic acid by mouth seems to reduce nausea and vomiting from methotrexate treatment.\n\t+ Birth defects of the brain and spine (neural tube birth defects). Consuming folic acid 600-800 mcg by mouth daily during pregnancy reduces the risk of these birth defects. Folic acid can come from the diet or supplements. Some people who are at high risk should get 4000-5000 mcg daily.\n* **Possibly effective for...**\n\t+ Decline in memory and thinking skills in older people. Taking folic acid by mouth, with or without other supplements, may improve memory and thinking skills in older people who have a larger decline in thinking skills than expected at that age. But it doesn't seem to work in older people who are experiencing the usual decline in thinking skills for their age.\n\t+ Depression. Taking folic acid by mouth along with antidepressants seems to improve symptoms in some people with depression.\n\t+ High blood pressure. Taking folic acid by mouth daily for at least 6 weeks reduces blood pressure in some people with high blood pressure who are not taking other blood pressure medications.\n\t+ Gum enlargement caused by the drug phenytoin. Applying folic acid to the gums seems to prevent this issue. But taking folic acid by mouth doesn't seem to help.\n\t+ Stroke. In areas of the world that don't add folic acid to grain products, taking folic acid supplements can reduce the risk of stroke. But supplements don't seem to be helpful for people who live in countries that do add folic acid to grain products.\n\t+ A skin disorder that causes white patches to develop on the skin (vitiligo). Taking folic acid by mouth seems to improve symptoms of this condition.\n* **Possibly ineffective for...**\n\t+ Low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia) due to iron deficiency. Adding folic acid to an iron supplement does not help to treat anemia any better than taking an iron supplement alone.\n\t+ Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. Taking folic acid by mouth doesn't seem to prevent a decline in mental function that occurs normally in healthy aging adults.\n\t+ Cataracts. Taking folic acid by mouth with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 does not prevent cataracts. In fact, it might increase the number of cataracts that need to be removed.\n\t+ Diarrhea. Taking folic acid by mouth doesn't seem to prevent diarrhea in children who are at risk of malnutrition. In fact, it may even increase the risk of having diarrhea that lasts more than a few days.\n\t+ Fall prevention. Taking folic acid by mouth with vitamin B12 does not seem to prevent falls in older people who are also taking vitamin D.\n\t+ Male infertility. Taking folic acid by mouth, alone or with other ingredients, does not seem to improve male fertility.\n\t+ Death of an unborn or premature baby. Taking folic acid by mouth during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of a baby dying just before or after birth. But it does help prevent other health issues in the baby.\n\t+ Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). Taking folate by mouth during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of this type of cancer in children.\n\t+ Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). In elderly individuals with osteoporosis, taking folic acid by mouth with vitamin B12 and/or vitamin B6 does not seem to prevent broken bones.\n\t+ Physical performance in elderly adults. Taking folic acid by mouth with vitamin B12 doesn't seem to help older people walk better or have stronger hands.\n\t+ High blood pressure during pregnancy. High-dose folic acid supplements do not seem to reduce blood pressure during pregnancy, or the risk of developing a condition called pre-eclampsia.\n\t+ Infection of the airways. Taking folic acid by mouth doesn't seem to prevent infections in the lungs in children at risk of malnutrition.\n* **Likely ineffective for...**\n\t+ Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Taking folic acid supplements does not prevent growths in the large intestine or rectum.\n\t+ An inherited condition marked by learning disabilities (fragile-X syndrome). Taking folic acid by mouth does not improve symptoms of fragile X syndrome.\n\t+ Preterm birth. Taking folic acid by mouth during pregnancy does not decrease the risk of having a premature baby. But it does help to prevent other health issues in the baby.\n\nThere is interest in using folic acid for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these uses.\n\n---\n\n**Folic Acid: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: It is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily. Doses higher than 1 mg daily may be unsafe. These doses might cause stomach upset, nausea, diarrhea, irritability, confusion, behavior changes, skin reactions, seizures, and other side effects.\n\nAnother form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe for most people in doses up to about 400 mcg daily.\n\nThere is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long time might cause serious side effects. Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems.\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n\n*   **Pregnancy and breast-feeding:** Folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. The maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age. Do not use more unless directed by a healthcare professional.\n*   **Children:** It is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. But children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 mcg for 1-3 years of age, 400 mcg for 4-8 years of age, 600 mcg for 9-13 years of age, and 800 mcg for 14-18 years of age.\n*   **Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty):** Using folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 might worsen narrowed arteries. Folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure.\n*   **Cancer:** Early research suggests that taking 0.8-1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. Until more is known, people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid.\n*   **Seizure disorder:** Taking folic acid supplements, especially in high doses, might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Folic Acid: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Special Precautions & Warnings**\n\n*   **Pregnancy and Breast-Feeding:** Folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. The maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age.\n*   **Children:** It is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. But children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits.\n\n**Are There Interactions With Medications?**\n\n*   **Moderate**\n    *   **5-Fluorouracil:** There is some concern that taking large amounts of folic acid with 5-fluorouracil might increase some side effects of 5-fluorouracil, especially stomach problems. Talk with your healthcare provider before taking folic acid.\n    *   **Capecitabine (Xeloda):** There is some concern that taking large amounts of folic acid might increase the side effects of capecitabine, especially stomach problems like diarrhea and vomiting. Talk with your healthcare provider before taking folic acid.\n\n**Are There Interactions With Herbs And Supplements?**\n\n*   **Green Tea:** There is some concern that green tea extract might keep folic acid from working the way it should in the body. This might lead to a condition that is similar to folic acid deficiency.\n*   **Zinc:** Folic acid might interfere with zinc absorption. But people who get enough zinc in their diet do not need to worry about this effect.\n\n**Are There Interactions With Foods?**\n\n*   **Folic Acid Can Be Taken With Food Or Without Food.**\n*   **Drinking Green Tea Might Lower Folic Acid Levels In The Body. If You Have Low Folic Acid Levels, Avoid Drinking Green Tea.**\n\n---\n\n**Folic Acid: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nIf you have low folic acid levels, avoid drinking green tea.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nFolic acid is an important nutrient. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA for folic acid is provided as Dietary Folate Equivalents, or DFE. This is because the body absorbs the folic acid in supplements better than the folate found in food. 1 mcg DFE is the same as 1 mcg of folate found in food. But 1 mcg DFE is the same as 0.6 mcg of folic acid supplements.\n\nThe RDA in adults is 400 mcg DFE daily. In pregnancy, the RDA is 600 mcg DFE daily. When breastfeeding, the RDA is 500 mcg DFE daily. In children, the RDA depends on age. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other names**\n\n* 5'-methyltetrahydrofolate\n* 5'-methyltetrahydrofolic acid\n* 5'-MTHF\n* Acide Folique\n* Acide Ptéroylglutamique\n* Acide Ptéroylmonoglutamique\n* Acido Folico\n* B Complex Vitamin\n* Complexe de Vitamines B\n* Complexe Vitaminique B\n* Dihydrofolate\n* Dihydrofolic Acid\n* Folacin\n* Folacine\n* Folate\n* Folinic Acid\n* L-methylfolate\n* Methylfolate\n* Méthylfolate\n* Methylfolic Acid\n* Pteroylglutamic Acid\n* Pteroylmonoglutamic Acid\n* Pteroylpolyglutamate\n* Tetrahydrofolate\n* Tétrahydrofolate\n* Vitamin B9\n* Vitamine B9\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\nXu R, Liu S, Zhong Z, et al.

This is because many pregnancies are unplanned, and birth defects often occur in the early days before you may know you are pregnant.\n\n**Prenatal Vitamins**\n\nIf you become pregnant, you should take a prenatal vitamin, which will include folic acid. Most prenatal vitamins contain 800 to 1000 mcg of folic acid. Taking a multivitamin with folic acid helps ensure that you get all the nutrients you need during pregnancy.\n\n**Higher Dose for Women with Neural Tube Defect History**\n\nWomen with a history of delivering a baby with a neural tube defect may need a higher dose of folic acid. If you have had a baby with a neural tube defect, you should take 400 µg of folic acid every day, even when you are not planning to become pregnant. If you plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your health care provider about whether you should increase your folic acid intake to 4 milligrams (mg) each day during the month before you become pregnant until at least the 12th week of pregnancy.\n\n**References**\n\nBerger DS, West EH.

    "content": "**Folic Acid in Diet**\n\nFolic acid and folate are both terms for a type of B vitamin (vitamin B9).\n\n* Folate is a B vitamin that occurs naturally in foods such as green leafy vegetables, citrus fruit, and beans.\n* Folic acid is man-made (synthetic) folate. It is found in supplements and added to fortified foods.\n\nThe terms folic acid and folate are often used interchangeably.\n\nFolic acid is water-soluble. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. That means your body does not store folic acid. You need to get a regular supply of the vitamin through the foods you eat or through supplements.\n\n**Function**\n\nFolate has many functions in the body:\n\n* Helps tissues grow and cells work\n* Works with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and create new proteins\n* Helps form red blood cells (helps prevent anemia)\n* Helps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information\n\nFolate deficiency may cause:\n\n* Diarrhea\n* Gray hair\n* Mouth ulcers\n* Peptic ulcer\n* Poor growth\n* Swollen tongue (glossitis)\n\nIt may also lead to certain types of anemias.\n\n**Because it may be hard to get enough folate through foods, women thinking about becoming pregnant should take folic acid supplements. Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent a type of birth defect called neural tube defects, including spina bifida.**\n\nFolic acid supplements may also be used to treat a lack of folate, and may help with some kinds of menstrual problems and leg ulcers.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nFolate occurs naturally in the following foods:\n\n* Dark green leafy vegetables\n* Dried beans and peas (legumes)\n* Citrus fruits and juices\n\nFortified means that vitamins have been added to the food. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid.

Some of these are:\n\n* Enriched breads\n* Cereals\n* Flours\n* Cornmeals\n* Pastas\n* Rice\n* Other grain products\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nFolic acid does not cause harm when used at recommended levels. Folic acid dissolves in water. This means that it is regularly removed from the body through urine, so excess amounts do not build up in the body.\n\nExcept for women with a history of pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect who are planning to become pregnant, you should avoid taking more than 1,000 mcg per day of folic acid. Although the risk is low, using higher levels of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency. Check with your health care provider for the best dose for you.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a wide variety of foods. Most people in the United States get enough folic acid in their diet because there is plenty of it in the food supply.\n\nFolic acid can help reduce the risk for certain birth defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly.\n\nWomen who are of childbearing age should take at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of a folic acid supplement every day in addition to that found in fortified foods.\nPregnant women should take 600 micrograms a day, or 1000 micrograms a day if expecting twins.\n\n**Function**\n\nFolate has many functions in the body:\n\n* Helps tissues grow and cells work\n* Works with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and create new proteins\n* Helps form red blood cells (helps prevent anemia)\n* Helps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information\n\nFolate deficiency may cause:\n\n* Diarrhea\n* Gray hair\n* Mouth ulcers\n* Peptic ulcer\n* Poor growth\n* Swollen tongue (glossitis)\n\nIt may also lead to certain types of anemias.\n\nBecause it may be hard to get enough folate through foods, women thinking about becoming pregnant should take folic acid supplements. Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent a type of birth defect called neural tube defects, including spina bifida.

FSH plays an important role in sexual development in children and fertility in adults.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nFSH testing is used to help diagnose conditions that cause too much or too little FSH. The specific way the test is used depends on your sex and age.\n\n* In women, an FSH test may be used to:\n\t+ Help find the cause of infertility\n\t+ Check for medical conditions that affect how the ovaries work\n\t+ Find the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periods in women of childbearing age\n\t+ Find out when a woman is most likely to get pregnant\n\t+ Find out if menopause or perimenopause may have begun:\n\t\t- Menopause happens when the ovaries stop making certain hormones, and menstrual periods have stopped for 12 months in a row. This usually happens around age 50.\n\t\t- Perimenopause is the time leading up to menopause when hormones and periods begin to change. It usually starts around age 45.\n* In men, an FSH test may be used to:\n\t+ Help find the cause of infertility\n\t+ Find the reason for a low sperm count\n\t+ Check for medical conditions that affect the testicles\n\n**Why do I need an FSH levels test?**\n\nYou may need this test if:\n\n* You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying.\n* Your menstrual periods aren't regular or have stopped.\n* If you're age 45 or older, testing usually isn't needed. That's because high levels of FSH are a normal sign of perimenopause and menopause.\n\n**What happens during an FSH levels test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nWomen who have menstrual periods may need to be tested at a specific time during their menstrual cycle. That's because FSH levels change throughout the month.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nTo understand the results of your FSH test, your provider will consider your sex, age, symptoms, medical history, and the results of other hormone tests, especially your level of luteinizing hormone (LH). Your provider can explain what the results of your FSH test mean.\n\nGenerally, in women and men:\n\n* Higher levels of FSH are often a sign of a condition in the reproductive glands (ovaries or testicles) that prevents them from making normal levels of sex hormones.\n* Conditions linked to high FSH levels include:\n\t+ In women: ovaries that never developed normally, primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), menopause or perimenopause, an ovarian tumor, thyroid diseases or adrenal gland disorders, a chromosomal disorder, such as Turner syndrome.\n\t+ In men: a germ cell tumor (a tumor that starts in the cells that become sperm), mumps, a physical injury to the testicles, a chromosomal disorder, such as Klinefelter syndrome.\n* Lower than normal levels of FSH in women and men are often a sign of a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. These problems may make it hard for your body to make FSH and LH.\n\nIn children with signs of early sexual development (before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys):\n\n* Low FSH levels may be linked to rapid weight loss, being very underweight, or extreme exercise.\n\n---\n\n**Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Levels Test**\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nThis test measures the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in a sample of your blood. FSH plays an important role in sexual development in children and fertility in adults.\n\nIn women, an FSH test may be used to:\n\n* Help find the cause of infertility\n* Check for medical conditions that affect how the ovaries work\n* Find the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periods in women of childbearing age\n* Find out when a woman is most likely to get pregnant\n* Find out if menopause or perimenopause may have begun\n\nIn men, an FSH test may be used to:\n\n* Help find the cause of infertility\n* Find the reason for a low sperm count\n* Check for medical conditions that affect the testicles\n\nIn women and men, FSH testing may be used to help diagnose disorders of the:\n\n* Pituitary gland\n* Hypothalamus\n\nIn children and teens, FSH testing is most often used to find out if a medical disorder is causing early or delayed (late) puberty.\n\n**Why do I need an FSH levels test?**\n\nFor women:\n\n* You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying.\n* Your menstrual periods aren't regular or have stopped.\n* If you're age 45 or older, testing usually isn't needed. That's because high levels of FSH are a normal sign of perimenopause and menopause.\n\nFor men:\n\n* You've been unable to get your partner pregnant after 12 months of trying.\n* You have less interest in sex than usual.\n* You have a low sperm count.\n* You have a loss of muscle and/or body hair.\n\n**What is follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)?**\n\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone that plays an important role in sexual development in children and fertility in adults. In women, FSH helps control the menstrual cycle by triggering the growth of eggs in the ovaries. In men, FSH helps control the amount of sperm that the testicles make.\n\n**How does FSH testing work?**\n\nFSH levels are controlled by a complex system of hormones made in different parts of your body. Abnormal levels of FSH may be a sign of a problem with any of these parts. They include your:\n\n* Pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of your brain that makes FSH.\n* Hypothalamus, a part of your brain that makes hormones that tell your pituitary gland how much FSH to make.\n* Reproductive glands, your ovaries or testicles. The amount of sex hormones they make let your hypothalamus and pituitary gland know when to start and stop making FSH.\n\n**What are the normal ranges for FSH levels?**\n\nNormal ranges for FSH levels vary depending on age and sex. In women, FSH levels typically rise with age. In men, FSH levels are usually low until puberty starts.\n\n**Can I use at-home test kits to measure FSH levels?**\n\nYes, you can use at-home test kits to measure FSH levels in urine (pee). These tests can help women find out if menopause or perimenopause is causing symptoms such as irregular periods, vaginal dryness, or hot flashes. However, home tests can only find higher than normal FSH levels and should not be used to check whether you can become pregnant.\n\n**What are the risks and benefits of FSH testing?**\n\nThe specific way the test is used depends on your sex and age. FSH testing may help diagnose conditions that cause too much or too little FSH. However, abnormal levels of FSH may be a sign of a problem with any of the parts that control FSH levels.\n\n**What should I do if my FSH levels are abnormal?**\n\nIf your FSH levels are abnormal, talk to your provider about what it means for you and how to proceed. They can help you understand the results and determine the best course of action.\n\n---\n\n**Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Levels Test**\n\n**When to Take the Test**\n\nYou've been unable to get your partner pregnant after 12 months of trying.\nYou have less interest in sex than usual.\nYou have a low sperm count.\nYou have a loss of muscle and/or body hair.\n\nFor women and men:\nYou may need an FSH test if your health care provider thinks you could have a pituitary disorder. Pituitary problems can affect fertility and decrease your interest in sex. They may also cause symptoms, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Decreased appetite and/or weight loss\n\n**Children and Teens**\n\nYou may need FSH testing if puberty seems to be starting too early or too late:\n\n* Early puberty means showing signs of sexual development before age 8 in girls and age 9 in boys.\n* Delayed puberty means not showing signs of sexual development by age 13 in girls and age 14 in boys.\n\n**What Happens During the Test**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nWomen who have menstrual periods may need to be tested at a specific time during their menstrual cycle. That's because FSH levels change throughout the month.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**Interpreting Results**\n\nTo understand the results of your FSH test, your provider will consider your sex, age, symptoms, medical history, and the results of other hormone tests, especially your level of luteinizing hormone (LH). Your provider can explain what the results of your FSH test mean.\n\n**Conditions Linked to High FSH Levels**\n\nIn women:\n\n* Ovaries that never developed normally\n* Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)\n* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n* Menopause or perimenopause\n* An ovarian tumor\n* Thyroid diseases or adrenal gland disorders\n* A chromosomal disorder, such as Turner syndrome\n\nIn men:\n\n* A germ cell tumor (a tumor that starts in the cells that become sperm)\n* Mumps\n* A physical injury to the testicles\n* A chromosomal disorder, such as Klinefelter syndrome\n\n**Conditions Linked to Low FSH Levels**\n\nIn women and men:\n\n* A problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus\n* Rapid weight loss\n* Being very underweight\n* Extreme exercise\n\n**Children with Early Puberty**\n\nHigh levels of FSH and LH mean the child has early puberty, also called precocious puberty. In most cases, the cause is unknown. But in certain cases, the cause is a problem in the brain, such as:\n\n* A brain tumor\n* A past brain injury\n* A past brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis\n\n**Teens with Delayed Puberty**\n\nLow or normal levels of FSH and LH usually mean delayed puberty. Many teens with delayed puberty are healthy and go through normal puberty at a later age. But delayed puberty may be caused by certain medical conditions, such as:\n\n* Poor nutrition from a long-term illness or eating disorder\n* Hypogonadism, which is when the ovaries or testicles make little or no hormone. It may be caused by:\n\t+ Certain genetic disorders, including Kallmann syndrome\n\t+ Tumors in the brain or pituitary gland\n\t+ Turner syndrome in girls\n\t+ Klinefelter syndrome in boys\n\t+ Certain autoimmune disorders\n\t+ Radiation therapy or chemotherapy\n\n---\n\n**Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Levels Test**\n\nAre you wondering if menopause or perimenopause is causing your symptoms? An at-home test kit that measures FSH levels in urine may be able to help. But what does it mean, and how do you use the results?\n\n**What does an at-home FSH test do?**\n\nAn at-home FSH test can only find higher than normal FSH levels. It's not meant to check whether you can become pregnant, because it can't accurately tell if your ovaries are making eggs.\n\n**How do I use the results of my at-home FSH test?**\n\nIf you use an at-home FSH test, be sure to discuss your symptoms and test results with your healthcare provider. They can help you understand what your results mean and how they relate to your overall health.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n* Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n* FDA: U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n* Hinkle J, Cheever K.

FSH is a hormone released by the pituitary gland, located on the underside of the brain.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nIf you are a woman of childbearing age, your health care provider may want you to have the test done on certain days of your menstrual cycle.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nIn women, FSH helps manage the menstrual cycle and stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs. The test is used to help diagnose or evaluate:\n\n* Menopause\n* Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cysts\n* Abnormal vaginal or menstrual bleeding\n* Problems becoming pregnant, or infertility\n\nIn men, FSH stimulates production of sperm. The test is used to help diagnose or evaluate:\n\n* Problems becoming pregnant, or infertility\n* Men who do not have testicles or whose testicles are underdeveloped\n\nIn children, FSH is involved with the development of sexual features. The test is ordered for children:\n\n* Who develop sexual features at a very young age\n* Who are delayed in starting puberty\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal FSH levels will differ, depending on a person's age and sex.\n\nMale:\n\n* Before puberty: 0 to 5.0 mIU/mL (0 to 5.0 IU/L)\n* During puberty: 0.3 to 10.0 mIU/mL (0.3 to 10.0 IU/L)\n* Adult: 1.5 to 12.4 mIU/mL (1.5 to 12.4 IU/L)\n\nFemale:\n\n* Before puberty: 0 to 4.0 mIU/mL (0 to 4.0 IU/L)\n* During puberty: 0.3 to 10.0 mIU/mL (0.3 to 10.0 IU/L)\n* Women who are still menstruating: 4.7 to 21.5 mIU/mL (4.5 to 21.5 IU/L)\n* After menopause: 25.8 to 134.8 mIU/mL (25.8 to 134.8 IU/L)\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nHigh FSH levels in women may be present:\n\n* During or after menopause, including premature menopause\n* When receiving hormone therapy\n* Due to certain types of tumor in the pituitary gland\n* Due to Turner syndrome\n\nLow FSH levels in women may be present due to:\n\n* Being very underweight or having had recent rapid weight loss\n* Not producing eggs (not ovulating)\n* Parts of the brain (the pituitary gland or hypothalamus) not producing normal amounts of some or all of its hormones\n* Pregnancy\n\nHigh FSH levels in men may mean the testicles are not functioning correctly due to:\n\n* Damage to testicles caused by alcohol overuse, chemotherapy, or radiation\n* Problems with genes, such as Klinefelter syndrome\n* Treatment with hormones\n* Certain tumors in the pituitary gland\n\nLow FSH levels in men may mean parts of the brain (the pituitary gland or hypothalamus) do not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones.\n\nHigh FSH levels in boys or girls may mean that puberty is about to start.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
