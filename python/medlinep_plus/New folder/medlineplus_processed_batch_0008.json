    "content": "**After an Exposure to Sharps or Body Fluids**\n\nBeing exposed to sharps (needles and other sharp medical instruments) or body fluids means that another person's blood or other body fluid touches your body. Exposure may occur after a needlestick or sharps injury. It can also occur when blood or other body fluid touches your skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucosal surface.\n\nExposure can put you at risk for infection.\n\n**What to Do**\n\nAfter a needlestick or cut exposure, wash the area with soap and water. For a splash exposure to the nose, mouth, or skin, flush with water. If exposure occurs to the eyes, irrigate with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigant.\n\nReport the exposure right away to your supervisor or the person in charge. Do not decide on your own whether you need more care.\n\nYour workplace will have a policy about what steps you should take after being exposed. Often, there is a nurse or another health care provider who is the expert on what to do. You will likely need lab tests, medicine, or a vaccine right away. Do not delay telling someone after you have been exposed.\n\nYou will need to report:\n\n*   How the needlestick or fluid exposure occurred\n*   What type of needle or instrument you were exposed to\n*   What fluid you were exposed to (such as blood, stool, saliva, or other body fluid)\n*   How long the fluid was on your body\n*   How much fluid there was\n*   Whether there was blood from the person visible on the needle or instrument\n*   Whether any blood or fluid was injected into you\n*   Whether the fluid touched an open area on your skin\n*   Where on your body the exposure was (such as skin, mucous membrane, eyes, mouth, or somewhere else)\n*   Whether the person has hepatitis, HIV, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\n\n**Risk of Illness**\n\nAfter exposure, there is a risk you may become infected with germs. These may include:\n\n*   Hepatitis B or C virus (causes liver infection)\n*   HIV, the virus that causes AIDS\n*   Bacteria, such as staph\n\nMost of the time, the risk of becoming infected after exposure is low. But you need to report any exposure right away. Do not wait.\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**After Vaginal Delivery - In the Hospital**\n\nMost women will remain in the hospital for about 24 hours after vaginal delivery. This is an important time for you to rest, bond with your new baby, and get help with breastfeeding and newborn care.\n\n**What to Expect After Delivery**\n\nRight after delivery, your baby will likely be placed on your chest while a nurse evaluates your baby's transition. Transition is the period after birth when your baby's body is adjusting to being outside your womb. Some babies may need oxygen or extra nursing care to transition. A small number may need to be transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for extra care. However, most new babies stay in the room with their mother.\n\nIn the first hours after delivery, hold your baby and attempt skin-to-skin contact. This helps ensure optimal bonding and the smoothest possible transition. If you are planning to breastfeed, which is highly recommended, your baby will likely try to latch on.\n\nDuring this time, you will stay in the room where you had your baby. A nurse will:\n\n* Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of vaginal bleeding\n* Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer\n\n**Contractions, Bleeding, and Pain**\n\nOnce you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding helps the uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful but they are important.\n\nAs your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavier bleeding. Blood flow should gradually decrease during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when your nurse presses on your uterus to check it.\n\nFor some women, the bleeding does not slow down and may even become heavier. This may be caused by a small piece of placenta that remains in the lining of your uterus. Rarely a minor surgery is needed to remove it.\n\n**Care of the Vagina and Perineum**\n\nThe area between your vagina and rectum is called the perineum. Even if you did not have a tear or an episiotomy, the area may be swollen and somewhat tender.\n\nTo relieve pain or discomfort:\n\n* Ask your nurses to apply ice packs right after you give birth. Using ice packs in the first 24 hours after birth decreases the swelling and helps with the pain.\n* Take warm baths, but wait until 24 hours after you have given birth. Also, use clean linens and towels and make sure the bathtub is clean each time you use it.\n* Take medicine like ibuprofen to relieve pain.\n\nSome women are worried about bowel movements after delivery or may be constipated. You may receive stool softeners.\n\nPassing urine may hurt during the first day. Most often this discomfort goes away in a day or so.\n\n**Caring for Your Baby**\n\nHolding and caring for your new infant is exciting. Most women feel that it makes up for the long journey of pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.\n\nKeeping your baby in the room with you helps you to bond with your new family member. If the baby must go to the nursery for health reasons, use this time and rest as much as you can. Taking care of a newborn is a full-time job and can be tiring.\n\nSome women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are common and are nothing to feel ashamed about. Talk with your health care provider, nurses, and partner.\n\n---\n\n**After Vaginal Delivery - In The Hospital**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect After Delivery**\n\nRight after delivery, your baby will likely be placed on your chest while a nurse evaluates your baby's transition.

    "content": "**Age-related Hearing Loss**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Age-related Hearing Loss?**\n\nAge-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, is a decrease in hearing ability that happens with age. In most cases, the hearing loss affects both ears. It can begin as early as a person's thirties or forties and worsens gradually over time.\n\n**Symptoms of Age-related Hearing Loss**\n\nAge-related hearing loss first affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, such as speech. Affected people find it increasingly difficult to understand what others are saying, particularly when there is background noise (such as at a party). However, because the hearing loss is gradual, many people do not realize they cannot hear as well as they used to. They may turn up the television volume or start speaking louder without being aware of it.\n\nAs the hearing loss worsens, it affects more frequencies of sound, making it difficult to hear more than just speech. Determining where a sound is coming from (localization) and identifying its source become more challenging. Some affected individuals also experience a ringing sensation in the ears (tinnitus) or dizziness and problems with balance (presbystasis).\n\n**Impact on Quality of Life**\n\nAge-related hearing loss often impacts a person's quality of life. Because affected individuals have trouble understanding speech, the condition affects their ability to communicate. It can contribute to social isolation, depression, and loss of self-esteem. Age-related hearing loss also causes safety issues if individuals become unable to hear smoke alarms, car horns, and other sounds that alert people to dangerous situations.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Gradual deterioration of the auditory system with age\n*   Exposure to loud noises over a long period\n*   Genetics\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAge-related hearing loss is not typically considered an inherited condition. However, some genetic factors may contribute to the development of presbycusis in certain individuals.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nPresbycusis\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on age-related hearing loss, please consult a healthcare professional or visit reputable health resources such as the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) or the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS).\n\n---\n\n**Age-Related Hearing Loss**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Age-Related Hearing Loss?**\n\nAge-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, is a decrease in hearing ability that happens with age.

Because affected individuals have trouble understanding speech, the condition affects their ability to communicate. It can contribute to social isolation, depression, and loss of self-esteem.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Age-Related Hearing Loss**\n\nAge-related hearing loss is one of the most common health conditions affecting older adults. Tens of millions of people worldwide are affected. In the United States, an estimated one-third of people over age 65, and half of those over 85, have some hearing loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Age-Related Hearing Loss**\n\nThe causes of age-related hearing loss are complex and involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Changes in the inner ear, where sound waves are converted to nerve impulses that are sent to the brain, are most commonly associated with this condition. Inherited variations in multiple genes likely influence whether age-related hearing loss occurs, the age at which it begins, and its severity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nAmong the best-studied genetic factors associated with age-related hearing loss are changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Damage to mtDNA causes cells to malfunction and ultimately to die, leading to irreversibly altered function of the inner ear.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Environmental and Lifestyle Factors**\n\nEnvironmental and lifestyle factors also contribute to age-related hearing loss. These factors include long-term exposure to loud noise (particularly through earphones at high volume), smoking, and exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead. Certain medications can damage cells in the inner ear that are necessary for hearing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for age-related hearing loss, some treatments can help alleviate symptoms. These include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices. Additionally, protecting one's hearing by avoiding loud noises and taking steps to prevent environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to hearing loss can help prevent or slow the progression of this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Age-Related Hearing Loss**\n\nThe causes of age-related hearing loss are complex. This condition results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, many of which have not been identified.\n\n**Causes of Age-Related Hearing Loss**\n\n*   Changes in the inner ear\n*   Nerve pathways that carry sound information in the brain\n*   Changes in the eardrum or in the small bones in the middle ear\n\nIn most cases, the exact cause of these changes is unknown.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nInherited variations in multiple genes likely influence whether age-related hearing loss occurs, the age at which it begins, and its severity. Some of these genes are important for the normal structure or function of the inner ear. Mutations in a subset of these genes also cause forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss that begin earlier in life.\n\n**Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)**\n\nAmong the best-studied genetic factors associated with age-related hearing loss are changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. As people age, mtDNA accumulates damaging mutations, including deletions and other changes.\n\n**Environmental and Lifestyle Factors**\n\nThese factors include:\n\n*   Long-term exposure to loud noise\n*   Smoking\n*   Exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead\n*   Certain medications (such as some antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs)\n*   Some health conditions that are common in older people, including heart disease and diabetes\n\n---\n\n**Age-related Hearing Loss**\n\n**What is Age-related Hearing Loss?**\n\nAge-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, is a type of hearing impairment that affects older adults. It is characterized by a gradual decline in hearing sensitivity, particularly in the high-frequency range.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile the exact causes of age-related hearing loss are not fully understood, several factors have been identified as contributing to its development:\n\n*   **Genetic predisposition**: Research suggests that people with close relatives who have severe age-related hearing loss may be at increased risk of developing the condition themselves.\n*   **Nutritional factors**: Certain nutritional deficiencies or excesses may play a role in age-related hearing loss, although the exact relationship between diet and hearing is unclear.\n*   **Health conditions**: Age-related hearing loss has been linked to various health conditions common in older adults, including heart disease and diabetes.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSeveral genes have been associated with age-related hearing loss:\n\n*   **APOE**\n*   **CDH23**\n*   **KCNQ4**\n*   **MTHFR**\n*   **MYO7A**\n*   **SLC26A4**\n*   **Mitochondrial DNA**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAge-related hearing loss typically does not have a clear pattern of inheritance, although many affected individuals report a family history of the condition. Studies suggest that people with close relatives who have severe age-related hearing loss may be at increased risk of developing the condition themselves.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   **Age-related hearing impairment**\n*   **Deafness due to old age**\n*   **Hearing loss, age-related**\n*   **Old-aged sensorineural hearing impairment**\n*   **Presbyacusia**\n*   **Presbycusis**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on age-related hearing loss, consider the following resources:\n\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov**\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n**References**\n\nThe following studies provide further insights into age-related hearing loss:\n\n*   Atcherson SR, Nagaraj NK, Kennett SE, Levisee M.

They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent.\n\nThere is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older. Your genes and loud noise (for example from loud concerts or music headphones) may play a role.\n\nThe following factors contribute to age-related hearing loss:\n\n* Family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families)\n* Repeated exposure to loud noises\n* Smoking (smokers are more likely to have such hearing loss than nonsmokers)\n* Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes\n* Certain medicines, such as chemotherapy medicines for cancer\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nLoss of hearing often occurs slowly over time.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Difficulty hearing people around you\n* Having to raise the volume on the TV\n* Frequently asking people to repeat themselves\n* Frustration at not being able to hear\n* Certain sounds seeming overly loud\n* Problems hearing in noisy areas\n* Problems telling apart certain sounds, such as \"s\" or \"th\"\n* More difficulty understanding people with higher-pitched voices\n* Ringing in the ears\n\nTalk to your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will do a complete physical exam. This helps find if a medical problem is causing your hearing loss. Your provider will use an instrument called an otoscope to look in your ears. Sometimes, ear wax can block the ear canals and cause hearing loss.\n\nYou may be sent to an ear, nose, and throat doctor and a hearing specialist (audiologist). Hearing tests can help determine the extent and type of hearing loss.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for age-related hearing loss. Treatment is focused on improving your everyday function. The following may be helpful:\n\n* Hearing aids\n* Telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices\n* Sign language (for those with severe hearing loss)\n* Speech reading (lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication)\n* A cochlear implant may be recommended for people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant. The implant allows the person to detect sounds again and with practice can allow the person to understand speech, but it does not restore normal hearing.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAge-related hearing loss most often gets worse slowly. The hearing loss cannot be reversed and may lead to deafness.\n\nHearing loss may cause you to avoid leaving home. Seek help from your provider and family and friends to avoid becoming isolated. Hearing loss can be managed so that you can continue to live a full and active life.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHearing loss can result in both physical (for example not hearing a fire alarm) and psychological (such as social isolation) problems.\n\nThe hearing loss may lead to deafness.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nHearing loss should be checked as soon as possible.

    "content": "**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. Subtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties. Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.\n\n**What is Age-related Macular Degeneration?**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.\n\n**Types of Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nResearchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.\n\nIn 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of age-related macular degeneration are not fully understood, but research suggests that it may be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is not typically inherited, but certain genetic mutations may increase the risk of developing the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nNone known.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about age-related macular degeneration, please visit the National Eye Institute's website at <https://www.nei.nih.gov/>.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nPlease see the references section for a list of sources used in this article.\n\n---\n\n**Age-Related Macular Degeneration**\n\n**What is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSubtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties.

These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nIt is estimated that 8 percent of people around the world have signs of age-related macular degeneration. The condition currently affects about 11 million Americans and 170 million people worldwide, and the prevalence is expected to increase over the coming decades as the proportion of older people in the population increases.\n\nFor reasons that are unclear, age-related macular degeneration affects individuals of European descent more frequently than African Americans in the United States.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.\n\nResearchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues.\n\nGenetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.\n\nChanges on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease.\n\nOther genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoproteins (HDL, also known as \"good\" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.\n\nResearchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Age appears to be the most important risk factor; the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older. Smoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration.\n\n---\n\n**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nThe most important risk factor for age-related macular degeneration is age. The chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older.\n\nSmoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration.\n\nOther factors that may increase the risk of this condition include:\n\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Heart disease\n*   A diet that is high in fat, high in easily digested foods (high glycemic index), or low in certain nutrients (such as antioxidants and zinc)\n*   Obesity\n*   Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

    "content": "**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\n**What is Age-related Macular Degeneration?**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (ARMD or AMD) is an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision. This makes it difficult to see fine details and read.\n\n**The Disease**\n\nThe disease is most common in people over age 60, which is why it is often called age-related macular degeneration (ARMD or AMD).\n\n**Causes**\n\nAMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.\n\nThere are two types of AMD:\n\n* **Dry AMD**: Occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form.\n* **Wet AMD**: Occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nHealth care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older.\n\nRisk factors for AMD are:\n\n* Family history of AMD\n* Being White\n* Cigarette smoking\n* High-fat diet\n* Being female\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision.\n\n**Dry AMD Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details.\n\nAs dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker.\n\nIn the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close.\n\n**Wet AMD Symptoms**\n\nThe most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy.\n\nThere may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou will have an eye exam. Drops will be placed into your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. Your eye doctor will use special lenses to view your retina, blood vessels, and optic nerve.\n\nYour eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen.\n\nYou may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lines look wavy, it may be a sign of AMD.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you have advanced or severe dry AMD, no treatment can restore your vision.\n\nIf you have early AMD and do not smoke, a combination of certain vitamins, antioxidants, and zinc may prevent the disease from getting worse. But it cannot give you back vision that is already lost.\n\nThe combination is often called the \"AREDS\" formula. The supplements contain:\n\n* 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C\n* 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E\n* 15 mg beta-carotene\n* 80 mg of zinc\n* 2 mg of copper\n\nOnly take this vitamin combination if your eye doctor recommends it. Make sure your eye doctor knows about any other vitamins or supplements you are taking. Smokers should not use this supplement.\n\n**Wet AMD Treatment**\n\nIf you have wet AMD, your eye doctor may recommend:\n\n* Laser surgery (laser photocoagulation) -- a small beam of light destroys the leaking, abnormal blood vessels.\n* Photodynamic therapy -- a light activates a medicine that is injected into your body to destroy leaking blood vessels.\n* Special medicines that prevent new blood vessels from forming in the eye are injected into the eye (this is an uncomfortable but painless process).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAlthough there is no known way to prevent macular degeneration, leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing AMD:\n\n* Do not smoke\n* Maintain a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat\n* Exercise regularly\n* Maintain a healthy weight\n\nSee your eye doctor regularly for dilated eye exams.\n\n---\n\n**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\n**What is Age-related Macular Degeneration?**\n\nMacular degeneration is an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision. This makes it difficult to see fine details and read.\n\n**Causes of Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nThe retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed. It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It has a high amount of two natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\nAMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.\n\nThere are two types of AMD:\n\n* Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form.\n* Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. This type of AMD causes most of the vision loss associated with the condition.\n\n**Risk Factors for Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nHealth care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older.\n\nRisk factors for AMD are:\n\n* Family history of AMD\n* Being White\n* Cigarette smoking\n* High-fat diet\n* Being female\n\n**Symptoms of Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nYou may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision.\n\nSYMPTOMS OF DRY AMD\n\nThe most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details. But you can see well enough to walk and do most daily activities.\n\nAs dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker.\n\nIn the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close.\n\nSYMPTOMS OF WET AMD\n\nThe most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy.\n\nThere may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time.\n\n**Exams and Tests for Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nYou will have an eye exam. Drops will be placed into your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. Your eye doctor will use special lenses to view your retina, blood vessels, and optic nerve.\n\nYour eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen.\n\nYou may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lines look wavy, it may be a sign of AMD. The American Macular Degeneration Foundation has an Amsler grid you can download along with instructions for how to check your vision.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n* Using special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina (fluorescein angiogram)\n* Taking a photo of the inner lining of the eye (fundus photography)\n* Using light waves to view the retina (optical coherence tomography)\n* A test that measures the pigment in the macula\n\n**Treatment for Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nIf you have advanced or severe dry AMD, no treatment can restore your vision.\n\nIf you have early AMD and do not smoke, a combination of certain vitamins, antioxidants, and zinc may prevent the disease from getting worse. But it cannot give you back vision that is already lost.\n\nThe combination is often called the \"AREDS\" formula.

Make sure your eye doctor knows about any other vitamins or supplements you are taking. Smokers should not use this supplement.\n\nAREDS may also benefit you if you have a family history and risk factors for AMD.\n\nLutein and zeaxanthin, which are substances found in green leafy vegetables, may also decrease your risk for age-related macular degeneration.\n\nIf you have wet AMD, your eye doctor may recommend:\n\n* Laser surgery (laser photocoagulation) -- a small beam of light destroys the leaking, abnormal blood vessels.\n* Photodynamic therapy -- a light activates a medicine that is injected into your body to destroy leaking blood vessels.\n* Special medicines that prevent new blood vessels from forming in the eye are injected into the eye (this is an uncomfortable but painless process).\n\n**Low-vision Aids and Therapy**\n\nLow-vision aids (such as special lenses) and therapy can help you use the vision that you have more effectively, and improve your quality of life.\n\nClose follow-up with your eye doctor is important.\n\nFor dry AMD, visit your eye doctor once a year for a complete eye exam.\nFor wet AMD, you likely need frequent, perhaps monthly, follow-up visits.\n\nEarly detection of vision changes is important because the sooner you are treated, the better your outcome. Early detection leads to earlier treatment and often, a better outcome.\n\nThe best way to detect changes is by self-testing at home with the Amsler grid. Your eye doctor can give you a copy of the grid or you can print one from the Internet. Test each eye individually while wearing your reading glasses. If the lines look wavy, call your eye doctor right away for an appointment.\n\n**Treatments in Development**\n\nStem cell research is showing some promise in restoring some vision in AMD. But this type of treatment is still years away at this point. Similarly, gene therapy may also have a place in the treatment of AMD. Levodopa, while most commonly used to treat Parkinson disease, may have a beneficial effect on wet AMD.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThese resources may provide more information on macular degeneration:\n\n* Macular Degeneration Association -- macularhope.org\n* National Eye Institute -- www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAMD does not affect side (peripheral) vision. This means complete vision loss never occurs. AMD results in the loss of central vision only.\n\nMild, dry AMD usually does not cause disabling central vision loss.\n\nWet AMD often leads to significant vision loss.\n\nIn general, with AMD you may lose the ability to read, drive a car, and recognize faces at a distance. But most people with AMD can carry out daily tasks without much difficulty.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have any symptoms of age-related macular degeneration, contact your eye doctor right away for an appointment.\n\n---\n\n**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nMacular degeneration is an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision.

It is a leading cause of vision loss among older adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ARMD include:\n\n*   Blind spots or missing areas in your field of vision\n*   Distorted or wavy lines on an Amsler grid test\n*   Difficulty reading, driving, or recognizing faces at a distance\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile the exact causes of ARMD are still not fully understood, research suggests that it may be related to:\n\n*   Age: ARMD is most common among people over 50 years old\n*   Genetics: Family history can play a role in the development of ARMD\n*   Lifestyle factors: Smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise may increase the risk of developing ARMD\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nARMD is typically diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, which includes:\n\n*   Visual acuity test to measure your central vision\n*   Amsler grid test to detect distorted or wavy lines\n*   Dilated fundus exam to examine the retina and macula\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ARMD, treatment options may include:\n\n*   Low-vision aids such as special lenses or magnifying glasses\n*   Therapy to help you use your remaining vision more effectively\n*   Close follow-up with your eye doctor to monitor changes in your vision\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAlthough there is no known way to prevent ARMD, leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing the condition. This includes:\n\n*   Not smoking\n*   Maintaining a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nIf you or a loved one is affected by ARMD, consider reaching out to support groups such as the Macular Degeneration Association or the National Eye Institute for more information and resources.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWhile ARMD can lead to significant vision loss, it does not affect peripheral vision. Mild, dry ARMD may not cause disabling central vision loss, but wet ARMD often leads to significant vision loss. With proper treatment and support, many people with ARMD are able to maintain their independence and quality of life.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any changes in your vision or notice distorted or wavy lines on an Amsler grid test, contact your eye doctor right away for an appointment. Regular follow-up visits with your eye doctor can help detect changes in your vision early on, leading to better treatment outcomes.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no known way to prevent ARMD, leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing the condition. This includes:\n\n*   Not smoking\n*   Maintaining a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (ARMD); AMD; Vision loss - ARMD\n\n---\n\n**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Age-related Macular Degeneration?**\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. It is a leading cause of blindness among older adults.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of AMD**\n\nThere are three main types of AMD:\n\n*   **Non-neovascular early AMD**: This type of AMD is characterized by the presence of drusen, which are yellowish deposits under the retina.\n*   **Intermediate AMD**: This type of AMD is characterized by the presence of both drusen and pigmentary changes in the macula.\n*   **Geographic atrophy**: This type of AMD is characterized by the loss of retinal tissue, leading to blind spots in the visual field.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile the exact causes of AMD are still not fully understood, research has identified several risk factors that may contribute to its development. These include:\n\n*   **Age**: AMD typically affects people over the age of 50.\n*   **Family history**: Having a family history of AMD increases an individual's risk of developing the condition.\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for AMD, and quitting smoking can help reduce this risk.\n*   **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of developing AMD.\n*   **Diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce the risk of AMD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of AMD can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Blind spots**: Blind spots in the visual field are a common symptom of geographic atrophy.\n*   **Distorted vision**: Distorted vision, such as straight lines appearing wavy, is a symptom of non-neovascular early AMD.\n*   **Loss of central vision**: Loss of central vision is a symptom of intermediate AMD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAMD is typically diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, which may include:\n\n*   **Visual acuity test**: A visual acuity test measures the sharpness of an individual's vision.\n*   **Dilated fundus examination**: A dilated fundus examination allows the doctor to examine the retina and macula for signs of AMD.\n*   **Fluorescein angiography**: Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a special dye to highlight any abnormal blood vessels in the retina.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there is currently no cure for AMD, treatment options are available to help slow its progression and improve vision. These include:\n\n*   **Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections**: Anti-VEGF injections are used to treat neovascular AMD by blocking the growth of abnormal blood vessels.\n*   **Laser photocoagulation**: Laser photocoagulation is a treatment that uses a laser to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina.\n*   **Vitamins and minerals**: Vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A and omega-3 fatty acids, may help reduce the risk of AMD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent AMD, research has identified several lifestyle changes that may help reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\n*   **Quitting smoking**: Quitting smoking can help reduce the risk of AMD.\n*   **Maintaining a healthy weight**: Maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise may help reduce the risk of AMD.\n*   **Eating a healthy diet**: Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce the risk of AMD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on AMD, please refer to the following references:\n\n*   Chaikitmongkol V, Bressler NM, Bressler SB.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Body Shape**\n\nAs we age, our bodies undergo natural changes that can affect our shape, size, and overall health. While some of these changes are unavoidable, lifestyle choices can slow or speed up the process.\n\n**The Human Body's Composition**\n\nOur body is made up of four main components: fat tissue, lean tissue (muscles and organs), bones, and water. After age 30, people tend to lose lean tissue, which includes muscle mass, liver function, kidney function, and other organ cells. This process is called atrophy.\n\n**Changes in Body Fat**\n\nThe amount of body fat increases steadily after age 30. Older people may have almost one-third more fat compared to when they were younger. However, the layer of fat under the skin may become smaller.\n\n**Height Loss**\n\nThe tendency to become shorter occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. Several factors contribute to height loss:\n\n*   The gel-like disks between the vertebrae dry out and flatten, shortening the spaces between the vertebrae.\n*   Muscle loss and loss of core strength lead to a more stooped posture.\n*   Feet tend to flatten with age.\n*   Osteoporosis can cause micro fractures in the spine, resulting in decreased height of the vertebrae.\n\n**Changes in Body Weight**\n\nMen often gain weight until about age 55, followed by weight loss later in life. This may be related to a drop in testosterone levels. Women typically gain weight until age 65 and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss is partly due to fat replacing lean muscle tissue, as fat weighs less than muscle.\n\n**Lifestyle Choices**\n\nYour lifestyle choices can affect how quickly the aging process takes place. To reduce age-related body changes:\n\n*   Get regular exercise.\n*   Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and the right amounts of healthy fats.\n*   Limit your alcohol use.\n*   Avoid tobacco products and illicit drugs.\n\nBy making these lifestyle choices, you can help slow down or prevent some of the age-related body changes.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Body Shape**\n\nAs we age, our body shape changes significantly. These changes can be attributed to various factors, including tissue loss, muscle atrophy, and bone density loss.\n\n**Tissue Loss and Muscle Atrophy**\n\nAfter the age of 30, people tend to lose lean tissue, including muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs. This process is called atrophy. Bones may also lose some of their minerals, becoming less dense (a condition that may lead to osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in your body.\n\n**Changes in Body Fat**\n\nThe amount of body fat increases steadily after age 30. Older people may have almost one-third more fat compared to when they were younger. However, the layer of fat under the skin may become smaller.\n\n**Height Loss**\n\nThe tendency to become shorter occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. Several factors contribute to height loss:\n\n*   The gel-like disks between the vertebrae in the spine dry out and flatten.\n*   Muscle loss and loss of core strength can lead to a more stooped posture.\n*   Feet tend to flatten with age.\n*   Osteoporosis can cause micro fractures in the spine, resulting in decreased height of the vertebrae.\n\n**Physical Consequences**\n\nSmaller leg muscles and stiffer joints can make moving around harder. Excess body fat and changes in body shape can affect your balance, making falls more likely.\n\n**Changes in Total Body Weight**\n\nMen often gain weight until about age 55, then begin to lose weight later in life. This may be related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less than muscle.\n\n**Lifestyle Choices**\n\nYour lifestyle choices affect how quickly the aging process takes place. Some things you can do to reduce age-related body changes are:\n\n*   Get regular exercise.\n*   Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and the right amounts of healthy fats.\n*   Limit your alcohol use.\n*   Avoid tobacco products and illicit drugs.\n\nBy making these lifestyle choices, you may slow or speed the aging process.",

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Hair and Nails**\n\nAs you age, your hair and nails begin to change. These changes are a natural part of the aging process.\n\n**Hair Changes and Their Effects**\n\n*   **Hair Color Change**: One of the clearest signs of aging is hair color change. Hair color is due to a pigment called melanin, which hair follicles produce. With aging, the follicles make less melanin, causing gray hair.\n*   **Scalp Hair Graying**: Scalp hair often starts graying at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp. Hair color becomes lighter, eventually turning white.\n*   **Body and Facial Hair Graying**: Body and facial hair also turn gray, but most often this happens later than scalp hair. Hair in the armpit, chest, and pubic area may gray less or not at all.\n*   **Hair Thickness Change**: Nearly everyone has some hair loss with aging. The rate of hair growth also slows. Hair strands become smaller and have less pigment.\n\n**Nail Changes and Their Effects**\n\nYour nails also change with age. They grow more slowly and may become dull and brittle. Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick. Ingrown toenails may be more common. The tips of the fingernails may break. Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and toenails.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n*   **Skin Changes**: \n*   **Face Changes**:\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Hair and Nails**\n\nAs you age, your hair and nails undergo significant changes. In this article, we will explore the effects of aging on these vital components of our body.\n\n**Hair Changes and Their Effects**\n\nHair color change is one of the clearest signs of aging. With decreasing melanin production, hair follicles produce less pigment, resulting in gray hair. Graying often begins in the 30s.\n\n* Scalp hair often starts graying at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp.\n* Hair color becomes lighter, eventually turning white.\n* Body and facial hair also turn gray, but most often, this happens later than scalp hair.\n* Hair in the armpit, chest, and pubic area may gray less or not at all.\n\nGraying is largely determined by your genes. Gray hair tends to occur earlier in white people and later in Asians. Nutritional supplements, vitamins, and other products will not stop or decrease the rate of graying.\n\nHair thickness change is another effect of aging. Hair strands become smaller and have less pigment, resulting in thin, fine, light-colored hair. Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs.\n\nMen may start showing signs of baldness by the time they are 30 years old. Many men are nearly bald by age 60. A type of baldness related to the normal function of the male hormone testosterone is called male-pattern baldness. Hair loss may be at the temples or at the top of the head.\n\nWomen can develop a similar type of baldness as they age. This is called female-pattern baldness. Hair becomes less dense and the scalp may become visible.\n\nAs you age, your body and face also lose hair. Women's remaining facial hair may get coarser, most often on the chin and around the lips. Men may grow longer and coarser eyebrow, ear, and nose hair.\n\nContact your health care provider if you have sudden hair loss. This can be a symptom of a health problem.\n\n**Nail Changes and Their Effects**\n\nYour nails also change with age. They grow more slowly and may become dull and brittle. They may also become yellowed and opaque.\n\n* Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick.\n* Ingrown toenails may be more common.\n* The tips of the fingernails may break.\n* Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and toenails.\n\nCheck with your provider if your nails develop pits, ridges, lines, changes in shape, or other changes. These can be related to iron deficiency, kidney disease, and nutritional deficiencies.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n* In the skin\n* In the face\n\nYour hair and nails help protect your body. They also keep the temperature of your body steady. As you age, your hair and nails begin to change.\n\nReferences:\nTosti A. Diseases of hair and nails. In: Goldman L, Cooney KA, eds.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Hormone Production**\n\nThe endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals produced in one location, released into the bloodstream, and then used by other target organs and systems.\n\nHormones control the target organs. Some organ systems have their own internal control systems along with, or instead of, hormones.\n\nAs we age, changes naturally occur in the way body systems are controlled. Some target tissues become less sensitive to their controlling hormone. The amount of hormones produced may also change.\n\nBlood levels of some hormones increase, some decrease, and some are unchanged. Hormones are also broken down (metabolized) more slowly.\n\nMany of the organs that produce hormones are controlled by other hormones. Aging also changes this process. For example, an endocrine tissue may produce less of its hormone than it did at a younger age, or it may produce the same amount at a slower rate.\n\n**AGING CHANGES**\n\nThe hypothalamus is located in the brain. It produces hormones that control the other structures in the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland. The amount of these regulating hormones stays about the same, but the response by the endocrine organs can change as we age.\n\nThe pituitary gland is located just below (anterior pituitary) or in (posterior pituitary) the brain. This gland reaches its maximum size in middle age and then gradually becomes smaller. It has two parts:\n\n* The back (posterior) part stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus.\n* The front (anterior) part produces hormones that affect growth, the thyroid gland (thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH), adrenal cortex, ovaries, testes, and breasts.\n\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck. It produces hormones that help control metabolism. With aging, the thyroid may become lumpy (nodular). Metabolism slows over time, beginning at around age 20. Because thyroid hormones are produced and broken down (metabolized) at the same rate, thyroid function tests are most often still normal. In some people, thyroid hormone levels may rise, leading to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe parathyroid glands are four tiny glands located around the thyroid. Parathyroid hormone affects calcium and phosphate levels, which affect bone strength. Parathyroid hormone levels rise with age, which may contribute to osteoporosis.\n\nInsulin is produced by the pancreas. It helps sugar (glucose) go from the blood to the inside of cells, where it can be used for energy.\n\nThe average fasting glucose level rises 6 to 14 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) every 10 years after age 50 as the cells become less sensitive to the effects of insulin. Once the level reaches 126 mg/dL or higher, the person is considered to have diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe adrenal glands are located just above the kidneys. The adrenal cortex, the surface layer, produces the hormones aldosterone, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).\n\n* Aldosterone regulates fluid and electrolyte balance.\n* Cortisol is the \"stress response\" hormone. It affects the breakdown of glucose, protein, and fat, and it has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects.\n\nAldosterone release decreases with age. This decrease can contribute to lightheadedness and a drop in blood pressure with sudden position changes (orthostatic hypotension). Cortisol release also decreases with aging, but the blood level of this hormone stays about the same. DHEA levels also drop. The effects of this drop on the body are not clear.\n\nThe ovaries and testes have two functions. They produce the reproductive cells (ova and sperm). They also produce the sex hormones that control secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair.\n\nWith aging, men often have a lower level of testosterone.\nWomen have lower levels of estradiol and other estrogen hormones after menopause.\n\n**EFFECT OF CHANGES**\n\nOverall, some hormones decrease, some do not change, and some increase with age. Hormones that usually decrease include:\n\n* Aldosterone\n* Calcitonin\n* Growth hormone\n* Renin\n\nIn women, estrogen and prolactin levels decrease significantly.\n\nHormones that most often remain unchanged or only slightly decrease include:\n\n* Cortisol\n* Epinephrine\n* Insulin\n* Thyroid hormones T3 and T4\n\nTestosterone levels usually decrease gradually as men age.\n\nHormones that may increase include:\n\n* Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)\n* Luteinizing hormone (LH)\n* Norepinephrine\n* Parathyroid hormone\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Hormone Production**\n\nAs we age, changes naturally occur in the way body systems are controlled.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Immunity**\n\nYour immune system helps protect your body from foreign or harmful substances. Examples are bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood or tissues from another person. The immune system makes cells and antibodies that destroy these harmful substances.\n\n**AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM**\n\nAs you grow older, your immune system does not work as well. The following immune system changes may occur:\n\n*   The immune system becomes slower to respond. This increases your risk of getting sick. Flu shots or other vaccines may not work as well or protect you for as long as expected.\n*   An autoimmune disorder may develop. This is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages or destroys healthy body tissues.\n*   Your body may heal more slowly. There are fewer immune cells in the body to bring about healing.\n*   The immune system's ability to detect and correct cell defects also declines. This can result in an increased risk of cancer.\n\n**PREVENTION**\n\nTo decrease the risks from immune system aging:\n\n*   Get vaccines to prevent the flu, COVID-19, shingles, and pneumococcal infections, as well as any other vaccines your health care provider recommends.\n*   Get plenty of exercise. Exercise helps boost your immune system.\n*   Eat healthy foods. Good nutrition keeps your immune system strong.\n*   Do not smoke. Smoking weakens your immune system.\n*   Limit your intake of alcohol. Ask your provider how much alcohol is safe for you.\n*   Look into safety measures to prevent falls and injuries. A weak immune system can slow healing from injuries.\n\n**OTHER CHANGES**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including in your:\n\n*   Hormone production\n*   Organs, tissues, and cells\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Immunity**\n\n\\n\\nAs people age, their immune systems undergo significant changes that can affect their overall health. In this article, we will explore the ways in which aging impacts immunity.\n\n**Changes in the Blood**\n\nOne of the key changes that occur with aging is a decrease in the production of red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Additionally, older adults may experience a decline in the production of white blood cells, which are essential for fighting off infections.\n\n**Immune Senescence**\n\nAging also leads to immune senescence, a state of decreased immune function that can make older adults more susceptible to illnesses. This can be attributed to a decline in the function and number of T-cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune response.\n\n**Common Clinical Sequelae**\n\nThe changes in immunity that occur with aging can have significant clinical implications. For example, older adults may experience a decrease in their ability to fight off infections, which can lead to increased rates of illness and death. Additionally, the decline in immune function can contribute to the development of age-related diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.\n\n**References**\n\n* McDevitt MA.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Organs, Tissue and Cells**\n\nAs we age, all vital organs begin to lose some function. Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs, affecting the functioning of all body systems.\n\n**Types of Tissue**\n\nThere are four basic types of tissue:\n\n*   **Connective Tissue**: supports other tissues and binds them together. This includes bone, blood, and lymph tissues, as well as the tissues that give support and structure to the skin and internal organs.\n*   **Epithelial Tissue**: provides a covering for superficial and deeper body layers. The skin and the linings of the passages inside the body, such as the gastrointestinal system, are made of epithelial tissue.\n*   **Muscle Tissue**: includes three types of tissue:\n    *   **Striated Muscles**: voluntary muscle that moves the skeleton\n    *   **Smooth Muscles**: involuntary muscle found in the stomach and other internal organs like the female uterus\n    *   **Cardiac Muscle**: makes up most of the heart wall, also an involuntary muscle\n*   **Nerve Tissue**: made up of nerve cells (neurons) and is used to carry messages to and from various parts of the body. The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are made of nerve tissue.\n\n**Cells and Aging**\n\nCells are the basic building blocks of tissues. All cells experience changes with aging. They become larger and are less able to divide and multiply. Among other changes, there is an increase in pigments and fatty substances inside the cell (lipids). Many cells lose their ability to function, or they begin to function abnormally.\n\n**Organs and Aging**\n\nBecause of cell and tissue changes, your organs also change as you age. Aging organs slowly lose function. Most people do not notice this loss immediately, because you rarely need to use your organs to their fullest ability. Organs have a reserve ability to function beyond the usual needs.\n\n**Loss of Reserve**\n\nThe biggest changes in organ reserve occur in the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The amount of reserve lost varies between people and between different organs in a single person. These changes appear slowly and over a long period. When an organ is worked harder than usual, it may not be able to increase function.\n\n**Side Effects of Medicine**\n\nLoss of reserve also makes it harder to restore balance (equilibrium) in the body. Drugs are removed from the body by the kidneys and liver at a slower rate. Lower doses of medicines may be needed, and side effects become more common.\n\n**Aging Theory**\n\nNo one knows how and why people change as they get older. Some theories claim that aging is caused by injuries from ultraviolet light over time, wear and tear on the body, or byproducts of metabolism. Other theories view aging as a predetermined process controlled by genes.\n\n**Terms to Describe Types of Cell Changes**\n\n*   **Atrophy**: cells shrink. If enough cells decrease in size, the entire organ atrophies.\n*   **Hypertrophy**: cells enlarge due to an increase of proteins in the cell membrane and cell structures.\n*   **Hyperplasia**: the number of cells increases due to an increased rate of cell division.\n*   **Dysplasia**: the size, shape, or organization of mature cells becomes abnormal.\n*   **Neoplasia**: the formation of tumors, either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Organs, Tissue and Cells**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tissue Types**\n\nAll vital organs begin to lose some function as you age. Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs, and these changes affect the functioning of all body systems.\n\nLiving tissue is made up of cells. There are many different types of cells, but all have the same basic structure. Tissues are layers of similar cells that perform a specific function. The different kinds of tissues group together to form organs.\n\nThere are four basic types of tissue:\n\n*   **Connective tissue**: supports other tissues and binds them together. This includes bone, blood, and lymph tissues, as well as the tissues that give support and structure to the skin and internal organs.\n*   **Epithelial tissue**: provides a covering for superficial and deeper body layers. The skin and the linings of the passages inside the body, such as the gastrointestinal system, are made of epithelial tissue.\n*   **Muscle tissue**: includes three types of tissue:\n    *   **Striated muscles**, such as those that move the skeleton (also called voluntary muscle)\n    *   **Smooth muscles** (also called involuntary muscle), such as the muscles contained in the stomach and other internal organs like the female uterus\n    *   **Cardiac muscle**, which makes up most of the heart wall (also an involuntary muscle)\n*   **Nerve tissue**: is made up of nerve cells (neurons) and is used to carry messages to and from various parts of the body. The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are made of nerve tissue.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**AGING CHANGES**\n\nCells are the basic building blocks of tissues. All cells experience changes with aging. They become larger and are less able to divide and multiply. Among other changes, there is an increase in pigments and fatty substances inside the cell (lipids). Many cells lose their ability to function, or they begin to function abnormally.\n\nAs aging continues, waste products build up in tissue. A fatty brown pigment called lipofuscin collects in many tissues, as do other fatty substances.\n\nConnective tissue changes, becoming more stiff. This makes the organs, blood vessels, and airways more rigid. Cell membranes change, so many tissues have more trouble getting oxygen and nutrients and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes.\n\nMany tissues lose mass. This process is called atrophy. Some tissues become lumpy (nodular) or more rigid.\n\nBecause of cell and tissue changes, your organs also change as you age. Aging organs slowly lose function. Most people do not notice this loss immediately, because you rarely need to use your organs to their fullest ability.\n\nOrgans have a reserve ability to function beyond the usual needs. For example, the heart of a 20-year-old is capable of pumping about 10 times the amount of blood that is actually needed to keep the body alive. After age 30, an average of 1% of this reserve is lost each year.\n\nThe biggest changes in organ reserve occur in the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The amount of reserve lost varies between people and between different organs in a single person.\n\nThese changes appear slowly and over a long period. When an organ is worked harder than usual, it may not be able to increase function. Sudden heart failure or other problems can develop when the body is worked harder than usual. Things that produce an extra workload (body stressors) include the following:\n\n*   Illness\n*   Medicines\n*   Overactive thyroid gland\n*   Significant life changes\n*   Sudden increased physical demands on the body, such as a change in activity or exposure to a higher altitude\n\nLoss of reserve also makes it harder to restore balance (equilibrium) in the body. Drugs are removed from the body by the kidneys and liver at a slower rate. Lower doses of medicines may be needed, and side effects become more common. Recovery from illnesses is seldom 100%, leading to more and more disability.\n\nSide effects of medicine can mimic the symptoms of many diseases, so it is easy to mistake a drug reaction for an illness. Some medicines have entirely different side effects in the elderly than in younger people.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**AGING THEORY**\n\nNo one knows how and why people change as they get older. Some theories claim that aging is caused by injuries from ultraviolet light over time, wear and tear on the body, or byproducts of metabolism. Other theories view aging as a predetermined process controlled by genes.\n\nNo single process can explain all the changes of aging. Aging is a complex process that varies as to how it affects different people and even different organs. Most gerontologists (people who study aging) feel that aging is due to the interaction of many lifelong influences. These influences include heredity, environment, culture, diet, exercise and leisure, past illnesses, and many other factors.\n\nUnlike the changes of adolescence, which are predictable to within a few years, each person ages at a unique rate. Some systems begin aging as early as age 30. Other aging processes are not common until much later in life.\n\nAlthough some changes always occur with aging, they occur at different rates and to different extents. There is no way to predict exactly how you will age.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**TERMS TO DESCRIBE TYPES OF CELL CHANGES**\n\n*   **Atrophy**: cells shrink. If enough cells decrease in size, the entire organ atrophies. This is often a normal aging change and can occur in any tissue. It is most common in skeletal muscle, the heart, the brain, and the sex organs (such as the breasts and ovaries). Bones become thinner and more likely to break with minor trauma.\n*   **Hypertrophy**: cells enlarge. This is caused by an increase of proteins in the cell membrane and cell structures, not an increase in the cell's fluid.\n*   **Hyperplasia**: the number of cells increases. There is an increased rate of cell division.\n*   **Dysplasia**: the size, shape, or organization of mature cells becomes abnormal. This is also called atypical hyperplasia.\n*   **Neoplasia**: the formation of tumors, either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**AGING CHANGES IN VARIOUS BODY SYSTEMS**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have changes throughout your body, including changes in your:\n\n*   Hormone production\n*   Immunity\n*   Skin\n*   Sleep\n*   Bones, muscles, and joints\n*   Breasts\n*   Face\n*   Reproductive system\n*   Heart and blood vessels\n*   Kidneys\n*   Lungs\n*   Nervous system\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Organs, Tissue, and Cells**\n\nAs we age, our bodies undergo a series of changes that affect all organs, tissues, and cells.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Skin**\n\nAs people grow older, a group of common conditions and developments occur in their skin. These changes are among the most visible signs of aging, along with wrinkles and sagging skin. Whitening or graying of the hair is another obvious sign of aging.\n\n**What Does Your Skin Do?**\n\nYour skin does many things:\n\n* Contains nerve receptors that allow you to feel touch, pain, and pressure\n* Helps control fluid and electrolyte balance\n* Helps control your body temperature\n* Protects you from the environment\n\n**Layers of the Skin**\n\nAlthough skin has many layers, it can generally be divided into three main parts:\n\n1. **The outer part (epidermis)**: contains skin cells, pigment, and proteins.\n2. **The middle part (dermis)**: contains skin cells, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and oil glands. The dermis provides nutrients to the epidermis.\n3. **The inner layer under the dermis (the subcutaneous layer)**: contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels, and fat.\n\nEach layer also contains connective tissue with collagen fibers to give support and elastin fibers to provide flexibility and strength.\n\n**Aging Changes**\n\nWith aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged. The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases, and the remaining melanocytes increase in size. Aging skin looks thinner, paler, and clear (translucent). Pigmented spots including age spots or \"liver spots\" may appear in sun-exposed areas.\n\nChanges in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity, known as elastosis. This is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors.\n\n**Other Aging Changes**\n\n* The blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile, leading to bruising, bleeding under the skin (often called senile purpura), and cherry angiomas.\n* Sebaceous glands produce less oil as you age, making it harder to keep the skin moist, resulting in dryness and itchiness.\n* The subcutaneous fat layer thins, increasing your risk of skin injury and reducing your ability to maintain body temperature.\n* Some medicines are absorbed by the fat layer, which may change the way these medicines work.\n* The sweat glands produce less sweat, making it harder to keep cool and increasing your risk for overheating or developing heat stroke.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause most skin changes are related to sun exposure, prevention is a lifelong process. Prevent sunburn if at all possible. Use a good quality sunscreen when outdoors, even in the winter. Wear protective clothing and a hat when needed. Good nutrition and adequate fluids are also helpful. Dehydration increases the risk of skin injury. Keep skin moist with lotions and other moisturizers.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Skin**\n\nAs people grow older, their skin undergoes a series of changes that are both visible and invisible. These changes are a natural part of the aging process, but they can also have significant impacts on our health and well-being.\n\n**What Does Your Skin Do?**\n\nYour skin is more than just a protective barrier - it's a complex organ that performs many vital functions. Some of its key roles include:\n\n*   **Sensing touch, pain, and pressure**: Your skin contains nerve receptors that allow you to feel sensations like touch, pain, and pressure.\n*   **Regulating fluid and electrolyte balance**: Your skin helps control the balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body, which is essential for maintaining proper hydration levels.\n*   **Controlling body temperature**: Your skin plays a crucial role in regulating your body's temperature, helping to keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\n*   **Protecting you from the environment**: Your skin acts as a shield against external factors like sunlight, wind, and cold temperatures.\n\n**The Structure of Your Skin**\n\nDespite its many layers, your skin can be divided into three main parts:\n\n1.  **The outer part (epidermis)**: This layer contains skin cells, pigment, and proteins.\n2.  **The middle part (dermis)**: This layer contains skin cells, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and oil glands. The dermis provides nutrients to the epidermis.\n3.  **The inner layer under the dermis (the subcutaneous layer)**: This layer contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels, and fat.\n\nEach layer also contains connective tissue with collagen fibers to provide support and elastin fibers to offer flexibility and strength.\n\n**Aging Changes in Your Skin**\n\nAs you age, your skin undergoes several changes that can impact its appearance and function. Some of the most notable changes include:\n\n*   **Thinning of the outer skin layer (epidermis)**: With aging, the epidermis becomes thinner, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged.\n*   **Decrease in pigment-containing cells (melanocytes)**: The number of melanocytes decreases with age, leading to a decrease in skin pigmentation.\n*   **Changes in connective tissue**: The blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile, and the elastin fibers that provide flexibility and strength begin to break down. This leads to a loss of elasticity and the formation of wrinkles.\n*   **Decrease in sebaceous gland activity**: As you age, your sebaceous glands produce less oil, which can lead to dryness and itchiness.\n\n**The Impact of Aging Changes on Your Skin**\n\nAs your skin undergoes these changes, it becomes more fragile and prone to injury. You may experience:\n\n*   **Bruising and bleeding under the skin**: The increased fragility of blood vessels can lead to bruising and bleeding.\n*   **Pressure ulcers**: The loss of subcutaneous fat and reduced ability to sense touch and pressure can increase your risk of developing pressure ulcers.\n*   **Delayed wound healing**: Aging skin repairs itself more slowly than younger skin, which can contribute to delayed wound healing.\n\n**Preventing Age-Related Skin Changes**\n\nWhile some aging changes are inevitable, there are steps you can take to prevent or mitigate their impacts:\n\n*   **Protect your skin from the sun**: Preventing sunburn and using sunscreen regularly can help reduce the appearance of age-related skin changes.\n*   **Maintain good nutrition and hydration**: Eating a balanced diet and staying hydrated can help support your skin's health and function.\n*   **Keep your skin moisturized**: Using lotions and other moisturizers can help maintain your skin's comfort and promote healthy healing.\n\nBy understanding the aging changes that occur in our skin, we can take proactive steps to preserve its health and appearance as we grow older.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Skin**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Does Your Skin Do?**\n\nYour skin does many things. It:\n\n*   Contains nerve receptors that allow you to feel touch, pain, and pressure\n*   Helps control fluid and electrolyte balance\n*   Helps control your body temperature\n*   Protects you from the environment\n\nAlthough skin has many layers, it can generally be divided into three main parts:\n\nThe outer part (epidermis) contains skin cells, pigment, and proteins.\nThe middle part (dermis) contains skin cells, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and oil glands. The dermis provides nutrients to the epidermis.\nThe inner layer under the dermis (the subcutaneous layer) contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels, and fat.\n\nEach layer also contains connective tissue with collagen fibers to give support and elastin fibers to provide flexibility and strength.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Skin Changes**\n\nSkin changes are related to environmental factors, genetic makeup, nutrition, and other factors. The greatest single factor, though, is sun exposure. You can see this by comparing areas of your body that have regular sun exposure with areas that are protected from sunlight.\n\nNatural pigments seem to provide some protection against sun-induced skin damage. Blue-eyed, fair-skinned people show more aging skin changes than people with darker, more heavily pigmented skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Aging Changes**\n\nWith aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged.\n\nThe number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases. The remaining melanocytes increase in size. Aging skin looks thinner, paler, and clear (translucent). Pigmented spots including age spots or \"liver spots\" may appear in sun-exposed areas. The medical term for these areas is lentigos.\n\nChanges in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity. This is known as elastosis. It is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors.\n\nThe blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile. This leads to bruising, bleeding under the skin (often called senile purpura), and cherry angiomas.\n\nSebaceous glands produce less oil as you age. Men experience a minimal decrease, most often after the age of 80. Women gradually produce less oil beginning after menopause. This can make it harder to keep the skin moist, resulting in dryness and itchiness.\n\nThe subcutaneous fat layer thins so it has less insulation and padding. This increases your risk of skin injury and reduces your ability to maintain body temperature. Because you have less natural insulation, you can get hypothermia in cold weather.\n\nSome medicines are absorbed by the fat layer. Shrinkage of this layer may change the way that these medicines work.\n\nThe sweat glands produce less sweat. This makes it harder to keep cool. Your risk for overheating or developing heat stroke increases.\n\nGrowths such as skin tags, warts, brown rough patches (seborrheic keratoses), and other blemishes are more common in older people. Also common are pinkish rough patches (actinic keratosis) which have a small chance of becoming a skin cancer. Skin cancers are also common and usually located in sun-exposed areas. Your health care provider can inform you if any skin lesions are worrisome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Effect of Changes**\n\nAs you age, you are at increased risk for skin injury. Your skin is thinner, more fragile, and you lose some of the protective fat layer. You also may be less able to sense touch, pressure, vibration, heat, and cold.\n\nRubbing or pulling on the skin can cause skin tears. Fragile blood vessels can break easily. Bruises, flat collections of blood (purpura), and raised collections of blood (hematomas) may form after even a minor injury.\n\nPressure ulcers can be caused by skin changes, loss of the fat layer, reduced activity, poor nutrition, and illnesses. Sores are most easily seen on the outside surface of the forearms, but they can occur anywhere on the body.\n\nAging skin repairs itself more slowly than younger skin. Wound healing may be up to 4 times slower. This contributes to pressure ulcers and infections. Diabetes, blood vessel changes, lowered immunity, and other factors also affect healing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nSkin disorders are so common among older people that it is often hard to tell normal changes from those related to a disorder. More than 90% of all older people have some type of skin disorder.\n\nSkin disorders can be caused by many conditions, including:\n\n*   Blood vessel diseases, such as atherosclerosis\n*   Diabetes\n*   Heart disease\n*   Liver disease\n*   Nutritional deficiencies\n*   Obesity\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Stress\n\nOther causes of skin changes:\n\n*   Allergies to plants and other substances\n*   Climate\n*   Clothing\n*   Exposures to industrial and household chemicals\n*   Indoor heating\n\nSunlight can cause:\n\n*   Loss of elasticity (elastosis)\n*   Noncancerous skin growths (keratoacanthomas)\n*   Pigment changes such as liver spots\n*   Thickening of the skin\n\nSun exposure has also been directly linked to skin cancers, including basal cell cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause most skin changes are related to sun exposure, prevention is a lifelong process.\n\nPrevent sunburn if at all possible.\nUse a good quality sunscreen when outdoors, even in the winter.\nWear protective clothing and a hat when needed.\n\nGood nutrition and adequate fluids are also helpful. Dehydration increases the risk of skin injury. Sometimes minor nutritional deficiencies can cause rashes, skin lesions, and other skin changes, even if you have no other symptoms.\n\nKeep skin moist with lotions and other moisturizers. Do not use soaps that are strongly detergent (drying) or heavily perfumed. Bath oils are not recommended because they can cause you to slip and fall. Moist skin is more comfortable and will heal more quickly.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Skin**\n\nWith aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged.\n\n* The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases.\n* The remaining melanocytes increase in size.\n* Aging skin looks thinner, paler, and clear (translucent).\n* Pigmented spots including age spots or \"liver spots\" may appear in sun-exposed areas.

Older people wake up an average of 3 or 4 times each night. They are also more aware of being awake.\n\n*   **Causes**: Older people wake up more often because they spend less time in deep sleep. Other causes include needing to get up and urinate (nocturia), anxiety, and discomfort or pain from long-term (chronic) illnesses.\n\n**Effect of Changes**\n\nSleep difficulty is an annoying problem. Long-term (chronic) insomnia is a major cause of auto accidents and depression. Because older people sleep more lightly and wake up more often, they may feel deprived of sleep even when their total sleep time has not changed.\n\n*   **Sleep Deprivation**: Sleep deprivation can eventually cause confusion and other mental changes.

It is very important to talk with your provider before taking sleep medicines. If possible, avoid sleep medicines. However, antidepressant medicines can be very helpful if depression affects your sleep. Some antidepressants do not cause the same side effects as sleep medicines.\n\nSometimes, a mild antihistamine works better than a sleeping pill for relieving short-term insomnia. However, most health experts do not recommend these types of medicines for older people.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Teeth and Gums**\n\nAs we age, our bodies undergo various changes that can affect our oral health. Certain health conditions more common in older adults and certain medicines can also impact oral health.\n\n**How Age Can Affect Oral Health**\n\nWith age, our cells renew at a slower rate, tissues become thinner and less elastic, bones become less dense and strong, and the immune system can become weaker, making it easier for infections to occur and healing to take longer. These changes affect tissue and bone in the mouth, increasing the risk for oral health problems.\n\n**Common Oral Health Problems in Older Adults**\n\n*   **Dry Mouth**\n    *   Older adults are more at risk for dry mouth due to age, medicine use, or certain health conditions.\n    *   Saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health; its absence increases the risk for problems tasting, chewing, and swallowing, as well as gum disease and tooth decay.\n    *   Common causes of dry mouth include:\n        1.  Many medicines used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pain, and depression.\n        2.  Side effects from cancer treatment.\n        3.  Health conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and Sjögren syndrome.\n*   **Gum Problems**\n    *   Receding gums are common in older adults, making it easy for bacteria to build up and cause inflammation and decay.\n    *   Gum disease (periodontal disease) is the most common cause of receding gums.\n*   **Cavities**\n    *   Dental cavities occur when bacteria change sugars and starches from food into acid, attacking tooth enamel.\n    *   Cavities are more likely to develop at the root of the tooth due to receding gums and dry mouth.\n*   **Oral Cancer**\n    *   Oral cancer is more common in people older than 50 and is almost three times greater in men than in women.\n    *   Smoking, drinking alcohol excessively, and other factors increase the risk for oral cancer.\n\n**How to Protect Your Teeth and Gums**\n\nProper dental care can keep your teeth and gums healthy regardless of age. To maintain good oral health:\n\n*   Brush twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.\n*   Floss at least once a day.\n*   See your dentist for regular check-ups.\n*   Avoid sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages.\n*   Do not smoke or use tobacco.\n\nIf medicines are causing dry mouth, talk to your healthcare provider about changing medications or using artificial saliva or other products to help keep your mouth moist.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Teeth and Gums**\n\nAs we age, our bodies undergo various changes that can affect our oral health. In this article, we will discuss how aging can impact our teeth and gums.\n\n**Common Oral Health Problems in Older Adults**\n\nOlder adults are more prone to certain oral health problems due to the natural aging process. These include:\n\n*   **Dry Mouth**: A decrease in saliva production can lead to problems tasting, chewing, and swallowing, as well as an increased risk of gum disease and tooth decay.\n*   **Gum Problems**: Receding gums are common in older adults, making it easy for bacteria to build up and cause inflammation and decay. Gum disease (periodontal disease) is the most common cause of receding gums.\n*   **Cavities**: Dental cavities occur when bacteria in the mouth change sugars and starches from food into acid, attacking tooth enamel and leading to cavities.\n*   **Oral Cancer**: Oral cancer is more common in people older than age 50 and is almost three times greater in men than in women.\n\n**How Age Can Affect Oral Health**\n\nCertain changes occur slowly over time in our bodies as we age:\n\n*   Cells renew at a slower rate\n*   Tissues become thinner and less elastic\n*   Bones become less dense and strong\n*   The immune system can become weaker, so infection can occur more quickly and healing takes longer\n\nThese changes affect tissue and bone in the mouth, increasing the risk for oral health problems in later years.\n\n**Protecting Your Teeth and Gums**\n\nProper dental care is essential to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. This includes:\n\n*   Brushing twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste\n*   Flossing at least once a day\n*   Seeing your dentist for regular check-ups\n*   Avoiding sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages\n*   Not smoking or using tobacco\n\nBy following these tips, you can help protect your teeth and gums from the effects of aging.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Teeth and Gums**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Oral Health Problems in Older Adults**\n\nOlder adults are more at risk for dry mouth. This can occur because of age, medicine use, or certain health conditions.\n\nSaliva plays an important role in maintaining oral health. It protects your teeth from decay and helps your gums stay healthy. When the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva, it can increase the risk for:\n\n*   Problems tasting, chewing, and swallowing\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Gum disease and tooth decay\n*   Yeast infection in the mouth (thrush)\n\nYour mouth may produce a bit less saliva as you get older. But medical problems that occur in older adults are more common causes of dry mouth:\n\nMany medicines, such as some used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pain, and depression, can reduce the amount of saliva you produce. This is probably the most common cause of dry mouth in older adults.\n\nSide effects from cancer treatment can cause dry mouth.\n\nHealth conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and Sjögren syndrome can affect your ability to produce saliva.\n\n**Gum Problems**\n\nReceding gums are common in older adults. This is when the gum tissue pulls away from the tooth, exposing the base, or root, of the tooth. This makes it easy for bacteria to build up and cause inflammation and decay.\n\nA lifetime of brushing too hard can cause gums to recede. However, gum disease (periodontal disease) is the most common cause of receding gums.\n\nGingivitis is an early type of gum disease. It occurs when plaque and tartar build up and irritate and inflame the gums. Severe gum disease is called periodontitis. It can lead to loss of teeth.\n\nCertain conditions and diseases common in older adults can put them at risk for periodontal disease.\n\nNot brushing and flossing every day\nNot getting regular dental care\nSmoking\nDiabetes\nDry mouth\nWeak immune system\n\n**Cavities**\n\nDental cavities occur when bacteria in the mouth (contained in plaque) changes sugars and starches from food into acid. This acid attacks tooth enamel and can lead to cavities.\n\nCavities are common in older adults these days in part because more adults are keeping their teeth for their lifetime. Because older adults often have receding gums, cavities are more likely to develop at the root of the tooth.\n\nDry mouth also causes bacteria to build up in the mouth more easily, leading to tooth decay.\n\n**Oral Cancer**\n\nOral cancer is more common in people older than age 50 and is almost three times greater in men than in women.\n\nSmoking and other types of tobacco use are the most common cause of oral cancer. Drinking alcohol in excess along with tobacco use greatly increases the risk for oral cancer.\n\nOther factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include:\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection (same virus that causes genital warts and several other cancers)\nPoor dental and oral hygiene\nTaking medicines that weaken the immune system (immunosuppressants)\nRubbing from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings over a long period of time\n\n**How to Protect Your Teeth and Gum**\n\nNo matter what your age, proper dental care can keep your teeth and gums healthy.\n\nBrush twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.\nFloss at least once a day.\nSee your dentist for regular check-ups.\nAvoid sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages.\nDo not smoke or use tobacco.\n\nIf medicines are causing dry mouth, talk with your health care provider to see if you may be able to change medicines. Ask about artificial saliva or other products to help keep your mouth moist.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your dentist if you notice:\n\nTooth pain\nRed or swollen gums\nDry mouth\nMouth sores\nWhite or red patches in mouth\nBad breath\nLoose teeth\nPoorly-fitting dentures\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Teeth and Gums**\n\nAs we age, our teeth and gums undergo significant changes that can affect our oral health. In this article, we will discuss the common aging changes in teeth and gums.\n\n**Symptoms to Watch Out For**\n\nIf you notice any of the following symptoms, it's essential to contact your dentist:\n\n*   Tooth pain\n*   Red or swollen gums\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Mouth sores\n*   White or red patches in the mouth\n*   Bad breath\n*   Loose teeth\n*   Poorly-fitting dentures\n\n**Dental Hygiene and Aging**\n\nMaintaining good dental hygiene is crucial as we age. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups can help prevent oral health issues.\n\n**References**\n\nFor more information on aging changes in teeth and gums, refer to the following sources:\n\n*   Hartshorn JE, Gibson G, Niessen LC.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Bones - Muscles - Joints**\n\nChanges in posture and gait (walking pattern) are common with aging.\n\nThe skeleton provides support and structure to the body. Joints are the areas where bones come together. They allow the skeleton to be flexible for movement. In a joint, bones do not directly contact each other. Instead, they are cushioned by cartilage in the joint, synovial membranes around the joint, and fluid.\n\nMuscles provide the force and strength to move the body. Coordination is directed by the brain, but is affected by changes in the muscles and joints. Changes in the muscles, joints, and bones affect the posture and walk, and lead to weakness and slowed movement.\n\n**AGING CHANGES**\n\nPeople lose bone mass or density as they age, especially women after menopause. The bones lose calcium and other minerals.\n\nThe spine is made up of bones called vertebrae. Between each bone is a gel-like cushion (called a disk). With aging, the middle of the body (trunk) becomes shorter as the disks gradually lose fluid and become thinner.\n\nVertebrae also lose some of their mineral content, making each bone thinner. The spinal column becomes curved and compressed (packed together). Bone spurs caused by aging and overall use of the spine may also form on the vertebrae.\n\nThe foot arches become less pronounced, contributing to a slight loss of height.\n\nThe long bones of the arms and legs are more brittle because of mineral loss, but they do not change length. This makes the arms and legs look longer when compared with the shortened trunk.\n\nThe joints become stiffer and less flexible. Fluid in the joints may decrease. The cartilage may begin to rub together and wear away. Minerals may deposit in and around some joints (calcification). This is common around the shoulder.\n\nHip and knee joints may begin to lose cartilage (degenerative changes). The finger joints lose cartilage and the bones thicken slightly. Finger joint changes, most often bony swelling called osteophytes, are more common in women. These changes may be inherited.\n\nLean body mass decreases. This decrease is partly caused by a loss of muscle tissue (atrophy). The speed and amount of muscle changes seem to be caused by genes. Muscle changes often begin in the 20s in men and in the 40s in women.\n\nLipofuscin (an age-related pigment) and fat are deposited in muscle tissue. The muscle fibers shrink. Muscle tissue is replaced more slowly. Lost muscle tissue may be replaced with a tough fibrous tissue. This is most noticeable in the hands, which may look thin and bony.\n\nMuscles are less toned and less able to contract because of changes in the muscle tissue and normal aging changes in the nervous system. Muscles may become rigid with age and may lose tone, even with regular exercise.\n\n**EFFECT OF CHANGES**\n\nBones become more brittle and may break more easily. Overall height decreases, mainly because the trunk and spine shorten.\n\nBreakdown of the joints may lead to inflammation, pain, stiffness, and deformity. Joint changes affect almost all older people. These changes range from minor stiffness to severe arthritis.\n\nThe posture may become more stooped (bent). The knees and hips may become more flexed. The neck may tilt, and the shoulders may narrow while the pelvis becomes wider.\n\nMovement slows and may become limited. The walking pattern (gait) becomes slower and shorter. Walking may become unsteady, and there is less arm swinging. Older people get tired more easily and have less energy.\n\nStrength and endurance change. Loss of muscle mass reduces strength.\n\n**COMMON PROBLEMS**\n\nOsteoporosis is a common problem, especially for older women. Bones break more easily. Compression fractures of the vertebrae can cause pain and reduce mobility.\n\nMuscle weakness contributes to fatigue, weakness, and reduced activity tolerance. Joint problems ranging from mild stiffness to debilitating arthritis (osteoarthritis) are very common.\n\nThe risk of injury increases because gait changes, instability, and loss of balance may lead to falls.\n\nSome older people have reduced reflexes. This is most often caused by changes in the muscles and tendons, rather than changes in the nerves. Decreased knee jerk or ankle jerk reflexes can occur. Some changes, such as a positive Babinski reflex, are not a normal part of aging.\n\nInvoluntary movements (muscle tremors and fine movements called fasciculations) are more common in the older people. Older people who are not active may have weakness or abnormal sensations (paresthesias).\n\nPeople who are unable to move on their own, or who do not stretch their muscles with exercise, may get muscle contractures.\n\n**PREVENTION**\n\nExercise is one of the best ways to slow or prevent problems with the muscles, joints, and bones. A moderate exercise program can help you maintain strength, balance, and flexibility. Exercise helps the bones stay strong.\n\nTalk to your health care provider before starting a new exercise program.\n\nIt is important to eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of calcium. Women need to be particularly careful to get enough calcium and vitamin D as they age. Postmenopausal women and men over age 70 should take in 1,200 mg of calcium per day. Women and men over age 70 should get 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. If you have osteoporosis, talk to your provider about prescription treatments.\n\n**RELATED TOPICS**\n\nAging changes in body shape\nAging changes in hormone production\nAging changes in organs, tissues, and cells\nAging changes in the nervous system\nCalcium in diet\nOsteoporosis\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Bones - Muscles - Joints**\n\nThe skeleton provides support and structure to the body.

In this article, we will explore these changes and discuss how they impact our overall health.\n\n**Changes in the Bones**\n\nOne of the most significant changes that occur with aging is the loss of bone density, also known as osteoporosis. This condition makes our bones more susceptible to fractures, particularly in older adults who are prone to falls. According to Weber TJ, \"Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increased risk of fractures.\" (1)\n\n**Changes in the Muscles**\n\nAs we age, our muscles also undergo significant changes. We lose muscle mass and strength, which can lead to decreased mobility and flexibility. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia, and it can have a significant impact on our overall health.\n\n**Changes in the Joints**\n\nOur joints are also affected by aging. The cartilage that cushions our joints begins to break down, leading to conditions such as osteoarthritis. This condition causes pain and stiffness in the joints, particularly in the hips, knees, and spine.\n\n**Exercise and Flexibility**\n\nWhile these changes can be challenging, there is hope for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Exercise and flexibility are essential for maintaining strong bones, muscles, and joints. Activities such as yoga, swimming, and cycling can help improve flexibility and strength, reducing the risk of age-related diseases.\n\n**References**\n\n(1) Weber TJ. Osteoporosis.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Breast**\n\nWith age, a woman's breasts lose fat, tissue, and mammary glands. Many of these changes are due to the decrease in the body's production of estrogen that occurs at menopause. Without estrogen, the gland tissue shrinks, making the breasts smaller and less full. The connective tissue that supports the breasts becomes less elastic, so the breasts sag.\n\n**Changes in the Nipple**\n\nChanges also occur in the nipple. The area surrounding the nipple (the areola) becomes smaller and may nearly disappear. The nipple may also turn in slightly.\n\n**Breast Lumps**\n\nBreast lumps are common around the time of menopause. These are usually noncancerous cysts. However, if you notice a lump, make an appointment with your health care provider, because breast cancer risk increases with age. Women should be aware of the benefits and limitations of breast self-exams. These exams do not always pick up early stages of breast cancer. Women should talk to their providers about regular physical examinations and mammograms or other imaging to screen for breast cancer.\n\n**References**\n\nDavidson NE.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Face**\n\nThe appearance of the face and neck typically changes with age. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin gives the face a flabby or drooping appearance. In some people, sagging jowls may create the look of a double chin.\n\nYour skin also dries out and the underlying layer of fat shrinks so that your face no longer has a plump, smooth surface. To some extent, wrinkles cannot be avoided. However, sun exposure and cigarette smoking are likely to make them develop more quickly. The number and size of blotches and dark spots on the face increase as well. These pigment changes are largely due to sun exposure.\n\nMissing teeth and receding gums change the appearance of the mouth, so your lips may look shrunken. Loss of bone mass in the jaw reduces the size of the lower face and makes your forehead, nose, and mouth more pronounced. Your nose may also lengthen slightly.\n\nThe ears may lengthen in some people (probably caused by cartilage growth). Men may develop hair in their ears that becomes longer, coarser, and more noticeable as they age. Ear wax becomes drier because there are fewer wax glands in the ears and they produce less oil. The hardened ear wax can block the ear canal and affect your ability to hear.\n\nEyebrows and eyelashes turn gray. As in other parts of the face, the skin around the eyes gets wrinkles, creating crow's feet at the side of the eyes.\n\nFat from the eyelids settles into the eye sockets. This can make your eyes look sunken. The lower eyelids can slacken and bags can develop under your eyes. Weakening of the muscle that supports the upper eyelid can make the eyelids droop. This may limit vision.\n\n**References**\n\n* Brodie SE, Francis JH. Aging and disorders of the eye. In: Fillit HM, Rockwood K, Young J, eds.

In this article, we will explore the various ways in which our faces change as we grow older.\n\n*   **Loss of Muscle Tone**: One of the most noticeable effects of aging on the face is the loss of muscle tone. As we age, our facial muscles become weaker, causing our skin to sag and lose its firmness.\n*   **Thinning Skin**: Another effect of aging on the face is the thinning of the skin. As we age, our skin becomes thinner and more fragile, making it more prone to wrinkles and fine lines.\n*   **Wrinkles and Fine Lines**: Wrinkles and fine lines are a natural part of the aging process. However, they can be exacerbated by factors such as sun exposure and cigarette smoking.\n*   **Bags Under the Eyes**: As we age, our eyelids become weaker, causing bags to form under our eyes. This can make us look tired and older than we actually are.\n*   **Drooping Eyelids**: Weakening of the muscle that supports the upper eyelid can cause it to droop, which may limit vision.\n*   **Grayish-White Ring on Cornea**: The outer surface of the eye (cornea) may develop a grayish-white ring as we age.\n*   **Loss of Pigmentation in Iris**: The colored portion of the eye (iris) loses pigment as we age, giving many older people the appearance of having gray or light blue eyes.\n\n**Changes in Face with Age**\n\nThe changes that occur in our faces as we age can be both subtle and dramatic. Some of the most noticeable changes include:\n\n*   **Loss of Facial Fat**: As we age, our facial fat begins to break down, causing our face to appear thinner and more gaunt.\n*   **Sagging Jowls**: The loss of muscle tone in our faces causes our jowls to sag, giving us a double chin-like appearance.\n*   **Lengthening of the Nose**: As we age, our nose begins to lengthen slightly due to the loss of bone mass in the jaw.\n*   **Ear Changes**: Our ears may lengthen as we age due to cartilage growth. Men may also develop hair in their ears that becomes longer, coarser, and more noticeable with age.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on the topic of aging changes in the face, please see the following references:\n\n*   Brodie SE, Francis JH.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Female Reproductive System**\n\nAs women age, their reproductive systems undergo significant changes due to declining hormone levels. One clear sign of aging is when menstrual periods stop permanently, marking menopause.\n\n**Perimenopause**\n\nThe time leading up to menopause is called perimenopause, which can begin several years before the last menstrual period. Signs of perimenopause include:\n\n*   More frequent periods at first, followed by occasional missed periods\n*   Periods that are longer or shorter\n*   Changes in the amount of menstrual flow\n\nAs hormone levels decrease, physical changes occur in the reproductive tract.\n\n**Menopause**\n\nMenopause is a normal part of a woman's aging process, typically occurring around age 50. With menopause:\n\n*   The ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone.\n*   Egg release ceases, making pregnancy impossible after menopause.\n*   Menstrual periods cease; confirmation of menopause requires no periods for 1 year.\n\nOther changes include:\n\n*   Thinning, drying, and irritation of vaginal walls\n*   Increased risk of vaginal yeast infections\n*   Decreased external genital tissue, potentially leading to irritation\n\nCommon changes associated with menopause include:\n\n*   Hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, and sleep disturbances\n*   Problems with short-term memory\n*   Decrease in breast tissue\n*   Lowered sex drive and sexual response\n*   Increased risk of osteoporosis\n*   Urinary system changes, such as frequency and urgency\n*   Loss of tone in pubic muscles, potentially leading to prolapse\n\n**Managing Changes**\n\nHormone therapy with estrogen or progesterone may help alleviate menopause symptoms like hot flashes or vaginal dryness. However, hormone therapy is not suitable for every woman due to risks. Discuss the benefits and risks with your provider.\n\nTo manage problems like painful intercourse, consider using lubricants during sex, vaginal moisturizers, or applying topical estrogen to thicken vaginal tissues and increase moisture and sensitivity. Your provider can help determine the best course of action for you.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\nRegular exercise, a balanced diet, and staying engaged in social activities can help the aging process unfold more smoothly.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Female Reproductive System**\n\nAs women age, their reproductive systems undergo significant changes due to declining hormone levels. One clear sign of aging is when menstrual periods stop permanently, known as menopause.\n\n**Perimenopause**\n\nThe time before menopause is called perimenopause, which may begin several years before the last menstrual period. Signs of perimenopause include:\n\n*   More frequent periods at first\n*   Occasional missed periods\n*   Periods that are longer or shorter\n*   Changes in the amount of menstrual flow\n\nEventually, periods become much less frequent until they stop completely.\n\n**Physical Changes**\n\nAlong with changes in periods, physical changes occur in the reproductive tract. These include:\n\n*   Vaginal walls becoming thinner, dryer, less elastic, and possibly irritated\n*   Increased risk for vaginal yeast infections\n*   External genital tissue decreasing and thinning, and becoming irritated\n\nOther common changes include:\n\n*   Menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, moodiness, headaches, and trouble sleeping\n*   Problems with short-term memory\n*   Decrease in breast tissue\n*   Lower sex drive (libido) and sexual response\n*   Increased risk for bone loss (osteoporosis)\n*   Urinary system changes, such as frequency and urgency of urination and increased risk for urinary tract infection\n*   Loss of tone in the pubic muscles, resulting in the vagina, uterus, or urinary bladder falling out of position (prolapse)\n\n**Managing Changes**\n\nHormone therapy with estrogen or progesterone may help menopause symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. Most women who have a uterus will require progesterone as well as estrogen. Women without a uterus may take estrogen only. Hormone therapy has risks, so it is not for every woman. Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with your provider.\n\nTo help manage problems such as painful sexual intercourse, use a lubricant during sexual intercourse. Vaginal moisturizers are available without a prescription. These can help with vaginal and vulvar discomfort due to the drying and thinning of tissues. Applying topical estrogen inside the vagina may help thicken the vaginal tissues and increase moisture and sensitivity. Your provider can tell you if any of these measures is right for you.\n\nGetting regular exercise, eating healthy foods, and staying involved in activities with friends and loved ones can help the aging process go more smoothly.\n\n**Other Aging Changes**\n\nOther aging changes to expect include:\n\n*   Hormone production\n*   Organs, tissues, and cells\n*   Breasts\n*   Kidneys\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Female Reproductive System**\n\n\\n\\nAs women age, their reproductive systems undergo significant changes. One of the most notable effects of aging is the decline in estrogen levels, which can lead to a range of symptoms and health issues.\n\n**Estrogen Deficiency**\n\nEstrogen deficiency is a common consequence of menopause, but it can also occur in younger women due to various medical conditions or treatments such as chemotherapy or surgery. The effects of estrogen deficiency can be far-reaching, impacting not only reproductive health but also overall well-being.\n\n**Effects of Hormone Therapy**\n\nHormone therapy has been widely used to alleviate symptoms associated with menopause and estrogen deficiency. However, the effectiveness and safety of hormone therapy are still debated among medical professionals. Some studies suggest that hormone therapy may provide relief from hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, while others raise concerns about increased risks of breast cancer, blood clots, and stroke.\n\n**Other Treatment Options**\n\nIn addition to hormone therapy, other treatment options are available for women experiencing symptoms related to estrogen deficiency. These may include:\n\n*   *Vaginal estrogen creams or tablets*: To alleviate vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex\n*   *Systemic estrogen therapy*: For women who cannot use vaginal estrogen due to certain medical conditions or preferences\n*   *Non-hormonal medications*: Such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to manage hot flashes and other symptoms\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on this topic, consider the following references:\n\n*   Lobo RA.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Heart and Blood Vessels**\n\nSome changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age. However, many other changes that are common with aging are due to or worsened by modifiable factors. If not treated, these can lead to heart disease.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n\nBlood flows out of the heart, first through the aorta, and then through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.\n\nCapillaries are where the blood gives up (releases) oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.\n\n**Aging Changes**\n\n* **Heart:**\n\t+ The natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits.\n\t+ The sinoatrial or SA node loses some of its cells, resulting in a slightly slower heart rate.\n\t+ A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle occurs in some people.\n\t+ The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size.\n\t+ Heart changes often cause the electrocardiogram (ECG) of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult.\n\t+ Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people.\n\t+ Deposits of the \"aging pigment,\" lipofuscin occur in the heart muscle cells.\n\t+ The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer.\n* **Blood Vessels:**\n\t+ Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging.\n\t+ This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing.\n\t+ The capillary walls thicken slightly, causing a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.\n\t+ The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible.\n* **Blood:**\n\t+ Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.\n\t+ The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced.\n\t+ Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (neutrophils) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria.\n\n**Effect of Changes**\n\nNormally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.\n\nSome of the things that make your heart work harder are:\n\nCertain medicines\nEmotional stress\nPhysical exertion\nIllness\nInfections\nInjuries\nCaffeine and other stimulants in the diet\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nAngina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease.\nAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.\nAnemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines.\nAtherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and may totally block blood vessels.\nCongestive heart failure is also very common in older people. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.\nCoronary artery disease is fairly common. It is usually a result of atherosclerosis.\nHigh blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Older people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their health care provider to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall.\nHeart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in older adults.\nTransient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.\nEat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking.\nMen age 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta usually with an ultrasound exam.\n\nGet more exercise:\n\nExercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar.\nExercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress.\nModerate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly.\nPeople who exercise often have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease.\n\nHave regular check-ups for your heart:\n\nHave your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.\nIf your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Heart and Blood Vessels**\n\nSome changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age.

    "content": "**Aging Changes and Their Effects on the Kidneys and Bladder**\n\nAs you age, your kidneys and bladder change. This can affect their function.\n\n**Changes in the Kidneys that Occur with Age:**\n\n*   Amount of kidney tissue decreases and kidney function diminishes.\n*   Number of filtering units (nephrons) decreases. Nephrons filter waste material from the blood.\n*   Blood vessels supplying the kidneys can become hardened. This causes the kidneys to filter blood more slowly.\n\n**Changes in the Bladder:**\n\n*   The bladder wall changes. The elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy. The bladder cannot hold as much urine as before.\n*   The bladder muscles weaken.\n*   The urethra can become partially or totally blocked. In women, this can be due to weakened muscles that cause the bladder or vagina to fall out of position (prolapse). In men, the urethra can become blocked by an enlarged prostate gland.\n\n**Common Problems:**\n\nAging increases the risk of kidney and bladder problems such as:\n\n*   Bladder control issues, such as leakage or urinary incontinence (not being able to hold your urine), or urinary retention (not being able to completely empty your bladder)\n*   Bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n*   Chronic kidney disease\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional:**\n\nContact your health care provider right away if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Signs of a urinary tract infection, including fever or chills, burning when urinating, nausea and vomiting, extreme tiredness, or flank pain\n*   Very dark urine or fresh blood in the urine\n*   Trouble urinating\n*   Urinating more often than usual (polyuria)\n*   Sudden need to urinate (urinary urgency)\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Kidneys and Bladder**\n\nAs you grow older, your kidneys and bladder undergo significant changes that can affect their function. In this article, we will explore these changes and discuss how they impact kidney function and bladder control.\n\n**Changes in the Kidneys**\n\nWith age, the kidneys undergo a range of changes that can impact their function. These changes include:\n\n*   **Decline in kidney function**: In a healthy aging person, kidney function declines very slowly. However, illness, medicines, and other conditions can significantly degrade kidney function.\n*   **Changes in kidney structure**: The kidneys themselves change with age, becoming less efficient at filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\n**Changes in the Bladder**\n\nThe bladder also undergoes significant changes with age, including:\n\n*   **Muscle changes**: Muscle changes and changes in the reproductive system can affect bladder control.\n*   **Prostate gland enlargement**: In men, an enlarged prostate gland can block the flow of urine, leading to urinary retention.\n*   **Prolapse**: In women, weakened muscles can cause the bladder or vagina to fall out of position, leading to prolapse.\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nAging increases the risk of kidney and bladder problems such as:\n\n*   **Bladder control issues**: Bladder control issues, such as leakage or urinary incontinence (not being able to hold your urine), or urinary retention (not being able to completely empty your bladder)\n*   **Urinary tract infections**: Bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n*   **Chronic kidney disease**: Chronic kidney disease\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider right away if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Signs of a urinary tract infection, including fever or chills, burning when urinating, nausea and vomiting, extreme tiredness, or flank pain\n*   Very dark urine or fresh blood in the urine\n*   Trouble urinating\n*   Urinating more often than usual (polyuria)\n*   Sudden need to urinate (urinary urgency)",

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Your Body and Their Effects on the Lungs**\n\nAs we age, our bodies undergo various changes that can affect our lungs. In this article, we'll explore these changes and how they impact our respiratory system.\n\n**Changes to the Bones and Muscles of the Chest and Spine**\n\n*   Bones become thinner and change shape, which can alter the shape of your ribcage.\n*   The muscle that supports breathing, the diaphragm, becomes weakened.\n\nThese changes can lower oxygen levels in the body and reduce carbon dioxide removal, leading to symptoms like tiredness and shortness of breath.\n\n**Changes to Lung Tissue**\n\n*   Muscles and other tissues near airways lose their ability to keep them completely open.\n*   Aging causes air sacs to lose shape and become baggy.\n\nThese changes can allow air to get trapped in the lungs, making it hard to breathe due to insufficient oxygen and carbon dioxide removal.\n\n**Changes to the Nervous System**\n\n*   The part of the brain controlling breathing may lose function, weakening automatic breathing functions.\n*   Nerves that trigger coughing become less sensitive, making it harder to expel particles like smoke or germs.\n\nThese changes can lead to breathing difficulties due to inadequate oxygen intake and carbon dioxide removal.\n\n**Changes to the Immune System**\n\n*   The immune system weakens, making it harder for the body to fight lung infections and diseases.\n*   Lungs are less able to recover from exposure to harmful particles like smoke.\n\nAs a result of these changes, older individuals are at increased risk for lung infections, shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, and abnormal breathing patterns that can lead to problems like sleep apnea.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Lungs**\n\nAs we age, our lungs undergo significant changes that can affect their function and overall health. In this article, we'll explore these changes and discuss how to prevent or mitigate their effects.\n\n**The Lungs' Main Functions**\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of aging changes, let's quickly review the lungs' two main functions:\n\n*   Getting oxygen from the air into the body\n*   Removing carbon dioxide from the body\n\nOur bodies need oxygen to work properly, and carbon dioxide is a gas produced when we use oxygen.\n\n**Aging Changes in the Lungs**\n\nNow, let's discuss the changes that occur in our lungs as we age:\n\n### **Changes to the Bones and Muscles of the Chest and Spine**\n\nAs we age, our bones become thinner and change shape. This can alter the shape of our ribcage, making it harder for our lungs to expand and contract during breathing. Additionally, the muscle that supports our breathing, the diaphragm, becomes weakened. This weakness may prevent us from breathing enough air in or out.\n\nThese changes in our bones and muscles may lower the oxygen level in our body. Also, less carbon dioxide may be removed from our body. Symptoms such as tiredness and shortness of breath can result.\n\n### **Changes to Lung Tissue**\n\nMuscles and other tissues near our airways may lose their ability to keep the airways completely open. This causes the airways to close easily. Aging also causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become baggy.\n\nThese changes in lung tissue can allow air to get trapped in our lungs. Too little oxygen may enter our blood vessels, and less carbon dioxide may be removed. This makes it hard to breathe.\n\n### **Changes to the Nervous System**\n\nThe part of our brain that controls breathing may lose some of its function, weakening the automatic breathing functions. When this happens, our lungs are not able to get enough oxygen. Not enough carbon dioxide may leave the lungs. Breathing may get more difficult.\n\n### **Changes to the Immune System**\n\nOur immune system can get weaker as we age. This means our body is less able to fight lung infections and other diseases. Our lungs are also less able to recover after exposure to smoke or other harmful particles.\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nAs a result of these changes, older people are at increased risk for:\n\n*   Lung infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Low oxygen level\n*   Abnormal breathing patterns, resulting in problems such as sleep apnea (episodes of stopped breathing during sleep)\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo decrease the effects of aging on the lungs:\n\n1.  **Do not smoke. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke.** Smoking and smoke exposure harm the lungs and speeds up lung aging.\n2.  **Do physical exercise to improve lung function.**\n3.  **Get up and move.** Lying in bed or sitting for long periods allows mucus to collect in the lungs. This puts you at risk of lung infections. This is especially true right after surgery or when you are ill.\n\nBy following these tips, we can help mitigate the effects of aging on our lungs and maintain overall health and well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Lungs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Age-Related Changes in Lung Tissue**\n\nAs we age, our lungs undergo significant changes that can impact our respiratory health. One of the key changes is the loss of elasticity in the lungs, making it harder to breathe and increasing the risk of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Impact on Respiratory Function**\n\nAging also affects the respiratory system's ability to exchange gases. The diaphragm becomes less efficient, and the lungs become less compliant, leading to a decrease in vital capacity and forced expiratory volume.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Changes in Lung Tissue**\n\nStudies have shown that lung tissue undergoes significant changes with age, including:\n\n*   Loss of respiratory cilia\n*   Decreased lung elasticity\n*   Increased risk of lung diseases such as COPD\n\nThese changes can have a significant impact on our respiratory health and overall quality of life.",

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Male Reproductive System**\n\nUnlike women, men do not experience a major, rapid change in fertility as they age (like menopause). Instead, changes occur gradually during a process that some people call andropause.\n\n**Information**\n\nAging changes in the male reproductive system occur primarily in the testes. Testicular tissue mass decreases. The level of the male sex hormone, testosterone decreases gradually. There may be problems getting an erection. This is a general slowing, instead of a complete lack of function.\n\n**Fertility**\n\nThe tubes that carry sperm may become less elastic (a process called sclerosis). The testes continue to produce sperm, but the rate of sperm cell production slows. The epididymis, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland lose some of their surface cells. But they continue to produce the fluid that helps carry sperm.\n\n**Urinary Function**\n\nThe prostate gland enlarges with age as some of the prostate tissue is replaced with a scar like tissue. This condition, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), affects about 50% of men. BPH may cause problems with slowed urination and ejaculation.\n\nIn both men and women, reproductive system changes are closely related to changes in the urinary system.\n\n**Effect of Changes**\n\nFertility varies from man to man. Age does not predict male fertility. Prostate function does not affect fertility. A man can father children, even if his prostate gland has been removed. Some fairly old men can (and do) father children.\n\nThe volume of fluid ejaculated usually remains the same, but there are fewer living sperm in the fluid.\n\nSome men may have a lower sex drive (libido). Sexual responses may become slower and less intense. This may be related to a decreased testosterone level. It may also result from psychological or social changes due to aging (such as the lack of a willing partner), illness, long-term (chronic) conditions, or medicines.\n\nAging by itself does not prevent a man from being able to enjoy sexual relationships.\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) may be a concern for aging men. It is normal for erections to occur less often than when a man was younger. Aging men are often less able to have repeated ejaculations.\n\n**Prevention and Related Topics**\n\nMany physical age-related changes, such as prostate enlargement or testicular atrophy, are not preventable. Getting treated for health disorders such as high blood pressure and diabetes may prevent problems with urinary and sexual function.\n\nChanges in sexual response are most often related to factors other than simple aging. Older men are more likely to have good sex if they continue to be sexually active during middle age.\n\n**References**\n\nBrinton RD. Neuroendocrinology of aging.

They control your body's:\n\n* Movements\n* Senses\n* Thoughts and memories\n\nThey also help control the organs such as your heart and bowels.\n\nNerves are the pathways that carry signals to and from your brain and the rest of your body. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerves that runs from your brain down the center of your back. Nerves extend out from the spinal cord to every part of your body.\n\n**Aging Changes and Their Effects on the Nervous System**\n\nAs you age, your brain and nervous system go through natural changes. Your brain and spinal cord lose nerve cells and weight (atrophy). Nerve cells may begin to pass messages more slowly than in the past. Waste products or other chemicals such as beta amyloid can collect in the brain tissue as nerve cells break down. This can cause abnormal changes in the brain called plaques and tangles to form. A fatty brown pigment (lipofuscin) can also build up in nerve tissue.\n\nBreakdown of nerves can affect your senses. You might have reduced or lost reflexes or sensation.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs you age, the way your senses (hearing, vision, taste, smell, touch) give you information about the world changes. Your senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details.\n\n**Sensory Changes Can Affect Lifestyle**\n\nSensory changes can affect your lifestyle. You may have problems communicating, enjoying activities, and staying involved with people. Sensory changes can lead to isolation.\n\n**How the Senses Work**\n\nYour senses receive information from your environment. This information can be in the form of sound, light, smells, tastes, and touch. Sensory information is converted into nerve signals that are carried to the brain. There, the signals are turned into meaningful sensations.\n\n**Threshold for Sensation**\n\nA certain amount of stimulation is required before you become aware of a sensation. This minimum level of sensation is called the threshold. Aging raises this threshold. You need more stimulation to be aware of the sensation.\n\n**Hearing**\n\nYour ears have two jobs. One is hearing and the other is maintaining balance. Hearing occurs after sound vibrations cross the eardrum to the inner ear. The vibrations are changed into nerve signals in the inner ear and are carried to the brain by the auditory nerve.\n\n* **Age-Related Hearing Loss**: Presbycusis affects both ears equally, causing a decline in hearing, particularly high-frequency sounds.\n* **Tinnitus**: Persistent, abnormal ear noise is common in older adults, often caused by wax buildup, medicines, or mild hearing loss.\n* **Ear Wax**: Impacted ear wax can cause trouble hearing and is common with age.\n\n**Vision**\n\nVision occurs when light is processed by your eye and interpreted by your brain. Light passes through the transparent eye surface (cornea) and reaches the lens, which focuses light on your retina (the back of the eye).\n\n* **Age-Related Vision Changes**: The cornea becomes less sensitive, pupils decrease in size, and the lens becomes yellowed, less flexible, and slightly cloudy.\n* **Presbyopia**: Difficulty focusing the eyes on close-up objects, often corrected with reading glasses or bifocal glasses.\n* **Glare**: Reduced ability to tolerate glare, making it difficult to drive at night.\n\n**Taste and Smell**\n\nThe senses of taste and smell work together. Most tastes are linked with odors.\n\n* **Age-Related Taste and Smell Changes**: Decreased number of taste buds, shrinking of remaining taste buds, reduced sensitivity to the five tastes, and diminished sense of smell.\n* **Factors Affecting Taste and Smell**: Diseases, smoking, and exposure to harmful particles in the air can speed up the loss of taste and smell.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs you grow older, the way your senses (hearing, vision, taste, smell, touch) give you information about the world changes. Your senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details.\n\n**Decreased Taste and Smell**\n\nDecreased taste and smell can lessen your interest and enjoyment in eating. You may not be able to sense certain dangers if you cannot smell odors such as natural gas or smoke from a fire.\n\nIf your senses of taste and smell have diminished, talk to your provider. The following may help:\n\n* Switch to a different medicine, if the medicine you take is affecting your ability to smell and taste.\n* Use different spices or change the way you prepare food.\n* Buy safety products, such as a gas detector that sounds an alarm you can hear.\n\n**TOUCH, VIBRATION, AND PAIN**\n\nThe sense of touch makes you aware of pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, and body position. Skin, muscles, tendons, joints, and internal organs have nerve endings (receptors) that detect these sensations. Some receptors give the brain information about the position and condition of internal organs.\n\nWith aging, sensations may be reduced or changed. These changes can occur because of decreased blood flow to the nerve endings or to the spinal cord or brain. The spinal cord transmits nerve signals and the brain interprets these signals.\n\nHealth problems, such as a lack of certain nutrients, can also cause sensation changes. Brain surgery, problems in the brain, confusion, and nerve damage from injury or long-term (chronic) diseases such as diabetes can also result in sensation changes.\n\nSymptoms of changed sensation vary based on the type that is affected. With decreased temperature sensitivity, it can be hard to tell the difference between cool and cold and hot and warm. This can increase the risk of injury from frostbite, hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature), and burns.\n\nReduced ability to detect vibration, touch, and pressure increases the risk of injuries, including pressure ulcers (skin sores that develop when pressure cuts off blood supply to the area). After age 50, many people have reduced sensitivity to pain. Or, you may feel and recognize pain, but it does not bother you.\n\nYou may develop problems walking because of reduced ability to perceive where your body is in relation to the floor. This increases your risk of falling, a common problem for older people.\n\nOlder people can become more sensitive to light touches because their skin is thinner.\n\nIf you have noticed changes in touch, pain, or problems standing or walking, talk with your provider. There may be ways to manage the symptoms.\n\nThe following measures can help you stay safe:\n\n* Lower the water heater temperature to no higher than 120°F (49°C) to avoid burns.\n* Check the thermometer to decide how to dress, rather than waiting until you feel overheated or chilled.\n* Inspect your skin, especially your feet, for injuries. If you find an injury, treat it. Do not assume the injury is not serious because the area is not painful.\n\n**OTHER CHANGES**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n* In organs, tissues, and cells\n* In skin\n* In the bones, muscles, and joints\n* In the face\n* In the nervous system\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs we age, our senses undergo significant changes that can impact our quality of life.\n\n**HEARING**\n\n*   Age-related hearing loss is common, affecting 1 in 5 people over 50.\n*   The ability to detect high-frequency sounds decreases with age.\n*   Tinnitus, a ringing or buzzing sound in the ear, affects many older adults.\n*   Impacted ear wax can cause trouble hearing and is common with age.\n\n**VISION**\n\n*   The cornea becomes less sensitive, making eye injuries harder to detect.\n*   Pupils may decrease in size and react more slowly to darkness or bright light.\n*   The lens becomes yellowed, less flexible, and slightly cloudy, leading to cataracts.\n*   Presbyopia, a condition causing difficulty focusing on close-up objects, is common.\n\n**TASTE AND SMELL**\n\n*   The number of taste buds decreases with age, affecting sensitivity to the five tastes.\n*   Saliva production decreases, causing dry mouth and affecting taste.\n*   The sense of smell can diminish, especially after age 70, due to nerve ending loss and reduced mucus production.\n\n**TOUCH, VIBRATION, AND PAIN**\n\n*   Sensations may be reduced or changed with aging, due to decreased blood flow or health problems.\n*   Decreased temperature sensitivity increases the risk of injuries from frostbite, hypothermia, and burns.\n*   Reduced ability to detect vibration, touch, and pressure increases the risk of injuries, including pressure ulcers.\n\nThese changes can impact our daily lives, making it essential to discuss any vision, hearing, taste, smell, or sensation changes with a healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs you age, the way your senses give you information about the world changes. Your senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details.\n\n**Sensory Changes Can Affect Your Lifestyle**\n\nYou may have problems communicating, enjoying activities, and staying involved with people. Sensory changes can lead to isolation.\n\n**Your Senses Receive Information from Your Environment**\n\nThis information can be in the form of sound, light, smells, tastes, and touch. Sensory information is converted into nerve signals that are carried to the brain. There, the signals are turned into meaningful sensations.\n\n**Aging Raises the Threshold**\n\nA certain amount of stimulation is required before you become aware of a sensation. This minimum level of sensation is called the threshold. Aging raises this threshold. You need more stimulation to be aware of the sensation.\n\n**Hearing**\n\nYour ears have two jobs: hearing and maintaining balance. Hearing occurs after sound vibrations cross the eardrum to the inner ear. The vibrations are changed into nerve signals in the inner ear and are carried to the brain by the auditory nerve.\n\n* Age-related hearing loss is called presbycusis.\n* It affects both ears equally.\n* Hearing, particularly the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, may decline.\n* You may also have trouble telling the difference between certain sounds.\n* Or, you may have problems hearing a conversation when there is background noise.\n\n**Vision**\n\nVision occurs when light is processed by your eye and interpreted by your brain. Light passes through the transparent eye surface (cornea). It continues through the pupil, the opening to the inside of the eye. The colored part of the eye is called the iris. It is a muscle that controls pupil size.\n\n* The cornea becomes less sensitive, so you might not notice eye injuries.\n* By the time you turn 60, your pupils may decrease to about one third of the size they were when you were 20.\n* The lens becomes yellowed, less flexible, and slightly cloudy leading to the development of cataracts.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n* In organs, tissues, and cells\n* In skin\n* In the bones, muscles, and joints\n* In the face\n* In the nervous system\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\n**Visual Changes**\n\nWeakened eye muscles may prevent you from moving your eyes in all directions. It may be hard to look upward. The area in which objects can be seen (visual field) gets smaller.\n\nAging eyes also may not produce enough tears. This leads to dry eyes which may be uncomfortable. When dry eyes are not treated, infection, inflammation, and scarring of the cornea can occur. You can relieve dry eyes by using eye drops or artificial tears.\n\nThe upper eyelids may sag because of weakened muscular support. This may lead to visual loss if the sagging is severe.\n\nCommon eye disorders that cause vision changes that are NOT normal include:\n\n* Cataracts -- clouding of the lens of the eye\n* Glaucoma -- rise in fluid pressure in the eye\n* Macular degeneration -- disease in the macula (responsible for central vision) that causes vision loss\n* Retinopathy -- disease in the retina often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure\n\nIf you are having vision problems, discuss your symptoms with your provider. Visual loss is associated with an increased chance of developing dementia.\n\n**Taste and Smell**\n\nThe senses of taste and smell work together. Most tastes are linked with odors. The sense of smell begins at the nerve endings high in the lining of the nose.\n\nWatch this video about: Smelling\n\nYou have about 10,000 taste buds. Your taste buds sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami flavors. Umami is a taste linked with foods that contain glutamate, such as the seasoning monosodium glutamate (MSG).\n\nSmell and taste play a role in food enjoyment and safety. A delicious meal or pleasant aroma can improve social interaction and enjoyment of life. Smell and taste also allow you to detect danger, such as spoiled food, gases, and smoke.\n\nThe number of taste buds decreases as you age. Each remaining taste bud also begins to shrink. Sensitivity to the five tastes often declines after age 60. In addition, your mouth produces less saliva as you age. This can cause dry mouth, which can affect your sense of taste.\n\nWatch this video about: Tasting\n\nYour sense of smell can also diminish, especially after age 70. This may be related to a loss of nerve endings and less mucus production in the nose. Mucus helps odors stay in the nose long enough to be detected by the nerve endings. It also helps clear odors from the nerve endings.\n\nCertain things can speed up the loss of taste and smell. These include diseases, smoking, and exposure to harmful particles in the air.\n\nDecreased taste and smell can lessen your interest and enjoyment in eating. You may not be able to sense certain dangers if you cannot smell odors such as natural gas or smoke from a fire.\n\nIf your senses of taste and smell have diminished, talk to your provider. The following may help:\n\n* Switch to a different medicine, if the medicine you take is affecting your ability to smell and taste.\n* Use different spices or change the way you prepare food.\n* Buy safety products, such as a gas detector that sounds an alarm you can hear.\n\n**Touch, Vibration, and Pain**\n\nThe sense of touch makes you aware of pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, and body position. Skin, muscles, tendons, joints, and internal organs have nerve endings (receptors) that detect these sensations. Some receptors give the brain information about the position and condition of internal organs. Though you may not be aware of this information, it helps to identify changes (for example, the pain of appendicitis).\n\nYour brain interprets the type and amount of touch sensation. It also interprets the sensation as pleasant (such as being comfortably warm), unpleasant (such as being very hot), or neutral (such as being aware that you are touching something).\n\nWatch this video about: Feeling pain\n\nWith aging, sensations may be reduced or changed. These changes can occur because of decreased blood flow to the nerve endings or to the spinal cord or brain. The spinal cord transmits nerve signals and the brain interprets these signals.\n\nHealth problems, such as a lack of certain nutrients, can also cause sensation changes. Brain surgery, problems in the brain, confusion, and nerve damage from injury or long-term (chronic) diseases such as diabetes can also result in sensation changes.\n\nSymptoms of changed sensation vary based on the type that is affected. With decreased temperature sensitivity, it can be hard to tell the difference between cool and cold and hot and warm. This can increase the risk of injury from frostbite, hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature), and burns.\n\nReduced ability to detect vibration, touch, and pressure increases the risk of injuries, including pressure ulcers (skin sores that develop when pressure cuts off blood supply to the area). After age 50, many people have reduced sensitivity to pain. Or, you may feel and recognize pain, but it does not bother you. For example, when you are injured, you may not know how severe the injury is because the pain does not trouble you.\n\nYou may develop problems walking because of reduced ability to perceive where your body is in relation to the floor. This increases your risk of falling, a common problem for older people.\n\nOlder people can become more sensitive to light touches because their skin is thinner.\n\nIf you have noticed changes in touch, pain, or problems standing or walking, talk with your provider. There may be ways to manage the symptoms.\n\nThe following measures can help you stay safe:\n\n* Lower the water heater temperature to no higher than 120°F (49°C) to avoid burns.\n* Check the thermometer to decide how to dress, rather than waiting until you feel overheated or chilled.\n* Inspect your skin, especially your feet, for injuries. If you find an injury, treat it. Do not assume the injury is not serious because the area is not painful.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\nNote: The above text has been cleaned and formatted according to the provided rules.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n* In organs, tissues, and cells\n* In skin\n* In the bones, muscles, and joints\n* In the face\n* In the nervous system\n\nYour senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details. Sensory changes can affect your lifestyle. You may have problems communicating, enjoying activities, and staying involved with people. Sensory changes can lead to isolation.\n\n**How Your Senses Work**\n\nYour senses receive information from your environment. This information can be in the form of sound, light, smells, tastes, and touch. Sensory information is converted into nerve signals that are carried to the brain. There, the signals are turned into meaningful sensations.\n\nA certain amount of stimulation is required before you become aware of a sensation. This minimum level of sensation is called the threshold. Aging raises this threshold. You need more stimulation to be aware of the sensation.\n\n**Hearing**\n\nYour ears have two jobs. One is hearing and the other is maintaining balance. Hearing occurs after sound vibrations cross the eardrum to the inner ear. The vibrations are changed into nerve signals in the inner ear and are carried to the brain by the auditory nerve.\n\nAs you age, structures inside the ear start to change and their functions decline. Your ability to pick up sounds decreases. You may also have problems maintaining your balance as you sit, stand, and walk.\n\nAge-related hearing loss is called presbycusis. It affects both ears equally. Hearing, particularly the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, may decline. You may also have trouble telling the difference between certain sounds. Or, you may have problems hearing a conversation when there is background noise.\n\nIf you are having trouble hearing, discuss your symptoms with your health care provider. Even mild hearing loss has been associated with a higher chance of developing dementia. One way to manage hearing loss is by getting fitted with hearing aids.\n\n**Vision**\n\nVision occurs when light is processed by your eye and interpreted by your brain. Light passes through the transparent eye surface (cornea). It continues through the pupil, the opening to the inside of the eye. The pupil becomes larger or smaller to control the amount of light that enters the eye.\n\nThe colored part of the eye is called the iris. It is a muscle that controls pupil size. After light passes through your pupil, it reaches the lens. The lens focuses light on your retina (the back of the eye). The retina converts light energy into a nerve signal that the optic nerve carries to the brain, where it is interpreted.\n\nAs you age, the sharpness of your vision (visual acuity) gradually declines. The most common problem is difficulty focusing the eyes on close-up objects. This condition is called presbyopia. Reading glasses, bifocal glasses, or contact lenses can help correct presbyopia.\n\nYou may be less able to tolerate glare. For example, glare from a shiny floor in a sunlit room can make it difficult to get around indoors. You may have trouble adapting to darkness or bright light. Problems with glare, brightness, and darkness may cause problems driving at night.\n\n**Taste and Smell**\n\nThe senses of taste and smell work together. Most tastes are linked with odors. The sense of smell begins at the nerve endings high in the lining of the nose.\n\nYou have about 10,000 taste buds. Your taste buds sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami flavors.

This may be related to a loss of nerve endings and less mucus production in the nose. Mucus helps odors stay in the nose long enough to be detected by the nerve endings. It also helps clear odors from the nerve endings.\n\nCertain things can speed up the loss of taste and smell.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in the Senses**\n\nAs we age, our senses undergo significant changes that can impact our quality of life. In this article, we'll explore the changes that occur in our sense of smell, taste, touch, vibration, and pain.\n\n**The Sense of Smell**\n\nOur sense of smell is closely linked to our sense of taste. As we age, the mucous membranes in our noses become thinner, making it harder for odors to bind to them. This can lead to a decrease in our ability to detect smells. Certain diseases, smoking, and exposure to harmful particles in the air can also speed up the loss of smell.\n\n**The Sense of Taste**\n\nOur sense of taste is also affected by aging. The taste buds on our tongues become less sensitive, making it harder for us to detect different flavors. This can lead to a decrease in our interest and enjoyment in eating. If you're experiencing a diminished sense of taste or smell, talk to your provider about ways to manage the symptoms.\n\n**Touch, Vibration, and Pain**\n\nOur sense of touch makes us aware of pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, and body position. As we age, sensations may be reduced or changed due to decreased blood flow to the nerve endings or to the spinal cord or brain. Health problems, such as a lack of certain nutrients, can also cause sensation changes.\n\n**Changes in Touch**\n\nWith aging, you may experience changes in touch, including:\n\n* Reduced sensitivity to pain\n* Increased risk of injuries, such as pressure ulcers and frostbite\n* Decreased ability to detect vibration and pressure\n* Problems walking due to reduced ability to perceive body position\n\nIf you've noticed any of these changes, talk to your provider about ways to manage the symptoms.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs we age, we experience other changes in our senses, including:\n\n* Aging changes in hearing\n* Hearing aids\n* Tongue changes\n* Sense of sight changes\n* Aged eye anatomy\n\nIt's essential to be aware of these changes and take steps to prevent or manage them. By understanding the aging process, we can take proactive measures to maintain our health and well-being.\n\n**References**\n\nEmmett SD. Otolaryngology in the elderly.

    "content": "**Aging Changes in Vital Signs**\n\nAs we age, our vital signs undergo significant changes that can impact our overall health and well-being. In this article, we'll explore the effects of aging on body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n\n**Body Temperature**\n\nNormal body temperature remains relatively unchanged with aging. However, our ability to regulate body temperature decreases with age. A decrease in subcutaneous fat makes it harder to stay warm, and we may need to wear layers of clothing to feel comfortable. Additionally, aging reduces our ability to sweat, putting us at risk for overheating (heat stroke) or dangerous drops in body temperature.\n\n**Fever**\n\nA fever is an important sign of illness in older adults, often being the only symptom for several days. It's essential to monitor for fever, especially if it's not explained by a known illness. A fever can also be a sign of infection, and our bodies may not produce a higher temperature as we age.\n\n**Heart Rate and Breathing Rate**\n\nOur pulse rate remains relatively unchanged with aging, but exercise can cause delays in increasing and decreasing heart rates. Lung function decreases slightly each year, but healthy older adults can usually breathe without effort.\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\nOlder individuals may experience dizziness when standing up too quickly due to a drop in blood pressure. This is known as orthostatic hypotension, often related to medications, particularly blood pressure drugs. The risk of high blood pressure increases with age, and other heart-related problems common in older adults include very slow or fast pulse rates and heart rhythm issues like atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Effects of Medicines on Vital Signs**\n\nMedications used to treat health problems in older adults can affect vital signs. For example, digoxin for heart failure and beta-blockers for blood pressure may cause a slower pulse rate. Diuretics (water pills) can lead to low blood pressure, especially when changing body position.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs we age, we experience changes in our organs, tissues, and cells, as well as the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. It's essential to be aware of these changes and monitor our vital signs regularly to ensure optimal health.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Schiger DL. Approach to the patient with abnormal vital signs.

Dugdale, MD, Medical Director, Brenda Conaway, Editorial Director, and the A.D.A.M. Editorial team.\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Vital Signs**\n\nAs you age, your vital signs may change, depending on how healthy you are. Some medical problems can cause changes in one or more vital signs.\n\n**Checking Your Vital Signs**\n\nChecking your vital signs helps your health care provider monitor your health and any medical problems you may have.\n\n**Body Temperature**\n\nNormal body temperature does not change much with aging. But as you get older, it becomes harder for your body to control its temperature. A decrease in the amount of fat below the skin makes it harder to stay warm. You may need to wear layers of clothing to feel warm.\n\nAging decreases your ability to sweat. You may have difficulty telling when you are becoming overheated. This puts you at high risk of overheating (heat stroke). You can also be at risk for dangerous drops in body temperature.\n\nFever is an important sign of illness in older people. It is often the only symptom for several days of an illness. See your provider if you have a fever that is not explained by a known illness.\n\nA fever is also a sign of infection. When an older person has an infection, their body may not be able to produce a higher temperature. For this reason, it is important to check other vital signs, as well as any symptoms and signs of infection.\n\n**Heart Rate and Breathing Rate**\n\nAs you grow older, your pulse rate is about the same as before. But when you exercise, it may take longer for your pulse to increase and longer for it to slow down afterward. Your highest heart rate with exercise is also lower than it was when you were younger.\n\nBreathing rate usually does not change with age. But lung function decreases slightly each year as you age. Healthy older people can usually breathe without effort.\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\nOlder people may become dizzy when standing up too quickly. This is due to a drop in blood pressure with standing. This kind of drop in blood pressure when standing is called orthostatic hypotension. It is often related to medicines, particularly blood pressure drugs.\n\nRisk of having high blood pressure (hypertension) increases as you get older. Other heart-related problems common in older adults include:\n\n* Very slow pulse or very fast pulse\n* Heart rhythm problems such as atrial fibrillation\n\n**Effects of Medicines on Vital Signs**\n\nMedicines that are used to treat health problems in older people can affect the vital signs. For example, the medicine digoxin, which is used for heart failure, and blood pressure medicines called beta-blockers may cause the pulse to slow.\n\nDiuretics (water pills) can cause low blood pressure, most often when changing body position too quickly.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\nAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:\n\n* In organs, tissues, and cells\n* In the heart and blood vessels\n* In the lungs\n\n---\n\n**Aging Changes in Vital Signs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Clinical Sequelae of Aging**\n\nAs people age, their vital signs undergo significant changes. Understanding these changes is crucial for healthcare providers to diagnose and manage age-related disorders effectively.\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\n*   With aging, blood pressure increases due to decreased elasticity of arteries.\n*   Hypertension becomes more common in older adults, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Pulse**\n\n*   The pulse rate slows with age, typically ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) in older adults.\n*   The radial pulse is often used as a reference point for assessing heart rate and rhythm.\n\n**Respiratory Rate**\n\n*   Respiratory rates tend to decrease with age, but this change is less pronounced compared to blood pressure or pulse changes.\n\n**Temperature**\n\n*   Older adults may experience a slight decrease in body temperature due to reduced metabolic activity.\n*   However, this change is relatively minor and often not clinically significant.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   Age-related changes in vital signs can have significant implications for healthcare providers.\n*   Understanding these changes is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of age-related disorders.",

They are most often not a cause for worry. They typically develop in people with fair complexions, but people with darker skin can also get them.\n\n**What do aging spots look like?**\n\nAging spots are flat and oval and tan, brown, or black marks. They appear on skin that has been the most exposed to sun over the years, such as the backs of hands, tops of feet, face, shoulders, and upper back.\n\n**When should you be concerned about aging spots?**\n\nAlways let your health care provider know if you have any new or unusual spots, and have them checked. Skin cancers may have many different appearances. Spots or sores related to skin cancers can be:\n\n* Small, shiny, or waxy\n* Scaly and rough\n* Firm and red\n* Crusty or bleeding\n\nSkin cancers can also have other features.\n\n**References**\n\nJames WD, Elston DM, Treat JR, Rosenbach MA, Neuhaus IM.

    "content": "**Agitation**\n\nAgitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAgitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and fever can all increase agitation.\n\nAgitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease.\n\nAgitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of delirium. Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by your health care provider right away.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many causes of agitation. Some of them are:\n\n*   Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal\n*   Allergic reaction\n*   Caffeine intoxication\n*   Certain forms of heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease\n*   Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, PCP, or opiods)\n*   Hospitalization (older adults often have delirium while in the hospital)\n*   Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n*   Infection (especially in elderly people)\n*   Nicotine withdrawal\n*   Poisoning (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning)\n*   Some medicines, including theophylline, amphetamines, and steroids\n*   Trauma\n*   Vitamin B6 deficiency\n\nAgitation can occur with brain and mental health disorders, such as:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Dementia (such as Alzheimer disease)\n*   Depression\n*   Mania\n*   Schizophrenia\n\n**Home Care**\n\nThe most important way to deal with agitation is to find and treat the cause. Agitation may lead to an increased risk of suicide and other forms of violence.\n\nAfter treating the cause, the following measures can reduce agitation:\n\n*   A calm environment\n*   Enough lighting during the day and darkness at night\n*   Medicines such as benzodiazepines, and in some cases, antipsychotics\n*   Plenty of sleep\n\nDo not physically hold back an agitated person, if possible. This usually makes the problem worse. Use restraints only if the person is at risk of harming themselves or others, and there is no other way to control their behavior.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for agitation that:\n\n*   Lasts a long time\n*   Is very severe\n*   Occurs with thoughts or actions of hurting yourself or others\n*   Occurs with other, unexplained symptoms\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam. To better understand your agitation, your provider may ask you specific things about your agitation.\n\nTests may include:\n\n*   Blood tests (such as a complete blood count, infection screening, thyroid tests, or vitamin levels)\n*   Head CT or head MRI scan\n*   Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)\n*   Urine tests (for infection screening, drug screening)\n*   Vital signs (temperature, pulse, breathing rate, blood pressure)\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of your agitation.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRestlessness\n\n---\n\n**Agitation**\n\nAgitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAgitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and fever can all increase agitation.\n\nAgitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease.\n\nAgitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of delirium. Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by your health care provider right away.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are many causes of agitation. Some of them are:\n\n* Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal\n* Allergic reaction\n* Caffeine intoxication\n* Certain forms of heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease\n* Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, PCP, or opiods)\n* Hospitalization (older adults often have delirium while in the hospital)\n* Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n* Infection (especially in elderly people)\n* Nicotine withdrawal\n* Poisoning (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning)\n* Some medicines, including theophylline, amphetamines, and steroids\n* Trauma\n* Vitamin B6 deficiency\n\nAgitation can occur with brain and mental health disorders, such as:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Dementia (such as Alzheimer disease)\n* Depression\n* Mania\n* Schizophrenia\n\n**Home Care**\n\nThe most important way to deal with agitation is to find and treat the cause. Agitation may lead to an increased risk of suicide and other forms of violence.\n\nAfter treating the cause, the following measures can reduce agitation:\n\n* A calm environment\n* Enough lighting during the day and darkness at night\n* Medicines such as benzodiazepines, and in some cases, antipsychotics\n* Plenty of sleep\n\nDo not physically hold back an agitated person, if possible. This usually makes the problem worse. Use restraints only if the person is at risk of harming themselves or others, and there is no other way to control their behavior.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for agitation that:\n\n* Lasts a long time\n* Is very severe\n* Occurs with thoughts or actions of hurting yourself or others\n* Occurs with other, unexplained symptoms\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

One important type of white blood cell is the granulocyte, which is made in the bone marrow and travels in the blood throughout the body. Granulocytes sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs.\n\nWhen the body has too few granulocytes, the condition is called agranulocytosis. This makes it harder for the body to fight off germs. As a result, the person may get sick from infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAgranulocytosis may be caused by:\n\n*   Autoimmune disorders\n*   Bone marrow diseases, such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia\n*   Certain medicines used to treat diseases, including cancer\n*   Certain street drugs\n*   Poor nutrition\n*   Preparation for bone marrow transplant\n*   Benign familial neutropenia\n*   Genetic variants, especially in people of certain African and Caribbean ethnicities\n\n---\n\n**Agranulocytosis**\n\n**What is agranulocytosis?**\n\nAgranulocytosis is a rare but serious condition where the body has a severe lack of white blood cells, specifically neutrophils.

It is characterized by a severe gene mutation in one of the X chromosomes in each cell, which leads to skewed X-inactivation.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nThe cause of Aicardi syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to result from new gene mutations. The disorder is classified as an X-linked dominant condition, meaning that a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in females. In males, who have only one X chromosome, a mutation in the only copy of the gene is nearly always lethal very early in development.\n\n**Symptoms and Characteristics**\n\nAicardi syndrome is characterized by various signs and symptoms, including:\n\n* Agensis of corpus callosum with chorioretinal abnormality\n* Agensis of corpus callosum with infantile spasms and ocular abnormalities\n* Aicardi's syndrome\n* Callosal agenesis and ocular abnormalities\n* Chorioretinal anomalies with ACC\n\n**Diagnosis and Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help diagnose Aicardi syndrome. The Genetic Testing Registry lists Aicardi syndrome as a condition that can be tested for.\n\n**Resources and Support**\n\nFor individuals and families affected by Aicardi syndrome, there are various resources available, including:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\nNote: The content has been reformatted to improve readability and clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi Syndrome**\n\n**Genetics**\n\nAicardi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects females, typically presenting with seizures, developmental delays, and characteristic facial features.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   **Prognosis of a Genetic Condition**: The prognosis of Aicardi syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment.\n*   **Gene Variants and Health Development**: Gene variants can affect health and development in individuals with Aicardi syndrome, leading to seizures, developmental delays, and other complications.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: Aicardi syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene on the X chromosome is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\n*   **Treatment Options**: Treatment for Aicardi syndrome typically involves managing seizures, addressing developmental delays, and providing supportive care.\n*   **Genetic Counseling**: Genetic counseling can help families understand the inheritance pattern of Aicardi syndrome and make informed decisions about family planning.\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n* **Definition**: A rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of the brain, eyes, and spinal cord.\n* **Causes**: Aicardi syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of the two copies of the XAC gene.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\n* **Common symptoms**: Seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and eye abnormalities such as coloboma or microphthalmia.\n* **Less common symptoms**: Hydrocephalus, spina bifida, and heart defects.\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\n* **Poor prognosis**: Aicardi syndrome is a severe disorder with a poor prognosis. Most children die in infancy due to complications from seizures, hydrocephalus, or other associated anomalies.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\n* **Supportive care**: Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.\n* **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat related conditions such as hydrocephalus or spina bifida.",

Affected infants experience severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), developmental regression, seizures, and abnormal deposits of calcium in the brain.\n*   **Later-onset form**: This type typically begins after 1 year of age, with affected individuals experiencing developmental delays, regression, spasticity, hypotonia, and microcephaly.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome include:\n\n*   Severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy)\n*   Developmental regression\n*   Seizures\n*   Abnormal deposits of calcium in the brain\n*   Irritability\n*   Poor feeding\n*   Sterile pyrexias\n*   Spasticity\n*   Hypotonia\n*   Microcephaly\n*   Vision problems (vision loss and increased pressure in the eye)\n*   Chilblains (painful, itchy skin lesions)\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nAs a result of the severe neurological problems associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, most people with this disorder do not survive past childhood. However, some affected individuals with the later-onset form and milder neurological problems can live into adolescence or adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\n**What is Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome?**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the brain, immune system, and skin.\n\n**Types of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\nThe condition is often divided into two types: early-onset form (sometimes called the classic form) and later-onset form. The main difference between these two forms is the severity of features and the age at which they begin.\n\n**Early-Onset Form**\n\nIndividuals with the early-onset form of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome can experience severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) within the first months of life. This encephalopathic phase of the disorder can last for weeks or months. Affected infants stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they had already acquired (developmental regression). Infants with this form can have seizures. Medical imaging reveals loss of white matter in the brain (leukodystrophy). White matter consists of nerve cells covered by myelin, which is a substance that protects nerves and allows them to rapidly transmit nerve impulses. Growth of the brain and skull slows down, resulting in an abnormally small head size (microcephaly). Affected individuals may have abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain.\n\n**Later-Onset Form**\n\nPeople with the later-onset form of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome typically have normal development in infancy. In these individuals, encephalopathy typically occurs after 1 year of age. Similar to those with the early-onset form, babies with the later-onset form experience irritability, poor feeding, and sterile pyrexias. Over time, affected individuals show developmental delays and regression. They may also have spasticity and hypotonia, and the growth of the brain and head may slow leading to microcephaly.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAffected babies are usually extremely irritable and do not feed well. They also have muscle stiffness (spasticity), involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). They can have vision problems including vision loss and increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma).\n\nSome newborns have a combination of features that include an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), elevated blood levels of liver enzymes, and a shortage of blood cells called platelets that are needed for normal blood clotting (thrombocytopenia). They may develop intermittent fevers in the absence of infection (sterile pyrexias).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare disorder. More than 500 people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have been described in the scientific literature, though the exact prevalence of the condition is unknown.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nAs a result of the severe neurological problems that are usually associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, most people with this disorder do not survive past childhood. However, some affected individuals with the later-onset form of the condition and milder neurological problems can live into adolescence or adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\n**What is Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome?**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare disorder affecting approximately 500 people worldwide, although its exact prevalence remains unknown.\n\n**Causes of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in several genes can cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. The TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes provide instructions for making nucleases, which are enzymes that help break down molecules of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA when they are no longer needed.\n\n*   These DNA and RNA molecules or fragments may be generated during the first stage of protein production (transcription), the replication of cells' genetic material that occurs when the cell is preparing for cell division, DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), and other processes.\n*   The nuclease enzymes produced by genes with variants may not function properly, and some variants may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.\n*   Researchers suggest that this may result in the accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells.\n*   The unneeded DNA and RNA may be mistaken by cells for the genetic material of viral invaders.\n*   This triggers an immune system reaction that includes the abnormal activation of interferon proteins, which play a critical role in the immune system including regulating inflammation.\n\nVariants in other genes, including the SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR genes, can also cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the immune system.\n\n*   Variants in these genes cause inappropriate activation of interferon proteins and the body's immune system, resulting in inflammatory damage to the brain, skin, and other body systems that leads to the characteristic features of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.\n*   Variants in other genes, including the RNU7-1 and LSM11 genes, can also cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the cell cycle, DNA replication, and protein production.\n\nVariants in the TREX1, RNASEH2A, and RNASEH2C genes tend to cause the early-onset form of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, while variants in the RNASEH2B, SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR genes tend to cause the later-onset form. However, not every case of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome follows this pattern.\n\n**Interferonopathies**\n\nBecause the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome are caused in part by abnormal activation of interferon proteins, it one of a group of disorders known as interferonopathies.\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\n**Causes and Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in several genes, including SAMHD1, IFIH1, ADAR, LSM11, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, RNU7-1, SAMHD1, and TREX1. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the immune system.\n\nVariants in these genes cause inappropriate activation of interferon proteins and the body's immune system, resulting in inflammatory damage to the brain, skin, and other body systems that leads to the characteristic features of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. In most cases, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance occurs when Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is caused by variants in the ADAR, LSM11, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, RNU7-1, SAMHD1, and TREX1 genes. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nWhen Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is caused by variants in the IFIH1 gene or by certain variants in the TREX1 or ADAR gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAGS\nAicardi Goutieres syndrome\nCree encephalitis\nEncephalopathy with basal ganglia calcification\nFamilial infantile encephalopathy with intracranial calcification and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis\nPseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi Goutieres syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 6\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 7\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 1\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 2\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 3\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 4\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 5\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\n*   Aicardi-Goutières syndrome\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1; AGS1\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 2; AGS2\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 3; AGS3\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 4; AGS4\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 7; AGS7\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 5; AGS5\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 6; AGS6\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 8; AGS8\n*   AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 9; AGS9\n\n---\n\n**Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome**\n\n**What is Aicardi-Goutières syndrome?**\n\nAicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by inflammation of the brain, which can lead to seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological problems.\n\n**Causes of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome**\n\nAGS is caused by mutations in several genes, including TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1. These genes play a crucial role in the innate immune response, which helps to protect the body against infections.\n\n**Symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of AGS can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* Inflammation of the brain\n* Seizures\n* Developmental delays\n* Microcephaly (small head size)\n* Spasticity (muscle stiffness)\n* Intellectual disability\n\n**Diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome**\n\nAGS can be diagnosed through genetic testing, which involves analyzing the DNA of an individual to identify mutations in the affected genes. Imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans may also be used to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\n**Treatment and management of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome**\n\nThere is no cure for AGS, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Treatment may include:\n\n* Anti-inflammatory medications\n* Seizure medication\n* Physical therapy to improve mobility and reduce spasticity\n* Speech and language therapy to improve communication skills\n\n**Prognosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with AGS varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. Some individuals may experience a significant improvement in symptoms, while others may experience a decline in cognitive and motor function.\n\n**References**\n\nCrow YJ, Chase DS, Lowenstein Schmidt J, Szynkiewicz M, Forte GM, Gornall HL,\nOojageer A, Anderson B, Pizzino A, Helman G, Abdel-Hamid MS, Abdel-Salam GM,\nAckroyd S, Aeby A, Agosta G, Albin C, Allon-Shalev S, Arellano M, Ariaudo G,\nAswani V, Babul-Hirji R, Baildam EM, Bahi-Buisson N, Bailey KM, Barnerias C,\nBarth M, Battini R, Beresford MW, Bernard G, Bianchi M, Billette de Villemeur T,\nBlair EM, Bloom M, Burlina AB, Carpanelli ML, Carvalho DR, Castro-Gago M,\nCavallini A, Cereda C, Chandler KE, Chitayat DA, Collins AE, Sierra Corcoles C,\nCordeiro NJ, Crichiutti G, Dabydeen L, Dale RC, D'Arrigo S, De Goede CG, De Laet\nC, De Waele LM, Denzler I, Desguerre I, Devriendt K, Di Rocco M, Fahey MC, Fazzi\nE, Ferrie CD, Figueiredo A, Gener B, Goizet C, Gowrinathan NR, Gowrishankar K,\nHanrahan D, Isidor B, Kara B, Khan N, King MD, Kirk EP, Kumar R, Lagae L,\nLandrieu P, Lauffer H, Laugel V, La Piana R, Lim MJ, Lin JP, Linnankivi T, Mackay\nMT, Marom DR, Marques Lourenco C, McKee SA, Moroni I, Morton JE, Moutard ML,\nMurray K, Nabbout R, Nampoothiri S, Nunez-Enamorado N, Oades PJ, Olivieri I,\nOstergaard JR, Perez-Duenas B, Prendiville JS, Ramesh V, Rasmussen M, Regal L,\nRicci F, Rio M, Rodriguez D, Roubertie A, Salvatici E, Segers KA, Sinha GP, Soler\nD, Spiegel R, Stodberg TI, Straussberg R, Swoboda KJ, Suri M, Tacke U, Tan TY, te\nWater Naude J, Wee Teik K, Thomas MM, Till M, Tonduti D, Valente EM, Van Coster\nRN, van der Knaap MS, Vassallo G, Vijzelaar R, Vogt J, Wallace GB, Wassmer E,\nWebb HJ, Whitehouse WP, Whitney RN, Zaki MS, Zuberi SM, Livingston JH, Rozenberg\nF, Lebon P, Vanderver A, Orcesi S, Rice GI.

    "content": "**Alagille Syndrome**\n\nAlagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Liver Damage**\n\nOne of the major features of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. These ducts carry bile (which helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. In Alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number (bile duct paucity). As a result, bile builds up in the liver and causes scarring that prevents the liver from working properly to eliminate wastes from the bloodstream. Signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in Alagille syndrome may include:\n\n* A yellowish tinge in the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Itchy skin\n* Deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas)\n\n**Heart Problems**\n\nAlagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis). Pulmonic stenosis may occur along with a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect) and other heart abnormalities. This combination of heart defects is called tetralogy of Fallot.\n\n**Facial Features**\n\nPeople with Alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features including:\n\n* A broad, prominent forehead\n* Deep-set eyes\n* A small, pointed chin\n\nThe disorder may also affect the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the kidneys. Affected individuals may have an unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) that can be seen in an x-ray.\n\n**Symptoms and Severity**\n\nProblems associated with Alagille syndrome generally become evident in infancy or early childhood. The severity of the disorder varies among affected individuals, even within the same family. Symptoms range from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe heart and/or liver disease requiring transplantation.\n\nSome people with Alagille syndrome may have isolated signs of the disorder, such as a heart defect like tetralogy of Fallot, or a characteristic facial appearance. These individuals do not have liver disease or other features typical of the disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Alagille Syndrome**\n\n**What is Alagille syndrome?**\n\nAlagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts\n* Heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis)\n* Distinctive facial features, including a broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin\n* Blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord may be affected\n* Kidneys may be affected\n* An unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) that can be seen in an x-ray\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Mutations in the JAG1 gene cause Alagille syndrome in more than 90 percent of cases\n* Small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that include the JAG1 gene are found in 7 percent of individuals with Alagille syndrome\n* A few people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in a different gene, called NOTCH2\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern\n* In approximately 30 to 50 percent of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation or deletion from one affected parent\n\n---\n\n**Alagille Syndrome**\n\n**What is Alagille Syndrome?**\n\nAlagille syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart, and other organs. It is caused by mutations or deletions in the JAG1 gene on chromosome 20.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered or deleted gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Causes of Alagille Syndrome**\n\nIn approximately 30 to 50 percent of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation or deletion from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene or new deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Alagille's syndrome\n* Alagille-Watson syndrome\n* Arteriohepatic dysplasia (AHD)\n* Cardiovertebral syndrome\n* Cholestasis with peripheral pulmonary stenosis\n* Hepatic ductular hypoplasia\n* Hepatofacioneurocardiovertebral syndrome\n* Paucity of interlobular bile ducts\n* Watson-Miller syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information:\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Alagille syndrome due to a JAG1 point mutation\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: Alagille syndrome due to a NOTCH2 point mutation\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\t+ Alagille syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ALAGILLE SYNDROME 1; ALGS1\n\t+ ALAGILLE SYNDROME 2; ALGS2\n\n**References**\n\n* Berniczei-Royko A, Chalas R, Mitura I, Nagy K, Prussak E.

    "content": "**Alanine Transaminase (ALT) Blood Test**\n\nThe alanine transaminase (ALT) blood test measures the level of the enzyme ALT in the blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. \n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nALT is an enzyme found in a high level in the liver. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body. Injury to the liver results in release of ALT into the blood. This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as AST, ALP, and bilirubin) to diagnose and monitor liver disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 4 to 36 U/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn increased ALT level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased. An increased ALT level may be due to any of the following:\n\n* Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n* Death of liver tissue\n* Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)\n* Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis)\n* Too much fat in the liver (fatty liver)\n* Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)\n* Liver tumor or cancer\n* Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver\n* Mononucleosis (\"mono\")\n* Swollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSGPT; Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase; Alanine transaminase; Alanine aminotransferase\n\n---\n\n**Alanine Transaminase (ALT) Blood Test**\n\n**What is ALT?**\n\nALT, or alanine transaminase, is an enzyme found in a high level in the liver.

Albiglutide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlbiglutide injection is a medication that helps the pancreas release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. It works by slowing the movement of food through the stomach.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAlbiglutide injection may increase the risk that you will develop tumors of the thyroid gland, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; a type of thyroid cancer). Laboratory animals who were given medications similar to albiglutide developed tumors, but it is not known if these medications increase the risk of tumors in humans. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had MTC or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2; condition that causes tumors in more than one gland in the body). If so, your doctor will probably tell you not to use albiglutide injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: a lump or swelling in the neck; hoarseness; difficulty swallowing; or shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to albiglutide injection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with albiglutide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of using albiglutide injection.\n\n---\n\n**Albiglutide Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlbiglutide injection is used with a diet and exercise program to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) when other medications did not control levels well enough. Albiglutide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Albiglutide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Albiglutide injection also works by slowing the movement of food through the stomach.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlbiglutide injection comes as a powder to be mixed with water in a prefilled dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a week without regard to meals. Use albiglutide injection on the same day each week at any time of day. You may change the day of the week that you use albiglutide as long as it has been 4 or more days since you used your last dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albiglutide injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAlbiglutide injection controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use albiglutide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using albiglutide injection without talking to your doctor.\n\nAlbiglutide comes in prefilled dosing pens that contain enough medication for one dose. Always inject albiglutide in its own prefilled dosing pen; never mix it with any other medication.\n\nCarefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that come with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and inject a dose of albiglutide injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to prepare or inject this medication.\n\nAlways look at your albiglutide before you inject it. It should be clear, yellow, and free of solid particles.\n\nYou can inject your albiglutide in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach area. Never inject albiglutide into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose. You can inject albiglutide and insulin in the same body area, but you should not give the injections right next to each other.\n\nNever reuse or share needles or pens. Always use a new needle for each injection. Dispose of needles in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.\n\n---\n\n**Albiglutide Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Precautions**\n\nBefore using albiglutide injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to albiglutide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in albiglutide injection. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. It is especially important to tell your doctor about all the medications you take by mouth because albiglutide may change the way your body absorbs these medications.

    "content": "**Albinism**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Albinism?**\n\nAlbinism is a lack of melanin production. Melanin is a natural substance in the body that gives color to your hair, skin, and iris of the eye.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Albinism**\n\nAlbinism occurs when one of several genetic changes makes the body unable to produce or distribute melanin. These changes may be passed down (inherited) through families.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Albinism**\n\nThe most severe form of albinism is called oculocutaneous albinism. People with this type of albinism have white or pink hair, skin, and iris color. They also have vision problems. Another type of albinism, called ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), affects only the eyes. The person's skin and eye color are usually in the normal range. However, an eye exam will show that there is no coloring in the back of the eye (retina). Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a form of albinism caused by a change to a single gene. It can occur with a bleeding disorder, as well as with lung, kidney, and bowel diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Albinism**\n\nA person with albinism may have one of these symptoms:\n\n* No color in the hair, skin, or iris of the eye\n* Lighter than normal skin and hair\n* Patches of missing skin color\n\nMany forms of albinism are associated with the following symptoms:\n\n* Crossed eyes\n* Light sensitivity\n* Rapid eye movements\n* Vision problems, or functional blindness\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Albinism**\n\nGenetic testing offers the most accurate way to diagnose the specific type of albinism. Such testing is helpful if you have a family history of albinism. It is also useful for certain groups of people who are known to get the disease. Your health care provider may also diagnose the condition based on the appearance of your skin, hair, and eyes. An eye doctor called an ophthalmologist may perform an electroretinogram. This is a test that can reveal vision problems related to albinism. A test called a visual evoked potentials test can be very useful when the diagnosis is uncertain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment for Albinism**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. It will depend on how severe the disorder is. Treatment involves protecting the skin and eyes from the sun. To do this:\n\n* Reduce sunburn risk by avoiding the sun, using sunscreen, and covering up completely with clothing when exposed to the sun.\n* Use sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).\n* Wear sunglasses (UV protected) to help relieve light sensitivity.\n\nGlasses are often prescribed to correct vision problems and eye position. Eye muscle surgery is sometimes recommended to correct abnormal eye movements.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups for Albinism**\n\nMore information and support for people with albinism and their families can be found at:\n\n* National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation -- www.albinism.org\n* National Library of Medicine - MedlinePlus website.

However, the HPS form of albinism can shorten a person's lifespan due to lung disease or bleeding problems. People with albinism may be limited in their outdoor activities because they can't tolerate the sun.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications of Albinism**\n\nThese complications can occur:\n\n* Decreased vision, blindness\n* Skin cancer\n\n---\n\n**Albinism**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlbinism occurs when one of several genetic changes makes the body unable to produce or distribute melanin.

    "content": "**Albumin Blood Test**\n\n**What is an Albumin Blood Test?**\n\nAn albumin blood test measures the amount of albumin in your blood. Albumin is a protein made by your liver. Low albumin levels can be a sign of liver or kidney disease or another medical condition. High levels may be a sign of dehydration.\n\n**Blood Composition and Function of Albumin**\n\nBlood is made of fluid and blood cells. Albumin keeps the fluid part of your blood from leaking out of your blood vessels (the tubes your blood flows through) and into other tissues. If you don't have enough albumin, fluid can leak out of your blood and build up in your lungs, abdomen (belly), or other parts of your body.\n\nAlbumin also helps carry important substances throughout your body. These include hormones, vitamins, and enzymes (proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body).\n\n**Other Names for the Test**\n\nALB, serum albumin test\n\n**What is an Albumin Blood Test Used For?**\n\nAn albumin blood test is used to check your general health and nutrition, and to see how well your liver and kidneys are working. If your liver is damaged or you're not well nourished, your liver may not make enough albumin. If your kidneys are damaged, they may let albumin pass from your blood into your urine (pee).\n\nAn albumin test may also be used to monitor treatment for liver or kidney conditions, or other conditions that may affect albumin levels.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Albumin Blood Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an albumin test as part of your routine checkup. In this case, the test is usually ordered as part of a group of liver function tests or a comprehensive metabolic panel.\n\nYou may also need an albumin test if you have symptoms of liver or kidney disease. Symptoms of liver disease include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\nSymptoms of kidney disease include:\n\n* Swelling in your hands and feet or puffy eyelids\n* Dry skin, itching, or numbness\n* Fatigue\n* Increased or decreased urination\n* Urine that is bloody or foamy\n* Loss of appetite and weight loss\n* Muscle cramps\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Shortness of breath\n* Sleep problems\n* Trouble thinking clearly\n\n**What Happens During an Albumin Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations to test for albumin in blood. If your provider ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. Certain medicines may affect your test results, so tell your provider what you are taking. But don't stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nAn albumin blood test alone cannot diagnose a condition. Your provider will usually consider your albumin test results with the results of other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nLower than normal albumin levels in your blood may be a sign of:\n\n* Liver disease, including severe cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Malnutrition, especially a lack of protein in your diet\n* Infection\n* Digestive diseases that involve problems using protein from food, such as Crohn's disease and malabsorption disorders\n* Burns over a large area of your body\n* Thyroid disease\n\nHigher than normal albumin levels in your blood may be a sign of dehydration, which may be caused by severe diarrhea or other conditions.\n\nIf you have questions about your test results, ask your provider to explain what they mean.\n\n---\n\n**Albumin Blood Test**\n\n**What is an albumin blood test?**\n\nAn albumin blood test measures the level of albumin in your blood.

    "content": "**Albuterol Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAlbuterol is used to prevent and treat difficulty breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways). Albuterol inhalation aerosol and powder for oral inhalation is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAlbuterol comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as an aerosol or powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to treat or prevent symptoms of lung disease, it is usually used every 4 to 6 hours as needed. When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to prevent breathing difficulty during exercise, it is usually used 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCall your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that albuterol inhalation no longer controls your symptoms. If you were told to use albuterol as needed to treat your symptoms and you find that you need to use the medication more often than usual, call your doctor.\n\nAlbuterol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them.

    "content": "**Albuterol and Ipratropium Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of albuterol and ipratropium is used to prevent wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and coughing in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) such as chronic bronchitis (swelling of the air passages that lead to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). Albuterol and ipratropium combination is used by people whose symptoms have not been controlled by a single inhaled medication. Albuterol and ipratropium are in a class of medications called bronchodilators. Albuterol and ipratropium combination works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of albuterol and ipratropium comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as a spray to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It is usually inhaled four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nUse albuterol and ipratropium exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may tell you to use additional doses of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation if you experience symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness. Follow these directions carefully, and do not use extra doses of medication unless your doctor tells you that you should.\n\nDo not use more than 2 extra doses of the nebulizer solution per day. Do not use the inhalation spray more than six times in 24 hours. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen, if you feel that albuterol and ipratropium inhalation no longer controls your symptoms, or if you find that you need to use extra doses of the medication more often.\n\nIf you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in cartridges. Each cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation spray is designed to provide 120 inhalations. This is enough medication to last one month if you use one inhalation four times a day. After you use all 120 doses, the inhaler will lock and will not release any more medication.\n\nThere is a dose indicator on the side of the inhaler that keeps track of how much medication is left in the cartridge. Check the dose indicator from time to time to see how much medication is left. When the pointer on the dose indicator enters the red area, the cartridge contains enough medication for 7 days and it is time to refill your prescription so that you will not run out of medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBe careful not to get albuterol and ipratropium inhalation into your eyes. If you get albuterol and ipratropium in your eyes, you may develop narrow angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition that may cause loss of vision). If you already have narrow angle glaucoma, your condition may worsen. You may experience widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), eye pain or redness, blurred vision, and vision changes such as seeing halos around lights, or seeing unusual colors.\n\nCall your doctor if you get albuterol and ipratropium into your eyes or if you develop these symptoms. The inhaler that comes with albuterol and ipratropium spray is designed for use only with a cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale the medication in a cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nBefore you use albuterol and ipratropium inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.

Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n3. Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n4. While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n5. Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n7. While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n8. Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n9. Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n10. Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n11. If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n12.
