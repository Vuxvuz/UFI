    "content": "**Gallbladder Diseases**\n\nAre you looking for information on gallbladder diseases? You're in the right place! Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand this condition.\n\n**What is Gallbladder Disease?**\n\nGallbladder disease refers to any condition that affects the gallbladder, such as gallstones, inflammation, or infection. The gallbladder is a small organ located under the liver that stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver.\n\n**Symptoms of Gallbladder Disease**\n\nThe symptoms of gallbladder disease can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right quadrant\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fever and chills (in cases of infection)\n* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n\n**Types of Gallbladder Disease**\n\nThere are several types of gallbladder disease, including:\n\n* **Gallstones**: Hardened bile that forms in the gallbladder. There are two main types of gallstones: cholesterol stones and pigment stones.\n* **Cholecystitis**: Inflammation of the gallbladder, often caused by a blockage or infection.\n* **Gallbladder cancer**: A rare type of cancer that affects the gallbladder.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment for gallbladder disease depends on the type and severity of the condition. Common treatment options include:\n\n* **Surgery**: Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) or a portion of it.\n* **Medications**: Antibiotics to treat infection, pain relievers to manage pain, and bile salts to dissolve gallstones.\n* **Laparoscopic surgery**: A minimally invasive procedure that uses a camera and instruments to remove the gallbladder.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile some risk factors for gallbladder disease cannot be changed (such as family history), there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n* **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing gallstones.\n* **Eat a balanced diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help prevent gallbladder disease.\n* **Exercise regularly**: Regular physical activity can help improve digestion and reduce the risk of gallstones.\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you're looking for more information on gallbladder disease, here are some resources to get you started:\n\n* **MedlinePlus**: A trusted online resource that provides comprehensive information on various health topics, including gallbladder disease.\n* **National Library of Medicine**: A leading source of medical information that offers a wealth of knowledge on gallbladder disease and its treatment.\n\n**Language Options**\n\nWe understand that not everyone speaks English.

    "content": "**Gallbladder Radionuclide Scan**\n\n_Gallbladder radionuclide scan is a test that uses radioactive material to check gallbladder function. It is also used to look for bile duct blockage or leak._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe health care provider will inject a radioactive chemical called a gamma-emitting tracer into a vein. This material collects mostly in the liver. It will then flow with bile into the gallbladder and then through the common bile duct to the duodenum or small intestine.\n\nFor the test:\n\n*   You lie face up on a table under a scanner called a gamma camera.\n*   The scanner detects the rays coming from the tracer.\n*   A computer displays images of where the tracer is found in the organs.\n*   Images are taken every 5 to 15 minutes. Most of the time, the test takes about 1 hour. At times, it can take up to 4 hours.\n\nIf the provider cannot see the gallbladder after a certain amount of time, you may be given a small amount of morphine. This can help the radioactive material get into the gallbladder. The morphine may cause you to feel tired after the exam.\n\nIn some cases, you may be given a medicine during this test to see how well your gallbladder squeezes (contracts). The medicine may be injected into the vein. Otherwise, you may be asked to drink a high-density drink like Boost which will help your gallbladder contract.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou need to eat something within a day of the test. However, you must stop eating or drinking 4 hours before the test starts.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou will feel a sharp prick from the needle when the tracer is injected into the vein. The site may be sore after the injection. There is normally no pain during the scan.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is very good for detecting a sudden infection of the gallbladder or blockage of a bile duct. It is also helpful in determining whether there is a complication of a transplanted liver or a leak after the gallbladder has been surgically removed.\n\nThe test can also be used to detect long-term gallbladder problems.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n*   Abnormal anatomy of the bile system (biliary anomalies)\n*   Bile duct obstruction\n*   Bile leaks or abnormal ducts\n*   Cancer of the hepatobiliary system\n*   Gallbladder infection (cholecystitis)\n*   Gallstones\n*   Infection of the gallbladder, ducts, or liver\n*   Liver disease\n*   Transplant complication (after liver transplant)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a small risk to pregnant or nursing mothers. Unless it is absolutely necessary, the scan will be delayed until you are no longer pregnant or nursing.\n\nThe amount of radiation is small (less than that of a regular x-ray). It is almost all gone from the body within 1 or 2 days. Your risk from radiation may increase if you have a lot of scans.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nMost of the time, this test is done only if a person has abdominal pain that may be from gallbladder disease or gallstones. For this reason, some people may need urgent treatment based on the test results.\n\nThis test is combined with other imaging (such as CT or ultrasound). After the gallbladder scan, the person may be prepared for surgery, if needed.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nRadionuclide - gallbladder; Gallbladder scan; Biliary scan; Cholescintigraphy; HIDA; Hepatobiliary nuclear imaging scan\n\n---\n\n**Gallbladder Radionuclide Scan**\n\nThis test uses radioactive material to check gallbladder function and detect blockages or leaks in the bile ducts.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A radioactive chemical called a gamma-emitting tracer is injected into a vein.\n*   The tracer collects mostly in the liver, then flows with bile into the gallbladder and common bile duct to the duodenum or small intestine.\n*   You lie face up on a table under a scanner called a gamma camera.

Your surgeon made 1 to 4 small cuts in your belly and used a special instrument called a laparoscope to take out your gallbladder.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nRecovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy will take up to 6 weeks for most people. You may be back to most normal activities in a week or two, but it can take several weeks to return to your normal energy level. You may have some of these symptoms as you recover:\n\n* Pain in your belly. You may also feel pain in one or both shoulders. This pain comes from the gas still left in your belly after the surgery. The pain should ease over several days to a week.\n* A sore throat from the breathing tube. Throat lozenges may be soothing.\n* Nausea and maybe throwing up (vomiting). Your surgeon can provide you with nausea medicine if needed.\n* Loose stools after eating. This may last 4 to 8 weeks. However, in some cases it can last longer.\n* Bruising around your wounds. This will go away on its own.\n* Skin redness around your wounds. This is normal if it is just around the incision.\n\n**Activity**\n\nStart walking after surgery. Begin your everyday activities as soon as you feel up to it. Move around the house and shower, and use the stairs during your first week home. If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity.\n\nYou may be able to drive after a week or so if you are not taking strong pain medicines (narcotics) and if you can move quickly without being hampered by pain if you need to react in an emergency. Don't do any strenuous activity or lift anything heavy for at least a couple of weeks. At any time, if any activity causes pain or pulls on the incisions, just don't do it.\n\nYou may be able to go back to a desk job after a week depending upon how much pain you are having and how energetic you feel.

Slowly increase how much you exercise.\n\n**Managing Pain**\n\nYour provider will prescribe pain medicines to use at home.\n\nSome providers may put you on a regiment of alternating scheduled acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen, using narcotic pain medicine as a backup.\n\nIf you are taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each day for 3 to 4 days. They may be more effective this way.\n\nPress a pillow over your incision when you cough or sneeze to ease discomfort and protect your incision.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYour incision may have been closed with a dissolving suture under the skin and glue on the surface. If so, you can shower the day after surgery without covering the incision. Leave the glue alone. It will come off on its own in a few weeks.\n\nIf your incision was closed with staples or stitches that need to be removed, it may be covered with a bandage. Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it becomes dirty. Your provider will tell you when you no longer need to keep your wound covered. Keep the wound area clean by washing it with mild soap and water. You may remove the wound dressings and take showers the day after surgery.\n\nIf tape strips (Steri-strips) were used to close your incision, cover the incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Do not try to wash off the Steri-strips. Let them fall off on their own.\n\nDo not soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or go swimming until your provider tells you it is OK.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nEat a normal diet, but you may want to avoid greasy or spicy foods for a while.\n\nIf you have hard stools:\n\n* Try to walk and be more active, but do not overdo it.\n* If you can, take less of the narcotic pain medicine your provider gave you. Some can cause constipation. You can use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen instead if it is OK with your surgeon.\n* Try a stool softener. You can get these at any pharmacy without a prescription.\n* Ask your provider whether you can take milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. Do not take any laxatives without first asking your provider.\n* Ask your provider about foods that are high in fiber, or try using an over-the-counter fiber product such as psyllium (Metamucil).\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nYou will see your provider for a follow-up appointment in the weeks after your gallbladder removal surgery.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a fever above 101°F (38.3°C).\n* Your surgical wound is bleeding, red, or warm to the touch.\n* Your surgical wound has thick, yellow or green drainage.\n* You have pain that is not helped with your pain medicines.\n* It is hard to breathe.\n* You have a cough that does not go away.\n* You cannot drink or eat.\n* Your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.\n* Your stools are a gray color.\n\n---\n\n**Gallbladder Removal - Open - Discharge**\n\nYou will be discharged from the hospital on the day of your surgery. Make sure someone is available to drive you home, as you will not be allowed to drive yourself.\n\n**Recovering at Home**\n\nRecovering from open gallbladder removal surgery takes 4 to 8 weeks. You may experience some symptoms during this time:\n\n* Incision pain for a few weeks\n* Sore throat from the breathing tube\n* Nausea and vomiting (if necessary)\n* Loose stools after eating (lasting 4 to 8 weeks)\n* Bruising around your wound\n* A small amount of skin redness just around the edge of your wound\n* A small amount of watery or dark bloody fluid from the incision\n\nYour surgeon may have left one or two drainage tubes in your belly:\n\n* One will help remove any fluid or blood that is left in your belly.\n* The second tube will drain bile while you recover. This tube will be removed by your surgeon in 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n**Activity**\n\nPlan to have someone drive you home from the hospital. You will not be allowed to drive yourself home.\n\nYou should be able to do most of your regular activities in 4 to 8 weeks. Before that:\n\n* Do not lift anything heavy enough to cause pain or pull at the incision.\n* Avoid all strenuous activity until you feel up to it. This includes heavy exercising, weightlifting, and other activities that make you breathe hard, strain, cause pain or pull on the incision.\n\n**Managing Pain**\n\nYour provider will prescribe pain medicines to use at home. Some providers may put you on a regiment of alternating scheduled acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen, using narcotic pain medicine as a backup.\n\nIf you are taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each day for 3 to 4 days. They may be more effective this way.\n\nPress a pillow over your incision when you cough or sneeze to ease discomfort and protect your incision.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYour incision may have been closed with a dissolving suture under the skin and glue on the surface. If so, you can shower the day after surgery without covering the incision. Leave the glue alone. It will come off on its own in a few weeks.\n\nIf your incision was closed with staples or stitches that need to be removed, it may be covered with a bandage. Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it becomes dirty. Your provider will tell you when you no longer need to keep your wound covered. Keep the wound area clean by washing it with mild soap and water.\n\nIf tape strips (Steri-strips) were used to close your incision, cover the incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Do not try to wash off the Steri-strips. Let them fall off on their own.\n\nDo not soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or go swimming until your provider tells you it is OK.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nEat a normal diet, but you may want to avoid greasy or spicy foods for a while.\n\nIf you have hard stools:\n\n* Try to walk and be more active, but do not overdo it.\n* If possible, take less of the narcotic pain medicine your provider gave you. Some can cause constipation. You can use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen instead if it is OK with your surgeon.\n* Try a stool softener. You can get these at any pharmacy without a prescription.\n* Ask your provider whether you can take milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. Do not take any laxatives without first asking your provider.\n* Ask your provider about foods that are high in fiber, or try using an over-the-counter fiber product such as psyllium (Metamucil).\n\n---\n\n**Gallbladder Removal - Open - Discharge**\n\nYou will be sent home on the day of your surgery or the next day. You may feel tired and sore for a few days.\n\n**Self-care**\n\n*   Eat a normal diet, but you may want to avoid greasy or spicy foods for a while.\n*   If you have hard stools:\n    *   Try to walk and be more active, but do not overdo it.\n    *   If you can, take less of the narcotic pain medicine your provider gave you.

These are hard, pebble-like deposits that form inside your gallbladder.\n\n**Most Gallstones Do Not Cause Symptoms**\n\nMost gallstones do not cause symptoms. Sometimes gallstones cause intermittent pain that goes away on its own (biliary colic). This usually does not require hospitalization.\n\n**Why Were You Admitted to the Hospital?**\n\nHowever, because your gallstones caused problems, you were admitted to the hospital. You may have been admitted for cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder usually from gallstones getting blocked in the drainage tubes (bile ducts). You may also have been admitted for complications from this, such as infection in the drainage ducts (cholangitis) or gallstone-related pancreatitis.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou may have had an infection in your gallbladder. You may have received medicines to reduce the swelling and fight the infection. You may have had surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is called cholecystectomy. It is the most common treatment for gallstones that are causing problems or symptoms.\n\nThere are two types of cholecystectomy procedures:\n\n*   **Open Cholecystectomy**: This is performed when your gallbladder is scarred, inflamed, or infected.\n*   **Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy**: This procedure is more common. It is less invasive and has a shorter recover period than open surgery.\n\nIf a gallstone is blocking a drainage duct outside of the gallbladder, then you may have had other procedures to remove those gallstones, but removing the gallbladder is usually done during the same hospital stay or the gallstone problems usually come back.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may continue to have pain and other symptoms if your gallstones return or were not removed. If you had a cholecystectomy, you will be given instructions to follow up after surgery.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nYou may be on a liquid diet for some time to give your gallbladder a rest. When you are eating regular food again, avoid overeating. If you are overweight try to lose weight.\n\nTake acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. Ask your health care provider about stronger pain medicines.\n\nTake any medicines you have been given to fight infection the way you were told to. You may be able to take medicines that dissolve gallstones, but they may take 6 months to 2 years to work, and the gallstones return after stopping the medicine. So, this medicine is not used a lot. That's why if you have symptomatic gallstones, your gallbladder is removed.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n*   Steady, severe pain in your upper belly\n*   Pain in your back, right shoulder, or between your shoulder blades that does not go away and is getting worse\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Fever or chills\n*   Yellow color to your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)\n*   Grey or chalky white bowel movements\n\n---\n\n**Gallstones - discharge**\n\nYou have gallstones.

    "content": "**Gallstones**\n\nAlso called: Cholelithiasis\n\n**Your Gallbladder**\n\nYour gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.\n\n**Gallstones**\n\nYour gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Gallstone attacks usually happen after you eat. Signs of a gallstone attack may include nausea, vomiting, or pain in the abdomen, back, or just under the right arm.\n\n**Who's at Risk**\n\nGallstones are most common among older adults, women, overweight people, Native Americans and Mexican Americans.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nGallstones are often found during imaging tests for other health conditions. If you do not have symptoms, you usually do not need treatment. The most common treatment is removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder.

There are two main types of gallstones:\n\n* **Stones made of cholesterol**: This is the most common type. Cholesterol gallstones are not related to cholesterol level in the blood. In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen.\n* **Stones made of bilirubin**: These are called pigment stones. They occur when red blood cells are destroyed and too much bilirubin is in the bile.\n\nGallstones are more common in:\n\n* Female sex\n* Native Americans and people of Hispanic descent\n* People over age 40\n* People who are overweight\n* People with family history of gallstones\n\nThe following factors also make you more likely to develop gallstones:\n\n* Bone marrow or solid organ transplant\n* Diabetes\n* Failure of the gallbladder to empty bile properly (this is more likely to happen during pregnancy)\n* Liver cirrhosis and biliary tract infections (pigmented stones)\n* Medical conditions that cause too many red blood cells to be destroyed\n* Rapid weight loss from eating a very low-calorie diet, or after weight loss surgery\n* Receiving nutrition through a vein for a long period of time (intravenous feedings)\n* Taking birth control pills\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany people with gallstones do not have any symptoms. These are often found during a routine x-ray, abdominal surgery, or other medical procedure.\n\nHowever, if a large stone blocks a tube or duct that drains the gallbladder, you may have a cramping pain in the middle to right upper abdomen. This is known as biliary colic. The pain goes away if the stone passes into the first part of the small intestine.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests used to detect gallstones or gallbladder inflammation include:\n\n* Ultrasound, abdomen\n* CT scan, abdomen\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n* Gallbladder radionuclide scan\n* Endoscopic ultrasound\n* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n* Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA)\n\nYour health care provider may order the following blood tests:\n\n* Bilirubin\n* Liver function tests\n* Complete blood count\n* Pancreatic enzyme (amylase or lipase)\n\n---\n\n**Gallstones**\n\nThe gallbladder stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver. When you eat a fatty meal, your gallbladder contracts and releases bile into your small intestine to help digest the fat.\n\nIf you have **gallstones**, you may experience a cramping pain in the middle to right upper abdomen. This is known as biliary colic. The pain goes away if the stone passes into the first part of the small intestine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Pain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen for at least 30 minutes\n* Fever\n* Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Clay-colored stools\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\nMany people with gallstones do not have any symptoms. These are often found during a routine x-ray, abdominal surgery, or other medical procedure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests used to detect gallstones or gallbladder inflammation include:\n\n* Ultrasound, abdomen\n* CT scan, abdomen\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n* Gallbladder radionuclide scan\n* Endoscopic ultrasound\n* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n* Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA)\n\nYour health care provider may order the following blood tests:\n\n* Bilirubin\n* Liver function tests\n* Complete blood count\n* Pancreatic enzyme (amylase or lipase)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost of the time, surgery is not needed unless symptoms begin. However, people planning weight loss surgery may need to have gallstones removed before undergoing the procedure.\n\nA technique called laparoscopic cholecystectomy is most commonly used. This procedure uses small surgical incisions, which allow for a faster recovery.\n\nMedicines may be given in pill form to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Rarely, chemicals are passed into the gallbladder through a catheter to rapidly dissolve cholesterol stones.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYou may need to be on a liquid diet or take other steps to give your gallbladder a rest after you are treated. Your provider will give you instructions when you leave the hospital.\n\nThe chance of symptoms or complications from gallstone surgery is low. Nearly all people who have their gallbladder taken out by surgery do not have their symptoms return.\n\n---\n\n**Gallstones**\n\n**What are gallstones?**\n\nGallstones are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder, a organ located under the liver. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of gallstones vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: Pain in the upper right or middle abdomen that may radiate to the back.\n*   **Nausea and vomiting**: Feeling queasy or sick to your stomach.\n*   **Fever**: Having a fever above 101.5°F (38.6°C).\n*   **Yellowing of the skin and eyes**: Jaundice, which is a sign that bile is not flowing properly.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBlockage by gallstones may cause swelling or infection in the:\n\n*   **Gallbladder (cholecystitis)**: Inflammation of the gallbladder.\n*   **Tube that carries bile from the liver to the gallbladder and intestines (cholangitis)**: Inflammation of the bile ducts.\n*   **Pancreas (pancreatitis)**: Inflammation of the pancreas.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n*   **Pain in the upper part of your abdomen**: If you experience severe or persistent pain in your upper abdomen, seek medical attention.\n*   **Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes**: If you notice yellowing of your skin or eyes, it may be a sign that bile is not flowing properly.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIn most people, gallstones can't be prevented. In people who are obese, avoiding rapid weight loss may help prevent gallstones.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGallstones are also known as:\n\n*   **Cholelithiasis**\n*   **Gallbladder attack**\n*   **Biliary colic**\n*   **Gallstone attack**\n*   **Biliary calculus: gallstones chenodeoxycholic acids (CDCA)**\n*   **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, ursodiol)**\n*   **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - gallstones**\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you have had your gallbladder removed, follow these instructions:\n\n*   **Gallbladder removal - laparoscopic - discharge**: Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n*   **Gallbladder removal - open - discharge**: Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n*   **Gallstones - discharge**: Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n\n**Images**\n\nSome images related to gallstones include:\n\n*   **Digestive system**\n*   **Kidney cyst with gallstones - CT scan**\n*   **Gallstones, cholangiogram**\n*   **Cholecystolithiasis**\n*   **Cholelithiasis**\n*   **Gallbladder**\n*   **Gallbladder removal - Series**\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references were used to create this article:\n\n*   Fogel EL, Sherman S.

    "content": "**Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Test**\n\nA gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in your blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout your body, mainly in your liver.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nIf your liver or bile duct is damaged, GGT may leak into your bloodstream, indicating liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile in and out of the liver. Bile is a fluid made by the liver that's important for digestion.\n\n**What can't it do?**\n\nA GGT test can't diagnose the specific cause of liver disease. It can only indicate that your liver is being damaged.\n\n**How is it used?**\n\nA GGT test is usually done with or after other liver function tests, most often an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test. ALP is another type of liver enzyme. While both your GGT and ALP may be elevated in diseases that affect your bile ducts and liver, only ALP will be elevated in bone disease.\n\n**Other names:**\n\ngamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GGTP, Gamma-GT, GTP\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA GGT test is most often used to:\n\n* Help diagnose liver disease\n* Figure out if liver damage is due to liver disease or a bone disorder\n* Check for blockages in the bile ducts\n* Screen for or monitor alcohol use disorder (AUD). Drinking alcohol increases GGT levels. Most people with AUD have high GGT levels.\n\n**When do I need it?**\n\nYou may need a GGT test if you have symptoms of liver disease, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Loss of appetite\n* Abdominal (belly) pain or swelling\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Severe itching\n\n**What happens during the test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Are there any risks?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show higher-than-normal levels of GGT, it may be a sign of liver damage. The damage may be due to one of the following conditions:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Cirrhosis\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Pancreatitis\n* Diabetes\n* Heart failure\n* Side effects of a medicine\n\nThe results can't tell you which condition is causing your liver damage, but they can help show how much damage there is. Usually, the higher the level of GGT, the more liver damage you have.\n\nIf your results show low or normal levels of GGT, you probably don't have liver disease.\n\nYour results may also be compared with the results of an ALP test. ALP tests help diagnose bone disorders. Together, your results may show one of the following:\n\n* High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT mean your symptoms are likely due to a liver disorder and not a bone disorder.\n* High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT levels mean it's more likely you have a bone disorder.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests to understand the results of your GGT test.\n\n---\n\n**Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Test**\n\n**What is a GGT test?**\n\nA GGT test measures the level of gamma-glutamyl transferase in your blood. This enzyme is found in many organs, including the liver, kidneys, and pancreas.\n\n**Why do I need a GGT test?**\n\nYou may need a GGT test if you have symptoms of liver disease, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n* Loss of appetite\n* Abdominal pain or swelling\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Severe itching\n\nYour provider may also use this test to monitor your alcohol use if you're being treated for AUD. You may need a GGT test if you have abnormal results on an ALP test and/or other liver function tests.\n\n**What happens during a GGT test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nTalk to your provider to see if there are any specific instructions, since:\n\n* Certain medicines or supplements can affect the results of your GGT test.\n* Drinking alcohol can also affect the results.\n* Smoking cigarettes can also affect the results.\n* GGT levels go down after meals. Your provider may ask you to fast for a certain amount of time before testing.\n\n**Are there any risks to a GGT test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show higher-than-normal levels of GGT, it may be a sign of liver damage. The damage may be due to one of the following conditions:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Cirrhosis\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Pancreatitis\n* Diabetes\n* Heart failure\n* Side effects of a medicine\n\nThe results can't tell you which condition is causing your liver damage, but they can help show how much damage there is. Usually, the higher the level of GGT, the more liver damage you have.\n\nIf your results show low or normal levels of GGT, you probably don't have liver disease.\n\nYour results may also be compared with the results of an ALP test. ALP tests help diagnose bone disorders. Together, your results may show one of the following:\n\n* High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT mean your symptoms are likely due to a liver disorder and not a bone disorder.\n* High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT levels mean it's more likely you have a bone disorder.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests to understand the results of your GGT test.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a GGT test?**\n\nIn addition to an ALP test, your provider may order liver function tests with or after the GGT test. These may include:\n\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n* Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Liver Foundation.

Drugs that can increase GGT level include:\n\n* Acetaminophen\n* Alcohol\n* Carbamazepine\n* Phenytoin\n* Phenobarbital\n\nDrugs that can decrease GGT level include:\n\n* Birth control pills\n* Clofibrate\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nGGT is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and brain. It is also found in lesser amount in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.\n\nThis test is used to detect diseases of the liver or bile ducts. It is also done with other tests (such as the ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin tests) to tell the difference between liver or bile duct disorders and bone disease.\n\nIt may also be done to screen for, or monitor, alcohol use.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range for adults is 5 to 40 U/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn increased GGT level may be due to any of the following:\n\n* Alcohol use\n* Diabetes\n* Flow of bile from the liver is blocked (cholestasis)\n* Heart failure\n* Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)\n* Liver tissue death\n* Liver cancer or tumor\n* Lung disease\n* Pancreas disease\n* Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n* Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)\n* Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a622058.html",
    "content": "**Ganaxolone**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGanaxolone is used to treat seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 deficiency disorder (CDKL5; an inherited condition that begins in early childhood and causes seizures and developmental delays) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Ganaxolone is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGanaxolone comes as an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day with food. Take ganaxolone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ganaxolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the liquid well for at least 1 minute to mix the medication evenly, place the bottle in an upright position, and then wait for 1 minute to allow any foam to settle before each use. Always use the bottle adapter and measuring syringe provided by the manufacturer to measure each dose of the suspension.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of ganaxolone and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.\n\nGanaxolone may control your seizures or migraines but will not cure your condition. Continue to take ganaxolone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ganaxolone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking ganaxolone, your seizures may worsen. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ganaxolone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Take ganaxolone exactly as directed.\n*   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Continue to take ganaxolone even if you feel well.\n*   Do not stop taking ganaxolone without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses to catch up.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nGanaxolone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   Headache\n*   Dizziness\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Stomach pain\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore ganaxolone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze the suspension. Keep ganaxolone out of reach of children.\n\nDispose of ganaxolone properly when it is no longer needed or expired. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of leftover medications safely.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much ganaxolone, call your doctor or local poison control center right away. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services immediately.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nGanaxolone may interact with other medications, including antacids and certain antibiotics. Tell your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking before starting ganaxolone treatment.\n\nDo not give ganaxolone to anyone else, even if they have the same symptoms as you. Ganaxolone is only for patients with CDKL5 or other conditions treated with this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Ganaxolone: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking ganaxolone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ganaxolone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ganaxolone oral suspension. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking ganaxolone. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with ganaxolone: St. John's wort. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking ganaxolone. Do not start any of these medications while taking ganaxolone without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you currently drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, used street drugs, or overused prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression, mood problems, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ganaxolone, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that ganaxolone may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking ganaxolone. Alcohol can make the side effects from ganaxolone worse.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways, and you may become suicidal (think about harming or killing yourself or plan or try to do so) while you are taking ganaxolone. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older who took anticonvulsants such as ganaxolone during clinical studies were found to be twice as likely to become suicidal than people who did not take the medication. This increased risk of suicidal behavior was seen as early as one week after starting the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, impulsive and dangerous behavior, panic attacks, anxiety, agitation, hostility, mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life, withdrawing from friends and family, new or worsening depression, preoccupation with death and dying, or giving away prized possessions. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nGanaxolone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* sleepiness\n* tiredness\n* drooling\n* difficulty walking\n* fever, sore throat, cough, or other flu-like symptoms\n* runny nose, sneezing, or nasal congestion\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

It is usually found in children between the ages of 2 and 4 years old, but can occur rarely in adults.\n\n**Types of Tumors**\n\nTumors of the nervous system have different degrees of differentiation, which is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope. This can predict whether or not they are likely to spread.\n\n*   Benign tumors are less likely to spread.\n*   Malignant tumors are aggressive, grow quickly, and often spread.\n*   A ganglioneuroma is less malignant in nature.\n*   A neuroblastoma (occurring in children over 1 year old) is usually malignant.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost commonly, a lump can be felt in the abdomen with tenderness. This tumor may also occur at other sites, including:\n\n*   Chest cavity\n*   Neck\n*   Legs\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider may do the following tests:\n\n*   Fine-needle aspiration of the tumor\n*   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n*   Bone scan\n*   CT scan of the affected area\n*   MRI scan of the affected area\n*   PET scan\n*   Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan\n*   Special blood and urine tests\n*   Surgical biopsy to confirm diagnosis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDepending on the type of tumor, treatment can involve surgery, and possibly chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Because these tumors are rare, they should be treated in a specialized center by experts who have experience with them.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for children with ganglioneuroblastoma and their families can be found at:\n\n*   Children's Oncology Group -- www.childrensoncologygroup.org\n*   The Neuroblastoma Children's Cancer Society -- neuroblastomachildrenscancersociety.org/\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on how far the tumor has spread, and whether some areas of the tumor contain more aggressive cancer cells.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result include:\n\n*   Complications of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy\n*   Spread of the tumor into surrounding areas",

As the bacteria grow inside the body, they emit gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGas gangrene causes very painful swelling. The skin turns pale to brownish-red. When the swollen area is pressed, gas can be felt (and sometimes heard) as a crackly sensation (crepitus). The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over minutes. The area may be completely destroyed.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n*   Air under the skin (subcutaneous emphysema)\n*   Blisters filled with brown-red fluid\n*   Drainage from the tissues, foul-smelling brown-red or bloody fluid (serosanguineous discharge)\n*   Increased heart rate (tachycardia)\n*   Moderate to high fever\n*   Moderate to severe pain around a skin injury\n*   Pale skin color, later becoming dusky and changing to dark red or purple\n*   Swelling that worsens around a skin injury\n*   Sweating\n*   Vesicle formation, combining into large blisters\n*   Yellow color to the skin (jaundice)\n\nIf the condition is not treated, the person can go into shock with decreased blood pressure (hypotension), kidney failure, coma, and finally death.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal signs of shock.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Tissue and fluid cultures to test for bacteria including clostridial species\n*   Blood culture to determine the bacteria causing the infection\n*   Gram stain of fluid from the infected area\n*   X-ray, CT scan, or MRI of the area, which may show gas in the tissues\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is needed quickly to remove dead, damaged, and infected tissue.\n\nSurgical removal (amputation) of an arm or leg may be needed to control the spread of infection. Amputation sometimes must be done before all test results are available.\n\nAntibiotics are also given. These medicines are given through a vein (intravenously). Pain medicines may also be prescribed.\n\nIn some cases, hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be tried.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook for gas gangrene is generally poor if not treated promptly.

    "content": "**Gas**\n\nEveryone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping. Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.\n\n**Causes of Gas**\n\nGas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine.

    "content": "**Gas – Flatulence**\n\nGas is air in the intestine that is passed through the rectum. Air that moves from the digestive tract through the mouth is called belching.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Gas is normally formed in the intestines as your body digests food.\n* Gas can make you feel bloated. It can cause crampy or colicky pains in your belly.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGas can be caused by certain foods you eat. You may have gas if you:\n\n* Eat foods that are hard to digest, such as fiber. Sometimes, adding more fiber into your diet can cause temporary gas. Your body may adjust and stop producing gas over time.\n* Insoluble fiber (such as bran) causes more gas than soluble fiber (such as psyllium).\n* Eat or drink something your body cannot tolerate. For example, some people have lactose intolerance and cannot eat or drink dairy products. Many people get gassy from fructose and related products.\n\nOther common causes of gas are:\n\n* Antibiotics\n* Irritable bowel syndrome\n* Inability to absorb nutrients properly (malabsorption)\n* Inability to digest nutrients properly (maldigestion)\n* Swallowing air while eating\n* Chewing gum\n* Smoking cigarettes\n* Drinking carbonated beverages\n* Eating a lot of candy or gum with sugar substitutes\n\n**Home Care**\n\nThe following tips may help you prevent gas:\n\n* Chew your food more thoroughly.\n* Lower intake of beans, cabbage, onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts\n* Avoid foods high in poorly digestible carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are called FODMAPs and include fructose (fruit sugar).\n* Avoid lactose.\n* Do not drink carbonated drinks.\n* Do not chew gum or eat frequent diabetic candy with sugar substitutes\n* Eat more slowly.\n* Relax while you eat.\n* Walk for 10 to 15 minutes after eating.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have:\n\n* Gas and other symptoms such as stomach pain, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, or weight loss\n* Oily, foul-smelling, or bloody stools\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\n\n* What foods do you commonly eat?\n* Has your diet changed recently?\n* Have you increased the fiber in your diet?\n* How fast do you eat, chew, and swallow?\n* Would you say that your gas is mild or severe?\n* Does your gas seem to be related to eating milk products or other specific foods?\n* What seems to make your gas better?\n* What medicines do you take?\n* Do you have other symptoms, like abdominal pain, diarrhea, early satiety (premature fullness after meals), bloating, or weight loss?\n* Do you chew artificially sweetened gum or eat artificially sweetened candy? (These frequently contain indigestible sugars that can lead to production of gas.)\n\n**Tests That May Be Done**\n\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal ultrasound\nBarium enema x-ray\nBarium swallow x-ray\nBlood work such as CBC or blood differential\nSigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\nUpper endoscopy (EGD)\nHydrogen breath test\n\n---\n\n**Gas – flatulence**\n\n**What is gas?**\n\nGas is air in the intestine that is passed through the rectum. Air that moves from the digestive tract through the mouth is called belching.\n\n**Causes of Gas**\n\n*   Certain foods you eat, such as:\n    *   Hard to digest foods like fiber\n    *   Foods your body cannot tolerate, like lactose intolerance or fructose and related products\n    *   Antibiotics\n    *   Irritable bowel syndrome\n    *   Inability to absorb nutrients properly (malabsorption)\n    *   Inability to digest nutrients properly (maldigestion)\n    *   Swallowing air while eating\n    *   Chewing gum\n    *   Smoking cigarettes\n    *   Drinking carbonated beverages\n    *   Eating a lot of candy or gum with sugar substitutes\n\n**Home Care**\n\nTo prevent gas, try the following:\n\n*   Chew your food more thoroughly.\n*   Lower intake of beans, cabbage, onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts\n*   Avoid foods high in poorly digestible carbohydrates (FODMAPs)\n*   Avoid lactose\n*   Do not drink carbonated drinks\n*   Do not chew gum or eat frequent diabetic candy with sugar substitutes\n*   Eat more slowly\n*   Relax while you eat\n*   Walk for 10 to 15 minutes after eating\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have:\n\n*   Gas and other symptoms such as stomach pain, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, or weight loss\n*   Oily, foul-smelling, or bloody stools\n\n---\n\n**Gas – flatulence**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Causes of Gas**: Intestinal gas is composed mainly of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The causes of gas include swallowing air, eating beans or cabbage, and the breakdown of undigested carbohydrates by bacteria in the colon.\n*   **Symptoms of Gas**: Symptoms of gas may include bloating, discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and flatulence.\n*   **Diagnosis of Gas**: Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and medical history. Tests such as a barium swallow or upper GI series may be ordered to rule out other conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Azpiroz F. Intestinal gas.

    "content": "**Gasoline Poisoning**\n\nThis article discusses the harmful effects from swallowing gasoline or breathing in its fumes.\n\n**Important Note**\n\nDO NOT use this article to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call 911 or your local emergency number, or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nThe poisonous ingredients in gasoline are chemicals called hydrocarbons, which are substances that contain only hydrogen and carbon. Examples are benzene (a liquid) and methane (a vapor).\n\n**Where Found**\n\nThese ingredients are found in gasoline and other hydrocarbon liquids, such as kerosene.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGasoline poisoning can cause symptoms in various parts of the body:\n\n* **AIRWAYS AND LUNGS**\n\t+ Breathing difficulty\n\t+ Throat swelling\n* **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n\t+ Pain\n\t+ Vision loss\n* **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n\t+ Abdominal pain\n\t+ Blood stools\n\t+ Burns of the esophagus (food pipe)\n\t+ Vomiting, possibly with blood\n* **HEART AND BLOOD**\n\t+ Collapse\n\t+ Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n* **NERVOUS SYSTEM**\n\t+ Convulsions (seizures)\n\t+ Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n\t+ Decreased alertness and responsiveness\n\t+ Depression\n\t+ Dizziness\n\t+ Drowsiness\n\t+ Feeling of being drunk (euphoria)\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Staggering\n\t+ Weakness\n* **SKIN**\n\t+ Burns\n\t+ Irritation\n\n**Home Care**\n\nGet medical help right away. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider.\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by poison control or a provider. DO NOT give water or milk if the person is unconscious (has a decreased level of alertness).\n\nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nGet the following information:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* Time the gasoline was swallowed\n* Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen given through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Bronchoscopy (camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Endoscopy (camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach)\n* Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n* Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n* Surgical removal of burned skin\n* Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach, but only when the victim is seen within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning and a very large amount of the poison has been swallowed\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nSwallowing this type of poison can affect many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. Infection, shock, and death can follow, even several months after the poison has been swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\nIf gasoline gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and possibly permanent lung damage can occur.\n\nThe harsh taste of gasoline makes it unlikely that large quantities will be swallowed. However, several cases of poisoning have occurred in people trying to suck (siphon) gas from an automobile tank using a garden hose or other tube. This practice is extremely dangerous and is not advised.\n\n---\n\n**Gasoline Poisoning**\n\n**What to Do in Case of Overexposure**\n\nIf you suspect gasoline poisoning, call your local poison control center or 911 immediately.\n\n**National Toll-Free Poison Help Hotline**\n\nCall the national toll-free Poison Help hotline at 1-800-222-1222 from anywhere in the United States. This hotline is available 24/7 and can provide you with further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nWhen you arrive at the emergency room, be prepared to provide information about the incident. The healthcare provider will:\n\n*   Measure and monitor your vital signs\n*   Treat symptoms as needed\n*   Perform diagnostic tests, such as blood and urine tests, breathing support, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), endoscopy, and fluid administration through a vein (IV)\n*   Administer medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n*   Consider surgical removal of burned skin or washing of the skin (irrigation)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster you receive medical help, the better your chance for recovery.\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nSwallowing gasoline can cause long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion due to tissue death and scarring in the airway or gastrointestinal tract. Aspiration of gasoline into the lungs can lead to serious and possibly permanent lung damage.\n\n**Prevention is Key**\n\nTo avoid gasoline poisoning, never suck gas from an automobile tank using a garden hose or other tube. This practice is extremely dangerous and not advised.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Nelson LS, Calello DP. Acute poisoning. In: Goldman L, Cooney KA, eds. Goldman-Cecil Medicine. 27th ed.

A laparoscope has a tiny camera that is inserted into your belly through a small cut. Video from the camera will appear on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon views the monitor to do the surgery. When done this way, the surgery, which is called laparoscopy, is done with a few small surgical cuts. The advantages of this surgery are a faster recovery, less pain, and only a few small cuts.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis surgery is used to treat stomach problems such as:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Inflammation\n* Cancer\n* Polyps (growth on the lining of the stomach)\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines or breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, heart problems. or infection\n\nRisks for this surgery include:\n\n* Leaking from the connection to the intestine which can cause infection or abscess\n* Narrowing of the connection to the intestine, causing blockage\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Dumping syndrome, (when food moves too rapidly from the stomach to the duodenum)\n* Persistent diarrhea\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nIf you are a smoker, you should stop smoking several weeks before surgery and not start smoking again after surgery. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk of problems. Tell your surgeon or health care provider if you need help quitting.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n* Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n---\n\n**Gastrectomy**\n\nYou may stay in hospital for 6 to 10 days.\n\nAfter surgery, there may be a tube in your nose which will help keep your stomach empty. It is removed as soon as your bowels are working well.\n\nMost people have pain from the surgery. You may receive a single medicine or a combination of medicines to control your pain. Tell your surgeon when you are having pain and if the medicines you are receiving control your pain.\n\nHow well you do after surgery depends on the reason for the surgery and your condition.\n\nAsk your surgeon if there are any activities you shouldn't do after you go home. It may take several weeks for you to recover fully. While you are taking narcotic pain medicines, you should not drive.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Surgery - stomach removal\n* Gastrectomy - total\n* Gastrectomy - partial\n* Stomach cancer - gastrectomy\n\n**Images**\n\nGastrectomy - series\n\n**References**\n\nAntiporda M, Reavis KM.

After a meal, it usually takes around four hours for 90 percent of the food to move out of your stomach and into your small intestine.\n\n**When is a gastric emptying test needed?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of gastroparesis, which include:\n\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Bloating\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* A feeling of fullness after just a few bites of food\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss\n\n**What happens during a gastric emptying test?**\n\nThere are different types of tests. You may have one or more of the following:\n\n* **Gastric Emptying Study**: You will start by eating a light meal, often eggs and toast. The food will contain a small, harmless amount of radioactive material called a tracer.\n* **Upper GI Series (Barium Swallow)**: You will swallow a chalky-tasting liquid that contains barium.\n* **Gastric Emptying Breath Test**: You will eat a meal or drink a liquid that contains a type of protein that your body absorbs.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your provider will also let you know if you need to stop taking certain medicines before your test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is little risk to having an imaging test, but talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.\n\nIf you're having an upper GI series, tell your provider if you have any known allergies to the barium used in the test. Also, your poop may look white for several days after the test as you pass the barium.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your results show it took a longer-than-normal time for your stomach to empty, it could mean you have gastroparesis. If your results show it took a shorter-than-normal time for your stomach to empty, it could mean you have dumping syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Emptying Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are gastric emptying tests?**\n\nGastric emptying tests measure the time it takes for food to empty out of your stomach. After a meal, it usually takes around four hours for 90 percent of the food to move out of your stomach and into your small intestine. But if your stomach empties too fast or too slow, it could be a sign of a health issue.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nGastric emptying tests are most often used to diagnose gastroparesis. They may also be used to check for other problems with food passing through your stomach.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why do I need a gastric emptying test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of gastroparesis, which include:\n\n*   Abdominal (belly) pain\n*   Bloating\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   A feeling of fullness after just a few bites of food\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What happens during a gastric emptying test?**\n\nGastric emptying tests are most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. There are different types of tests. You may have one or more of the following tests:\n\n*   Gastric emptying study, also known as a gastric emptying scan, or gastric emptying scintigraphy\n*   Upper GI series, also known as a barium swallow\n*   Gastric emptying breath test\n*   Smart pill, also known as a wireless motility capsule\n\nEach type of test has its own procedure. For example:\n\n*   During a gastric emptying study:\n    *   You will start by eating a light meal, often eggs and toast.\n    *   The food will contain a small, harmless amount of radioactive material called a tracer.\n    *   After you finish eating, you will lie down on an x-ray table.\n    *   The radiologist will take images of your abdomen using a scanning device.\n    *   Additional images will be taken over the next few hours to see how long it takes for food to move out of your stomach and into your small intestine.\n*   During an upper GI series:\n    *   You will swallow a chalky-tasting liquid that contains barium.\n    *   Barium is a substance that coats your internal organs and tissues so they can be seen more clearly on an x-ray.\n    *   You will lie on an x-ray table.\n    *   A special type of x-ray called a fluoroscopy will track the barium in real-time as a live video as it moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.\n*   During a gastric emptying breath test:\n    *   You will eat a meal or drink a liquid that contains a type of protein that your body absorbs.\n    *   The substance eventually passes into your breath.\n    *   A provider will collect samples of your breath over a period of about four hours.\n\nNote: This text has been cleaned and formatted for display, with code blocks removed and medical information preserved.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Emptying Tests**\n\n**What is a Gastric Emptying Test?**\n\nA gastric emptying test measures how long it takes for food to leave your stomach. There are different types of tests, including:\n\n*   **Gastric emptying study**: This is the most common test used to diagnose gastroparesis.\n*   **Upper GI series**: Also known as a barium swallow, this test uses a liquid containing the radioactive tracer instead of solid food.\n*   **Gastric emptying breath test**: This test measures the amount of substance in your breath samples.\n\n**How is a Gastric Emptying Test Performed?**\n\nYou will swallow a smart pill, a pill-sized wireless electronic device. The smart pill will travel through your gastrointestinal system and collect data. The data is sent to a receiver you wear, usually around your waist. After a day or two, the smart pill will leave your body in a bowel movement (poop). You may not feel it when the smart pill exits your body. So when you have a bowel movement, wait 3 minutes before flushing. This will ensure the receiver you wear on your body captures the data, even after the capsule leaves your body.\n\n**What Do I Need to Prepare For?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your provider will also let you know if you need to stop taking certain medicines before your test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nYou should not have a gastric emptying study or an upper GI series if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation from these imaging tests can be harmful to a developing baby. For others, there is little risk to having an imaging test. The dose of radiation is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your results show it took a longer-than-normal time for your stomach to empty, it could mean you have gastroparesis. If your results show it took a shorter-than-normal time for your stomach to empty, it could mean you have dumping syndrome. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider may also consider your symptoms and medical history to understand your results.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Gastric Emptying Tests?**\n\nTreatment for gastroparesis may involve taking certain medicines and/or treating the condition causing the problem, such as diabetes. Regardless of the cause, your provider will likely recommend changing your diet and eating habits. These may include:\n\n*   Eating foods low in fiber and fat.\n*   Avoiding carbonated drinks, smoking, and alcohol.\n*   Eating smaller meals throughout the day rather than two or three large meals.\n*   Chewing food thoroughly.\n*   Waiting at least two hours after eating before lying down.\n\nBy understanding what a gastric emptying test is, how it's performed, and what to expect from the results, you can take the first step towards diagnosing and treating gastroparesis.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Emptying Tests**\n\nIf you're experiencing symptoms like bloating, nausea, and vomiting after eating, your doctor may recommend a gastric emptying test to diagnose gastroparesis, a condition where the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine.\n\n**What is Gastroparesis?**\n\nGastroparesis is a condition where the stomach muscles are weakened, causing food to stay in the stomach for too long. This can lead to symptoms like bloating, nausea, and vomiting after eating. It's often caused by diabetes or other conditions that affect the nerves controlling the stomach.\n\n**How is Gastroparesis Diagnosed?**\n\nA gastric emptying test measures how quickly your stomach empties its contents into the small intestine. The test involves swallowing a radioactive substance that shows up on an X-ray. The test can take 1-4 hours to complete, depending on the type of test and the patient's symptoms.\n\n**What are the Symptoms of Gastroparesis?**\n\nThe symptoms of gastroparesis include:\n\n* Bloating\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting after eating\n* Abdominal pain\n* Malnutrition (due to poor digestion)\n\n**How is Gastroparesis Treated?**\n\nTreatment for gastroparesis usually involves changing your diet and eating habits. Your doctor may recommend:\n\n* Eating smaller, more frequent meals\n* Avoiding fatty or greasy foods\n* Drinking plenty of water\n* Taking medications to help manage symptoms\n\n**References:**\n\n* American College of Radiology\n* Banks KP, Syed K, Parekh M, et al.\n* Boston Children's Hospital\n* Cleveland Clinic\n* Familydoctor.org\n* International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders\n* Johns Hopkins Medicine\n* Mayo Clinic\n* Merck Manual Consumer Version\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n* RadiologyInfo.org\n* Thorsen Y, Stimec BV, Nesgaard JM, Ignjatovic D.\n* Verywell Health",

    "content": "**Gastric Bypass Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou were in the hospital to have gastric bypass surgery for weight loss. This article tells you what you need to know to take care of yourself in the days and weeks after the operation.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had gastric bypass surgery to help you lose weight. Your surgeon used staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section, called a pouch, and a larger bottom section. Then your surgeon sewed a section of your small intestine to a small opening in this small stomach pouch. The food you eat will now go into your small stomach pouch, then into your small intestine.\n\nYou probably spent 1 to 2 days in the hospital. When you go home you will be eating liquids or puréed foods. You should be able to move around without too much problem.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou will lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months. During this time, you may:\n\n* Have body aches\n* Feel tired and cold\n* Have dry skin\n* Have mood changes\n* Have hair loss or hair thinning\n\nThese problems should go away as your body gets used to your weight loss and your weight becomes stable. Because of this quick weight loss, you will need to be careful that you get all of the nutrition and vitamins you need as you recover.\n\nWeight loss slows down after 12 months.\n\n**Diet**\n\nYou will remain on liquid or puréed food for 2 or 3 weeks after surgery. You will slowly add soft foods and then regular food, as your health care provider told you to do. Remember to eat small portions and chew each bite very slowly and completely.\n\nDo not eat and drink at the same time. Drink fluids at least 30 minutes after you eat food. Drink slowly. Sip when you are drinking. Do not gulp. Your provider may tell you not to use a straw, as it may bring air into your stomach.\n\nYour provider will teach you about foods that you should eat and foods you should stay away from.\n\n**Activity**\n\nBeing active soon after surgery will help you recover more quickly. During the first week:\n\n* Start walking after surgery. Move around the house and shower, and use the stairs at home.\n* If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity.\n\nIf you have laparoscopic surgery, you should be able to do most of your regular activities in 2 to 4 weeks. It may take up to 6 weeks if you have open surgery.\n\nBefore this time, DO NOT:\n\n* Lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (5 to 7 kg) until you see your provider\n* Do any activity that involves pushing or pulling\n* Push yourself too hard. Increase how much you exercise slowly\n* Drive or use machinery if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. These medicines will make you drowsy. Driving and using machinery is not safe when you are taking them. Check with your provider about when you may start driving again after your operation.\n\nDO:\n\n* Take short walks and go up and down stairs.\n* Try getting up and moving around if you are having some pain in your belly. It may help.\n\nMake sure your home is set up for your recovery, to prevent falls and make sure you are safe in the bathroom.\n\nIf your provider says it is OK, you may start an exercise program 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.\n\nYou do not need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a 5- to 10-minute walk every day is a good start. Increase this amount until you are walking 15 minutes twice a day.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou may change the dressing every day if your provider tells you to do so. Be sure to change your dressing if it gets dirty or wet.\n\nYou may have bruising around your wounds. This is normal. It will go away on its own. The skin around your incisions may be a little red. This is normal, too.\n\nDo not wear tight clothing that rubs against your incisions while they heal.\n\nKeep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. If there are sutures (stitches) or staples, they will be removed about 7 to 10 days after surgery. Some stitches can dissolve on their own. Your provider will tell you if you have them.\n\nAsk your provider when it is safe to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision, but do not scrub or let the water beat down on it.\n\nDo not soak in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your provider says it is OK.\n\nPress a pillow over your incisions when you need to cough or sneeze.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nYou may need to take some medicines when you go home.\n\nYou may need to give yourself shots underneath the skin of a blood-thinning drug for 1 or more weeks to prevent a blood clot. Your provider will show you how.\nYou may need to take medicine to prevent gallstones.\nYou will need to take certain vitamins that your body may not absorb well from your food. These usually are multivitamins, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D.\nYou may need to take calcium and iron supplements as well.\n\nAspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and some other medicines may harm the lining of your stomach or even cause ulcers. Talk with your provider before you take these medicines.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nTo help you recover from surgery and manage all the changes in your lifestyle, you will see your surgeon and many other providers.\n\nBy the time you leave the hospital, you will likely have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your surgeon within 1 to 2 weeks. You will see your surgeon several more times in the first year after your surgery.\n\nYou may also have appointments with:\n\n* A nutritionist or dietitian, who will teach you how to eat correctly with your smaller stomach. You will also learn about what foods and drinks you should have after surgery.\n* A psychologist, who can help you follow your eating and exercise guidelines and deal with the feelings or concerns you may have after surgery.\nYou will need blood tests for the rest of your life to make sure that your body is getting enough vitamins and minerals from food after your surgery.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* You have more redness, pain, warmth, swelling, or bleeding around your incision.\n* You have trouble drinking the recommended amount of fluids.\n* The drainage from your incision does not decrease in 3 days or increases.\n* The drainage becomes thick, tan or yellow and has a bad smell (pus).\n* Your temperature is above 100°F (37.7°C) for more than 4 hours.\n* You have pain that your pain medicine is not helping.\n* You have trouble breathing.\n* You have a cough that does not go away.\n* You cannot drink or eat.\n* Your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.\n* Your stools are loose, or you have diarrhea.\n* You are vomiting after eating.\n* Your leg starts swelling.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Bypass Surgery - Discharge**\n\nYou were in the hospital to have gastric bypass surgery for weight loss.

    "content": "**Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\nGastric bypass is surgery that helps you lose weight by changing how your stomach and small intestine handle the food you eat.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou will have general anesthesia before this surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free.\n\nThere are 2 steps during gastric bypass surgery:\n\n* The first step makes your stomach smaller. Your surgeon uses staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section and a larger bottom section. The top section of your stomach (called the pouch) is where the food you eat will go. The pouch is about the size of a walnut. It holds only about 1 ounce (oz) or 28 grams (g) of food. Because of this, you will eat less and lose weight.\n* The second step is the bypass. Your surgeon connects a part of your small intestine (the jejunum) to a small hole in your pouch. The food you eat will now travel from the pouch into this new opening and into your small intestine below where it would normally go, thus bypassing part of your small intestine. As a result, your body will absorb fewer calories.\n\n**Advantages of Laparoscopy**\n\nLaparoscopic surgery has several advantages over open surgery:\n\n* Shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery\n* Less pain\n* Smaller scars and a lower risk for getting a hernia or infection\n\nThis surgery takes about 2 to 4 hours.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nWeight-loss surgery (also called metabolic and bariatric surgery or MBS) may be an option if you have moderate to high-risk obesity and have not been able to lose enough weight through diet, exercise, and medicines.\n\nHealth care providers often use the body mass index (BMI) and health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (diabetes that started in adulthood), asthma, and high blood pressure to determine which people are most likely to benefit from MBS.\n\nGastric bypass surgery is not a quick fix for obesity. It will greatly change your lifestyle. After this surgery, you must eat healthy foods, control portion sizes of what you eat, and exercise. If you do not follow these measures, you may have complications from the surgery, poor weight loss or can even continue to gain weight.\n\nBe sure to discuss the benefits and risks with your surgeon.\n\n**Risks**\n\nGastric bypass is major surgery and it has many risks. Some of these risks are very serious. You should discuss these risks with your surgeon.\n\nSome of the risks include:\n\n* Gastritis (inflamed stomach lining), heartburn, or stomach ulcers\n* Injury to the stomach, intestines, or other organs during surgery\n* Leaking from the line where parts of the stomach have been stapled together\n* Poor nutrition\n* Scarring inside your belly that could lead to a blockage in your bowel in the future\n* Vomiting from eating more than your stomach pouch can hold\n* Dumping syndrome (when food moves too rapidly from the stomach to the duodenum), especially after eating a meal rich in starches and sugars.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon will ask you to have tests and visits with other providers before you have this surgery. Some of these are:\n\n* A complete physical exam.\n* Blood tests, ultrasound of your gallbladder, and other tests to make sure you are healthy enough to have surgery.\n* Visits with your provider to make sure other medical problems you may have, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are under control.\n* Nutritional counseling.\n* Classes to help you learn what happens during the surgery, what you should expect afterward, and what risks or problems may occur afterward.\n\nYou must be able to make major changes in your lifestyle after surgery. If you smoke, you should stop several weeks before surgery and not start smoking again after surgery. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risks for problems such as wound infections. Tell your surgeon or provider if you need help quitting.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\n**During the Week Before Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMost people stay in the hospital for 1 to 4 days after surgery.\n\nIn the hospital:\n\n* You will be asked to sit on the side of the bed and walk a little on the same day you have surgery.\n* You may have a tube that goes through your nose into your stomach for 1 or 2 days. This tube helps drain fluids from your intestine.\n* You may have a catheter in your bladder to remove urine.\n* You will not be able to eat for the first 1 to 3 days. After that, you can have liquids and then pureed or soft foods.\n* You may have a tube connected to the larger part of your stomach that was bypassed. The tube will come out of your side and will drain fluids.\n* You will wear special stockings on your legs to help prevent blood clots from forming.\n* You will receive shots of medicine to prevent blood clots.\n* You will receive pain medicine. You will take pills for pain or receive pain medicine through an IV, a catheter that goes into your vein.\n\nYou will be able to go home when:\n\n* You can eat liquid or pureed food without vomiting.\n* You can move around without a lot of pain.\n* You do not need pain medicine through an IV or given by shot.\n\nBe sure to follow instructions for how to care for yourself at home.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\n**What to Expect After Surgery**\n\nAfter gastric bypass surgery, most people lose about 10 to 20 lbs (4.5 to 9 kgs) a month in the first year. Weight loss will decrease over time, but sticking to your diet and exercise program from the beginning will help you lose more weight.\n\nYou may lose half or more of your extra weight in the first 2 years. If you're still on a liquid or pureed diet, you'll lose weight quickly after surgery.\n\nLosing enough weight after surgery can improve many medical conditions, including:\n\n* Asthma\n* Arthritis\n* Heart or cardiovascular disease\n* Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n* High blood pressure\n* High cholesterol\n* Obstructive sleep apnea\n* Some cancers\n* Type 2 diabetes\n\nWeighing less will also make it easier for you to move around and do your everyday activities.\n\n**To Lose Weight and Avoid Complications**\n\nTo lose weight and avoid complications from the procedure, you'll need to follow the exercise and eating guidelines given to you by your provider and dietitian.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Bariatric surgery - gastric bypass\n* Roux-en-Y gastric bypass\n* Gastric bypass - Roux-en-Y\n* Weight-loss surgery - gastric bypass\n* Obesity surgery - gastric bypass\n* Metabolic and bariatric surgery or MBS\n\n**References**\n\n* Eisenberg D, Shikora SA, Aarts E, et al. 2022 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO): Indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery.

You will feel full with less food.\n*   The food you eat will no longer go into some parts of your small intestine that absorb the nutrients in food. Because of this, your body will not get all of the calories from the food you eat.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou will have general anesthesia before this surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free.\n\nThere are 2 steps during gastric bypass surgery:\n\n1.  The first step makes your stomach smaller. Your surgeon uses staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section and a larger bottom section. The top section of your stomach (called the pouch) is where the food you eat will go.

The food you eat will now travel from the pouch into this new opening and into your small intestine below where it would normally go, thus bypassing part of your small intestine. As a result, your body will absorb fewer calories.\n\n**Types of Surgery**\n\nGastric bypass can be done in two ways:\n\n*   **Open surgery**: Your surgeon makes a large surgical cut to open your belly. The bypass is done by working on your stomach, small intestine, and other organs.\n*   **Laparoscopic surgery**: This type of surgery uses a scope with a tiny camera, called a laparoscope. This camera is placed in your belly. The scope allows the surgeon to see inside your belly.\n\n**In Laparoscopic Surgery**\n\nYour surgeon will make several small cuts in your belly to insert the laparoscope and other instruments. The surgery is done through these small cuts.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\n**What is Gastric Bypass Surgery?**\n\nGastric bypass surgery is a type of weight-loss surgery that helps people with obesity lose weight and improve their health. During the surgery, the surgeon makes changes to the stomach and small intestine to reduce food intake and absorption of calories.\n\n**Types of Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\nThere are two main types of gastric bypass surgery: open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.\n\n*   **Open Surgery**: In this type of surgery, the surgeon makes a large incision in the abdomen to access the stomach and small intestine.\n*   **Laparoscopic Surgery**: This is a minimally invasive procedure where the surgeon uses a scope with a tiny camera (laparoscope) to visualize the internal organs. The surgeon makes 4 to 6 small cuts in the abdomen to insert the scope and instruments.\n\n**Advantages of Laparoscopy**\n\nLaparoscopic surgery has several advantages over open surgery, including:\n\n*   **Shorter Hospital Stay**: Patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery typically stay in the hospital for a shorter period compared to those who have open surgery.\n*   **Less Pain**: Laparoscopic surgery involves smaller incisions, which results in less pain and discomfort for the patient.\n*   **Smaller Scars**: The small cuts made during laparoscopic surgery leave smaller scars compared to the large incision made in open surgery.\n*   **Lower Risk of Hernia or Infection**: Laparoscopic surgery reduces the risk of hernia or infection, which are common complications associated with open surgery.\n\n**Why is Gastric Bypass Surgery Performed?**\n\nGastric bypass surgery may be recommended for individuals who have:\n\n*   A BMI of 35 kilograms/square meter (kg/m2) or more (class 2 or class 3 obesity)\n*   A BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 (class 1 obesity) and a serious medical condition that might improve with weight loss\n\n**Risks Associated with Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\nGastric bypass surgery, like any other major surgery, carries risks. Some of these risks are very serious and should be discussed with the surgeon before undergoing the procedure. Risks include:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots\n*   Heart problems\n*   Infections\n\nIt is essential to carefully consider the benefits and risks of gastric bypass surgery and discuss them with a healthcare provider before making a decision.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Bypass Surgery**\n\n**Risks of Having Anesthesia and Surgery**\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots\n* Heart problems\n* Infections\n\n**Risks of Gastric Bypass**\n\n* Gastritis (inflamed stomach lining), heartburn, or stomach ulcers\n* Injury to the stomach, intestines, or other organs during surgery\n* Leaking from the line where parts of the stomach have been stapled together\n* Poor nutrition\n* Scarring inside your belly that could lead to a blockage in your bowel in the future\n* Vomiting from eating more than your stomach pouch can hold\n* Dumping syndrome (when food moves too rapidly from the stomach to the duodenum), especially after eating a meal rich in starches and sugars.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYour surgeon will ask you to have tests and visits with other providers before you have this surgery.

You must be able to make major changes in your lifestyle after surgery.\n\nIf you smoke, you should stop several weeks before surgery and not start smoking again after surgery. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risks for problems such as wound infections. Tell your surgeon or provider if you need help quitting.\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\n**During the Week Before Your Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting.

This article provides an overview of the different types of surgeries, their benefits and risks, and what to expect during recovery.\n\n**Types of Weight Loss Surgeries**\n\nThere are several types of weight loss surgeries, each with its own benefits and risks. Some of the most common types include:\n\n*   **Roux-en-Y stomach surgery**: This is one of the most common types of weight loss surgery. It involves creating a small stomach pouch by stapling or cutting the top portion of the stomach.\n*   **Adjustable gastric banding**: In this procedure, an adjustable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch.\n*   **Vertical banded gastroplasty**: This type of surgery involves creating a small stomach pouch by stapling or cutting the top portion of the stomach and then placing a band around it to keep it closed.\n*   **Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)**: In this procedure, the surgeon removes a large portion of the stomach and reroutes the small intestine to reduce food absorption.\n*   **Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch**: This type of surgery involves removing a large portion of the stomach and rerouting the small intestine to reduce food absorption.\n\n**Benefits and Risks**\n\nWeight loss surgery can be an effective way to lose weight and improve overall health. However, it is not without risks. Some of the benefits include:\n\n*   **Significant weight loss**: Weight loss surgery can help individuals lose a significant amount of weight.\n*   **Improved health**: Weight loss surgery can help improve overall health by reducing the risk of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nHowever, there are also some risks associated with weight loss surgery. These include:\n\n*   **Surgical complications**: As with any type of surgery, there is a risk of surgical complications such as infection or bleeding.\n*   **Nutritional deficiencies**: Weight loss surgery can lead to nutritional deficiencies if the individual does not follow a balanced diet.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThe recovery process for weight loss surgery varies depending on the type of procedure. Generally, individuals will need to rest for several days after surgery and follow a liquid diet for several weeks. It is also important to attend regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider to ensure that the individual is healing properly.\n\nBy understanding the different types of weight loss surgeries, their benefits and risks, and what to expect during recovery, individuals can make an informed decision about whether weight loss surgery is right for them.",

    "content": "**Gastric Culture**\n\n_Gastric culture is a test to check a child's stomach contents for the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB)._\n\n## How the Test is Performed\n\nA flexible tube is gently placed through the child's nose and into the stomach. The child may be given a glass of water and asked to swallow while the tube is inserted. Once the tube is in the stomach, the health care provider uses a syringe to remove a sample of the stomach contents.\n\nThe tube is then gently removed through the nose. The sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish called a culture medium and watched for the growth of bacteria.\n\n## How to Prepare for the Test\n\nYour child will need to fast for 8 to 10 hours before the test. This means your child cannot eat and drink anything during that time.\n\nThe sample is collected in the morning. For this reason, your child may be admitted to the hospital the night before the test.

This method is used because some children cannot cough up and spit out mucus until about age 8. They swallow the mucus, instead. (That is why young children only rarely spread TB to others.)\n\nThe test may also be done to help identify viruses, fungi, and bacteria in the gastric contents of people with cancer, AIDS, or other conditions that cause a weakened immune system.\n\n## Normal Results\n\nThe bacteria that cause TB are not found in the stomach contents.\n\n## What Abnormal Results Mean\n\nIf the bacteria that cause TB grow from the gastric culture, TB is diagnosed. Because these bacteria grow slowly, it may take up to 6 weeks to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA test called a TB smear will be done first on the sample. If the results are positive, treatment may be started right away. Be aware that a negative TB smear result does not rule out TB.\n\n## Risks\n\nAnytime a nasogastric tube is inserted down the throat, there is a small chance it will enter the windpipe. If this happens, your child may cough, gasp, and have trouble breathing until the tube is removed. There is also a small chance that some of the stomach contents may enter the lung.\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Culture**\n\n_Gastric culture is a test to check a child's stomach contents for the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB)._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA flexible tube is gently placed through the child's nose and into the stomach.

    "content": "**Gastric Suction**\n\nGastric suction is a procedure to empty the contents of your stomach.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA tube is inserted through your nose or mouth, down the food pipe (esophagus), and into the stomach. Your throat may be numbed with medicine to reduce irritation and gagging caused by the tube. Stomach contents can be removed using suction right away or after irrigating water through the tube.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nIn an emergency, such as when a person has swallowed poison or is vomiting blood, no preparation is needed for gastric suction. If gastric suction is being done for testing, your health care provider may ask you not to eat overnight or to stop taking certain medicines.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel a gagging sensation as the tube is passed.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be done to:\n\n* Remove poisons, harmful materials, blood, or excess medicines from the stomach\n* Clean the stomach before an upper endoscopy (EGD) if you have been vomiting blood\n* Collect stomach acid\n* Relieve pressure if you have a blockage in the intestines\n* Stop frequent vomiting\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks may include:\n\n* Breathing in contents from the stomach (this is called aspiration)\n* Hole (perforation) in the esophagus\n* Placing the tube into the airway (windpipe) instead of the esophagus\n* Minor bleeding, including a nosebleed\n* Electrolyte imbalance\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Suction**\n\n**What is Gastric Suction?**\n\nGastric suction, also known as stomach pumping or nasogastric tube suction, is a medical procedure used to remove contents from the stomach. It can be performed using a nasogastric tube, which is inserted through the nose and guided into the stomach.\n\n**Why is Gastric Suction Performed?**\n\nGastric suction may be performed for several reasons:\n\n*   To remove poisons, harmful materials, blood, or excess medicines from the stomach\n*   To clean the stomach before an upper endoscopy (EGD) if you have been vomiting blood\n*   To collect stomach acid\n*   To relieve pressure if you have a blockage in the intestines\n*   To stop frequent vomiting\n\n**Risks Associated with Gastric Suction**\n\nWhile gastric suction is generally safe, there are some risks associated with the procedure:\n\n*   Breathing in contents from the stomach (aspiration)\n*   Hole (perforation) in the esophagus\n*   Placing the tube into the airway (windpipe) instead of the esophagus\n*   Minor bleeding, including a nosebleed\n*   Electrolyte imbalance\n\n**Alternative Names for Gastric Suction**\n\nGastric suction is also known by several other names:\n\n*   Gastric lavage\n*   Stomach pumping\n*   Nasogastric tube suction\n*   Bowel obstruction - suction\n\n**References**\n\nThe information provided in this article is based on the following references:\n\n*   Holstege CP, Borek HA.

A culture is a laboratory test that examines the tissue sample for bacteria and other organisms that can cause disease._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe tissue sample is removed during a procedure called upper endoscopy (or EGD). It is done with a flexible tube with a small camera (flexible endoscope) at the end. The scope is inserted down the throat into the stomach.\n\nYour health care provider sends the tissue sample to a laboratory where it is examined for signs of cancer, certain infections, or other problems.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. You will likely be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be done to diagnose a stomach ulcer or the cause of other stomach symptoms. These symptoms may include:\n\n* Loss of appetite or weight loss\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in the upper part of the belly\n* Black stools\n* Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material\n\nA gastric tissue biopsy and culture can help detect:\n\n* Cancer\n* Infections, most commonly Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria that can cause stomach or intestinal ulcers\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA gastric tissue biopsy is normal if it does not show cancer, other damage to the lining of the stomach, or signs of organisms that cause infection.\n\nA gastric tissue culture may be considered normal if it does not show certain bacteria. Stomach acids normally prevent too much bacteria from growing.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Stomach (gastric) cancer\n* Gastritis, when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen\n* Helicobacter pylori infection\n\n**Risks**\n\nYour provider will discuss the risks of the upper endoscopy procedure with you.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCulture - gastric tissue; Culture - stomach tissue; Biopsy - gastric tissue; Biopsy - stomach tissue; Upper endoscopy - gastric tissue biopsy; EGD - gastric tissue biopsy\n\n---\n\n**Gastric Tissue Biopsy and Culture**\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow instructions on how to prepare for the procedure.

Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\n\nMedicines that can increase the gastrin level include:\n\n* Stomach acid reducers, such as antacids\n* H2 blockers (cimetidine, nizatidine, and famotidine)\n* Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole, and several others)\n\nSome of these medicines are available without a prescription. Discuss non-prescription medicines you are taking with your provider.\n\nMedicines that can decrease gastrin level include:\n\n* Caffeine\n* Corticosteroids\n* Deserpidine, reserpine, and rescinnamine\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nGastrin is the main hormone that controls the release of acid in your stomach. When there is food in the stomach, gastrin is released into the blood. As the acid level rises in your stomach and intestines, your body normally makes less gastrin.\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a problem linked to an abnormal amount of gastrin. This includes peptic ulcer disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal values are generally less than 100 pg/mL (48.1 pmol/L).\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nToo much gastrin can cause severe peptic ulcer disease. A higher than normal level may be due to:\n\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* Long-term gastritis\n* Over-activity of the gastrin-producing cells in the stomach (G-cell hyperplasia)\n* Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach\n* Use of antacids or medicines to treat heartburn\n* Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a gastrin-producing tumor that may develop in the stomach or pancreas\n* Decreased ability of the stomach to produce acid\n* Previous stomach surgery\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Gastrin Blood Test**\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nCertain medicines may affect the results of this test.

It plays a crucial role in digestion and maintaining a healthy gut.\n\n**Why is the gastrin blood test important?**\n\nThe gastrin blood test is essential for diagnosing conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, where the stomach produces excessive amounts of gastrin, leading to severe ulcers. The test can also help identify other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n**How is the gastrin blood test performed?**\n\nThe test involves a simple blood draw from a vein in the arm. A healthcare professional will collect a sample of your blood and send it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**What are the normal results for the gastrin blood test?**\n\nNormal gastrin levels range from 0-120 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter). Elevated levels may indicate conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Feldman M, Friedman LS, Brandt LJ, eds.

This backflow can cause symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing.\n\n**Causes of GERD**\n\nThe exact causes of GERD are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:\n\n*   **Weakened lower esophageal sphincter (LES)**: The LES is a ring of muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach. When it becomes weakened, stomach acid can flow back into the esophagus.\n*   **Hiatal hernia**: A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm.\n*   **Overweight or obesity**: Being overweight or obese can put pressure on the stomach, causing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.\n*   **Eating habits**: Consuming foods that are high in fat, sugar, or spice can stimulate the production of stomach acid.\n\n**Symptoms of GERD**\n\nThe symptoms of GERD can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Heartburn**: A burning sensation in the chest and throat\n*   **Regurgitation**: Food coming back up into the mouth\n*   **Difficulty swallowing**: Feeling like food is stuck in the throat or chest\n*   **Coughing or wheezing**: In some cases, GERD can cause respiratory symptoms\n\n**Diagnosing GERD**\n\nTo diagnose GERD, a healthcare provider may perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Upper endoscopy (EGD)**: A flexible tube with a camera is inserted through the mouth to visualize the esophagus and stomach.\n*   **Ambulatory acid testing**: A small device is placed in the esophagus to measure the amount of acid flowing back into the esophagus.\n\n**Treatment options for GERD**\n\nTreatment options for GERD depend on the severity of symptoms and may include:\n\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Making dietary changes, losing weight if overweight or obese, and avoiding trigger foods\n*   **Medications**: Antacids, histamine-2 (H2) blockers, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce stomach acid production\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a hiatal hernia or strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter.\n\n**Patient instructions**\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with GERD, follow these patient instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid trigger foods**: Identify and avoid foods that trigger symptoms\n*   **Eat smaller meals**: Eating smaller meals can help reduce symptoms\n*   **Raise the head of your bed**: Raising the head of your bed by 6 inches can help prevent stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus\n*   **Take medications as directed**: Take medications as directed by your healthcare provider\n\n**Review date**\n\nThis article was last reviewed on October 30, 2024.",

    "content": "**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease - Children**\n\nGastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when the stomach contents leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach). This is also called reflux. GER can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen we eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) prevents swallowed food from moving back up.\n\nWhen this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nIn infants, this ring of muscles has not fully developed, and this can allow reflux. This is why babies often spit up after feeding. Reflux in infants goes away once this muscle develops, often by age 1 year.\n\nWhen symptoms continue or become worse, it may be a sign of GERD.\n\nCertain factors can lead to GERD in children, including:\n\n*   Birth defects, such as hiatal hernia\n*   Obesity\n*   Certain medicines\n*   Secondhand smoke\n*   Surgery of the upper abdomen\n*   Brain disorders, such as cerebral palsy\n*   Genetics\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of GERD in children and teens include:\n\n*   Nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting\n*   Reflux and heartburn\n*   Choking, chronic cough, or wheezing\n*   Hiccups or burps\n*   Not wanting to eat, eating only a small amount, or avoiding certain foods\n*   Weight loss or not gaining weight\n*   Feeling that food is stuck behind the breastbone or pain with swallowing\n*   Hoarseness or a change in voice\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour child may not need any tests if the symptoms are mild.\n\nA test called a barium swallow or upper GI may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. In this test, your child will swallow a chalky substance to highlight the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of his small intestine. It can show if liquid is backing up from the stomach into the esophagus or if anything is blocking or narrowing these areas.\n\nIf the symptoms do not improve, or they come back after the child has been treated with medicines, the health care provider may recommend a test. One test is called an upper endoscopy (EGD). The test:\n\n*   Is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat\n*   Examines the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine\n\nThe provider may also recommend tests to:\n\n*   Measure how often stomach acid enters esophagus\n*   Measure the pressure inside the lower part of the esophagus\n\n---\n\n**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease in Children**\n\n**What is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)?**\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a long-lasting problem where reflux occurs often.

The benefit of reducing fats in children is not as well proven.\n\nParents or caretakers who smoke should quit smoking. Never smoke around children. Secondhand smoke can cause GERD in children.\n\nIf your child's provider says it's OK to do so, you can give your child over-the-counter (OTC) acid suppressors. They help reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach. These medicines work slowly, but relieve the symptoms for a longer period. They include:\n\n*   Proton pump inhibitors\n*   H2 blockers\n\nYour child's provider may also suggest using antacids along with other medicines. Do not give your child any of these medicines without first checking with the provider.\n\nIf these treatment methods fail to manage symptoms, anti-reflux surgery may be an option for children with severe symptoms. For example, surgery may be considered in children who develop breathing problems.\n\nTalk with your child's provider about what options may be best for your child.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children respond well to treatment and to lifestyle changes. However, many children need to continue taking medicines to control their symptoms.\n\nChildren with GERD are more likely to have problems with reflux and heartburn as adults.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of GERD in children may include:\n\n*   Asthma that might get worse\n*   Damage to the lining of the esophagus, which may cause scarring and narrowing\n*   Ulcer in the esophagus (rare)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if symptoms do not improve with lifestyle changes. Also contact the provider if the child has these symptoms:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Choking (coughing, shortness of breath)\n*   Feeling full quickly when eating\n*   Frequent vomiting\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Trouble swallowing or pain with swallowing\n*   Weight loss\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can help reduce risk factors for GERD in children by taking these steps:\n\n*   Help your child stay at a healthy weight with a healthy diet and regular exercise.\n*   Never smoke around your child. Keep a smoke-free home and car.

In infants, GERD can cause symptoms like spitting up, refusal to feed, and poor weight gain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of GERD in children are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:\n\n*   **Overweight or obesity**: Excess weight can put pressure on the stomach, causing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.\n*   **Family history**: Children with a family history of GERD are more likely to develop the condition.\n*   **Food allergies or sensitivities**: Allergies or sensitivities to certain foods may trigger symptoms of GERD in some children.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of GERD in children can vary depending on their age and the severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Heartburn**: A burning sensation in the chest, usually after eating\n*   **Regurgitation**: Food coming back up into the mouth\n*   **Difficulty swallowing**: Trouble swallowing food or feeling like food is stuck in the throat\n*   **Coughing and wheezing**: In some cases, GERD can cause coughing and wheezing due to stomach acid flowing into the lungs\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing GERD in children typically involves a combination of:\n\n*   **Medical history**: A thorough review of the child's medical history, including symptoms, diet, and lifestyle\n*   **Physical examination**: A physical exam to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms\n*   **Diagnostic tests**: Tests such as an upper GI series or endoscopy may be ordered to visualize the esophagus and stomach\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for GERD in children depends on the severity of the condition and may include:\n\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Changes to diet, eating habits, and physical activity\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as antacids or acid reducers may be prescribed to reduce symptoms\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to treat complications of GERD\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent GERD in children, some strategies may help reduce the risk:\n\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight**: Encouraging healthy eating habits and regular physical activity can help prevent excess weight gain.\n*   **Breastfeeding**: Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of GERD in infants.\n*   **Avoiding triggers**: Identifying and avoiding food allergens or sensitivities may help alleviate symptoms.",

    "content": "**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease**\n\nGERD is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backward from the stomach into the esophagus (food pipe). Food travels from your mouth to the stomach through your esophagus. GERD can irritate the food pipe and cause heartburn and other symptoms.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).\n\nWhen this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus.\n\nThe risk factors for reflux include:\n\n*   Use of alcohol (possibly)\n*   Hiatal hernia (a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities)\n*   Obesity\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Scleroderma\n*   Smoking or tobacco use\n*   Lying down within 3 hours after eating\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of GERD include:\n\n*   Feeling that food is stuck behind the breastbone\n*   Heartburn or a burning pain in the chest\n*   Nausea after eating\n\nLess common symptoms are:\n\n*   Bringing food back up (regurgitation)\n*   Cough or wheezing\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Hiccups\n*   Hoarseness or change in voice\n*   Sore throat\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms such as avoiding tobacco, alcohol, or foods that cause your symptoms.\n\nOther tips include:\n\n*   If you are overweight or obese, in many cases, losing weight can help.\n*   Raise the head of the bed if your symptoms get worse at night.\n*   Have your dinner 2 to 3 hours before going to sleep. Avoid eating food after dinner.\n*   Avoid medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.\n*   Take all of your medicines with plenty of water. When your provider gives you a new medicine, ask whether it will make your heartburn worse.\n\nYou may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime, although the relief may not last very long. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.\n\nOther over-the-counter and prescription medicines can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, provider, or nurse can tell you how to take these medicines.\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach.\nH2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach.\n\nAnti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines. Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. But you may still need to take medicines for your heartburn.\n\nThere are also new therapies for reflux that can be performed through an endoscope (a flexible tube passed through the mouth into the stomach).\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Worsening of asthma\n*   A change in the lining of the esophagus that can increase the risk of cancer (Barrett esophagus)\n*   Bronchospasm (irritation and spasm of the airways due to acid)\n*   Long-term (chronic) cough or hoarseness\n*   Dental problems\n*   Ulcer in the esophagus\n*   Stricture (a narrowing of the esophagus due to scarring from chronic irritation)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if symptoms do not improve with lifestyle changes or medicine.\n\nAlso contact if you have:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Choking (coughing, shortness of breath)\n*   Feeling filled up quickly when eating\n*   Frequent vomiting\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Trouble swallowing (dysphagia) or pain with swallowing (odynophagia)\n*   Weight loss\n*   A feeling like food or pills are sticking behind the breast bone\n\n---\n\n**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**\n\nGERD is a condition where the stomach contents leak backward into the esophagus, irritating the food pipe and causing heartburn and other symptoms.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen you eat, food passes from your throat to your stomach through your esophagus.

If your symptoms are severe or they come back after you have been treated, your provider may recommend a test called an upper endoscopy (EGD).\n\nThis is a test to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. It is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat.\n\nYou may also be recommended to have one or more of the following tests:\n\n*   A test that measures how often stomach acid enters the esophagus\n*   A test to measure the pressure inside the lower part of the esophagus (esophageal manometry)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms, such as:\n\n*   Avoiding tobacco, alcohol, or foods that cause your symptoms\n*   If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can help\n*   Raising the head of the bed if your symptoms get worse at night\n*   Having your dinner 2 to 3 hours before going to sleep and avoiding eating food after dinner\n\nYou may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime.

The exact cause of GERD is unknown, but several factors can contribute to its development:\n\n*   **Weakened lower esophageal sphincter**: A weakened lower esophageal sphincter (LES) allows stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.\n*   **Hiatal hernia**: A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm.\n*   **Overweight or obesity**: Being overweight or obese can put pressure on the stomach, causing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.\n*   **Certain foods**: Consuming certain foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, and spicy dishes can trigger symptoms of GERD.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of GERD can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Heartburn**: A burning sensation in the chest that worsens after eating or at night.\n*   **Regurgitation**: Food coming back up into the mouth.\n*   **Difficulty swallowing**: In severe cases, food may get stuck in the esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose GERD, healthcare providers typically perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Upper endoscopy**: A flexible tube with a camera is inserted through the mouth to visualize the esophagus and stomach.\n*   **Ambulatory acid testing**: A small device is placed in the esophagus to measure the amount of acid flowing back into the esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for GERD depends on the severity of symptoms. Mild cases may be treated with lifestyle changes, such as:\n\n*   **Dietary modifications**: Avoiding trigger foods and eating smaller, more frequent meals.\n*   **Weight loss**: Losing weight can help reduce pressure on the stomach.\n\nMore severe cases may require medication or surgery. Medications used to treat GERD include:\n\n*   **H2 blockers**: Reducing the production of stomach acid.\n*   **Proton pump inhibitors**: Blocking the production of stomach acid.\n*   **Antacids**: Neutralizing stomach acid.\n\nIn severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a hiatal hernia or strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter.",

    "content": "**Gastrointestinal Bleeding**\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding refers to any bleeding that starts in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Types of GI Bleeding**\n\n*   **Upper GI bleeding**: The upper GI tract includes the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.\n*   **Lower GI bleeding**: The lower GI tract includes most of the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe amount of GI bleeding may be so small that it can only be detected on a lab test, such as the fecal occult blood test. Other signs of GI bleeding include:\n\n*   Dark, tarry stools\n*   Larger amounts of blood passed from the rectum\n*   Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl, on toilet paper, or in streaks on stool (feces)\n*   Vomiting blood\n\nMassive bleeding from the GI tract can be dangerous. However, even very small amounts of bleeding that occur over a long period of time can lead to problems such as anemia or low blood counts.\n\n**Causes**\n\nGI bleeding may be due to conditions that are not serious, including:\n\n*   Anal fissure\n*   Hemorrhoids\n\nGI bleeding may also be a sign of more serious diseases and conditions. These may include cancers of the GI tract, such as:\n\n*   Cancer of the colon\n*   Cancer of the small intestine\n*   Cancer of the stomach\n*   Intestinal polyps (a pre-cancerous condition)\n\nOther causes of GI bleeding may include:\n\n*   Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (also called angiodysplasia)\n*   Bleeding diverticulum, or diverticulosis\n*   Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis\n*   Esophageal varices\n*   Esophagitis\n*   Gastric (stomach) ulcer\n*   Intussusception (bowel telescoped on itself)\n*   Mallory-Weiss tear\n*   Meckel diverticulum\n*   Radiation injury to the bowel\n\n**Home Care**\n\nThere are home stool tests for microscopic blood that may be recommended for people with anemia or for colon cancer screening.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n*   You have black, tarry stools (this may be a sign of GI bleeding)\n*   You have blood in your stool\n*   You vomit blood or you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider may discover GI bleeding during an exam at your office visit.\n\nGI bleeding can be an emergency condition that requires immediate medical care. Treatment may involve:\n\n*   Blood transfusions.\n*   Fluids and medicines through a vein.\n*   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). A thin tube with a camera on the end is passed through your mouth into your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.\n*   A tube that is placed through your mouth into the stomach to drain the stomach contents (gastric lavage).\n\nOnce your condition is stable, you will have a physical exam and a detailed exam of your abdomen. You will also be asked questions about your symptoms, including:\n\n*   When did you first notice symptoms?\n*   Did you have black, tarry stools or red blood in the stools?\n*   Have you vomited blood?\n*   Did you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds?\n*   Do you have a history of peptic or duodenal ulcers?\n*   Have you ever had symptoms like this before?\n*   What other symptoms do you have?\n\n**Tests That May Be Done**\n\n*   Abdominal CT scan\n*   Abdominal MRI scan\n*   Abdominal x-ray\n*   Angiography\n*   Bleeding scan (tagged red blood cell scan)\n*   Blood clotting tests\n*   Capsule endoscopy (camera shaped like a pill that is swallowed to look at the small intestine)\n*   Colonoscopy\n*   Complete blood count (CBC), clotting tests, platelet count, and other laboratory tests\n*   EGD\n*   Enteroscopy\n*   Sigmoidoscopy\n\n---\n\n**Gastrointestinal Bleeding**\n\n**What is Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding?**\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding refers to any bleeding that starts in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Types of GI Bleeding**\n\nBleeding may come from any site along the GI tract, but is often divided into:\n\n* Upper GI bleeding: The upper GI tract includes the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach), stomach, and first part of the small intestine (duodenum).\n* Lower GI bleeding: The lower GI tract includes most of the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.\n\n**Signs of GI Bleeding**\n\nThe amount of GI bleeding may be so small that it can only be detected on a lab test, such as the fecal occult blood test. Other signs of GI bleeding include:\n\n* Dark, tarry stools\n* Larger amounts of blood passed from the rectum\n* Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl, on toilet paper, or in streaks on stool (feces)\n* Vomiting blood\n\n**Causes of GI Bleeding**\n\nGI bleeding may be due to conditions that are not serious, including:\n\n* Anal fissure\n* Hemorrhoids\n\nGI bleeding may also be a sign of more serious diseases and conditions. These may include cancers of the GI tract, such as:\n\n* Cancer of the colon\n* Cancer of the small intestine\n* Cancer of the stomach\n* Intestinal polyps (a pre-cancerous condition)\n\nOther causes of GI bleeding may include:\n\n* Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (also called angiodysplasia)\n* Bleeding diverticulum, or diverticulosis\n* Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis\n* Esophageal varices\n* Esophagitis\n* Gastric (stomach) ulcer\n* Intussusception (bowel telescoped on itself)\n* Mallory-Weiss tear\n* Meckel diverticulum\n* Radiation injury to the bowel\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n* You have black, tarry stools (this may be a sign of GI bleeding)\n* You have blood in your stool\n* You vomit blood or you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds\n\n---\n\n**Gastrointestinal Bleeding**\n\n**What is Gastrointestinal Bleeding?**\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can be an emergency condition that requires immediate medical care. It occurs when there is bleeding in the digestive tract, which can lead to symptoms such as black, tarry stools or red blood in the stool.\n\n**Symptoms of GI Bleeding**\n\nSome common symptoms of GI bleeding include:\n\n*   Black, tarry stools\n*   Red blood in the stool\n*   Vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds\n*   A history of peptic or duodenal ulcers\n\n**Tests for Diagnosing GI Bleeding**\n\nThe following tests may be done to diagnose GI bleeding:\n\n*   Abdominal CT scan\n*   Abdominal MRI scan\n*   Abdominal x-ray\n*   Angiography\n*   Bleeding scan (tagged red blood cell scan)\n*   Blood clotting tests\n*   Capsule endoscopy (camera shaped like a pill that is swallowed to look at the small intestine)\n*   Colonoscopy\n*   Complete blood count (CBC), clotting tests, platelet count, and other laboratory tests\n*   EGD\n*   Enteroscopy\n*   Sigmoidoscopy\n\n**Treatment for GI Bleeding**\n\nTreatment may involve:\n\n*   Blood transfusions\n*   Fluids and medicines through a vein\n*   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)\n*   A tube that is placed through your mouth into the stomach to drain the stomach contents (gastric lavage)\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nDuring an office visit, you will have a physical exam and a detailed exam of your abdomen. You will also be asked questions about your symptoms, including:\n\n*   When did you first notice symptoms?\n*   Did you have black, tarry stools or red blood in the stools?\n*   Have you vomited blood?\n*   Did you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds?\n*   Do you have a history of peptic or duodenal ulcers?\n*   Have you ever had symptoms like this before?\n*   What other symptoms do you have?",

    "content": "**Gastroschisis Repair**\n\nGastroschisis repair is a procedure done on an infant to correct a birth defect that causes an opening in the skin and muscles covering the belly (abdominal wall). The opening allows the intestines and sometimes other organs to bulge outside the belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nThe goal of the procedure is to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. Repair may be done right after the baby is born. This is called a primary repair. Or, the repair is done in stages. This is called a staged repair.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Primary Repair**\n\nSurgery for primary repair is done in the following way:\n\n*   If possible, the surgery is performed the day your baby is born.\n*   Right after birth, the intestine that is outside the belly is placed in a special bag or is covered with a plastic wrap to protect it.\n*   Your baby is then prepared for surgery.\n*   Your baby receives general anesthesia. This is medicine that allows your baby to sleep and be pain-free during the operation.\n*   The surgeon examines your baby's intestine (bowel) closely for signs of damage or other birth defects. Unhealthy parts are removed. The healthy edges are stitched together.\n*   The intestine is placed back into the belly.\n*   The opening in the wall of the belly is repaired.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Staged Repair**\n\nThe staged repair is done when your baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. It may also be done if the baby's intestine is very swollen or there is a large amount of intestine outside the body. Or, it is done when the baby's belly isn't large enough to contain all of the intestine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nGastroschisis is a life-threatening condition. It needs to be treated soon after birth so that the baby's organs can develop and be protected in the belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n\nRisks for gastroschisis repair are:\n\n*   Breathing problems if the baby's belly area (abdominal space) is smaller than normal. The baby may need a breathing tube and breathing machine for a few days or weeks after surgery.\n*   Inflammation of tissues that line the wall of the abdomen and cover the abdominal organs.\n*   Organ injury.\n*   Problems with digestion and absorbing nutrients from food, if a baby has a lot of damage to the small bowel.\n*   Temporary paralysis (intestinal muscles stop moving) of the small bowel.\n*   Abdominal wall hernia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nGastroschisis is usually seen on ultrasound before the baby is born. The ultrasound may show loops of bowel freely floating outside the baby's belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter surgery, your baby will receive care in the NICU. Your baby will be placed in a special bed to keep warm.\n\nYour baby may need to be on a breathing machine until organ swelling has decreased and the size of the belly area has increased.\n\nOther treatments your baby will probably need after surgery are:\n\n*   A nasogastric (NG) tube placed through the nose to drain the stomach and keep it empty.\n*   Antibiotics.\n*   Fluids and nutrients given through a vein.\n*   Oxygen.\n*   Pain medicines.\n\nFeedings are started through the NG tube as soon as your baby's bowel starts functioning after surgery. Feedings by mouth will start very slowly. Your baby may eat slowly and may need feeding therapy, lots of encouragement, and time to recover after a feeding.\n\nThe average stay in the hospital is a few weeks up to a few months. You may be able to take your baby home once they start taking all foods by mouth and gaining weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter you go home, your child may develop a blockage in the intestines (bowel obstruction) due to a kink or scar in the intestines. The health care provider can tell you how this will be treated.\n\nMost of the time, gastroschisis can be corrected with one or two surgeries. How well your baby does will depend on how much damage there was to the intestine.\n\nAfter recovering from surgery, most children with gastroschisis do very well and live normal lives. Most babies who are born with gastroschisis do not have any other birth defects.\n\n---\n\n**Gastroschisis Repair**\n\n_Gastroschisis repair is a procedure done on an infant to correct a birth defect that causes an opening in the skin and muscles covering the belly (abdominal wall). The opening allows the intestines and sometimes other organs to bulge outside the belly._\n\n**Description**\n\nThe goal of the procedure is to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. Repair may be done right after the baby is born. This is called a primary repair. Or, the repair is done in stages. This is called a staged repair.\n\n_Surgery for Primary Repair_\n\nIf possible, the surgery is performed the day your baby is born. This surgery is done when there is only a small amount of intestine outside the belly and the intestine isn't very swollen.\n\n* Right after birth, the intestine that is outside the belly is placed in a special bag or is covered with a plastic wrap to protect it.\n* Your baby is then prepared for surgery.\n* Your baby receives general anesthesia. This is medicine that allows your baby to sleep and be pain-free during the operation.\n* The surgeon examines your baby's intestine (bowel) closely for signs of damage or other birth defects. Unhealthy parts are removed. The healthy edges are stitched together.\n* The intestine is placed back into the belly.\n* The opening in the wall of the belly is repaired.\n\n_Surgery for Staged Repair_\n\nStaged repair is done when your baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. It may also be done if the baby's intestine is very swollen or there is a large amount of intestine outside the body. Or, it is done when the baby's belly isn't large enough to contain all of the intestine.\n\n* Right after birth, the baby's intestine and any other organs that are outside the belly are placed in a long plastic pouch. This pouch is called a silo. The silo is then attached to the baby's belly.\n* The other end of the silo is hung above the baby. This allows gravity to help the intestine to slip into the belly. Each day, the health care provider also gently tightens the silo to push the intestine into the belly.\n* It may take up to 2 weeks for all of the intestine and any other organs to be back inside the belly. The silo is then removed. The opening in the belly is repaired.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nGastroschisis is a life-threatening condition. It needs to be treated soon after birth so that the baby's organs can develop and be protected in the belly.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\nRisks for gastroschisis repair are:\n\n* Breathing problems if the baby's belly area (abdominal space) is smaller than normal. The baby may need a breathing tube and breathing machine for a few days or weeks after surgery.\n* Inflammation of tissues that line the wall of the abdomen and cover the abdominal organs.\n* Organ injury.\n* Problems with digestion and absorbing nutrients from food, if a baby has a lot of damage to the small bowel.\n* Temporary paralysis (intestinal muscles stop moving) of the small bowel.\n* Abdominal wall hernia.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nGastroschisis is usually seen on ultrasound before the baby is born. The ultrasound may show loops of bowel freely floating outside the baby's belly.\n\nAfter gastroschisis is found, your baby will be followed very closely to make sure they are growing.\n\nYour baby should be delivered at a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and a pediatric surgeon. A NICU is set up to handle emergencies that occur at birth. A pediatric surgeon has special training in surgery for babies and children. Most babies who are known to have gastroschisis are delivered by cesarean section (C-section).\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter surgery, your baby will receive care in the NICU. Your baby will be placed in a special bed to keep warm.\n\nYour baby may need to be on a breathing machine until organ swelling has decreased and the size of the belly area has increased.\n\nOther treatments your baby will probably need after surgery are:\n\n* A nasogastric (NG) tube placed through the nose to drain the stomach and keep it empty.\n* Antibiotics.\n* Fluids and nutrients given through a vein.\n* Oxygen.\n* Pain medicines.\n\nFeedings are started through the NG tube as soon as your baby's bowel starts functioning after surgery. Feedings by mouth will start very slowly. Your baby may eat slowly and may need feeding therapy, lots of encouragement, and time to recover after a feeding.\n\nThe average stay in the hospital is a few weeks up to a few months. You may be able to take your baby home once they start taking all foods by mouth and gaining weight.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter you go home, your child may develop a blockage in the intestines (bowel obstruction) due to a kink or scar in the intestines. The health care provider can tell you how this will be treated.\n\nMost of the time, gastroschisis can be corrected with one or two surgeries. How well your baby does will depend on how much damage there was to the intestine.\n\nAfter recovering from surgery, most children with gastroschisis do very well and live normal lives. Most babies who are born with gastroschisis do not have any other birth defects.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAbdominal wall defect repair - gastroschisis\n\n---\n\n**Gastroschisis Repair**\n\n**What is Gastroschisis?**\n\nGastroschisis is a life-threatening condition where the baby's intestines protrude through a hole in their belly button. It needs to be treated soon after birth so that the baby's organs can develop and be protected in the belly.\n\n**Procedure for Primary Repair**\n\nThe goal of the procedure is to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. Surgery for primary repair is done in the following way:\n\n*   If possible, the surgery is performed the day your baby is born.\n*   Right after birth, the intestine that is outside the belly is placed in a special bag or is covered with a plastic wrap to protect it.\n*   Your baby receives general anesthesia. This is medicine that allows your baby to sleep and be pain-free during the operation.\n*   The surgeon examines your baby's intestine (bowel) closely for signs of damage or other birth defects. Unhealthy parts are removed. The healthy edges are stitched together.\n*   The intestine is placed back into the belly.\n*   The opening in the wall of the belly is repaired.\n\n**Procedure for Staged Repair**\n\nStaged repair is done when your baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. It may also be done if the baby's intestine is very swollen or there is a large amount of intestine outside the body. Or, it is done when the baby's belly isn't large enough to contain all of the intestine. The repair is performed the following way:\n\n*   Right after birth, the baby's intestine and any other organs that are outside the belly are placed in a long plastic pouch. This pouch is called a silo.\n*   The silo is then attached to the baby's belly.\n*   The other end of the silo is hung above the baby. This allows gravity to help the intestine to slip into the belly.\n*   Each day, the health care provider also gently tightens the silo to push the intestine into the belly.\n*   It may take up to 2 weeks for all of the intestine and any other organs to be back inside the belly. The silo is then removed. The opening in the belly is repaired.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n\nRisks for gastroschisis repair are:\n\n*   Breathing problems if the baby's belly area (abdominal space) is smaller than normal. The baby may need a breathing tube and breathing machine for a few days or weeks after surgery.\n*   Inflammation of tissues that line the wall of the abdomen and cover the abdominal organs.\n*   Organ injury.\n*   Problems with digestion and absorbing nutrients from food, if a baby has a lot of damage to the small bowel.\n*   Temporary paralysis (intestinal muscles stop moving) of the small bowel.\n*   Abdominal wall hernia.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nGastroschisis is usually seen on ultrasound before the baby is born. The ultrasound may show loops of bowel freely floating outside the baby's belly.\n\nAfter gastroschisis is found, your baby will be followed very closely to make sure they are growing.\n\nYour baby should be delivered at a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and a pediatric surgeon.

    "content": "**Gastroschisis**\n\nGastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant's intestines are outside of the body because of a hole in the abdominal wall.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBabies with gastroschisis are born with a hole in the abdominal wall. The child's intestines often stick out (protrude) through the hole.\n\nThe condition looks similar to an omphalocele. An omphalocele, however, is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. With gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane.\n\nAbdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestine and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries, or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with gastroschisis, the intestines (and sometimes the stomach) remain outside the abdominal wall, without a membrane covering them. The exact cause of abdominal wall defects is not known.\n\nMothers with the following may be at higher risk of having babies with gastroschisis:\n\n* Younger age\n* Fewer resources\n* Poor nutrition during pregnancy\n* Use of tobacco, illicit drugs, and alcohol\n* Exposure to nitrosamine (a chemical found in some foods, cosmetics, cigarettes)\n* Use of aspirin or ibuprofen\n* Use of decongestants that have the chemical pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine\n\nBabies with gastroschisis usually do not have other related birth defects.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA gastroschisis is usually seen during a prenatal ultrasound. It can also be seen when the baby is born. There is a hole in the abdominal wall. The small intestine is often outside the abdomen near the umbilical cord. Other organs that may also be outside the abdomen are the large intestine, stomach, and/or gallbladder.\n\nUsually the intestine is irritated by the exposure to amniotic fluid. The baby may have problems absorbing food.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nPrenatal ultrasounds often identify infants with gastroschisis before birth, usually by 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf gastroschisis is found before birth, the mother will need special monitoring to make sure her unborn baby remains healthy.\n\nTreatment for gastroschisis involves surgery. Usually the infant's abdominal cavity is too small for the intestine to fit back in at birth. So, a mesh sack is stitched around the borders of the defect and the edges of the defect are pulled up. The sack is called a silo. Over the next week or two, the intestine returns into the abdominal cavity and the defect can then be closed.\n\nThe baby's temperature must be carefully controlled, because the exposed intestine allows body heat to escape. Because of the pressure involved in returning the intestines to the abdomen, the baby may need breathing support with a ventilator. Other treatments for the baby include nutrients by IV and antibiotics to prevent infection. Even after the defect is closed, IV nutrition will continue as milk feedings must be introduced slowly.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe baby has a good chance of recovering if there are no other problems and if the abdominal cavity is large enough. A very small abdominal cavity may result in complications that require more surgeries.\n\nPlans should be made for careful delivery and immediate management of the problem after birth. The baby should be delivered in a medical center that is skilled at repairing abdominal wall defects. Babies are likely to do better if they do not need to be taken to another center for further treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBecause of the exposure to amniotic fluid, babies' intestines may not work normally even after the organs are put back inside the abdominal cavity. Babies with gastroschisis need time for their intestines to recover and become used to taking feedings.\n\nA small number of babies with gastroschisis (about 10 to 20%) may have intestinal atresia (parts of the intestines that did not develop in the womb). These babies require further surgery to relieve obstruction.\n\nThe increased pressure from the misplaced abdominal contents can decrease blood flow to the intestines and kidneys and cause more long-term damage. It can also make it difficult for the baby to expand the lungs, leading to breathing problems.\n\nAnother possible complication is bowel death leading to necrosis of the bowel. This occurs when intestinal tissue dies due to low blood flow or infection. This risk may be reduced in babies who receive breast milk rather than formula.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nThis problem is diagnosed and treated in the hospital right after birth. After returning home, contact your health care provider if your baby develops any of these symptoms:\n\n* Decreased bowel movements\n* Feeding problems\n* Fever\n* Green or yellowish green vomit\n* Swollen belly area\n* Vomiting (different than normal baby spit-up)\n* Worrisome behavioral changes\n\n---\n\n**Gastroschisis**\n\n_Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant's intestines are outside of the body because of a hole in the abdominal wall._\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Babies with gastroschisis are born with a hole in the abdominal wall.

Many parents have done this with good results.\n\nYou will quickly get used to feeding your child through the tube, or button. It will take about the same time as a regular feeding, around 20 to 30 minutes. There are two ways to feed through the system: the syringe method and the gravity method. Each method is described below. Make sure you follow all of the instructions given to you by your health care provider as well.\n\nYour provider will tell you the right mix of formula or blended feedings to use, and how often to feed your child. Have this food ready at room temperature before you start, by taking it out of the refrigerator for about 30 to 40 minutes. Do not add more formula or solid foods before you talk to your child's provider.\n\n**Caring for the G-tube Site**\n\nYou will clean your child's skin around the G-tube 1 to 3 times a day with mild soap and water. Try to remove any drainage or crusting on the skin and tube. Be gentle.

Hang the bag high on a hook and squeeze the drip chamber below the bag to fill it halfway with food. Next, open the clamp so that the food fills the long tube with no air left in the tube. Close the clamp. Insert the catheter into the G-tube. Open toward the clamp and adjust the feeding rate, following your provider's instructions.\n*   **Using a G-Button or MIC-KEY**: Attach the feeding tube to the feeding system first, and then fill it with formula or food. Release the clamp when you are ready to adjust the feeding rate, following your provider's instructions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Feeding Your Child With the Syringe Method**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Preparation**: Wash your hands. Gather your supplies (a syringe, feeding tube, extension set if needed for a G-button or MIC-KEY, measuring cup with spout, room temperature food, water, rubber band, clamp, and safety pin). Check that your formula or food is warm or at room temperature by putting a few droplets on your wrist.\n*   **Using the Syringe Method**: If your child has a G-tube: Insert the syringe into the open end of the feeding tube. Pour the formula into the syringe until it is half full and unclamp the tube. If you are using a G-button, or MIC-KEY, system: Open the flap and insert the bolus feeding tube. Insert the syringe into the open end of the extension set and clamp the extension set. Pour the food into the syringe until it is half full. Unclamp the extension set briefly to fill it full of food and then close the clamp again.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Adding Water**: When you are finished feeding, your nurse may recommend that you add water to the tube to flush it out.\n*   **Removing the Tube**: G-tubes will then need to be clamped at the tube and the feeding system removed. For a G-button or MIC-KEY, you will close the clamp and then remove the tube.\n\n---\n\n**Gastrostomy Feeding Tube - Bolus**\n\nIf your child has a G-tube:\n\n1. Insert the syringe into the open end of the feeding tube.\n2. Pour the formula into the syringe until it is half full and unclamp the tube.\n\nIf you are using a G-button, or MIC-KEY, system:\n\n1. Open the flap and insert the bolus feeding tube.\n2. Insert the syringe into the open end of the extension set and clamp the extension set.\n3. Pour the food into the syringe until it is half full. Unclamp the extension set briefly to fill it full of food and then close the clamp again.\n4. Open the button flap and connect the extension set to the button.\n5. Unclamp the extension set to begin feeding.\n\n**Tips for Feeding**\n\n* Check that your formula or food is warm or at room temperature by putting a few droplets on your wrist.\n* Hold the tip of the syringe no higher than your child's shoulders. If the food is not flowing, squeeze the tube in downward strokes to bring the food down.\n* You can wrap a rubber band around the syringe and safety pin it to the top of your shirt so that your hands are free.\n\n**When Finished Feeding**\n\n* Your nurse may recommend that you add water to the tube to flush it out. G-tubes will then need to be clamped at the tube and the feeding system, and removed. For a G-button or MIC-KEY, you will close the clamp and then remove the tube.\n* Follow these steps:\n\t+ If your child has a G-tube: Clamp the tube and the feeding system, and remove the syringe.\n\t+ If you are using a G-button, or MIC-KEY, system: Close the clamp and then remove the tube.\n\n**Bloating After Feeding**\n\nIf your child's belly becomes hard or swollen after a feeding, try venting, or burping the tube or button:\n\n* Attach an empty syringe to the G-tube and unclamp it to allow air to flow out.\n* Attach the extension set to the MIC-KEY button and open the tube for the air to release.\n* Ask your provider for a special decompression tube for burping the Bard Button.\n\n**Giving Medicines to Your Child**\n\nSometimes you may need to give medicines to your child through the tube. Follow these guidelines:\n\n* Try to give your child medicine before a feeding so that they work better. You may also be asked to give your child medicines on an empty stomach outside of mealtime.\n* The medicine should be liquid, or finely crushed and dissolved in water, so that the tube does not get blocked. Check with your provider or pharmacist on how to do this.\n* Always flush the tube with a little water between medicines. This will make sure that all the medicine goes in the stomach and is not left in the feeding tube.\n* Never mix medicines.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your child's provider if your child:\n\n* Seems hungry after the feeding\n* Has diarrhea after feedings\n* Has a hard and swollen belly 1 hour after feedings\n* Seems to be in pain\n* Has changes in their condition\n* Is on new medicine\n* Is constipated and passing hard, dry stools\n\nAlso contact the provider if:\n\n* The feeding tube has come out and you do not know how to replace it.\n* There is leakage around the tube or system.\n* There is redness or irritation on the skin area around the tube.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFeeding - gastrostomy tube - bolus; G-tube - bolus; Gastrostomy button - bolus; Bard Button - bolus; MIC-KEY - bolus\n\n---\n\n**Gastrostomy Feeding Tube - Bolus**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a gastrostomy feeding tube?**\n\nA gastrostomy feeding tube, also known as a G-tube, is a medical device inserted into the stomach through an opening in the abdomen. It allows for direct delivery of food and nutrients into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who needs a gastrostomy feeding tube?**\n\nGastrostomy feeding tubes are typically used for individuals who have difficulty swallowing or digesting food, such as those with cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, esophageal cancer, or failure to thrive. They may also be used for patients undergoing esophagectomy (removal of the esophagus) or experiencing swallowing problems due to conditions like Crohn disease, multiple sclerosis, pancreatitis, stroke, or ulcerative colitis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is a gastrostomy feeding tube inserted?**\n\nThe insertion procedure involves making an opening in the abdomen and inserting a flexible tube into the stomach. The tube is then secured in place with a balloon or other device to prevent it from coming out.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits of a gastrostomy feeding tube?**\n\nGastrostomy feeding tubes provide several benefits, including:\n\n*   Direct delivery of food and nutrients into the stomach\n*   Reduced risk of aspiration pneumonia\n*   Improved nutrition and hydration for individuals with swallowing difficulties\n*   Increased comfort and convenience for patients who have difficulty eating or digesting food\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you are a patient undergoing gastrostomy feeding tube insertion, be sure to follow these instructions:\n\n*   Follow your healthcare provider's advice on diet and nutrition\n*   Report any changes in your symptoms or discomfort to your healthcare provider\n*   Practice good hygiene and wound care to prevent infection",

    "title": "Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605012.html",
    "content": "**Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nGatifloxacin ophthalmic solution is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye; infection of the membrane that covers the outside of the eyeballs and the inside of the eyelids) in adults and children 1 year of age and older. Gatifloxacin is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nGatifloxacin comes as an ophthalmic solution (liquid) to be instilled in the eyes. It is usually instilled every 2 hours while awake (up to eight times a day) for 2 days, and then two to four times a day for 5 days. Instill gatifloxacin eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou should expect your symptoms to improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not go away or get worse, or if you develop other problems with your eyes during your treatment.\n\nUse gatifloxacin eye drops until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using gatifloxacin eye drops too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n*   Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n*   Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n*   If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n*   Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of gatifloxacin, use it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then to use the medication and skip the missed dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up for a missed dose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nGatifloxacin may cause some people to become dizzy or drowsy. Make sure you know how you react to gatifloxacin before you drive, operate machinery, perform other dangerous activities, or engage in tasks that require alertness.\n\nOther side effects of gatifloxacin may include:\n\n*   Eye irritation\n*   Redness of the eye\n*   Itching of the eye\n*   Burning sensation when putting in the drops\n\nThese side effects usually do not need medical attention. However, if they are severe or if you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n*   Severe eye irritation\n*   Severe redness of the eye\n*   Severe itching of the eye\n*   Burning sensation when putting in the drops\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution away from children and pets.

    "content": "**Gaucher Disease**\n\n**Summary**\n\nGaucher disease is a rare, inherited disorder that affects lipid metabolism. It occurs when the body lacks enough of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase, causing a buildup of fatty substances in organs such as the spleen, liver, lungs, bones, and brain.\n\n**Types of Gaucher Disease**\n\nThere are three types:\n\n* **Type 1**: The most common form, which causes liver and spleen enlargement, bone pain and fractures, and sometimes lung and kidney problems. It does not affect the brain.\n* **Type 2**: A severe form that causes brain damage, appearing in infants. Most children who have it die by age 2.\n* **Type 3**: A form where there may be liver and spleen enlargement, and the brain is gradually affected. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nGaucher disease has no cure. Treatment options for types 1 and 3 include medicine and enzyme replacement therapy, which is usually very effective. There is no good treatment for the brain damage of types 2 and 3.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Gaucher Disease and Pregnancy (Organization of Teratology Information Specialists)\n* Learning about Gaucher Disease (National Human Genome Research Institute)\n* Lipid Storage Diseases (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\n\n**Genetics**\n\nGaucher disease is a genetic disorder, and understanding its genetic basis can provide insights into its causes and potential treatments.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinical trials are ongoing to develop new treatments for Gaucher disease. You can find information on clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent journal articles on Gaucher disease include:\n\n* A novel allosteric GCase modulator prevents Tau accumulation in GBA1(WT) and...\n* Allosteric Modulation of GCase Enhances Lysosomal Activity and Reduces ER Stress...\n* Epidemiology of Gaucher Disease in France: Trends in Incidence, Mortality, Management,...\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\nGaucher disease (Medical Encyclopedia)\n\nThis cleaned output provides a clear and concise overview of Gaucher disease, its types, treatment options, and related resources.",

    "content": "**Gaucher Disease**\n\nGaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder in which a person lacks an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GBA).\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Gaucher disease is rare in the general population.\n*   People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease.\n*   It is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning that the mother and father must both pass one variant copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who carries one variant copy of the gene but doesn't have the disease is called a silent carrier.\n\n**Subtypes**\n\nThere are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:\n\n*   Type 1 is most common and involves bone disease, anemia, an enlarged spleen, and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). It affects both children and adults and is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.\n*   Type 2 usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement and can lead to rapid, early death.\n*   Type 3 may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems. People with this type may live into adulthood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBleeding because of low platelet count is the most common symptom seen in Gaucher disease. Other symptoms may include:\n\n*   Bone pain and fractures\n*   Cognitive impairment (decreased thinking ability)\n*   Easy bruising\n*   Enlarged spleen\n*   Enlarged liver\n*   Fatigue\n*   Heart valve problems\n*   Lung disease (rare)\n*   Seizures\n*   Severe swelling at birth\n*   Skin changes\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. The following tests may be done:\n\n*   Blood test to look for enzyme activity\n*   Bone marrow aspiration\n*   MRI\n*   CT\n*   X-ray of the skeleton\n*   Genetic testing\n\n**Treatment**\n\nGaucher disease can't be cured, but treatments can help regulate and may improve symptoms. Medicines may be given to:\n\n*   Replace the missing GBA (enzyme replacement therapy) to help reduce spleen size, bone pain, and improve thrombocytopenia.\n*   Limit production of fatty chemicals that build up in the body.\n\nOther treatments include:\n\n*   Medicines for pain\n*   Surgery for bone and joint problems or to remove the spleen\n*   Blood transfusions\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThese groups can provide more information on Gaucher disease:\n\n*   National Gaucher Foundation -- www.gaucherdisease.org\n*   MedlinePlus - Gaucher disease.-- medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/gaucher-disease/\n*   National Organization for Rare Diseases -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/gaucher-disease/\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on their subtype of the disease. The infantile form of Gaucher disease (Type 2) may lead to early death. Most affected children die before age 5.\n\nAdults with the type 1 form of Gaucher disease can expect a normal life expectancy with enzyme replacement therapy.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of Gaucher disease may include:\n\n*   Seizures\n*   Anemia\n*   Thrombocytopenia\n*   Bone problems\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents with a family history of Gaucher disease. Testing can determine if both parents carry one variant copy of the gene and thus could pass on the Gaucher disease. A prenatal test can also tell if a baby in the womb has Gaucher disease.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGlucocerebrosidase deficiency; Glucosylceramidase deficiency; Lysosomal storage disease - Gaucher; Gaucher's disease\n\n---\n\n**Gaucher Disease**\n\nGaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder in which a person lacks an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GBA).\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Gaucher disease is rare in the general population.\n* People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease.\n* It is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning that the mother and father must both pass one variant copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease.\n\n**Subtypes**\n\nThere are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:\n\n1. **Type 1**: Most common, involving bone disease, anemia, enlarged spleen, and low platelets (thrombocytopenia).
