These viruses occur in wild birds and can infect domestic poultry. The viruses that cause the disease in birds can change their genes (mutate) so they can spread to other animals and humans.\n\n**Causes of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe first avian influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997. It was called avian influenza (H5N1). The outbreak was linked to chickens. Since then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East.\n\n**Risk Factors for Avian Influenza**\n\nYour risk of getting the bird flu virus is higher if:\n\n* You work with poultry or cattle (such as farmers or farm workers).\n* You have exposure to backyard bird flocks and wild birds (such as through hunting).\n* You travel to countries where the virus is present.\n* You are exposed to sick or dead animals infected with the virus.\n* You are exposed to animal feces, litter, or other material contaminated by animals infected with H5N1.\n* You eat raw or undercooked poultry meat, eggs, or unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheese from animals infected with H5N1.\n\n**Symptoms of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe avian influenza virus in humans causes typical flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n* Cough\n* Diarrhea\n* Trouble breathing\n* Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C)\n* Headache\n* General ill feeling (malaise)\n* Muscle aches\n* Runny nose\n* Sore throat\n\n**Treatment of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe treatment varies and is based on your symptoms. Treatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may make the disease less severe.\n\n**Prevention of Avian Influenza**\n\nThere is an approved vaccine to protect humans from the H5N1 avian flu virus. This vaccine could be used if the current H5N1 virus starts spreading among people.\n\n**Recommendations for Prevention**\n\nAs a general precaution:\n\n* Avoid wild birds and watch them only from a distance.\n* Avoid touching sick animals and surfaces that may be covered in their feces.\n* Use protective clothing and special breathing masks if you work with birds or dairy cows, if you go into buildings with sick or dead animals, feces, or litter from infected animals.\n* If you have had contact with infected animals, watch for signs of infection. If you do become infected, tell your provider.\n* Avoid undercooked or uncooked meat. Avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses.\n\n**Travel Recommendations**\n\nIf traveling to other countries:\n\n* Avoid visits to live-bird markets and poultry farms.\n* Avoid preparing or eating undercooked poultry products.\n* See your provider if you become sick after you return from your trip.\n\n---\n\n**Avian Influenza**\n\n**What is Avian Influenza?**\n\nAvian influenza A viruses cause the influenza (flu) infection in birds.

Since then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East. The virus has caused illness and even death in humans.\n\n**Symptoms of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe symptoms of avian flu infection in humans depend on the strain of virus. Typical flu-like symptoms include:\n\n* Cough\n* Diarrhea\n* Trouble breathing\n* Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C)\n* Headache\n* General ill feeling (malaise)\n* Muscle aches\n* Runny nose\n* Sore throat\n\n**Prevention of Avian Influenza**\n\nThere is an approved vaccine to protect humans from the H5N1 avian flu virus.

Treatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may make the disease less severe. For the medicine to work, you need to start taking it within 48 hours after your symptoms start.\n\nOseltamivir may also be prescribed for people who live in the same house as people with avian flu. This may prevent them from getting the illness.\n\n**Complications of Avian Influenza**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Acute respiratory failure\n* Organ failure\n* Pneumonia\n* Sepsis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop flu-like symptoms within 10 days of handling infected birds, being around infected cattle, or being in an area with a known avian flu outbreak.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the type of avian flu virus and how bad the infection is. The disease can be fatal.\n\n---\n\n**Avian Influenza**\n\n**What is Avian Influenza?**\n\nAvian influenza A viruses cause the influenza (flu) infection in birds. These viruses occur in wild birds and can infect domestic poultry. The viruses that cause the disease in birds can change their genes (mutate) so they can spread to other animals and humans.\n\n**Current Situation in the United States**\n\nAs of May 2024, H5N1 bird flu has spread to poultry and dairy cows in the United States and has infected some poultry and dairy workers. The latest outbreak in the United States started in 2022 and has affected over 1,100 flocks of birds in 48 states.\n\n**Causes of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe first avian influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997. It was called avian influenza (H5N1). The outbreak was linked to chickens. Since then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East.\n\n**Risk Factors for Avian Influenza**\n\nYour risk of getting the bird flu virus is higher if:\n\n* You work with poultry or cattle (such as farmers or farm workers).\n* You have exposure to backyard bird flocks and wild birds (such as through hunting).\n* You travel to countries where the virus is present.\n* You are exposed to sick or dead animals infected with the virus.\n* You are exposed to animal feces, litter, or other material contaminated by animals infected with H5N1.\n* You eat raw or undercooked poultry meat, eggs, or unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheese from animals infected with H5N1.\n\n**Symptoms of Avian Influenza**\n\nSince April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported cases of H5N1 in humans in the United States. Symptoms have included a cough, runny nose, sore throat, chills, fever, and conjunctivitis (eye infection). In December 2024, one person was hospitalized with a severe case of H5N1 after exposure to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nCurrently, the risk for infection in people is low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to monitor the situation. No one has gotten avian flu virus from eating properly cooked animals or animal products. Health care workers and people who live in the same house as people with bird flu may also be at higher risk for infection.\n\n**Avian Influenza Viruses**\n\nAvian influenza viruses can live in the environment for long periods of time. Infection may be spread just by touching surfaces that have the virus on them. Birds who were infected with the avian flu can shed the virus in their feces and saliva for as long as 10 days.\n\n---\n\n**Avian Influenza**\n\n**What is Avian Influenza?**\n\nAvian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a type of influenza caused by the avian flu virus. This virus can infect humans and is typically spread through contact with infected birds or their droppings.\n\n**Who is at Risk?**\n\n*   People who work with birds, such as farmers and veterinarians\n*   Health care workers who come into contact with patients who have bird flu\n*   People who live in the same house as someone who has bird flu\n\n**Symptoms of Avian Influenza**\n\nThe symptoms of avian influenza in humans are similar to those of regular flu, including:\n\n*   Cough\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C)\n*   Headache\n*   General ill feeling (malaise)\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Runny nose\n*   Sore throat\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf you think you have been exposed to the avian flu virus, notify your health care provider before your office visit. This will give the staff a chance to take steps to protect themselves and other people during your office visit.\n\nThere are tests for the avian flu, but they are not widely available. One type of test can give results in about 4 hours.\n\nYour provider might also do the following tests:\n\n*   Listening to the lungs (to detect abnormal breath sounds)\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Culture from the nose or throat\n*   A method or technique to detect the virus, called RT-PCR\n*   White blood cell count\n\nOther tests may be done to look at how well your heart, kidneys, and liver are working.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment varies and is based on your symptoms.\n\nTreatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may make the disease less severe. For the medicine to work, you need to start taking it within 48 hours after your symptoms start.\n\nOseltamivir may also be prescribed for people who live in the same house as people with avian flu. This may prevent them from getting the illness.\n\nThe virus that causes human avian flu is resistant to the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine. These medicines should not be used in the case of an H5N1 infection.\n\nPeople with severe infection may need to be hospitalized and, sometimes, placed on a breathing machine. People infected with the virus also should be kept separate from non-infected people.\n\nProviders recommend that people get an influenza (flu) shot. This may cut down the chance that the avian flu virus will mix with a human flu virus. This might create a new virus that may easily spread.\n\n---\n\n**Avian Influenza: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the type of avian flu virus and how bad the infection is. The disease can be fatal.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Acute respiratory failure\n*   Organ failure\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Sepsis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop flu-like symptoms within 10 days of handling infected birds, being around infected cattle, or being in an area with a known avian flu outbreak.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is an approved vaccine to protect humans from the H5N1 avian flu virus. This vaccine could be used if the current H5N1 virus starts spreading among people. The US government keeps a stockpile of the vaccine.\n\nAt this time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend against travel to countries affected by avian influenza.\n\nThe CDC makes the following recommendations:\n\n*   As a general precaution:\n    *   Avoid wild birds and watch them only from a distance.\n    *   Avoid touching sick animals and surfaces that may be covered in their feces.\n    *   Use protective clothing and special breathing masks if you work with birds or dairy cows, if you go into buildings with sick or dead animals, feces, or litter from infected animals.\n    *   If you have had contact with infected animals, watch for signs of infection. If you do become infected, tell your provider.\n    *   Avoid undercooked or uncooked meat. Avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses. This reduces the risk for exposure to avian flu and other foodborne diseases.\n*   If traveling to other countries:\n    *   Avoid visits to live-bird markets and poultry farms.\n    *   Avoid preparing or eating undercooked poultry products.\n    *   See your provider if you become sick after you return from your trip.\n\nYou can find more about the avian flu and humans and the current situation in the United States from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\nH5 Bird Flu: Current Situation -- www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html\n\n---\n\n**Avian Influenza**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Current U.S. Bird Flu Situation in Humans**\n\nAs of December 18, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a severe case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Causes Bird Flu Virus Infections in Humans?**\n\nAccording to the CDC, bird flu virus infections in humans are caused by contact with infected birds. The virus can be transmitted through:\n\n*   Direct contact with infected birds\n*   Indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or objects\n*   Airborne transmission (although this is rare)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Influenza and Zoonoses**\n\nInfluenza viruses, including avian influenza, are zoonotic diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.

    "content": "**Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome**\n\n_Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, although it can also affect other parts of the body. This condition is characterized by abnormalities of the front part of the eye, an area known as the anterior segment._\n\n* _The colored part of the eye (the iris) may be thin or poorly developed._\n* _The iris normally has a single central hole, called the pupil, through which light enters the eye._\n* _People with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome often have a pupil that is off-center (corectopia) or extra holes in the iris that can look like multiple pupils (polycoria)._\n* _This condition can also cause abnormalities of the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye._\n\n**Glaucoma**\n\n* _About half of affected individuals develop glaucoma, a serious condition that increases pressure inside the eye._\n* _When glaucoma occurs with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, it most often develops in late childhood or adolescence, although it can occur as early as infancy._\n* _Glaucoma can cause vision loss or blindness._\n\n**Other Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* _Many affected individuals have distinctive facial features such as widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); a flattened mid-face with a broad, flat nasal bridge; and a prominent forehead._\n* _The condition is also associated with dental abnormalities including unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia)._\n* _Some people with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome have extra folds of skin around their belly button (redundant periumbilical skin)._\n* _Other, less common features can include heart defects, the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), narrowing of the anus (anal stenosis), and abnormalities of the pituitary gland that can result in slow growth._\n\n**Types of Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome**\n\n* _Researchers have described at least three types of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, distinguished by their genetic cause._\n\n---\n\n**Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome**\n\n**What is Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome?**\n\nAxenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the eyes, but can also impact other parts of the body.\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\n* Abnormalities of the front part of the eye (anterior segment)\n\t+ Thin or poorly developed iris\n\t+ Off-center pupil (corectopia) or extra holes in the iris (polycoria)\n\t+ Corneal abnormalities\n* Glaucoma, a serious condition that increases pressure inside the eye\n* Distinctive facial features:\n\t+ Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)\n\t+ Flattened mid-face with a broad, flat nasal bridge\n\t+ Prominent forehead\n* Dental abnormalities:\n\t+ Unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia)\n* Extra folds of skin around the belly button (redundant periumbilical skin)\n* Less common features:\n\t+ Heart defects\n\t+ Opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias)\n\t+ Narrowing of the anus (anal stenosis)\n\t+ Abnormalities of the pituitary gland that can result in slow growth\n\n**Types of Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome**\n\nResearchers have described at least three types of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, distinguished by their genetic cause:\n\n1. Type 1: caused by mutations in the PITX2 gene\n2. Type 2: likely caused by a mutation on chromosome 13 (unknown gene)\n3. Type 3: caused by mutations in the FOXC1 gene\n\n**Causes and Genetics**\n\nAxenfeld-Rieger syndrome results from mutations in at least two known genes, PITX2 and FOXC1. These genes produce transcription factors that play important roles in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of structures in the anterior segment of the eye.\n\nMutations in either the PITX2 or FOXC1 gene disrupt the activity of other genes needed for normal development, leading to problems in the formation of the anterior segment of the eye and other parts of the body. Affected individuals with PITX2 gene mutations are more likely than those with FOXC1 gene mutations to have abnormalities affecting parts of the body other than the eye.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nAxenfeld-Rieger syndrome has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 200,000 people.\n\n---\n\n**Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome**\n\n**What is Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome?**\n\nAxenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of various tissues in the body, including those outside the eye.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the PITX2 or FOXC1 genes. Some people with ARS do not have identified mutations in these genes, and the cause of their condition is unknown. Other as-yet-unidentified genes may also cause ARS.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nARS\nAxenfeld anomaly\nAxenfeld syndrome\nAXRA\nAXRS\nRieger anomaly\nRieger syndrome\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 1\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 2\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 3\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Rieger anomaly\n\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\n\n*   Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n*   AXENFELD-RIEGER SYNDROME, TYPE 2; RIEG2\n*   AXENFELD-RIEGER SYNDROME, TYPE 1; RIEG1\n*   AXENFELD-RIEGER SYNDROME, TYPE 3; RIEG3\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n*   Chang TC, Summers CG, Schimmenti LA, Grajewski AL.

    "content": "**Axillary Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAxillary nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy that occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This nerve helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it.\n\nThe usual causes are:\n\n* Direct injury\n* Long-term pressure on the nerve\n* Pressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment)\n* Shoulder injury\n\nEntrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure. The damage can destroy the myelin sheath that covers the nerve or part of the nerve cell (the axon). Damage of either type reduces or prevents the movement of signals through the nerve.\n\nConditions that can lead to axillary nerve dysfunction include:\n\n* Body-wide (systemic) disorders that cause nerve inflammation\n* Deep infection\n* Fracture of the upper arm bone (humerus)\n* Pressure from casts or splints\n* Improper use of crutches\n* Shoulder dislocation\n\nIn some cases, no cause can be found.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Numbness over part of the outer shoulder\n* Pain in the shoulder region\n* Shoulder weakness, especially when lifting the arm up and away from the body\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine your neck, arm, and shoulder. Weakness of the shoulder can cause difficulty moving your arm.\n\nThe deltoid muscle of the shoulder may show signs of muscle atrophy (loss of muscle tissue and thinning).\n\nTests that may be used to check axillary nerve dysfunction include:\n\n* EMG and nerve conduction tests will likely be normal right after the injury and should be done several weeks after the injury or symptoms start\n* MRI or x-rays of the shoulder\n\n**Treatment**\n\nDepending on the cause of the nerve disorder, some people do not need treatment. The problem may get better on its own. The rate of recovery is different for everyone. It can take many months to recover.\n\nAnti-inflammatory medicines may be given if you have any of the following:\n\n* Sudden symptoms\n* Small changes in sensation or movement\n* No history of injury to the area\n* No signs of nerve damage\n\nThese medicines reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve. They may be injected directly into the area or taken by mouth.\n\nOther medicines include:\n\n* Over-the-counter pain medicines may be helpful for mild pain.\n* Medicines to help reduce stabbing pain (neuralgia).\n* Opioid pain relievers may be needed to control severe pain.\n\nIf your symptoms continue or get worse, you may need surgery. If a trapped nerve is causing your symptoms, surgery to release the nerve may help you feel better.\n\nPhysical therapy can help maintain muscle strength. Job changes, muscle retraining, or other forms of therapy may be recommended.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIt may be possible to make a full recovery if the cause of the axillary nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Deformity of the arm, shoulder contracture, or frozen shoulder\n* Partial loss of sensation in the arm (uncommon)\n* Partial shoulder paralysis\n* Repeated injury to the arm\n\n---\n\n**Axillary Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nAxillary nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy that occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This nerve helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe usual causes are:\n\n*   Direct injury\n*   Long-term pressure on the nerve\n*   Pressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment)\n*   Shoulder injury\n\nEntrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure.

This can cause a range of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arm.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of axillary nerve dysfunction vary, but common ones include:\n\n*   **Injury**: A blow to the shoulder or upper arm can damage the axillary nerve.\n*   **Compression**: The nerve can become compressed due to a variety of factors, such as wearing a tight cast or splint, using crutches incorrectly, or having a medical condition that affects the nerve.\n*   **Medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and peripheral artery disease, can damage the axillary nerve.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of axillary nerve dysfunction can vary depending on the severity of the damage. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Numbness**: A lack of sensation in the arm or shoulder.\n*   **Tingling**: A pins-and-needles feeling in the arm or shoulder.\n*   **Weakness**: A decrease in muscle strength in the arm or shoulder.\n*   **Pain**: A sharp, stabbing pain in the arm or shoulder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of axillary nerve dysfunction depends on the underlying cause. Common treatments include:\n\n*   **Medicines**: Anti-inflammatory medicines may be given to reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve. Over-the-counter pain medicines may help with mild pain, while opioid pain relievers may be needed for severe pain.\n*   **Surgery**: If a trapped nerve is causing symptoms, surgery to release the nerve may help alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Physical therapy**: Physical therapy can help maintain muscle strength and improve range of motion.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Avoiding activities that put pressure on the underarm area, making sure casts and splints fit properly, and learning how to use crutches correctly can help prevent further damage.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe outlook for axillary nerve dysfunction varies depending on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, it may be possible to make a full recovery if the cause of the nerve disorder can be identified and successfully treated. However, in other cases, complications such as deformity of the arm, shoulder contracture, or frozen shoulder, partial loss of sensation in the arm, partial shoulder paralysis, or repeated injury to the arm may occur.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPreventive measures vary depending on the cause, but common ones include:\n\n*   **Avoiding pressure**: Avoid putting pressure on the underarm area for long periods.\n*   **Proper fitting**: Make sure casts, splints, and other appliances fit properly.\n*   **Correct use of crutches**: Learn how to avoid putting pressure on the underarm when using crutches.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of axillary nerve dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of controlling symptoms.",

    "content": "**Azithromycin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAzithromycin is used to treat certain bacterial infections, such as bronchitis; pneumonia; sexually transmitted diseases (STD); and infections of the ears, lungs, sinuses, skin, throat, and reproductive organs. Azithromycin also is used to treat or prevent disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection [a type of lung infection that often affects people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]. Azithromycin is in a class of medications called macrolide antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.\n\nAntibiotics such as azithromycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAzithromycin comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (liquid), and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablets and suspension (Zithromax) are usually taken with or without food once a day for 1-5 days. When used for the prevention of disseminated MAC infection, azithromycin tablets are usually taken with or without food once weekly. The extended-release suspension (Zmax) is usually taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) as a one-time dose.\n\nTo help you remember to take azithromycin, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take azithromycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use a dosing spoon, oral syringe, or measuring cup to measure the correct amount of medication. Rinse the measuring device with water after taking the full dose of medication.\n\nIf you receive azithromycin powder for suspension (Zithromax) in the single-dose, 1-gram packet, you must first mix it with water before you take the medication. Mix the contents of the 1-gram packet with 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water in a glass and consume the entire contents immediately. Add an additional 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water to the same glass, mix, and consume the entire contents to ensure that you receive the entire dose.\n\nIf you receive azithromycin extended-release suspension (Zmax) as a dry powder, you must first add water to the bottle before you take the medication. Open the bottle by pressing down on the cap and twisting. Measure 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water, and add to the bottle. Close the bottle tightly, and shake well to mix. Use the azithromycin extended-release suspension within 12 hours of receiving it from the pharmacy or after adding water to the powder.\n\nIf you vomit within an hour after taking azithromycin, call your doctor right away. Your doctor will tell you if you need to take another dose. Do not take another dose unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n---\n\n**Azithromycin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Take Azithromycin**\n\nTake azithromycin exactly as directed by your doctor.

Do not stop taking azithromycin unless you experience the severe side effects described in the SIDE EFFECTS section.

Use the azithromycin extended-release suspension within 12 hours of receiving it from the pharmacy or after adding water to the powder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Uses for Azithromycin**\n\nAzithromycin is also used sometimes to treat H. pylori infection, travelers' diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal infections; Legionnaires' disease (a type of lung infection); pertussis (whooping cough; a serious infection that can cause severe coughing); Lyme disease (an infection that may develop after a person is bitten by a tick); and babesiosis (an infectious disease carried by ticks). It is also used to prevent heart infection in people having dental or other procedures, and to prevent STD in victims of sexual assault. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking azithromycin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to azithromycin, clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac), dirithromycin (not available in the U.S.), erythromycin (E.E.S., ERYC, Erythrocin), telithromycin (Ketek; not available in the U.S.), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in azithromycin tablets or suspension (liquid). Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking azithromycin. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nIf you are taking antacids containing aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, others), you will need to allow some time to pass between when you take a dose of these antacids and when you take a dose of azithromycin tablets or liquid. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how many hours before or after you take azithromycin you may take these medications. The extended-release suspension may be taken at any time with antacids.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) or other liver problems while taking azithromycin. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take azithromycin.\n\nTell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death) or a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat, and if you have low levels of magnesium or potassium in your blood; if you have a blood infection; heart failure or other heart problems; cystic fibrosis; myasthenia gravis (a condition of muscles and the nerves that control them); or if you have kidney or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.\n\n---\n\n\\n\\n**Azithromycin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   Tell your doctor if you have ever had jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) or other liver problems while taking azithromycin.

These proteins are markers that may help diagnose leukemia or lymphoma.\n\n**How is it performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed. In some cases, white blood cells are removed during a bone marrow biopsy. The sample may also be taken during a lymph node biopsy or other biopsy when lymphoma is suspected. The blood sample is sent to a laboratory, where a laboratory specialist checks the cell type and characteristics. This procedure is called immunophenotyping. The test is often done using a technique called flow cytometry.\n\n**How do I prepare for the test?**\n\nNo special preparation is usually necessary.\n\n**What will it feel like during the test?**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why is this test performed?**\n\nThis test may be done for the following reasons:\n\n* When other tests (such as a blood smear) show signs of abnormal white blood cells\n* When leukemia or lymphoma is suspected\n* To find out the type of leukemia or lymphoma\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\n\nAbnormal results usually indicate either B-cell lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma.\n\n**Are there any risks associated with this test?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

    "content": "**Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER)**\n\n**What is BAER?**\n\nBrainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) is a test that measures the brain wave activity in response to sounds such as clicks or certain tones.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nYou lie on a reclining chair or bed and remain still. Electrodes are placed on your scalp and on each earlobe. A brief click or tone is transmitted through earphones you wear during the test. The electrodes pick up the brain's responses to these sounds and record them.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou may be asked to wash your hair the night before the test. Young children often need medicine to help them relax (sedation) so they can stay still during the procedure.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThe test is done to:\n\n* Help diagnose nervous system problems and hearing loss (especially in newborns and children)\n* Find out how well the nervous system works\n* Check hearing ability in people who cannot do other hearing tests\n\nThis test may also be performed during surgery to decrease the risk for injury to the hearing nerve and brain.\n\n**What Do Normal Results Mean?**\n\nNormal results vary.

    "content": "**BCR-ABL1 Genetic Test**\n\n**What is a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nA BCR-ABL1 genetic test uses a sample of blood or bone marrow to look for an abnormal gene called BCR-ABL1. This abnormal gene is involved in certain types of blood cancer.\n\n**How is the abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene formed?**\n\nThe abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene is made when two separate genes merge together and become one gene. Genes are short sections of DNA. Normally, most of your cells have the same set of 23 pairs of chromosomes. The broken piece of chromosome 9 includes part of the ABL1 gene. It attaches (fuses) to part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22. This makes the abnormal fusion gene, BCR-ABL1.\n\n**What does the abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene do?**\n\nThe abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene has instructions for an abnormal protein. The protein causes certain bone marrow cells to make large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. These abnormal white blood cells are leukemia cells. They don't protect you from infections like healthy white blood cells do.\n\n**What types of BCR-ABL1 genetic tests are there?**\n\nThere are different types of BCR-ABL1 genetic tests. They check your blood or bone marrow for:\n\n* The abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene\n* Changes in chromosome 22 that show it has become a Philadelphia chromosome\n\n**What is the purpose of a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nBCR-ABL1 genetic testing is most often used with other tests to diagnose or rule out two specific types of blood cancer:\n\n* Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)\n* Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL)\n\n**Why do I need a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nIf your health care provider thinks you may have a type of leukemia that involves the BCR-ABL1 gene, you may need a BCR-ABL1 genetic test to make a diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of these blood cancers include:\n\n* High levels of white blood cells on a complete blood count (CBC) test\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* Weight loss\n* Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\n* Joint or bone pain\n* Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side\n* Painless lumps in your armpits, groin, neck, or belly\n\n**What happens during a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nA BCR-ABL1 genetic test usually uses a sample of blood or bone marrow. If you are having a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. If you are having a bone marrow test, a provider usually takes a sample from the back of the hip bone.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for a blood test. If you're having a bone marrow test, your provider will tell you whether you need to fast (not eat or drink) for a few hours before the procedure.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf you had BCR-ABL1 genetic testing to diagnose a blood cancer, your provider will probably use the results of more than one test to make a diagnosis. Your provider will likely diagnose either chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) if your tests show all three of these results:\n\n* Abnormal white blood cells\n* The BCR-ABL1 gene\n* The Philadelphia chromosome\n\n**How do I understand my test results?**\n\nIf the amount of BCR-ABL1 in your sample decreases, it means your treatment is working to some degree. If the amount of BCR-ABL1 in your sample increases, it may mean your treatment is not working. You may need to try another treatment or have more tests.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nYes, you should learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**BCR-ABL1 Genetic Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nA BCR-ABL1 genetic test uses a sample of blood or bone marrow to look for an abnormal gene called BCR-ABL1.

After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n* If you are having a bone marrow test, a provider usually takes a sample from the back of the hip bone. You will be given an injection (shot) of medicine to numb the area. You may also be given medicine to help you relax or sleep.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for a blood test.

Your provider will likely diagnose either chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) if your tests show all three of these results:\n\n* Abnormal white blood cells\n* The BCR-ABL1 gene\n* The Philadelphia chromosome\n\nIn certain cases, a person may have CML without having the Philadelphia chromosome, but this isn't common.\n\nIf you had a BCR-ABL1 gene test to see if your cancer treatment is working, your provider will compare your results with past test results to look for changes over time. The way your results are reported depends on which test you had. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean for your health and treatment plan.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BCR-ABL1 genetic test?**\n\nLabs use different methods to test for the BCR-ABL1 gene and Philadelphia chromosome. The test method can affect your results. So, it's important to have your tests done the same way, and usually in the same lab. This allows your provider to compare your results over time. If you have questions about how your tests are done, ask your provider.\n\n---\n\n**BCR-ABL1 Genetic Test**\n\nAre you considering getting tested for the BCR-ABL1 genetic mutation? This test is crucial in diagnosing and monitoring Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. In this article, we'll delve into the importance of this test, its process, and what the results mean.\n\n**Why is the BCR-ABL1 genetic test important?**\n\nThe BCR-ABL1 genetic test is essential in detecting the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a hallmark of CML. This test helps diagnose CML early on, allowing for timely treatment and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this test can help monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect any potential relapse.\n\n**How is the BCR-ABL1 genetic test performed?**\n\nThe BCR-ABL1 genetic test is typically performed on a sample of bone marrow or blood cells. The process involves extracting the DNA from these cells and then analyzing it for the presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This gene is formed when the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 fuses with the BCR gene on chromosome 22, resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n**What do the results of the BCR-ABL1 genetic test mean?**\n\nThe results of the BCR-ABL1 genetic test can indicate one of three things:\n\n*   **Positive result**: This indicates that the patient has CML and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome.\n*   **Negative result**: This suggests that the patient does not have CML, but it's essential to note that this test is not 100% accurate. A negative result may require further testing to rule out other conditions.\n*   **Indeterminate result**: This occurs when the test results are unclear or inconclusive. In such cases, additional testing or consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary to determine the next course of action.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe BCR-ABL1 genetic test is a vital tool in diagnosing and monitoring CML. Understanding the importance, process, and results of this test can help patients make informed decisions about their care. If you're considering getting tested for CML, consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.",

    "content": "**BRAF Genetic Test**\n\nA **BRAF genetic test** uses a sample of tumor tissue, bone marrow, or blood to look for changes in a gene called BRAF. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. The test is usually done to look for changes in the BRAF gene that may be involved in cancer.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\n*   Look for changes in the BRAF gene in certain types of cancer. This information may be used to diagnose certain types of cancer and/or guide treatment decisions.\n*   Check for inherited changes in the BRAF gene. This is not a routine screening test. But it may be used if your personal or family health history suggests that you may have a high risk for cancer or another condition that's caused by inherited changes in the BRAF gene.\n\n**Why do I need a BRAF genetic test?**\n\nYou may need a BRAF genetic test if you:\n\n*   Have a cancer that could be caused by changes in your BRAF gene. The results from a BRAF genetic test can help your provider:\n    *   Predict how fast your cancer may grow.\n    *   Know whether targeted treatment is likely to help you. Targeted treatment for cancer with changes in BRAF genes blocks or slows the abnormal proteins that make cancer grow. These medicines could be harmful if they are prescribed for cancers that don't have changed BRAF genes. So BRAF testing is needed to match you with the best treatment for your cancer.\n    *   Understand how your cancer may respond to treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n*   Have a personal or family health history that increases your risk of cancer involving inherited changes in your BRAF gene. A BRAF genetic test can help you estimate and manage your cancer risk. The test can also show whether you could pass a changed BRAF gene to your children.\n*   Have a family health history of a genetic condition caused by BRAF gene changes. BRAF genetic testing can help you understand if you and your partner have BRAF gene changes that you could pass to your children.\n\n**What happens during a BRAF genetic test?**\n\nIf you're having a BRAF genetic test because you have cancer, the test will depend what type of cancer you have:\n\n*   For solid tumors, the test often uses a sample of cells from the tumor. The sample may be taken:\n    *   During surgery to remove the entire tumor.\n    *   With a biopsy to remove a small amount of tissue. The type of biopsy you have depends on where your cancer is located. A biopsy may be done with:\n        *   A hollow needle inserted through your skin. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound may be used to guide the needle.\n        *   Minor surgery to remove a sample of tissue (an incisional biopsy).\n    *   With a blood test. If surgery or a biopsy isn't possible, you may have a blood test to look for DNA that the tumor has shed in your bloodstream. This is called a \"liquid biopsy.\" To do a blood test, a health care professional will use a small needle to take a blood sample from a vein in your arm.\n*   For blood cancer, a blood test or a bone marrow test may be used. Marrow is soft, spongy tissue found inside of bones. Most bone marrow samples are taken from the back of the hip bone.\n\nIf you're having a BRAF genetic test to check for inherited gene changes, you will usually have a blood test.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nIf you're having a blood test, you usually don't need any special preparations. Ask your provider about how to prepare for other types of BRAF gene tests.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThe risks of a BRAF gene test depend on how your sample is collected. Talk with your provider about your risks.\n\nIn general, with a biopsy, you may have soreness, pain, or bleeding where the tissue was removed.\n\nA blood test has very little risk. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nAfter a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore where the sample was taken. This usually goes away in a few days. Serious symptoms are very rare, but may include swelling, bleeding at the site, or fever.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf you have cancer and your test results show:\n\n*   You have a change in your BRAF gene, your provider may prescribe medicines that are designed to target the changed BRAF proteins that are making your cancer grow. You may also need other treatments.\n*   You don't have a change in your BRAF gene, your provider will prescribe another type of treatment for your cancer.\n\nIf you don't have cancer and your results show you have a change in your BRAF gene, it does not mean you'll get cancer. But, depending on the change, you may have a higher risk of developing cancer.\n\nYou may be able to reduce your risk by having more frequent cancer screenings. For example, to reduce or risk of melanoma, you can have more skin exams to check your whole body for moles and other suspicious growths. Cancer screening can help catch cancer early when it's easier to treat.\n\nIf you have an inherited change in your BRAF gene, talk with your provider or a genetic counselor to learn about the risks of passing the change to your children.\n\n---\n\n**BRAF Genetic Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA BRAF genetic test uses a sample of tumor tissue, bone marrow, or blood to look for changes in a gene called BRAF.

    "content": "**BRAF Gene**\n\nThe BRAF gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions.\n\n*   **Normal Function:** The BRAF gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.\n*   **Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes:**\n    *   **Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome**: Mutations in the BRAF gene are the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This condition affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous).\n    *   **Erdheim-Chester disease**: At least one mutation in the BRAF gene has been identified in some people with Erdheim-Chester disease. This rare condition is characterized by the abnormal production and accumulation of immune system cells called histiocytes in many of the body's tissues.\n    *   **Giant congenital melanocytic nevus**: The V600E mutation (described above) in the BRAF gene has also been found to cause giant congenital melanocytic nevus. This condition is characterized by a large, noncancerous patch of abnormally dark skin that is present from birth and an increased risk of a type of skin cell cancer called melanoma.\n    *   **Noonan syndrome**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Noonan syndrome\n\n---\n\n**BRAF Gene**\n\nThe **BRAF gene** plays a crucial role in various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders.\n\n**Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines**\n\nAt least two mutations in the **BRAF gene** have been found to cause Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). This condition is characterized by:\n\n*   Multiple brown skin spots (lentigines)\n*   Heart defects\n*   Short stature\n*   A sunken or protruding chest\n*   Distinctive facial features\n\nThe **BRAF gene** mutations change single amino acids in the **BRAF protein**: One mutation replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid proline at position 241 (written as Thr241Pro or T241P), and the other mutation replaces the amino acid leucine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 245 (written as Leu245Phe or L245F).\n\n**Cholangiocarcinoma**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n**Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\n\n**Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**\n\nSomatic mutations in the **BRAF gene**, most frequently the V600E mutation, have been identified in some individuals with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This disorder causes an abnormal accumulation of certain immune cells called Langerhans cells in multiple tissues and organs.\n\n**Lung Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Lung cancer.\n\n**Melanoma**\n\nThe V600E mutation in the **BRAF gene** has also been found in about half of noninherited (sporadic) cases of melanoma. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes.\n\n**Multiple Myeloma**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Multiple myeloma.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nSomatic mutations in the **BRAF gene** are common in several types of cancer. Normally, the **BRAF protein** is switched on and off in response to signals that control cell growth and development. Somatic mutations cause the **BRAF protein** to be continuously active and to transmit messages to the nucleus even in the absence of these chemical signals.\n\n**Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome**\n\nMutations in the **BRAF gene** are the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This condition affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous).\n\nAt least 49 **BRAF mutations** have been identified in people with this disorder. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the **BRAF protein**. Almost all of these genetic changes abnormally activate the protein, which disrupts the tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in cells throughout the body.\n\nThe altered signaling interferes with the normal development of many organs and tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.\n\n**Erdheim-Chester Disease**\n\nAt least one mutation in the **BRAF gene** has been identified in some people with Erdheim-Chester disease. This rare condition is characterized by the abnormal production and accumulation of immune system cells called histiocytes in many of the body's tissues.\n\nThe BRAF gene mutation that causes this condition is somatic, meaning that it occurs during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells. The mutation affects a single amino acid in the **BRAF protein**. Specifically, the mutation replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 600 (written as Val600Glu or V600E).\n\nThis mutation leads to production of a **BRAF protein** that is abnormally active, which disrupts regulation of cell proliferation and may allow histiocytes to grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to the abnormal accumulation of histiocytes that occurs in Erdheim-Chester disease.\n\n---\n\n**BRAF Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/7)**\n\n**Health Condition**\n\n* **Erdheim-Chester Disease**\n\t+ At least one mutation in the BRAF gene has been identified in some people with Erdheim-Chester disease.\n\t+ This rare condition is characterized by the abnormal production and accumulation of immune system cells called histiocytes in many of the body's tissues.\n\t+ The disease most commonly affects the bones, causing bone thickening and pain, but the accumulation of histiocytes can also cause signs and symptoms affecting the brain, eyes, lungs, liver, kidneys, and other organs.\n\t+ The BRAF gene mutation that causes this condition is somatic, meaning that it occurs during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells.\n\t+ The mutation affects a single amino acid in the BRAF protein.

This misregulation can result in the various features of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines.\n\n**Cholangiocarcinoma**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cholangiocarcinoma\n\n**Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Gastrointestinal stromal tumor\n\n**Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**\n\nSomatic mutations in the BRAF gene, most frequently the V600E mutation (described above), have been identified in some individuals with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This disorder causes an abnormal accumulation of certain immune cells called Langerhans cells in multiple tissues and organs, which often leads to the formation of tumors called granulomas.\n\nMany researchers consider Langerhans cell histiocytosis to be a form of cancer, but this classification is controversial. The BRAF gene mutations, which are found only in the abnormal Langerhans cells, cause the BRAF protein to be continuously active. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of Langerhans cell histiocytosis by allowing the Langerhans cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.\n\nIn some other forms of histiocytosis such as Erdheim-Chester disease (described above), the histiocytes do not include Langerhans cells; a disorder of that type is classified as a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is not clear why the V600E mutation can cause different forms of histiocytosis.\n\n**Lung Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Lung cancer\n\n**Melanoma**\n\nThe V600E mutation (described above) in the BRAF gene has also been found in about half of noninherited (sporadic) cases of melanoma. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes.\n\nIn this cancer, a somatic V600E mutation occurs during a person's lifetime, likely caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or other environmental risk factors. This mutation often leads only to the formation of a noncancerous mole. At least one additional mutation is necessary for the development of melanoma.\n\n---\n\n**BRAF Gene**\n\nThe BRAF gene is a crucial component in the development of various cancers. It plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and division.\n\n**Cancers Associated with BRAF Mutations**\n\nSomatic mutations in the BRAF gene are common in several types of cancer, including:\n\n*   Cancers of the colon and rectum\n*   Ovary\n*   Thyroid gland\n\nThese mutations cause the BRAF protein to be continuously active, leading to the growth of abnormal cells without external signals.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe BRAF gene has several other names, including:\n\n*   94 kDa B-raf protein\n*   B-raf 1\n*   B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase\n*   BRAF1\n*   BRAF1_HUMAN\n*   Murine sarcoma viral (v-raf) oncogene homolog B1\n*   p94\n*   RAFB1\n*   v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on the BRAF gene and its association with various cancers:\n\n*   Allen CE, Parsons DW.

    "content": "**BRCA Genetic Test**\n\nA BRCA gene test uses a sample of your blood, saliva (spit), or cells from inside of your cheek to look for changes in your BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that may increase your risk of cancer.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nThis test is used to find out if you have harmful changes in your BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes that increase your risk of getting certain cancers, especially breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer.\n\n**Why do I need a BRCA gene test?**\n\nHarmful BRCA gene variants are rare. They affect only about 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. So, BRCA testing is not recommended for most people.\n\nYou and your family members are more likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant if either side of your family has a strong history of breast or ovarian cancer. If you're concerned that you may have a harmful variant in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, your health care provider or a genetic counselor can review your personal and family health history to see if you need this test.\n\n**When do I need a BRCA gene test?**\n\nIn general, it's important to talk with a provider about BRCA testing if your personal or family health history includes:\n\n* Breast cancer, especially:\n\t+ Before age 50\n\t+ In both breasts\n\t+ In a male\n\t+ Triple negative breast cancer which has limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and/or surgery\n* Cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes (tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus), or peritoneum (tissue that covers your belly organs).\n* Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer).\n* Pancreatic cancer.\n* Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. BRCA variants are much more common in this group compared with the general population. They are also more common in people from other parts of Europe, including Iceland, Norway, and Denmark.\n* A relative already diagnosed with a harmful gene variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\n**What happens during a BRCA gene test?**\n\nA BRCA test can use either a sample of your blood, saliva, or a cheek swab.\n\nFor a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a saliva test: You'll spit into a container or use a cotton pad to soak up some saliva.\n\nFor a cheek swab: A health care professional will wipe the inside of your cheek with a small tool to remove some cells. You may have the option of doing it yourself.\n\nAn at-home test kit is available to buy without a prescription. It allows you to collect a saliva sample to send to a lab for testing. The test checks for the three most common harmful variants in BRCA genes. But there are more than 1000 known variants. So, a home test can't rule out the possibility that you have a variant. Ask your provider whether an at-home test is right for you.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nFor a blood test: You don't need any special preparations.\n\nFor a saliva test: A half hour before the test, you may need to stop eating, drinking, or smoking. Follow all the instructions your provider gives you or the instructions in an at-home kit.\n\nFor a cheek swab: You may be asked to rinse your mouth before the test.\n\nWith any type of genetic test, you may want to meet with a genetic counselor first to see if testing is right for you. Your counselor can explain the pros and cons of learning more about your cancer risk. After your test, a counselor can help with the medical and emotional impact that your results may have on you and your family.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere are no risks linked to providing a saliva sample or having a cheek swab.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour provider or genetic counselor will need to explain how your results affect your risk for certain cancers. That's because the meaning of your test results depends on the exact type of variant you have and your personal and family health history.\n\nIn general, your results may be reported using these terms:\n\n* A negative (normal) result means that the test didn't find any harmful changes in your BRCA genes.\n* An uncertain result may also be called a \"variant of uncertain significance (VUS)\". It means that a variant in your BRCA genes was found, but researchers don't know whether that variant causes cancer.\n* A positive result may also be called a \"likely pathogenic variant.\" It means that you have a harmful gene variant that is known to increase the risk of certain cancers. But the test cannot tell whether you will develop cancer.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a BRCA gene test?**\n\nIf your results show that you have a harmful variant in your BRCA genes, talk with your provider about ways to lower your cancer risk. You may discuss:\n\n* Your schedule for cancer screening tests. Should you get tested for cancer sooner and more often than usual?\n* Taking certain medicines and/or having surgery to reduce the risk of cancer. Surgery may include removing both breasts and/or the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\n\nNote: This is a cleaned version of the original content, with bold headings, lists formatted as *items*, and sections separated by \\n\\n.\n\n---\n\n**BRCA Genetic Test**\n\n**What is it?**\nA BRCA gene test uses a sample of your blood, saliva, or cells from inside your cheek to look for changes in your BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that may increase your risk of cancer.\n\n**Why do I need a BRCA gene test?**\nHarmful BRCA gene variants are rare. They affect only about 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. So, BRCA testing is not recommended for most people. You and your family members are more likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant if either side of your family has a strong history of breast or ovarian cancer.\n\n**When do I need a BRCA gene test?**\nIn general, it's important to talk with a provider about BRCA testing if your personal or family health history includes:\n\n* Breast cancer, especially:\n\t+ Before age 50\n\t+ In both breasts\n\t+ In a male\n\t+ Triple negative breast cancer which has limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and/or surgery\n* Cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes (tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus), or peritoneum (tissue that covers your belly organs).\n* Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer).\n* Pancreatic cancer.\n* Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. BRCA variants are much more common in this group compared with the general population. They are also more common in people from other parts of Europe, including Iceland, Norway, and Denmark.\n* A relative already diagnosed with a harmful gene variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\n**What happens during a BRCA gene test?**\nA BRCA test can use either a sample of your blood, saliva, or a cheek swab. For a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. For a saliva test: You'll spit into a container or use a cotton pad to soak up some saliva. For a cheek swab: A health care professional will wipe the inside of your cheek with a small tool to remove some cells.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\nFor a blood test: You don't need any special preparations. For a saliva test: A half hour before the test, you may need to stop eating, drinking, or smoking. Follow all the instructions your provider gives you or the instructions in an at-home kit. For a cheek swab: You may be asked to rinse your mouth before the test.\n\n---\n\n**BRCA Genetic Test**\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nBefore taking the BRCA genetic test, stop eating, drinking, or smoking. Follow all the instructions your provider gives you or the instructions in an at-home kit.\n\n* For a blood test: You don't need any special preparations.\n* For a saliva test: A half hour before the test, you may need to stop eating, drinking, or smoking. Follow all the instructions your provider gives you or the instructions in an at-home kit.\n* For a cheek swab: You may be asked to rinse your mouth before the test.\n\nWith any type of genetic test, you may want to meet with a genetic counselor first to see if testing is right for you. Your counselor can explain the pros and cons of learning more about your cancer risk. After your test, a counselor can help with the medical and emotional impact that your results may have on you and your family.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere are no risks linked to providing a saliva sample or having a cheek swab.\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nYour provider or genetic counselor will need to explain how your results affect your risk for certain cancers.

    "content": "**BRCA1 and BRCA2 Gene Testing**\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene test is a blood test that can tell you if you have a higher risk of getting cancer.\n\n**What is the BRCA Gene Mutation?**\n\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that suppress malignant tumors (cancer) in humans. When these genes change (become mutated) they do not suppress tumors like they should. So people with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are at a higher risk of getting cancer.\n\nWomen with this mutation are at higher risk of getting breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Mutations may also increase a woman's risk of developing:\n\n* Cervical cancer\n* Uterine cancer\n* Colon cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Gallbladder cancer or bile duct cancer\n* Stomach cancer\n* Melanoma\n\nMen with this mutation are also more likely to get cancer. Mutations may increase a man's risk of developing:\n\n* Breast cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Testicular cancer\n* Prostate cancer\n\nOnly about 5% of breast cancers and 10% to 15% of ovarian cancers are associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\n**Who Should Think About Being Tested?**\n\nBefore being tested, you should speak with a genetic counselor to learn more about the tests, and the risks and benefits of testing.\n\nIf you have a family member with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, find out if that person has been tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation. If that person does have the mutation, you might consider getting tested, too.\n\nSomeone in your family may have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if:\n\n* Two or more close relatives (parents, siblings, children) have breast cancer before the age of 50\n* A male relative has breast cancer\n* A female relative has both breast and ovarian cancer\n* Two relatives have ovarian cancer\n* You are of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, and a close relative has breast or ovarian cancer\n\nYou have a very low chance of having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if:\n\n* You do not have a relative that had breast cancer before the age of 50\n* You do not have a relative that had ovarian cancer\n* You do not have a relative that had male breast cancer\n\n**How is the Test Done?**\n\nBefore the test is done, speak to a genetic counselor to decide whether to have the test.\n\nBring your medical history, family's medical history, and questions with you.\nYou might want to bring someone with you to listen and take notes. It is hard to hear and remember everything.\n\nIf you decide to be tested, your blood sample is sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. That lab will test your blood for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. It can take weeks or months to get the test results.\n\n**What Does a Positive Test Result Mean?**\n\nA positive test result means you have inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n\nThis does not mean you have cancer, or even that you will get cancer. This means you are at a higher risk of getting cancer.\nThis also means you can or could have passed this mutation on to your children. Each time you have a child there is a 50% chance that your child will get the mutation you have.\n\nWhen you know you are at higher risk of developing cancer, you can decide if you will do anything differently.\n\nYou may want to be screened for cancer more often, so it can be caught early and treated.\nThere may be medicine you can take that could reduce your chance of getting cancer.\nYou may choose to have surgery to remove your breasts or ovaries.\n\nNone of these precautions will guarantee you will not get cancer.\n\n**What Does a Negative Test Result Mean?**\n\nIf your test result for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is negative, the genetic counselor will tell you what this means. Your family history will help the genetic counselor understand a negative test result.\n\nA negative test result does not mean you will not get cancer. It may mean you have the same risk of getting cancer as people who do not have this mutation.\n\nBe sure to discuss all results of your tests, even negative results, with your genetic counselor.\n\n---\n\n**BRCA1 and BRCA2 Gene Testing**\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene test is a blood test that can tell you if you have a higher risk of getting cancer. The name BRCA comes from the first two letters of breast cancer.\n\n**What Does the Test Involve?**\n\n*   Bring your medical history, family's medical history, and questions with you.\n*   You might want to bring someone with you to listen and take notes.

    "content": "**BRCA1 Gene**\n\nThe BRCA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The BRCA1 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA.\n* In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA.\n* These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division.\n* By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA1 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Breast Cancer**: Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer.\n* **Ovarian Cancer**: Many of the same BRCA1 gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\n* **Prostate Cancer**: Inherited BRCA1 gene mutations have been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n* **Cholangiocarcinoma**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cholangiocarcinoma\n* **Fanconi Anemia**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Fanconi anemia\n\n---\n\n**BRCA1 Gene**\n\n**Increased Risk of Cancers**\n\nInherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene also increase the risk of several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and colon cancer.\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\nMutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer. These mutations are present in every cell in the body and can be passed from one generation to the next. As a result, they are associated with cancers that cluster in families. However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the BRCA1 gene will develop cancer. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.\n\nMost BRCA1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the BRCA1 protein or prevent any protein from being made from one copy of the gene. As a result, less of this protein is available to help repair damaged DNA or fix mutations that occur in other genes. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor.\n\n**Ovarian Cancer**\n\nMany of the same BRCA1 gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer also increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Families with these mutations are often said to be affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Women with BRCA1 gene mutations have a 35 to 60 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetimes, as compared with 1.6 percent in the general population.\n\n**Prostate Cancer**\n\nInherited BRCA1 gene mutations have been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer. These mutations likely reduce the BRCA1 protein's ability to repair DNA, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist in various other genes. The accumulation of damaging mutations can lead to the out-of-control cell growth and division that can cause a tumor to develop. Men who carry a BRCA1 gene mutation may also be at increased risk for other cancers, including breast and pancreatic cancer.\n\n**Cholangiocarcinoma**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cholangiocarcinoma\n\n**Fanconi Anemia**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Fanconi anemia\n\n---\n\n**BRCA1 Gene**\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nInherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene also increase the risk of several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. These mutations impair the ability of the BRCA1 protein to help repair damaged DNA. As defects accumulate in DNA, they can trigger cells to grow and divide without order to form a tumor. It is not clear why different individuals with BRCA1 mutations develop cancers in different organs. Environmental factors that affect specific organs may contribute to the development of cancers at particular sites.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* BRCA1 gene\n* BRCA1_HUMAN\n* BRCC1\n* breast cancer 1\n* breast cancer 1 gene\n* breast cancer 1, early onset\n* breast cancer 1, early onset gene\n* breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene\n* breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein\n* IRIS\n* PPP1R53\n* PSCP\n* RNF53\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of BRCA1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ BRCA1 DNA REPAIR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BRCA1\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Antoniou A, Pharoah PD, Narod S, Risch HA, Eyfjord JE, Hopper JL, Loman N, Olsson H, Johannsson O, Borg A, Pasini B, Radice P, Manoukian S, Eccles DM, Tang N, Olah E, Anton-Culver H, Warner E, Lubinski J, Gronwald J, Gorski B, Tulinius H, Thorlacius S, Eerola H, Nevanlinna H, Syrjakoski K, Kallioniemi OP, Thompson D, Evans C, Peto J, Lalloo F, Evans DG, Easton DF.

    "content": "**BRCA2 Gene**\n\nThe BRCA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe BRCA2 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA2 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.\n\nResearchers suspect that the BRCA2 protein has additional functions within cells. For example, the protein may help regulate cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. Researchers are investigating the protein's other potential activities.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Breast Cancer**: Mutations in the BRCA2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer.\n*   **Ovarian Cancer**: Many of the same BRCA2 gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\n*   **Prostate Cancer**: Inherited BRCA2 gene mutations have been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   The BRCA2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information by helping to repair damaged DNA.\n*   Researchers are investigating the protein's other potential activities, including its possible role in regulating cytokinesis.\n\n---\n\n**BRCA2 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Breast Cancer**\n    Inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer.\n    These mutations are present in every cell in the body and can be passed from one generation to the next.\n    However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the BRCA2 gene will develop cancer.\n    Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.\n\n*   **Ovarian Cancer**\n    Many of the same BRCA2 gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\n    Families with these mutations are often said to be affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.\n    Women with BRCA2 gene mutations have an approximately 12 to 25 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetimes, as compared with 1.6 percent in the general population.\n\n*   **Prostate Cancer**\n    Inherited BRCA2 gene mutations increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n    Men with these mutations are also more likely to develop prostate cancer at an earlier age and may be at increased risk of having an aggressive form of the disease.\n    They may also be at increased risk for other cancers.\n\n*   **Other Cancers**\n    Inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene also increase the risk of several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma.\n\n---\n\n**BRCA2 Gene**\n\nInherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene also increase the risk of several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\n*   Pancreatic cancer\n*   Melanoma (aggressive form of skin cancer)\n\nThese mutations impair the ability of the BRCA2 protein to help repair damaged DNA. As defects accumulate in DNA, they can trigger cells to grow and divide without order to form a tumor. It is not clear why different individuals with BRCA2 mutations develop cancers in different organs. Environmental factors that affect specific organs may contribute to the development of cancers at particular sites.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   brca 2 gene\n*   BRCC2\n*   breast cancer 2\n*   breast cancer 2 gene\n*   breast cancer 2, early onset\n*   breast cancer type 2 susceptibility gene\n*   breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein\n*   FACD\n*   FAD\n*   FAD1\n*   FANCB\n*   FANCD1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of BRCA2\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   BRCA2 DNA REPAIR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BRCA2\n    *   FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP D1; FANCD1\n*   Gene and Variant Databases:\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n*   Chen S, Parmigiani G.

    "content": "**Biotinidase Deficiency**\n\nBiotinidase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BTD gene. The disorder can affect many parts of the body and cause delayed development if left untreated.\n\n**Causes of Biotinidase Deficiency**\n\nMore than 150 mutations in the BTD gene have been identified in people with biotinidase deficiency. These mutations change single amino acids in the biotinidase enzyme, reducing or eliminating its activity. Most BTD gene mutations cause profound biotinidase deficiency, resulting in a severe form of the disorder characterized by reduced biotinidase activity to less than 10 percent of normal.\n\n**Symptoms and Effects**\n\nBiotinidase deficiency can affect many parts of the body and cause delayed development if left untreated. The symptoms and effects of the disorder can vary depending on the severity of the mutation, but may include:\n\n* Delayed development\n* Skin rashes\n* Hair loss\n* Diarrhea\n* Vomiting\n* Seizures\n* Muscle weakness\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nBiotinidase deficiency is typically treated with biotin supplements. The dosage and duration of treatment vary depending on the severity of the disorder and the individual's response to therapy. In some cases, a combination of biotin and other nutrients may be necessary to manage the symptoms and effects of the disorder.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no cure for biotinidase deficiency, early detection and treatment can help manage the symptoms and effects of the disorder. Newborn screening programs can identify infants with biotinidase deficiency, allowing for prompt treatment and reducing the risk of complications.\n\n---\n\n**BTD Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Biocytin Hydrolase\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of BTD\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ BIOTINIDASE; BTD\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Dobrowolski SF, Angeletti J, Banas RA, Naylor EW.

    "content": "**BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) Test**\n\nA BUN, or blood urea nitrogen test, measures the amount of urea nitrogen in your blood. Urea nitrogen is a waste product that forms as your body breaks down proteins. It's carried in your blood and then removed by your kidneys when you urinate (pee).\n\n**What does it measure?**\n\nHaving a small amount of urea nitrogen in your blood is normal. But higher-than-normal BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working well. If you have kidney disease, this waste material can build up in your blood and may lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, anemia, and heart disease.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA BUN test is often part of a series of tests called a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). It can help diagnose or monitor kidney diseases.\n\n**Why do I need a BUN test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a BUN test:\n\n* As part of a routine checkup\n* To monitor the treatment of a kidney disease\n* For screening if you are at risk of a kidney problem, since early kidney disease usually does not have any signs or symptoms. You may be at risk of developing a kidney problem because of:\n\t+ A family history of kidney problems\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ High blood pressure\n\t+ Heart disease\n\t+ Obesity\n\t+ Being over the age of 60\n\t+ Smoking or using other tobacco products\n\nYour provider may also check your BUN levels if you are having symptoms of later-stage kidney disease, which can include:\n\n* Needing to go the bathroom (urinate) frequently or infrequently\n* Itching\n* Fatigue\n* Swelling in your arms, legs, or feet\n* Muscle cramps\n* Trouble sleeping\n\n**What happens during a BUN test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nUsually, no special preparation is necessary for a BUN test. But if your provider has ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nNormal BUN levels can vary, but generally, a high blood urea nitrogen level is a sign that your kidneys are not working well. But abnormal results don't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. BUN levels can vary according to your sex. They also usually increase with age.\n\nA few other reasons your BUN level might be higher than normal include:\n\n* Dehydration (too little fluid in your body)\n* Burns\n* Certain medicines\n* A high-protein diet\n* A recent heart attack\n\nA few other reasons your BUN levels might be lower than normal include:\n\n* A lack of protein in your diet\n* Malnutrition\n* Liver disease\n\n---\n\n**BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nUsually, no special preparation is necessary for a BUN test.

    "content": "**Babinski Reflex**\n\nReflexes are responses that occur when the body receives a certain stimulus. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out.\n\n**Normal Reflex in Infants and Children**\n\nBabinski reflex is one of the normal reflexes in infants and in children up to 2 years old. It disappears as the child gets older. It may disappear as early as 12 months. In adults, this reflex is not normal and often indicates a problem with the brain or spinal cord.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen the Babinski reflex is present in a child older than 2 years or in an adult, it is often a sign of a central nervous system disorder. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. Disorders may include:\n\n* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig disease)\n* Brain tumor or injury\n* Meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord)\n* Viral infection of the brain\n* Multiple sclerosis\n* Spinal cord injury, defect, or tumor\n* Stroke\n* Neurodegenerative diseases\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nReflex - Babinski; Extensor plantar reflex; Babinski sign\n\n---\n\n**Babinski Reflex**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe Babinski reflex is a neurological test used to assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract. It involves stroking the sole of the foot with a firm object, typically a key or a similar instrument. The response to this stimulus is a crucial indicator of the function and health of the nervous system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clinical Significance**\n\nThe Babinski reflex has significant clinical implications in diagnosing and managing various neurological conditions. It helps healthcare professionals identify abnormalities in the corticospinal tract, which can be indicative of underlying diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, or peripheral neuropathies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Procedure**\n\nTo perform the Babinski reflex test, the following steps should be taken:\n\n*   The patient is seated comfortably with their feet exposed.\n*   A firm object, typically a key, is used to stroke the sole of the foot in a gentle but firm manner.\n*   The response to this stimulus is observed and recorded.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe interpretation of the Babinski reflex test involves evaluating the patient's response to the stimulus. A normal response is characterized by flexion of the great toe, while an abnormal response may indicate underlying neurological conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the Babinski reflex is a valuable diagnostic tool in assessing the integrity of the corticospinal tract. Its clinical significance extends to various neurological conditions, making it an essential test for healthcare professionals to perform and interpret correctly.",

    "content": "**Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Vaccine**\n\n**Why is this medicine prescribed?**\n\nBCG vaccine provides immunity or protection against tuberculosis (TB). The vaccine may be given to persons at high risk of developing TB. It is also used to treat bladder tumors or bladder cancer.\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nYour doctor or a health care provider will administer this medicine. When used to protect against TB, it is injected into the skin. Keep the vaccination area dry for 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, and keep the area clean until you cannot tell the vaccination area from the skin around it.\n\nWhen used for bladder cancer, the medicine flows into your bladder through a tube or catheter. Avoid drinking fluids for 4 hours before your treatment. You should empty your bladder before treatment. During the first hour after the medication is infused, you will lie on your stomach, back, and sides for 15 minutes each. Then you will stand, but you should keep the medication in your bladder for another hour. If you cannot keep the medication in your bladder for the entire 2 hours, tell your health care provider. At the end of 2 hours you will empty your bladder in a seated manner for safety reasons. Your urine should be disinfected for 6 hours after the medication is administered. Pour a similar amount of undiluted bleach in the toilet after you urinate. Let it stand for 15 minutes before flushing.\n\nVarious dosing schedules may be used. Your doctor will schedule your treatment. Ask your doctor to explain any directions you do not understand.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given to protect against TB, it usually is given only one time but may be repeated if there is not a good response in 2-3 months. Response is measured by a TB skin test.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving BCG vaccine,\n\n*   tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to BCG vaccine or any other drugs.\n*   tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially antibiotics, cancer chemotherapy agents, steroids, tuberculosis medications, and vitamins.\n*   tell your doctor if you have had a recent smallpox vaccination or if you have had a positive TB test.\n*   tell your doctor if you have an immune disorder, cancer, fever, an infection, or an area of severe burns on your body.\n*   tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking BCG vaccine, call your doctor immediately.\n\n**What side effects can this medicine cause?**\n\nBCG vaccine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   swollen lymph nodes\n*   small red areas at the site of injection.

    "content": "**Bacillus Coagulans**\n\n**What is it?**\nBacillus coagulans (B. coagulans) is a type of probiotic (\"good\" bacteria). It isn't naturally found in the body, but it produces lactic acid in the gut.\n\nB. coagulans is now known as Weizmannia coagulans. However, most products continue to use the name Bacillus. Also, some products containing B. coagulans are marketed as Lactobacillus sporogenes. Although both lactobacillus and B. coagulans produce a compound called lactic acid, unlike lactobacillus, B. coagulans forms spores. Spores are important for telling B. coagulans apart from other lactic acid bacteria.\n\nPeople take B. coagulans for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is also used for diarrhea, gas, indigestion, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.\n\nDon't confuse B. coagulans with other probiotics, or with fermented food products such as fermented milk, kefir, or yogurt. These are not the same.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for BACILLUS COAGULANS are as follows:\n\nPossibly effective for...\n\n* Constipation. Taking B. coagulans by mouth seems to help relieve constipation.\n* A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Taking B. coagulans by mouth seems to help relieve symptoms of IBS.\n\nThere is interest in using B. coagulans for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: B. coagulans is possibly safe. It's been used safely in doses of up to 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 3 months. Lower doses have been used safely for up to 1 year.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if B. coagulans is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: B. coagulans is possibly safe when taken by mouth by most infants and children. It's been used safely in infants in doses of up to 100 million CFUs daily for up to one year. However, there isn't enough reliable information to know if Bacillus coagulans is safe for very small premature infants.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nModerate\n\nBe cautious with this combination.\n\n* Antibiotic drugs: B. coagulans is a type of friendly bacteria. Antibiotics are used to reduce harmful bacteria in the body. Taking antibiotics along with B. coagulans can reduce the effects of B. coagulans. To avoid this interaction, take B. coagulans products at least 2 hours before or after antibiotics.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nB. coagulans has most often been used by adults in doses of 1-2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) by mouth daily for 4-12 weeks. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other names**\n\n* B.

Bacitracin is in a class of medications called antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nOphthalmic bacitracin comes as an ointment to apply to the eyes. It is usually applied one to three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bacitracin eye ointment exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou should expect your symptoms to improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not go away, or if you develop other problems with your eyes during your treatment.\n\nUse ophthalmic bacitracin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ophthalmic bacitracin too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\nTo use the eye ointment, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   Use a mirror or have someone else apply the ointment.\n*   Avoid touching the tip of the tube against your eye or anything else. The ointment must be kept clean.\n*   Tilt your head forward slightly.\n*   Holding the tube between your thumb and index finger, place the tube as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.\n*   With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of your eye down to form a pocket.\n*   Place a small amount of ointment into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. A 1/2 inch (1.25-centimeter) strip of ointment usually is enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n*   Look downward, then gently close your eyes and keep them closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap right away.\n*   Wipe off any excess ointment from your eyelids and lashes with a clean tissue. Do not rub your eyes, even if your vision is blurry. Wash your hands again.\n\nIf your doctor has told you to use bacitracin eye ointment to treat an infection on your eyelids, carefully wipe your eyelids with water to remove scales and crusts. Then spread a small amount of the ointment evenly over the affected eyelid areas.\n\n---\n\n**Bacitracin Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Using the Medicine**\n\nApply a small amount of ointment evenly over the affected eyelid areas after carefully wiping your eyelids with water to remove scales and crusts.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bacitracin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in bacitracin eye ointment.

Learn how to lift the right way and make changes at work, if needed.\n\n**Tips to Help Prevent Back Pain When You Return to Work**\n\n*   **Exercise helps to prevent future back pain:**\n    *   Exercise a little every day. Walking is a good way to keep your heart healthy and your muscles strong. If walking is too hard for you, work with a physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that you can do.\n    *   Keep doing the exercises you have been shown to strengthen your core muscles, which support your back. A stronger core helps lower your risk for further back injuries.\n*   **If you are overweight, ask your health care provider about ways you can lose some weight.** Carrying around extra weight adds stress to your back no matter what kind of work you do.\n*   **Long car rides and getting in and out of the car can be hard on your back. If you have a long commute to work, consider some of these changes:**\n    *   Adjust your car seat to make it easier to enter, sit in, and get out of your car. Bring your seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending forward when you are driving.\n    *   If you drive long distances, stop and walk around every hour.\n    *   Do not lift heavy objects right after a long car ride.\n\n**Learn How to Lift**\n\n*   **Know how much you can safely lift.** Think about how much you have lifted in the past and how easy or hard that was. If an object seems too heavy or awkward, get help to move or lift it.\n*   **If your work requires you to do lifting that may not be safe for your back, talk with your boss.** Try to find out the most weight you should have to lift. You may need to meet with a physical therapist or occupational therapist to learn how to safely lift this amount of weight.\n\n**Follow these steps when you bend and lift to help prevent back pain and injury:**\n\n*   Spread your feet apart to give your body a wide base of support.\n*   Stand as close as possible to the object you are lifting.\n*   Bend at your knees, not at your waist.\n*   Tighten your stomach muscles as you lift the object up or lower it down.\n*   Hold the object as close to your body as you can.\n*   Lift slowly, using the muscles in your hips and knees.\n*   As you stand up with the object, do not bend forward.\n*   Do not twist your back while you bend to reach the object, lift the object up, or carry the object.\n*   Squat as you set the object down, using the muscles in your knees and hips.\n\n**Some providers recommend using a back brace to help support the spine.** A brace may help prevent injuries for workers who have to lift heavy objects. But, using a brace too much can allow the core muscles that support your back to weaken, making back pain problems worse.\n\n**Changes at Work**\n\n*   **If your back pain is worse at work, it may be that your work station is not set up correctly.**\n*   If you sit at a computer at work, make sure that your chair has a straight back with an adjustable seat and back, armrests, and a swivel seat.\n*   Ask about having a trained therapist assess your workspace or movements to see if changes, such as a new chair or a cushioned mat under your feet, would help.\n*   Get up and move around during the workday.

    "content": "**Back Pain - When You See the Doctor**\n\nWhen you first see your health care provider for back pain, you will be asked about your back pain, including how often and when it occurs and how severe it is.\n\nYour provider will try to determine the cause of your pain and whether it is likely to quickly get better with simple measures, such as ice, mild painkillers, physical therapy, and exercise.\n\n**Information**\n\n* Is your back pain on one side only or both sides?\n* What does the pain feel like? Is it dull, sharp, throbbing, or burning?\n* Is this the first time you have had back pain?\n* When did the pain begin? Did it start suddenly?\n* Did you have an injury or accident?\n* What were you doing just before the pain began? For example, were you lifting or bending? Sitting at your computer? Driving a long distance?\n* If you have had back pain before, is this pain similar or different? In what way is it different?\n* Do you know what caused your back pain in the past?\n* How long does each episode of back pain usually last?\n* Do you feel the pain anywhere else, such as in your hip, thigh, leg or feet?\n* Do you have any numbness or tingling? Any weakness or loss of function in your leg or elsewhere?\n* What makes the pain worse? Lifting, twisting, standing, or sitting for long periods?\n* What makes you feel better?\n* Does bearing down or straining make your pain worse?\n\nYou will also be asked if you have other symptoms, which may point to a more serious cause. Tell your provider if you have had weight loss, fever, a change in urination or bowel habits, or a history of cancer.\n\n**Physical Exam**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam to try to find the exact location of your pain, and determine how it affects your movement. Your back will be pressed on at different spots to find where it hurts. You will also be asked to:\n\n* Sit, stand, and walk\n* Walk on your toes and then your heels\n* Bend forward, backward, and sideways\n* Lift your legs straight up while lying down\n* Move your back in certain positions\n\nIf the pain is worse and goes down your leg when you lift your legs straight up while lying down, you may have sciatica, especially if you also feel numbness or tingling going down the same leg.\n\nYour provider will also move your legs into different positions, including bending and straightening your knees.\n\nA small rubber hammer is used to check your reflexes and to see if your nerves are working properly. Your provider will touch your skin in many places, using a pin, cotton swab, or feather. This reveals how well you can feel or sense things. Your provider may also scratch the bottom of your feet to see whether you have the right reflexes.\n\n**References**\n\nDixit R. Low back pain.
