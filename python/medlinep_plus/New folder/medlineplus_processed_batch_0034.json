    "content": "**Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Causes_\n\nCancer grows out of cells in the body. Normal cells multiply when the body needs them, and die when they are damaged or the body doesn't need them.\n\nCancer occurs when the genetic material of a cell becomes changed. This results in cells growing out of control. Cells divide too quickly and do not die in a normal way.\n\nThere are many kinds of cancer. Cancer can develop in almost any organ or tissue, such as the lung, colon, breast, skin, bones, or nerve tissue.\n\nThere are many risk factors for cancer, including:\n\n* Smoking tobacco or other substances\n* Chewing tobacco\n* Benzene and other chemical exposures\n* Drinking too much alcohol\n* Environmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of mold that can grow on peanut plants and produce a toxin called aflatoxin\n* Genetic problems\n* Obesity\n* Radiation exposure\n* Too much sunlight exposure\n* Viruses\n\nThe cause of many cancers remains unknown.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer. For example, lung cancer can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Colon cancer may cause diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool.\n\nSome cancers may not have any symptoms. In certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage.\n\nThe following symptoms may occur with cancer:\n\n* Chills\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite\n* Malaise\n* Night sweats\n* Pain\n* Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nLike symptoms, the signs of cancer vary based on the type and location of the tumor. Common tests include the following:\n\n* Biopsy of the tumor\n* Blood tests (which look for chemicals called tumor markers that can be elevated or abnormal with certain types of cancer)\n* Bone marrow biopsy (for lymphoma or leukemia)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* CT scan\n* Liver function lab tests\n* MRI scan\n* PET scan\n\nMost cancers are diagnosed by biopsy. Depending on the location of the tumor, the biopsy may be a simple procedure or a serious operation. Most people with cancer have CT scans to determine the exact location and size of the tumor or tumors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Treatment_\n\nTreatment varies, based on the type of cancer and its stage. The stage of a cancer refers to how much it has grown and whether the tumor has spread from its original location.\n\nIf the cancer is in one location and has not spread, the most common treatment approach is surgery to cure the cancer. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon.\n\nIf the tumor has spread to local lymph nodes only, sometimes these can also be removed with the tumor.\n\nIf surgery cannot remove all of the cancer, the options for treatment may include radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted cancer therapies, or other types of treatment. Some cancers require a combination of treatments. Lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is rarely treated with surgery. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and other nonsurgical therapies are often used.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Support Groups_\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of cancer often causes a lot of anxiety and can affect a person's entire life. There are many resources for cancer patients.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nThe outlook depends on the type of cancer and the stage of the cancer when diagnosed.\n\nSome cancers can be cured. Other cancers that are not curable can still be treated effectively. Some people can live for many years with cancer. Other tumors are quickly life threatening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nComplications depend on the type and stage of cancer. The cancer may spread.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Prevention_\n\nYou can reduce the risk of getting a cancerous (malignant) tumor by:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Exercising regularly\n* Limiting alcohol\n* Maintaining a healthy weight\n* Minimizing your exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals\n* Not smoking or chewing tobacco\n* Reducing sun exposure, especially if you burn easily\n\nCancer screenings, such as mammography for breast cancer and stool blood testing or colonoscopy for colon cancer, may help catch these cancers at their early stages when they are most treatable. Some people at high risk for developing certain cancers can take medicines to reduce their risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n_Alternative Names_\n\nCarcinoma; Malignant tumor\n\n---\n\n**Cancer**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCancer grows out of cells in the body.

For example, in Japan, there are many cases of stomach cancer. But in the United States this type of cancer is much less common. Differences in diet or environmental factors may play a role.\n\nSome other types of cancer include:\n\n* Brain cancer\n* Cervical cancer\n* Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Kidney cancer\n* Leukemia\n* Liver cancer\n* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Ovarian cancer\n* Pancreatic cancer\n* Testicular cancer\n* Thyroid cancer\n* Uterine cancer\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer.

It's essential to discuss the type, size, and location of the cancer with your healthcare provider when you're diagnosed. You'll also want to ask about treatment options, along with the prognosis (likely outcome), benefits, and risks.\n\nHaving someone with you at the provider's office can help you get through and understand the diagnosis. If you have trouble asking questions after hearing about your diagnosis, the person you bring with you can ask them for you.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nLike symptoms, the signs of cancer vary based on the type and location of the tumor.

    "content": "**Cancers**\n\nCancers are diseases that result from an uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. The term \"cancer\" refers to a group of related diseases, each with its own unique characteristics.\n\n**What is Cancer?**\n\nCancer occurs when the genetic material in a cell's DNA becomes damaged or altered, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation. This process can be triggered by various factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices.\n\n**Types of Cancers**\n\nThere are over 100 different types of cancers, each with its own distinct features and treatment options. Some common types of cancers include:\n\n* *Breast Cancer*\n* *Lung Cancer*\n* *Colorectal Cancer*\n* *Prostate Cancer*\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhile the exact causes of cancer are still not fully understood, research has identified several risk factors that can increase an individual's likelihood of developing the disease. These include:\n\n* Family history\n* Genetic mutations\n* Exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing substances)\n* Poor diet and lifestyle choices\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nCancer symptoms can vary widely depending on the type and location of the tumor. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Unexplained weight loss\n* Fatigue\n* Pain or discomfort\n* Changes in bowel or bladder habits\n\nIf cancer is suspected, a healthcare provider will typically perform a physical exam, take a thorough medical history, and order diagnostic tests such as imaging studies, biopsies, or laboratory tests.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the individual's overall health and preferences. Common treatment options include:\n\n* Surgery\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Hormone therapy\n* Targeted therapy\n\nIt is essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for each unique situation.\n\n**Prevention and Screening**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent cancer, certain lifestyle choices and preventive measures can reduce the risk of developing the disease. These include:\n\n* Maintaining a healthy weight\n* Engaging in regular exercise\n* Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\n* Avoiding tobacco products and excessive sun exposure\n\nRegular cancer screening tests can also help detect the disease at an early stage, when it is more treatable. These may include:\n\n* Mammograms for breast cancer\n* Pap tests for cervical cancer\n* Colonoscopies for colorectal cancer\n\nBy staying informed and taking proactive steps, individuals can reduce their risk of developing cancer and improve their chances of successful treatment and recovery.",

    "content": "**Candesartan: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCandesartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Candesartan is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat congestive heart failure (a condition when your heart can not pump enough blood to the other parts of the body). Candesartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCandesartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take candesartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take candesartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of candesartan and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks.\n\nCandesartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 4 to 6 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of candesartan. Continue to take candesartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking candesartan without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Do not take candesartan if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are taking candesartan, stop taking candesartan and call your doctor immediately. Candesartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take a dose of candesartan, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCandesartan may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* Dizziness\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle pain\n* Diarrhea\n* Stomach upset\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of candesartan and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep candesartan in its original container, tightly closed. Store it at room temperature and away from moisture and light. Throw away any unused medicine after the expiration date or 30 days after opening, whichever is sooner.\n\nIn case of emergency/overdose:\n\n* If you take too much candesartan, call your doctor immediately.\n* If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\t+ Severe dizziness\n\t+ Seizures\n\t+ Confusion\n\t+ Difficulty breathing\n\n\\n\\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCandesartan is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Do not share candesartan with others, even if they have similar symptoms or illnesses. Do not take more or less of candesartan than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nBrand names:\n\n* Atacand\n* Atacand HCT\n\nBrand names of combination products:\n\n* Atacand HCT (candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide)\n\n---\n\n**Candesartan: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **How to Take Candesartan**\n    *   Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of candesartan and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks.\n    *   Candesartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it.

Do not stop taking candesartan without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other Uses**\n    *   Candesartan is also sometimes used to treat diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease in people with diabetes and high blood pressure). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n    *   Before taking candesartan, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to candesartan, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in candesartan tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n    *   Tell your doctor if you have diabetes (high blood sugar) and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take candesartan if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.\n    *   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking candesartan. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n    *   Do not use salt substitutes containing potassium without talking to your doctor. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What Should I Do if I Forget a Dose?**\n    *   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next regularly scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take your regular dose as directed.

Other risk factors for C auris infection include:\n\n* Living in a nursing home or making many visits to the hospital\n* Taking antibiotic or antifungal medicines often\n* Having many medical problems\n* Having had a recent surgery\n\n**What are the symptoms of Candida auris infection?**\n\nSymptoms of a C auris infection are similar to those caused by other fungal infections. People who have a C auris infection are often already very sick. Symptoms of infection are hard to tell apart from other symptoms.\n\nHigh fever with chills that does not get better after taking antibiotics may be a sign of a C auris infection. Tell your provider right away if you or a loved one has an infection that is not getting better, even after treatment.\n\n**How is Candida auris diagnosed?**\n\nA C auris infection can't be easily diagnosed using standard methods. If your provider thinks your illness is caused by C auris, they will need to use special lab tests.\n\nBlood tests include:\n\n* CBC with differential\n* Blood cultures\n* Basic metabolic panel\n* B-1,3 glucan test (testing for a specific sugar found on some fungi)\n\nYour provider also may suggest testing if they suspect you have been colonized with C auris, or if you have tested positive for C auris before.\n\n**How is Candida auris treated?**\n\nC auris infections are often treated with antifungal medicines called echinocandins. Other types of antifungal medicines also may be used.\n\nSome C auris infections do not respond to any of the main classes of antifungal medicines. In such cases, more than one antifungal medicine or higher doses of these medicines may be used.\n\n**What is the outlook for Candida auris infection?**\n\nInfections with C auris can be hard to treat because of its resistance to antifungal medicines. How well a person does will depend on:\n\n* How severe the infection is\n* Whether the infection has spread to the bloodstream and organs\n* The person's overall health\n\n---\n\n**Candida Auris Infection**\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nC auris infections that spread to the bloodstream and organs in very ill people can often lead to death.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have fever and chills that don't improve, even after antibiotic treatment\n* You have a fungal infection that doesn't improve, even after antifungal treatment\n* You develop fever and chills soon after coming in contact with a person who has a C auris infection\n\n**Prevention**\n\nFollow these steps to prevent the spread of C auris:\n\n* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), C. auris has been responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings worldwide, particularly in the United States, South Africa, and India.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Candida auris Infection**\n\nThe symptoms of C. auris infection can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the infection. According to a retrospective analysis published in Frontiers in Microbiology, common symptoms include fever, chills, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the bloodstream or organs.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment of Candida auris Infection**\n\nThe treatment of C. auris infection typically involves antifungal medications, such as fluconazole or amphotericin B. According to the CDC, the choice of medication depends on the severity and location of the infection. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention of Candida auris Infection**\n\nTo prevent C. auris infection, healthcare settings should implement strict infection control measures, such as proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces. Patients with C. auris infections should be isolated to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n* Forsberg K, Woodworth K, Walters M, et al.

    "content": "**Candida Infection of the Skin**\n\n_Cutaneous Candidiasis_\n\n_Causes_\n\nThe body normally hosts a variety of germs, including bacteria and fungi. Some of these are useful to the body, some produce no harm or benefit, and some can cause harmful infections.\n\nSome fungal infections are caused by fungi that often live on the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. They include yeast-like fungi such as candida. Sometimes, these yeast penetrate beneath the surface of the skin and cause an infection.\n\nIn cutaneous candidiasis, the skin is infected with candida fungi. This type of infection is fairly common. It can involve almost any area of skin on the body, but most often it occurs in warm, moist, creased areas such as the armpits and groin. The fungus that most often causes cutaneous candidiasis is Candida albicans.\n\n_Candida Infection: A Common Cause_\n\nCandida is the most common cause of diaper rash in infants. The fungi take advantage of the warm, moist conditions inside the diaper. Candida infection is also particularly common in people with diabetes and in those who are obese. Antibiotics, steroid therapy, and chemotherapy increase the risk of cutaneous candidiasis. Candida can also cause infections of the nails, edges of the nails, and corners of the mouth.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nCandida infection of the skin can cause intense itching.\n\nSymptoms also include:\n\n* Red, growing skin rash\n* Rash on the skin folds, genitals, middle of the body, buttocks, under the breasts, and other areas of skin\n* Infection of the hair follicles that may look like pimples\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Your provider may gently scrape off a sample of skin for testing.\n\nOlder children and adults with a yeast skin infection should be tested for diabetes. High blood sugar levels, seen in people with diabetes, act as food for the yeast fungus and help it grow.\n\n_Treatment_\n\nGood general health and hygiene are very important for treating candida infections of the skin. Keeping the skin dry and exposed to air is helpful. Drying (absorbent) powders may help prevent fungal infections.\n\nLosing weight may help eliminate the problem if you are overweight.\n\nGood blood sugar control may also be helpful to those with diabetes.\n\nAntifungal skin creams, ointments, or powders may be used to treat a yeast infection of the skin, mouth, or vagina. You may need to take antifungal medicine by mouth for severe candida infections in the mouth, throat, or vagina.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nCutaneous candidiasis often goes away with treatment, especially if the underlying cause is corrected. Repeat infections are common.\n\n_Possible Complications_\n\nThese complications may occur:\n\n* Infection of the nails may cause the nails to become oddly shaped and may cause an infection around the nail.\n* Candida skin infections may return.\n* Widespread candidiasis may occur in people with weakened immune systems.\n\n_When to Contact a Medical Professional_\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cutaneous candidiasis.\n\n---\n\n**Candida Infection of the Skin**\n\nCutaneous candidiasis is a yeast infection of the skin that can occur on almost any area of the body.

Keeping the skin dry and exposed to air can help prevent fungal infections. Drying (absorbent) powders may also be used to treat a yeast infection of the skin, mouth, or vagina.\n\nAntifungal skin creams, ointments, or powders may be prescribed to treat a candida infection of the skin. In severe cases, antifungal medicine may need to be taken orally.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCutaneous candidiasis often goes away with treatment, especially if the underlying cause is corrected. However, repeat infections are common.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications may occur:\n\n*   Infection of the nails\n*   Candida skin infections may return\n*   Widespread candidiasis may occur in people with weakened immune systems\n\n---\n\n**Candida Infection of the Skin**\n\n_Cutaneous candidiasis_ is a type of fungal infection that affects the skin. It's caused by the yeast-like fungus _Candida albicans_, which normally lives on the skin, in the mouth, and vagina.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   Not usually contagious, though in some settings people with weakened immune systems may catch the infection.\n*   When it occurs in the mouth or vagina, it's sometimes called mucocutaneous candidiasis.\n*   Candida is also the most frequent cause of vaginal yeast infections.

The fungus that causes this infection is called Candida.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of a Candida infection of the skin is not always clear, but it is thought to be related to an overgrowth of the fungus in the body. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n*   **Weakened immune system**: People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to fungal infections.\n*   **Antibiotic use**: Taking antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the body and lead to an overgrowth of Candida.\n*   **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause, can increase the risk of a Candida infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a Candida infection of the skin around the mouth may include:\n\n*   **Redness and itching**: The affected area may become red, itchy, and inflamed.\n*   **Blisters or rashes**: Small blisters or rashes may form on the skin.\n*   **Foul odor**: In some cases, a Candida infection of the skin around the mouth may cause a foul odor.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for a Candida infection of the skin around the mouth typically involves antifungal medications. These medications can be taken orally or applied topically to the affected area. In some cases, a healthcare provider may also recommend home remedies, such as applying a paste made from baking soda and water to the affected area.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent a Candida infection of the skin around the mouth, it is essential to maintain good hygiene practices, such as:\n\n*   **Washing hands frequently**: Washing your hands regularly can help prevent the spread of fungal infections.\n*   **Keeping the genital area clean**: Keeping the genital area clean and dry can help prevent fungal infections in this area.\n*   **Avoiding tight clothing**: Wearing loose-fitting clothing can help reduce the risk of a Candida infection.\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "content": "**Canker Sore**\n\nA canker sore is a painful, open sore in the mouth. Canker sores are white or yellow and surrounded by a bright red area. They are not cancerous.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCanker sores are a common form of mouth ulcer. They may occur with viral infections. In some cases, the cause is unknown.\n\nCanker sores may also be linked to problems with the body's immune system. The sores may also be brought on by:\n\n* Mouth injury from dental work\n* Cleaning the teeth too roughly\n* Biting the tongue or cheek\n\nOther things that can trigger canker sores include:\n\n* Emotional stress\n* Lack of certain vitamins and minerals in the diet (especially iron, folic acid, or vitamin B-12)\n* Hormonal changes\n* Food allergies\n\nAnyone can develop a canker sore. Women are more likely to get them than men. Canker sores may run in families.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCanker sores most often appear on the inner surface of the cheeks and lips, tongue, upper surface of the mouth, and the base of the gums.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* One or more painful, red spots or bumps that develops into an open ulcer\n* White or yellow center\n* Small size (most often under one third inch or 1 centimeter across)\n* Gray color as healing starts\n\nLess common symptoms include:\n\n* Fever\n* General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise)\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nPain often goes away in 7 to 10 days. It can take 1 to 3 weeks for a canker sore to completely heal. Large ulcers can take longer to heal.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider can often make the diagnosis by looking at the sore.\n\nIf canker sores persist or continue to return, tests should be done to look for other causes, such as erythema multiforme, drug allergies, herpes infection, and bullous lichen planus.\n\nYou may need further testing or a biopsy to look for other causes of mouth ulcers. Canker sores are not cancer and do not cause cancer. There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn most cases, the canker sores go away without treatment.\n\nTry not to eat hot or spicy foods, which can cause pain.\n\nUse over-the-counter medicines that ease pain in the area.\n\nRinse your mouth with salt water or mild, over-the-counter mouthwashes. (DO NOT use mouthwashes that contain alcohol which can irritate the area more.)\n\nApply a mixture of half hydrogen peroxide and half water directly to the sore using a cotton swab. Follow by dabbing a small amount of Milk of Magnesia on the canker sore afterward. Repeat these steps 3 to 4 times a day.\n\nRinse your mouth with a mixture of half Milk of Magnesia and half Benadryl liquid allergy medicine. Swish mixture in the mouth for about 1 minute and then spit out.\n\nOver the counter numbing mouth rinses or drops can provide short term pain relief.\n\nMedicines prescribed by your provider may be needed for severe cases. These may include:\n\n* Chlorhexidine mouthwash\n* Stronger medicines called corticosteroids that are placed on the sore or are taken in pill form\n\nBrush your teeth twice a day and floss your teeth every day. Also, get routine dental check-ups.\n\nIn some cases, gastric acid-reducing medicines can decrease the discomfort.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCanker sores almost always heal on their own. The pain should decrease in a few days. Other symptoms disappear in 10 to 14 days.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional:\n\n* A canker sore or mouth ulcer does not go away after 2 weeks of home care or gets worse.\n* You get canker sores more than 2 or 3 times a year.\n* You have symptoms with the canker sore such as fever, diarrhea, headache, or skin rash.\n\n---\n\n**Canker Sore: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCanker sores are a common form of mouth ulcer.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1439.html",
    "content": "**Cannabidiol (CBD)**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical in the Cannabis sativa plant, also known as cannabis or hemp. One specific form of CBD is approved as a drug in the U.S. for seizures.\n\nOver 80 chemicals, known as cannabinoids, have been found in the Cannabis sativa plant. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most famous ingredient in cannabis. But CBD is obtained from hemp, a form of the Cannabis sativa plant that only contains small amounts of THC. CBD seems to have effects on some chemicals in the brain, but these are different than the effects of THC.\n\nA prescription form of CBD is used for seizure disorder (epilepsy). CBD is also used for anxiety, pain, a muscle disorder called dystonia, Parkinson disease, Crohn disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nLaws passed in 2018 made it legal to sell hemp and hemp products in the US. But that doesn't mean that all CBD products made from hemp are legal. Since CBD is an approved prescription drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements. CBD can only be included in \"cosmetic\" products. But there are still CBD products on the market that are labeled as dietary supplements. The amount of CBD contained in these products is not always the same as what is stated on the label.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for CANNABIDIOL (CBD) are as follows:\n\nLikely effective for...\n\n* Seizure disorder (epilepsy). A specific prescription product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is approved by the US FDA to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other forms of CBD are helpful for seizure. For now, stick with the prescription product.\n\nThere is interest in using CBD for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these uses.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: CBD is possibly safe to take in appropriate doses. Doses of up to 200 mg daily have been used safely for up to 13 weeks. With the guidance of a healthcare provider, a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) has been used at higher doses and for longer durations.\n\nCBD can cause some side effects, such as dry mouth, low blood pressure, light headedness, and drowsiness. Signs of liver injury have also been reported with high doses of the prescription form of CBD, called Epidiolex.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: A specific cannabis extract spray that contains cannabidiol and THC (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is possibly safe when used for up to 2 years. This product is a prescription drug in the UK and Canada. It is an investigation drug in the US.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: It may be unsafe to take CBD if you are pregnant or breast feeding. CBD products can be contaminated with other ingredients that may be harmful to the fetus or infant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: It is possibly safe for children to take a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) by mouth in doses up to 25 mg/kg daily. This product is approved for use in children with certain conditions who are at least 1 year old. It isn't clear if other CBD products are safe in children.\n* A group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma): Some early research suggests that taking CBD might increase the pressure in the eye in some people with glaucoma.\n* Liver disease: People with liver disease may need to use lower doses of CBD.\n* Parkinson disease: Some early research suggests that taking high doses of CBD might make muscle movement and tremors worse in some people with Parkinson disease.\n\n---\n\n**Cannabidiol (CBD): MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Safety Information**\n\n*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**: It is unsafe to take CBD if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. CBD products can be contaminated with other ingredients that may be harmful to the fetus or infant.\n*   **Children**: A specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) is possibly safe for children to take by mouth in doses up to 25 mg/kg daily, but it's unclear if other CBD products are safe.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Glaucoma**: Some early research suggests that taking CBD might increase eye pressure in people with glaucoma.\n*   **Liver Disease**: People with liver disease may need to use lower doses of CBD.\n*   **Parkinson's Disease**: High doses of CBD might worsen muscle movement and tremors in some people with Parkinson's disease.\n\n**Medication Interactions**\n\n*   **Brivaracetam (Briviact)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down brivaracetam, increasing its levels.\n*   **Caffeine**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine, increasing its levels.\n*   **Carbamazepine (Tegretol)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down carbamazepine, increasing its levels and side effects.\n*   **Citalopram (Celexa)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down citalopram, increasing its levels and side effects.\n*   **Clobazam (Onfi)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down clobazam, increasing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Eslicarbazepine (Aptiom)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down eslicarbazepine, increasing its levels by a small amount.\n*   **Everolimus (Zostress)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down everolimus, increasing its levels.\n*   **Fluoxetine (Prozac)**: In some people, CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down fluoxetine, increasing its levels.\n*   **Lithium**: Higher doses of CBD might increase lithium levels, increasing the risk of toxicity.\n*   **Losartan (Cozaar)**: CBD might decrease how the liver breaks down losartan, increasing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Substrates**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Glucuronidated Drugs**: CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications, affecting their effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) Inhibitors**: Some drugs decrease how quickly the liver breaks down CBD, changing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Inhibitors**: Some drugs decrease how quickly the liver breaks down CBD, changing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Inducers**: Some drugs increase how quickly the liver breaks down CBD, changing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) Inducers**: Some drugs increase how quickly the liver breaks down CBD, changing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Methadone (Dolophine)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down methadone, increasing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Midazolam (Versed)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down midazolam, increasing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Omeprazole (Prilosec)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down omeprazole.\n\n---\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\nWhen taking cannabidiol (CBD), it's essential to be aware of potential interactions with medications. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n*   **Omeprazole (Prilosec)**: CBD may decrease how the liver breaks down omeprazole, increasing its effects and side effects.\n*   **Rufinamide (Banzel)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down rufinamide, leading to increased levels of the medication in the body.\n*   **Sedative medications (CNS depressants)**: CBD can cause sleepiness and slowed breathing, which may be exacerbated by sedative medications. This combination may lead to breathing problems or excessive drowsiness.\n*   **Sirolimus (Rapamune)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down sirolimus, increasing its levels in the body.\n*   **Stiripentol (Diacomit)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down stiripentol, leading to increased levels of the medication and potentially more side effects.\n*   **Tacrolimus (Prograf)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down tacrolimus, increasing its levels in the body.\n*   **Tamoxifen (Nolvadex)**: CBD may affect how quickly the body breaks down tamoxifen, which could impact its effectiveness or increase side effects.\n*   **Topiramate (Topamax)**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down topiramate, leading to increased levels of the medication in the body.\n*   **Valproate**: Taking CBD with valproic acid may increase the risk of liver injury. In some cases, CBD and/or valproic acid may need to be stopped or their doses reduced.\n*   **Warfarin**: CBD might increase levels of warfarin, which can increase the risk of bleeding. In some cases, CBD and/or warfarin may need to be stopped or their doses reduced.\n*   **Zonisamide**: CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down zonisamide, leading to increased levels of the medication in the body.\n\n**Other Interactions**\n\nIn addition to these specific interactions, it's essential to note that CBD may affect how the liver breaks down various medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.\n\nSome medications are changed and broken down by the liver, and CBD might change how quickly the liver breaks them down. This could impact the effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects associated with these medications.\n\nIf you're taking any medications and considering adding CBD to your regimen, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss potential interactions and ensure safe usage.\n\n---\n\n**Cannabidiol (CBD) Interactions**\n\n**Medications that decrease the breakdown of other medications by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) inhibitors)**\n\n* CBD is changed and broken down by the liver. Some drugs decrease how quickly the liver changes and breaks down CBD. This could change the effects and side effects of CBD.\n\n**Medications that decrease the breakdown of other medications in the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors)**\n\n* CBD is changed and broken down by the liver. Some drugs decrease how quickly the liver changes and breaks down CBD. This could change the effects and side effects of CBD.\n\n**Medications that increase breakdown of other medications by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers)**\n\n* CBD is changed and broken down by the liver. Some drugs increase how quickly the liver changes and breaks down CBD. This could change the effects and side effects of CBD.\n\n**Medications that increase the breakdown of other medications by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) inducers)**\n\n* CBD is changed and broken down by the liver. Some drugs increase how quickly the liver changes and breaks down CBD. This could change the effects and side effects of CBD.\n\n**Interactions with Specific Medications**\n\n* **Methadone (Dolophine)**: Methadone is broken down by the liver. CBD might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down methadone. Taking cannabidiol along with methadone might increase the effects and side effects of methadone.\n* **Midazolam (Versed)**: Midazolam is broken down by the liver. Cannabidiol (CBD) may decrease how the liver breaks down midazolam. Taking CBD along with midazolam may increase the effects and side effects of midazolam.\n* **Omeprazole (Prilosec)**: Omeprazole is broken down by the liver. Cannabidiol (CBD) may decrease how the liver breaks down omeprazole. Taking CBD along with omeprazole may increase the effects and side effects of omeprazole.\n\n**Interactions with Sedative Medications**\n\n* CBD might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking CBD with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n\n**Interactions with Other Medications**\n\n* **Sirolimus (Rapamune)**: Sirolimus is changed and broken down by the body. CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down sirolimus. This might increase levels of sirolimus in the body.\n* **Stiripentol (Diacomit)**: Stiripentol is changed and broken down by the body. CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down stiripentol. This might increase levels of stiripentol in the body and increase its side effects.\n* **Tacrolimus (Prograf)**: Tacrolimus is changed and broken down by the body. CBD might decrease how quickly the body breaks down tacrolimus. This might increase levels of tacrolimus in the body.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n* **Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)**: Using supplements that contain CBD may increase THC blood levels. This can increase the effects and side effects of THC.\n* **Herbs and supplements with sedative properties**: CBD might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\n* CBD can be taken with food or without food. But taking it with food can cause the body to absorb more CBD than when it is taken without food. This might increase the effects of CBD.\n* Fatty foods or drinks, such as whole milk, and alcohol can also make the body absorb more CBD.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n* CBD has most often been used by adults in doses of 200 mg or less per day. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n* For information on using prescription CBD, a product called Epidiolex, speak with a healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Cannabidiol (CBD): MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* ylbenzene-1,3-diol\n* CBD\n* Nano-cannabidiol\n* 2-[(1R,6R)-3-Methyl-6-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl]-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n* Afshar S, Khalili S, Amin G, Abbasinazari M.

Cannabidiol is in a class of medications called cannabinoids. It is not known exactly how cannabidiol works to prevent seizure activity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCannabidiol comes as a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice daily. You may take cannabidiol either with or without food, but be sure to take it the same way each time. Take cannabidiol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cannabidiol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nUse the oral syringe that came with the medication for measuring the solution. Do not use a household spoon to measure your dose.\n\nUse a dry oral syringe each time that you take the medication. The solution may turn cloudy if water enters the medication bottle or is inside the syringe, but this will not change the safety or how well the medication works.\n\nThe oral solution can be given through a feeding tube. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor how you should take the medication. Follow these directions carefully.\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of cannabidiol and gradually increase your dose, usually not more than once every week.\n\nCannabidiol helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. Continue to take cannabidiol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cannabidiol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking cannabidiol, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as new or worsening seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of cannabidiol and gradually increase your dose, usually not more than once every week.\n\nCannabidiol helps to control your condition, but does not cure it.

If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at one time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCannabidiol may cause the following side effects:\n\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\nThese side effects are usually mild and temporary. However, if you experience any severe or persistent side effects, talk to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore cannabidiol at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze the solution. Keep the oral syringe dry before each use. If water enters the medication bottle or is inside the syringe, the solution may turn cloudy, but this will not change the safety or how well the medication works.\n\nDispose of any unused cannabidiol solution responsibly.

    "content": "**Capillary Nail Refill Test**\n\nThe capillary nail refill test is a quick test done on the nail beds. It is used to monitor dehydration and the amount of blood flow to tissue.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nPressure is applied to the nail bed until it turns white. This indicates that the blood has been forced from the tissue under the nail. It is called blanching. Once the tissue has blanched, pressure is removed.\n\nWhile the person holds their hand above their heart, the health care provider measures the time it takes for blood to return to the tissue. Return of blood is indicated by the nail turning back to a pink color.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nRemove colored nail polish before this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere will be minor pressure to the bed of your nail. This should not cause discomfort.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nTissues need oxygen to survive. Oxygen is carried to various parts of the body by the blood (vascular) system.\n\nThis test measures how well the vascular system works in your hands and feet -- the parts of your body that are farthest from the heart.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIf there is good blood flow to the nail bed, a pink color should return in less than 2 seconds after pressure is removed.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nBlanch times that are greater than 2 seconds may indicate:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Hypothermia\n* Low blood pressure\n* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD)\n* Shock\n\n---\n\n**Capillary Nail Refill Test**\n\nIf there is good blood flow to the nail bed, a pink color should return in less than 2 seconds after pressure is removed.\n\n* **Normal Results**: If there is good blood flow to the nail bed, a pink color should return in less than 2 seconds after pressure is removed.\n* **What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\t+ Blanch times that are greater than 2 seconds may indicate:\n\t\t- Dehydration\n\t\t- Hypothermia\n\t\t- Low blood pressure\n\t\t- Peripheral vascular disease (PVD)\n\t\t- Shock\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Nail blanch test; Capillary refill time\n\n**Images**\n\n* [Image: Nail blanch test]\n\n**References**\n\n* McGrath JL, Bachmann DJ.

    "content": "**Capillary Sample**\n\nA capillary sample is a blood sample collected by pricking the skin. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done in the following way:\n\n*   The area is cleansed with antiseptic.\n*   The skin of the finger, heel, or another area is pricked with a sharp needle or a lancet.\n*   The blood may be collected in a pipette (small glass tube), on a slide, onto a test strip, or into a small container.\n*   Cotton or a bandage may be applied to the puncture site if there is any continued bleeding.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSome people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nBlood transports oxygen, food, waste products, and other materials within the body. It also helps regulate body temperature. Blood is made up of cells and a fluid called plasma. Plasma contains various dissolved substances. The cells are mainly red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nBecause blood has many functions, tests on the blood or its components provide valuable clues in the diagnosis of medical conditions.\n\nCapillary blood sampling has several advantages over drawing blood from a vein:\n\n*   It is easy to obtain (it can be difficult to obtain blood from the veins, especially in infants).\n*   There are several collection sites on the body, and these sites can be rotated.\n*   Testing can be done at home and with little training. For example, persons with diabetes must check their blood sugar several times a day using capillary blood sampling.\n\nDisadvantages to capillary blood sampling include:\n\n*   Only a limited amount of blood can be drawn using this method.\n*   The procedure has some risks (see below).\n*   Capillary blood sampling may result in inaccurate results, such as falsely elevated sugar, electrolyte, and blood count values.\n\n---\n\n**Capillary Sample**\n\n**What is a Capillary Sample?**\n\nA capillary sample, also known as a fingerstick or heelstick, is a small amount of blood taken from a person's finger or heel. It is a quick and relatively painless procedure that can be done at home or in a medical setting.\n\n**How is the Test Done?**\n\nTo take a capillary sample, a healthcare provider will typically use a specialized device to prick the skin on the finger or heel, allowing a small amount of blood to flow onto a test strip or into a small container. A cotton ball or bandage may be applied to the puncture site if there is any continued bleeding.\n\n**How Will I Feel During the Test?**\n\nSome people may feel moderate pain during the test, while others may only experience a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing at the puncture site.\n\n**Why is the Capillary Sample Performed?**\n\nBlood has many important functions in the body, including transporting oxygen, food, waste products, and other materials. It also helps regulate body temperature. Tests on blood or its components can provide valuable clues in the diagnosis of medical conditions.\n\n**Advantages of Capillary Sampling**\n\nCapillary sampling has several advantages over drawing blood from a vein:\n\n*   It is easy to obtain\n*   There are several collection sites on the body, and these sites can be rotated\n*   Testing can be done at home and with little training\n\n**Disadvantages of Capillary Sampling**\n\nSome disadvantages of capillary sampling include:\n\n*   Only a limited amount of blood can be drawn using this method\n*   The procedure has some risks (see below)\n*   Capillary blood sampling may result in inaccurate results, such as falsely elevated sugar, electrolyte, and blood count values\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nRisks of this test may include any of the following:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n*   Scarring (occurs when there have been multiple punctures in the same area)\n*   Calcified nodules (sometimes occurs in infants, but usually disappear by 30 months of age)\n*   Damage to blood cells from this method of collection can sometimes cause inaccurate test results and the need to repeat the test with blood drawn from a vein\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBlood sample - capillary; Fingerstick; Heelstick\n\n---\n\n**Capillary Sample**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is a capillary sample?**\n    A capillary sample, also known as a heel prick or fingerstick, is a small blood sample taken from a newborn's heel or finger. It is used to screen for certain genetic disorders and other conditions.\n\n*   **How is a capillary sample collected?**\n    The collection of a capillary sample involves pricking the baby's heel or finger with a special device to obtain a few drops of blood. The blood is then placed on a special card or in a tube for testing.\n\n*   **What is tested in a capillary sample?**\n    A capillary sample may be used to test for various conditions, including:\n    *   Phenylketonuria (PKU): a genetic disorder that affects the way the body processes protein\n    *   Hypothyroidism: a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones\n    *   Other blood disorders\n\n*   **Why is a capillary sample important?**\n    A capillary sample is an essential tool for detecting genetic disorders and other conditions in newborns. Early detection allows for prompt treatment and can prevent long-term health problems.\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Capsaicin Topical**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nTopical capsaicin is used to relieve minor pain in muscles and joints caused by arthritis, backaches, muscle strains, bruises, cramps, and sprains. Capsaicin is a substance that is found in chili peppers. It works by affecting nerve cells in the skin that are associated with pain, which results in decreased activity of these nerve cells and a reduced sense of pain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCapsaicin comes as an ointment, cream, gel, oil, and a topical solution in various strengths to apply to the skin. Topical capsaicin is usually used as needed as stated on the product label or as directed by your doctor. Follow the directions on the package instructions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nTo use topical capsaicin, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, oil, or topical solution to cover the affected area of skin with a thin layer and rub it in gently. Avoid applying topical capsaicin into folds of skin.\n\nDo not apply topical capsaicin to skin that is broken, damaged, cut, infected, or covered by a rash. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area.\n\nThis medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let topical capsaicin get into your eyes, nose, or mouth and do not swallow it.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water to remove any medicine that may have gotten on them.

    "content": "**Capsaicin Transdermal Patch**\n\n*pronounced as (kap say' i sin)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nNonprescription (over-the-counter) capsaicin patches are used to relieve minor pain in muscles and joints caused by arthritis, backaches, muscle strains, bruises, cramps, and sprains. Prescription capsaicin patches are used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; the burning, stabbing pain or aches that may last for months or years after an attack of shingles). Prescription capsaicin patches are also used to relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy (numbness or tingling due to nerve damage in people who have diabetes).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nPrescription transdermal capsaicin comes as an 8% patch (Qutenza) to be applied to the skin by a doctor or nurse at a doctor's office. Your doctor will choose the best place to apply the patch(es) in order to treat your condition and will mark the area where the patch should be placed.\n\n* If transdermal capsaicin is used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, up to 4 patches are usually applied for 60 minutes once every 3 months.\n* If transdermal capsaicin is used to relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy, up to 4 patches are usually applied for 30 minutes once every 3 months.\n\nYour doctor may apply a topical medicine before applying the capsaicin patch to help prevent pain and burning from the patch. If pain still occurs after applying the patch, your doctor or nurse may apply cool compress or give you pain medicine by mouth to help.\n\nNonprescription (over the counter) transdermal capsaicin comes as a 0.025% patch (Aspercreme Warming, Salonpas Pain Relieving Hot, others) to apply up to 3 or 4 times daily and for no more than 8 hours per application.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/945.html",
    "content": "**Capsicum**\n\n**What is it?**\nCapsicum, also known as red pepper or chili pepper, is an herb. Its fruit is commonly applied to the skin for arthritis pain and other conditions.\n\nThe fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays.\n\nCapsicum is commonly used for nerve pain and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for CAPSICUM are as follows:\n\n* Likely effective for:\n\t+ Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)\n\t+ Chronic pain\n\t+ Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Back pain\n\t+ Cluster headache\n\t+ Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (nonallergic rhinitis)\n\t+ Osteoarthritis\n\t+ Acute pain\n\t+ Nausea and vomiting after surgery\n\t+ Pain after surgery\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Capsicum is likely safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects can include stomach irritation, sweating, and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nCapsicum may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, and decrease their effectiveness. It's best to consult a healthcare professional before using capsicum if you're taking any medications.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere is limited information on interactions between capsicum and other herbs and supplements. However, it's possible that capsicum may interact with certain herbs and supplements, such as blood thinners, and decrease their effectiveness. Consult a healthcare professional before using capsicum if you're taking any herbs or supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nCapsicum may interact with certain foods, such as dairy products, and decrease the absorption of nutrients. It's best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on using capsicum with food.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nCapsicum is commonly applied topically to the skin in the form of creams, lotions, or patches. It can also be consumed orally in food or as a supplement. The typical dosage and application method may vary depending on the specific use and individual needs.\n\n---\n\n**Capsicum: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special Precautions & Warnings**\n\n*   **Pregnancy**: Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the second trimester and during the third trimester.\n*   **Breast-feeding**: If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is likely safe. But it is possibly unsafe for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems (dermatitis) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers.\n*   **Children**: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe for children to use capsicum by mouth as a medicine. Stay on the safe side and stick with the amounts found in foods.\n*   **Bleeding disorders**: While conflicting results exist, capsicum might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.\n*   **Damaged skin**: Don't use capsicum on damaged or broken skin.\n*   **High blood pressure**: Taking capsicum or eating a large amount of chili peppers might cause a spike in blood pressure. In theory, this might worsen the condition for people who already have high blood pressure.\n*   **Surgery**: Capsicum might increase bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using capsicum at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Interactions With Medications?**\n\n*   **Moderate**\n    *   **Aspirin**: Capsicum might decrease how much aspirin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with aspirin might reduce the effects of aspirin.\n    *   **Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)**: Capsicum might increase how much ciprofloxacin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with ciprofloxacin might increase the effects and side effects of ciprofloxacin.\n    *   **Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)**: Capsicum might lower blood sugar levels. Taking capsicum along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n    *   **Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)**: Capsicum might slow blood clotting. Taking capsicum along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n    *   **Theophylline**: Capsicum can increase how much theophylline the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with theophylline might increase the effects and side effects of theophylline.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are There Interactions With Herbs And Supplements?**\n\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar**\n    *   Capsicum might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting**\n    *   Capsicum might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n*   **Iron**\n    *   There is some concern that using capsicum might reduce how much iron the body can absorb.\n\n---\n\n**Capsicum: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Drug & Supplements**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n* Slow blood clotting\n\t+ Capsicum might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding.\n\t+ Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people.\n\t+ Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n\n**Interactions**\n\n* Iron\n\t+ There is some concern that using capsicum might reduce how much iron the body can absorb.\n\n**Usage**\n\n* In adults, capsicum has been taken by mouth as extracts, chili, fermented red pepper, red pepper powder, lozenges, nectar, and capsaicin.\n* In both adults and children, capsicum has been applied to the skin in creams, plasters, and gels.\n* It's also used in nasal sprays and solutions.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* African Bird Pepper\n* African Chillies\n* African Pepper\n* Aji\n* Bird Pepper\n* Capsaicin\n* Capsaïcine\n* Capsicum annuum\n* Capsicum baccatum\n* Capsicum chinense\n* Capsicum Fruit\n* Capsicum frutescens\n* Capsicum minimum\n* Capsicum Oleoresin\n* Capsicum pubescens\n* Cayenne\n* Cayenne Fruit\n* Cayenne Pepper\n* Chili\n* Chili Pepper\n* Chilli\n* Chillies\n* Cis-capsaicin\n* Civamide\n* Garden Pepper\n* Goat's Pod\n* Grains of Paradise\n* Green Chili Pepper\n* Green Pepper\n* Hot Pepper\n* Hungarian Pepper\n* Ici Fructus\n* Katuvira\n* Lal Mirchi\n* Louisiana Long Pepper\n* Louisiana Sport Pepper\n* Mexican Chilies\n* Mirchi\n* Oleoresin capsicum\n* Paprika\n* Paprika de Hongrie\n* Pili-pili\n* Piment de Cayenne\n* Piment Enragé\n* Piment Fort\n* Piment-oiseau\n* Pimento\n* Poivre de Cayenne\n* Poivre de Zanzibar\n* Poivre Rouge\n* Red Pepper\n* Sweet Pepper\n* Tabasco Pepper\n* Trans-capsaicin\n* Zanzibar Pepper\n* Zucapsaicin\n* Zucapsaïcine\n\n**References**\n\n* Schäfer RC, Sohn A, Kersten A, Amr A, Held M, Wenger A.

This capsule includes one or two tiny cameras, a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter.\n\nIt is about the size of a large vitamin pill. The person swallows the capsule, and it takes pictures all the way through the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test can be started in the provider's office.\n\nThe capsule is the size of a large vitamin pill, about an inch (2.5 centimeters) long and less than ½ inch (1.3 centimeters) wide. Each capsule is used only once.\n\nThe provider may ask you to lie down or sit up while swallowing the capsule. A capsule endoscope has a slippery coating, so it is easier to swallow.\n\nThe capsule is not digested or absorbed. It travels through the digestive system following the same path food travels. It leaves the body in a bowel movement and can be flushed down the toilet without harming the plumbing.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions. If you do not follow instructions carefully, the test may have to be done a different day.\n\nYour provider may ask you to:\n\n* Take medicine to clear your bowels before this test\n* Have only clear liquids for 24 hours before this test\n* Have nothing to eat or drink, including water, for about 12 hours before you swallow the capsule\n\nDO NOT smoke for 24 hours before this test.\n\nBe sure to tell your provider:\n\n* About all the medicines you take, including prescription medicine, over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, vitamins, minerals, supplements, and herbs. You may be asked to not take some medicines during this test, because they could interfere with the camera.\n* If you are allergic to any medicine.\n* If you have ever had any blockages of the bowel.\n* About any medical conditions, such as problems swallowing or heart or lung disease.\n* If you have a pacemaker, defibrillator, or other implanted device.\n* If you have had abdominal surgery or any problems with your bowel.\n\nOn the day of the test, go to the provider's office wearing loose fitting, two-piece clothing.\n\nWhile the capsule is in your body you should not have an MRI.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCapsule endoscopy is a way for the doctor to see inside your digestive system.\n\nThere are many problems it can look for, including:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Ulcers\n* Polyps\n* Tumors or cancer\n* Inflammatory bowel disease\n* Crohn disease\n* Celiac disease\n\n---\n\n**Capsule Endoscopy**\n\n**What is Capsule Endoscopy?**\n\nEndoscopy is a way of looking inside the body.

Sometimes a few antenna patches may also be put on your body. During the test, the small light on a recorder will blink. If it stops blinking, call your provider.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions. If you do not follow instructions carefully, the test may have to be done a different day.\n\nYour provider may ask you to:\n\n* Take medicine to clear your bowels before this test\n* Have only clear liquids for 24 hours before this test\n* Have nothing to eat or drink, including water, for about 12 hours before you swallow the capsule\n\nDO NOT smoke for 24 hours before this test.\n\nBe sure to tell your provider:\n\n* About all the medicines you take, including prescription medicine, over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, vitamins, minerals, supplements, and herbs.

Most people consider this test comfortable.\n\nWhile the capsule is in your body you can do most normal activities, but not heavy lifting or strenuous exercise. If you plan to work on the day of the test, tell your provider how active you will be on the job.\n\nYour provider will tell you when you can eat and drink again.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCapsule endoscopy is a way for the doctor to see inside your digestive system.\n\nThere are many problems it can look for, including:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Ulcers\n* Polyps\n* Tumors or cancer\n* Inflammatory bowel disease\n* Crohn disease\n* Celiac disease\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe camera takes thousands of color photos of your digestive tract during this test. These pictures are downloaded to a computer and software turns them into a video. Your provider watches the video to look for problems. It may take up to a week for you to learn the results. If no problems are found, your results are normal.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nYour provider will tell you if they find a problem with your digestive tract, what it means, and how it can be treated.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are very few problems that can occur with capsule endoscopy. Call your provider right away if, after swallowing the capsule, you:\n\n* Have a fever\n* Have trouble swallowing\n* Throw up\n* Have chest pain, cramping, or abdominal pain\n\nIf your intestines are blocked or narrow, the capsule can get stuck.

The capsule has a tiny camera and light inside. As it travels through your digestive system, it takes thousands of color photos of your intestines. These pictures are downloaded to a computer and software turns them into a video. Your doctor watches the video to look for problems.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, you will be told what to expect and how to prepare. You may need to:\n\n* Take medicine to clear your bowels\n* Have only clear liquids for 24 hours before the test\n* Have nothing to eat or drink, including water, for about 12 hours before swallowing the capsule\n* Not smoke for 24 hours before the test\n\nYou should also tell your doctor about any medicines you take, including prescription medicine, over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, vitamins, minerals, supplements, and herbs. You may be asked to not take some medicines during this test, because they could interfere with the camera.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe capsule may be in your body for several hours or several days. Everyone is different. Most of the time, the capsule leaves the body within 24 hours. If you do not see the capsule in the toilet within two weeks of swallowing it, tell your doctor. You may need an x-ray to see if the capsule is still in your body.\n\nYou will be told what to expect before the test is started. Most people consider this test comfortable.

The capsule is swallowed like a pill and then moves through the digestive system, taking pictures along the way.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe capsule contains a tiny camera and a light source. As it moves through the digestive system, it takes pictures of the inside of the digestive tract and sends them to a receiver worn on the waist or attached to clothing. The pictures are then displayed on a computer screen for the doctor to view.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are very few problems that can occur with capsule endoscopy. Call your provider right away if, after swallowing the capsule, you:\n\n* Have a fever\n* Have trouble swallowing\n* Throw up\n* Have chest pain, cramping, or abdominal pain\n\nIf your intestines are blocked or narrow, the capsule can get stuck.

    "content": "**Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide**\n\n*pronounced as (kap' toe pril) (hye droe klor oh thye' a zide)*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Captopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day on an empty stomach, 1 hour before meals. To help you remember to take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 6 to 8 weeks.\n\nCaptopril and hydrochlorothiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to captopril (Capoten); hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; Microzide, Oretic); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin, in Lotrel), enalapril (Vasotec, in Vaseretic), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (in Prinzide, in Zestoretic), moexipril (Univasc, in Uniretic), perindopril (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril, in Accuretic, in Quinaretic), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik, in Tarka); sulfa drugs; any other medications; or any of the ingredients in captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Also, tell your doctor if you have diabetes and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, in Tekamlo, in Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking while taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide: aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); potassium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Do not start any of these medications while taking captopril and hydrochorothiazide without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had lupus; scleroderma (a condition in which extra tissue grows on the skin and some organs); heart failure; diabetes; allergy; asthma; or liver or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

    "content": "**Caput Succedaneum**\n\n_Causes_\n\nA caput succedaneum is more likely to form during a long or hard delivery. It is more common after the membranes have broken. This is because the fluid in the amniotic sac is no longer providing a cushion for the baby's head. Vacuum extraction done during a difficult birth can also increase the chances of a caput succedaneum.\n\nA caput succedaneum may be detected by prenatal ultrasound, even before labor or delivery begins. It has been found as early as 31 weeks of pregnancy. Very often, this is due to an early rupture of the membranes or too little amniotic fluid. It is less likely that a caput will form if the membranes stay intact.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Soft, puffy swelling on the scalp of a newborn infant\n* Possible bruising or color change on the scalp swelling area\n* Swelling that may extend to both sides of the scalp\n* Swelling that is most often seen on the portion of the head which presented first\n\n---\n\n**Caput Succedaneum**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCaput succedaneum is a soft, puffy swelling on the scalp of a newborn infant. It occurs when the baby's skull bones are compressed during delivery, causing fluid to accumulate in the scalp.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Soft, puffy swelling on the scalp\n* Possible bruising or color change on the scalp swelling area\n* Swelling that may extend to both sides of the scalp\n* Swelling that is most often seen on the portion of the head which presented first\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will look at the swelling to confirm that it is a caput succedaneum. No other testing is needed.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nNo treatment is needed. The problem most often goes away on its own within a few days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nComplete recovery can be expected. The scalp will go back to a normal shape.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include a yellow color to the skin (jaundice) if bruising is involved.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nMost of the time, the problem is noticed right after birth. You do not need to contact your provider unless you have other questions.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCaput\n\n**References**\n\nBalest AL, Riley MM, O'Donell B, Zarit JS. Neonatology.

    "content": "**Carbamazepine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Carbamazepine?**\n\nCarbamazepine, pronounced as (kar ba maz' e peen), is a medication used to treat epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCarbamazepine is prescribed for the treatment of certain types of seizures and epilepsy. It is also used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, a condition that causes pain in the face.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nIn addition to treating epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia, carbamazepine may be used off-label for other conditions such as bipolar disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCarbamazepine may cause life-threatening allergic reactions called Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These allergic reactions may cause severe damage to the skin and internal organs. The risk of SJS or TEN is highest in people of Asian ancestry who have a genetic (inherited) risk factor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no specific dietary instructions for carbamazepine, but it's essential to inform your doctor about any food allergies or sensitivities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of carbamazepine, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's close to the time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of carbamazepine include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and changes in appetite. Rare but serious side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which may cause severe damage to the skin and internal organs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nCarbamazepine tablets should be stored in a tightly closed container at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Dispose of any unused or expired medication properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of overdose, such as difficulty breathing, seizures, or loss of consciousness, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical attention.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCarbamazepine may interact with other medications, including blood thinners, and may decrease the number of blood cells produced by your body. Inform your doctor about any medications you're taking, especially if you have a history of bone marrow depression or other blood disorders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nCarbamazepine is available under several brand names, including Tegretol, Carbatrol, and Epitol.\n\n---\n\n**Carbamazepine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\n* Carbamazepine is used alone or in combination with other medications to control certain types of seizures in people with epilepsy.\n* It is also used to treat trigeminal neuralgia (a condition that causes facial nerve pain).\n* Carbamazepine extended-release capsules (Equetro brand only) are also used to treat episodes of mania (frenzied, abnormally excited or irritated mood) or mixed episodes (symptoms of mania and depression that happen at the same time) in patients with bipolar I disorder (manic-depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\n* Carbamazepine comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, an extended-release capsule, and as a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.\n* The regular tablet, chewable tablet, and suspension are usually taken two to four times a day with meals.\n* The extended-release tablet (Tegretol XR) is usually taken twice a day with meals.\n* The extended-release capsule (Carbatrol, Equetro) is usually taken twice a day with or without meals.\n* To help you remember to take carbamazepine, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take carbamazepine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Important Administration Instructions**\n\n* Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n* The extended-release capsules may be opened and the beads inside sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or similar food. Do not crush or chew the extended-release capsules or the beads inside them.\n* Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\n**Starting Dose and Dosage Adjustment**\n\n* Your doctor will start you on a low dose of carbamazepine and gradually increase your dose.\n\n---\n\n**Carbamazepine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/6)**\n\n**How to Take Carbamazepine**\n\nTake carbamazepine exactly as directed by your doctor.\n\n*   The regular tablet, chewable tablet, and suspension are usually taken two to four times a day with meals.\n*   The extended-release tablet (Tegretol XR) is usually taken twice a day with meals.\n*   The extended-release capsule (Carbatrol, Equetro) is usually taken twice a day with or without meals.\n\n**Important Instructions**\n\n*   Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n*   The extended-release capsules may be opened and the beads inside sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or similar food. Do not crush or chew the extended-release capsules or the beads inside them.\n*   Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\n**Starting Your Treatment**\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of carbamazepine and gradually increase your dose.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nCarbamazepine may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of carbamazepine. Continue to take carbamazepine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking carbamazepine without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you have a seizure disorder and you suddenly stop taking carbamazepine, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Carbamazepine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/6)**\n\n\\n\\n**Before Taking Carbamazepine**\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to carbamazepine, amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Silenor, Zonalon), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), oxcarbazepine (Trileptal, Oxtellar XR), protriptyline, other medications for seizures such as phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), or primidone (Mysoline), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in carbamazepine preparations.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with carbamazepine.

    "content": "**Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders**\n\nMetabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.\n\n**What are Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders?**\n\nCarbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems, some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.\n\n**Are These Disorders Inherited?**\n\nThese disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.\n\n**What Are Some Examples of Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders?**\n\n* Diabetes\n* Galactosemia\n* Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1 (von Gierke)\n* Hurler Syndrome\n* MPS Diseases\n* Mucopolysaccharidoses\n\n**How Are These Disorders Treated?**\n\nTreatments may include special diets, supplements, and medicines.

Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.\n\nYour body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the different types of carbohydrates?**\n\nThere are three main types of carbohydrates:\n\n* Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form.\n* Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together.\n* Fiber. It is also a complex carbohydrate.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Which foods have carbohydrates?**\n\nCommon foods with carbohydrates include:\n\n* Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice\n* Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges\n* Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt\n* Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas\n* Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts\n* Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar\n* Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas\n\nSome foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Which types of carbohydrates should I eat?**\n\nYou do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health:\n\n* When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains.\n* Eat foods with lots of fiber.\n* Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How many carbohydrates should I eat?**\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet?**\n\nSome people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day.\n\n---\n\n**Carbohydrates**\n\nThis article is part of the MedlinePlus series on nutrition and healthy eating.\n\n**What are carbohydrates?**\n\nCarbohydrates, or carbs, are one of the main types of nutrients found in food. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbs are an important source of energy for the body.\n\n**Types of carbohydrates**\n\nThere are two main types of carbohydrates: simple and complex.\n\n*   **Simple carbohydrates**, also known as sugars, are quickly digested by the body and provide a rapid source of energy.\n*   **Complex carbohydrates**, such as starches and fibers, take longer to digest and provide sustained energy.\n\n**Food sources of carbohydrates**\n\nCarbohydrates can be found in a variety of foods, including:\n\n*   Grains: bread, pasta, rice\n*   Fruits: apples, bananas, berries\n*   Vegetables: broccoli, carrots, potatoes\n*   Legumes: beans, lentils, peas\n\n**Importance of carbohydrates**\n\nCarbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. They provide energy for the body and help to maintain proper hydration levels.\n\n**Limitations of low-carb diets**\n\nWhile low-carb diets may be effective for short-term weight loss, they can have negative consequences in the long term. These include:\n\n*   Limited fiber intake\n*   Potential negative impact on gut health\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCarbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet. They provide energy and help to maintain proper hydration levels. While low-carb diets may be effective for short-term weight loss, they can have negative consequences in the long term. It is important to find a balance between carbohydrate intake and overall nutrition.",

    "content": "**Carbohydrates**\n\n\\n\\nCarbohydrates are one of the main nutrients in our diet. They help provide energy for our body. There are three main types of carbohydrates found in foods: sugars, starches, and fiber.\n\n\\n\\n**People with Diabetes**\n\nPeople with diabetes often need to count the amount of carbohydrates they eat to ensure a consistent supply throughout the day as well as to help choose mealtime doses of insulin.\n\n\\n\\n**Function**\n\nYour body needs all three forms of carbohydrates to function properly.\n\nSugars and most starches are broken down by the body into glucose, which then circulates in the blood to be used as energy.\n\nFiber is the part of food that is not broken down by the body. There are two types of fiber. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stools so you stay regular. Soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol levels and can help improve blood glucose control. Both types of fiber can help you to feel full and stay at a healthy weight.\n\n\\n\\n**Food Sources**\n\nMany foods contain one or more types of carbohydrates.\n\n\\n\\n* **Sugars**\nSugars, or simple carbohydrates, occur naturally in these nutrient-rich foods:\n\t+ Fruits\n\t+ Milk and milk products\n\nSome foods have added sugar. Many packaged and refined foods contain added sugar. These include:\n\n\t+ Candy\n\t+ Cookies, cakes, and pastries\n\t+ Regular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda\n\t+ Heavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit\n\nRefined grains with added sugar provide calories, but they lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Because they lack nutrients, these foods provide \"empty calories\" and can lead to weight gain. Try to minimize your intake of foods with added sugars.\n\n\\n\\n* **Starches**\nStarches are also called complex carbohydrates. These nutrient-rich foods are high in starch (many are also high in fiber):\n\n\t+ Canned and dried beans, such as kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, split peas, and garbanzo beans\n\t+ Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, green peas, and parsnips\n\t+ Whole grains, such as brown rice, oats, barley, and quinoa\n\nRefined grains, such as those found in pastries, white bread, crackers, and white rice also contain starch. However, they lack B vitamins and other important nutrients unless they are marked \"enriched.\" Foods made with refined or \"white\" flour also contain less fiber and protein than whole-grain products and do not help you feel as satisfied.\n\n\\n\\n* **Fiber**\nHigh-fiber foods include:\n\n\t+ Whole grains, such as whole wheat and brown rice as well as whole-grain breads, cereals, and crackers\n\t+ Beans and legumes, such as black beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans\n\t+ Vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, corn, and potato with the skin\n\t+ Fruits, such as raspberries, pears, apples, and figs\n\t+ Nuts and seeds\n\nMost processed and refined foods, enriched or not, are low in fiber.\n\n\\n\\n**Side Effects**\n\nEating too many carbohydrates in the form of processed, starchy, or sugary foods can increase your total calorie intake, which can lead to weight gain. It can also lead you to not consume enough fat and protein.\n\nSeverely restricting carbohydrates can cause ketosis. This is when the body uses fat for energy because there are not enough carbohydrates from food for the body to use for energy.\n\n\\n\\n**Recommendations**\n\nIt is best to get most of your carbohydrates from whole grains, dairy, fruits, and vegetables rather than refined grains. In addition to calories, whole grain foods provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\nBy making smart food choices, you can get the full range of healthy carbohydrates and plenty of nutrients:\n\n* Choose a variety of foods including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products.\n* Read labels on canned, packaged, and frozen foods to avoid added sugar, salt, and fat.\n* Make at least half of your grain servings per day from whole grains.\n* Choose whole fruits and 100% fruit juices with no added sugar. Make at least half of your daily fruit servings from whole fruits.\n* Limit sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and alcohol. Limit added sugars to less than 10 percent of your calories per day.\n\n\\n\\n**Food Guide Plate**\n\nHere is what is considered \"1 serving\" of carbohydrate-rich foods according to the USDA (www.myplate.gov):\n\n* Starchy vegetables: 1 cup (230 grams) mashed potato or sweet potato, 1 small ear of corn.\n* Fruits: 1 medium-sized fruit (such as an apple or orange), ½ cup dried fruit (95 grams) 1 cup 100% fruit juice (240 milliliters), 1 cup berries (or about 8 large strawberries).\n* Breads and cereals, grains, and beans: 1 slice of whole-grain bread; 1/2 cup (100 grams) of cooked brown rice, pasta, or cereal; 1/4 cup cooked peas, lentils, or beans (50 grams), 3 cups popped popcorn (30 grams).\n* Dairy: 1 cup (240 milliliters) of skim or low-fat milk or 8 ounces (225 grams) plain yogurt.\n\nThe food guide plate recommends filling half of your plate with fruits and vegetables, and one-quarter of your plate with grains, at least half of which are whole grains.\n\n\\n\\n**Sample Menu**\n\nHere is a sample 2,000-calorie menu with healthy carbohydrate choices:\n\n* BREAKFAST\n\t+ 1 cup (60 grams) shredded wheat cereal, topped with 1 tbsp (10 grams) raisins and one cup (240 milliliters) fat-free milk\n\t+ 1 small banana\n\t+ 1 hard-boiled egg\n* LUNCH\n\t+ Smoked turkey sandwich, made with 2 ounces (55 grams) whole-wheat pita bread, 1/4 cup (12 grams) romaine lettuce, 2 tomato slices, 3 ounces (85 grams) sliced smoked turkey breast.\n\t+ 1 teaspoon (tsp) or 5 milliliters (mL) mayonnaise-type salad dressing\n\t+ 1 tsp (2 grams) yellow mustard\n\t+ 1 medium pear\n\t+ 1 cup (240 milliliters) tomato juice\n* DINNER\n\t+ 5 ounces (140 grams) grilled top loin steak\n\t+ 3/4 cup (190 grams) mashed sweet potato\n\t+ 2 tsp (10 grams) soft margarine\n\t+ 1 cup (30 grams) spinach salad\n\t+ 2 ounce (55 grams) whole-wheat dinner roll\n\t+ 1 tsp (5 grams) soft margarine\n\t+ 1 cup (240 milliliters) fat-free milk\n\t+ 1 cup (240 milliliters) unsweetened applesauce\n* SNACK\n\t+ 1 cup (225 grams) low-fat plain yogurt with strawberries on top\n\n---\n\n**Carbohydrates**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Carbohydrates?**\n\nCarbohydrates are one of the main nutrients in our diet.

    "content": "**Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in Blood**\n\nA carbon dioxide (CO2) blood test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is a waste product from metabolism, the process your body uses to make energy from food you eat.\n\nMost of the carbon dioxide in your body is in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3), which is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluid and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body.\n\nYour blood carries carbon dioxide to your lungs, and then you breathe it out. Too much or too little carbon dioxide in your blood can be a sign of a health problem.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA CO2 blood test is often part of a group of tests called an electrolyte panel, which may be part of a routine checkup. The test may also help diagnose or monitor conditions related to an electrolyte imbalance. These may include high blood pressure and diseases of the kidneys, lungs, or liver.\n\n**Why do I need a CO2 in blood test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order a CO2 blood test as part of your routine checkup or if you have symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance. These symptoms may include:\n\n* Trouble breathing\n* Confusion\n* Weakness\n* Fatigue\n* Vomiting and/or diarrhea over a long period\n\nYour provider may also order a CO2 blood test to check for side effects of certain medicines that can cause electrolyte imbalances.\n\n**What happens during a CO2 blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nSome prescription and over-the-counter medicines can increase or decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. You may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAbnormal test results may be a sign that your body is having a hard time keeping the right acid-base balance (pH balance). This may be because your lungs or kidneys are having a problem removing carbon dioxide or because you have an electrolyte imbalance. Many different types of conditions can cause these problems.\n\nToo much CO2 in the blood (called hypercapnia or hypercarbia) can be a sign of many conditions, including:\n\n* Lung diseases\n* Cushing's syndrome\n* Kidney failure\n* Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough. You may lose acid from conditions such as vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia.\n\nToo little CO2 in the blood (hypocarbia) may be a sign of:\n\n* Addison disease\n* Diabetic ketoacidosis, a complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes\n* Shock\n* Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which your blood is too acidic. It can have many causes, including kidney or liver disease or long-lasting diarrhea.\n* Respiratory alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough because of a lung or breathing problem, including hyperventilation (rapid, deep breathing).\n\nIf your test results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your provider may order other tests to confirm a diagnosis. Other factors, including certain medicines, can affect the level of CO2 in your blood. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about a CO2 blood test?\n\nA CO2 blood test may also be completed as part of a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel. These tests measure different substances in your blood to learn about your body's chemical balance and metabolism.\n\n---\n\n**Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in Blood: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Part 2/3**\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nSome prescription and over-the-counter medicines can increase or decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood.

    "content": "**Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**\n\n Carbon monoxide is an odorless gas that causes thousands of deaths each year in North America. Breathing in carbon monoxide is very dangerous. It is the leading cause of poisoning death in the United States.\n\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nCarbon monoxide is a chemical produced from the incomplete burning of natural gas or other products containing carbon. This includes motor vehicle exhaust, faulty heaters, fires, and factory emissions.\n\n**Where Found**\n\nThe following items may produce carbon monoxide:\n\n* Anything that burns coal, gasoline, kerosene, oil, propane, or wood\n* Automobile engines\n* Charcoal grills (charcoal should never be burned indoors)\n* Indoor and portable heating systems\n* Portable propane heaters\n* Stoves (indoor and camp stoves)\n* Water heaters that use natural gas\n\nNote: This list may not be all-inclusive.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poison replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream. Your heart, brain, and body then become starved of oxygen.\n\nSymptoms vary from person to person. Those at high risk for more severe bodily damage include young children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease, people who are at high altitudes, and smokers. Carbon monoxide can harm a fetus (unborn baby still in the womb).\n\nSymptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include:\n\n* Breathing problems, including no breathing, shortness of breath, or rapid breathing\n* Chest pain (may occur suddenly in people with angina)\n* Coma\n* Confusion\n* Convulsions\n* Dizziness\n* Drowsiness\n* Fainting\n* Fatigue\n* General weakness and achiness\n* Headache\n* Hyperactivity\n* Impaired judgment\n* Irritability\n* Low blood pressure\n* Muscle weakness\n* Rapid or abnormal heartbeat\n* Shock\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Unconsciousness\n\nAnimals can also be poisoned by carbon monoxide. People who have pets at home may notice that their animals become weak or unresponsive from carbon monoxide exposure. Often the pets will get sick before humans.\n\nSince many of these symptoms can occur with viral illnesses, carbon monoxide poisoning is often confused with these conditions. This can lead to a delay in getting help.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air. Seek immediate medical right away.\n\n**PREVENTION**\n\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector on each floor of your home. Place an additional detector near any major gas-burning appliances (such as a furnace or water heater).\n\nMany carbon monoxide poisonings occur in the winter months when furnaces, gas fireplaces, and portable heaters are being used and windows are closed. Have heaters and gas-burning appliances regularly inspected to make sure they are safe to use.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nThe following information is helpful for emergency assistance:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition (for example, is the person awake or alert?)\n* How long they may have been exposed to the carbon monoxide, if known\n\nHowever, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:\n\n* Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV)\n* Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (high-pressure oxygen given in a special chamber)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can cause death. For those who survive, recovery is slow. How well a person does depends on the amount and length of exposure to the carbon monoxide. Permanent brain damage may occur.\n\nIf the person still has impaired mental ability after 2 weeks, the chance of a complete recovery is worse. Impaired mental ability can reappear after a person has been symptom-free for 1 to 2 weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Breathing problems, including no breathing, shortness of breath, or rapid breathing\n* Chest pain (may occur suddenly in people with angina)\n* Coma\n* Confusion\n* Convulsions\n* Dizziness\n* Drowsiness\n* Fainting\n* Fatigue\n* General weakness and achiness\n* Headache\n* Hyperactivity\n* Impaired judgment\n* Irritability\n* Low blood pressure\n* Muscle weakness\n* Rapid or abnormal heartbeat\n* Shock\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Unconsciousness\n\n**Where Found**\n\n* Anything that burns coal, gasoline, kerosene, oil, propane, or wood\n* Automobile engines\n* Charcoal grills (charcoal should never be burned indoors)\n* Indoor and portable heating systems\n* Portable propane heaters\n* Stoves (indoor and camp stoves)\n* Water heaters that use natural gas\n\n**Prevention**\n\n* Install a carbon monoxide detector on each floor of your home.\n* Place an additional detector near any major gas-burning appliances.\n\n**Home Care**\n\n* If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.\n* Seek immediate medical attention.\n\n**Emergency Room Treatment**\n\n* The healthcare provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs.\n* The person may receive:\n\t+ Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)\n\t+ Blood and urine tests\n\t+ Chest x-ray\n\t+ ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n\t+ Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV)\n\t+ Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (high-pressure oxygen given in a special chamber)\n\t+ Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n* Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause death.\n* For those who survive, recovery is slow.\n* How well a person does depends on the amount and length of exposure to the carbon monoxide.\n* Permanent brain damage may occur.\n\nNote: This article is for information only.

    "content": "**Carboplatin Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCarboplatin is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat cancer of the ovaries (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed) that has spread to other parts of the body, not improved, or that has worsened after treatment with other medications or radiation therapy. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCarboplatin injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected over at least 15 minutes intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. It is usually given once every 4 weeks.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nCarboplatin is also sometimes used to treat lung, bladder, breast, and endometrial cancer; head and neck cancer; cancer of the cervix and testicles: Wilms' tumor (a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children); certain types of brain tumors; neuroblastoma (a cancer that begins in nerve cells and occurs mainly in children); and retinoblastoma (cancer in the eye). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCarboplatin injection must be given in a hospital or medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer.

    "content": "**Carbuncle**\n\nA carbuncle is a skin infection that often involves a group of hair follicles. The infected material forms a lump, which occurs deep in the skin and often contains pus.\n\nWhen a person has many carbuncles, the condition is called **carbunculosis**.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Most carbuncles are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus).\n* A carbuncle is a cluster of several skin boils (furuncles). The infected mass is filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue.\n* Carbuncles can develop anywhere, but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women.\n* The bacteria that cause this condition spread easily, so family members may develop carbuncles at the same time.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nYou are more likely to get a carbuncle if you have:\n\n* Friction from clothing or shaving\n* Poor hygiene\n* Poor overall health\n\nPeople with diabetes, dermatitis, and a weakened immune system are more likely to develop staph infections that can cause carbuncles.\n\nStaph bacteria are sometimes found in the nose or around the genitals. Carbuncles can recur when antibiotics are not able to treat the bacteria in those areas.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA carbuncle is a swollen lump or mass under the skin. It may be the size of a pea or as large as a golf ball. The carbuncle may be red and irritated and might hurt when you touch it.\n\nA carbuncle usually:\n\n* Develops over several days\n* Has a white or yellow center (contains pus)\n* Weeps, oozes, or crusts\n* Spreads to other skin areas\n\nSometimes, other symptoms may occur. These may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* General discomfort or sick feeling\n* Skin itching before the carbuncle develops\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin. The diagnosis is based on what the skin looks like. A sample of the pus may be sent to a lab to determine the bacteria causing the infection (bacterial culture). The test result helps your provider determine the appropriate treatment.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCarbuncles usually must drain before they will heal. This most often occurs on its own in less than 2 weeks.\n\nPlacing a warm moist cloth on the carbuncle helps it to drain, which speeds healing. Apply a clean, warm moist cloth several times each day. Never squeeze a boil or try to cut it open at home, because this can spread the infection and make it worse.\n\nYou need to seek treatment if the carbuncle:\n\n* Lasts longer than 2 weeks\n* Returns frequently\n* Is located on the spine or the middle of the face\n* Occurs with a fever or other systemic symptoms\n\nTreatment helps reduce complications related to an infection. Your provider may prescribe:\n\n* Antibacterial soaps\n* Antibiotics applied to the skin or taken by mouth\n* Antibiotic ointment to treat the inside of the nose or around the anus\n\nDeep or large carbuncles may need to be drained by your provider.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGood general health and hygiene may help prevent some staph skin infections. These infections are contagious, so care must be taken to avoid spreading the bacteria to other people.\n\nIf you get carbuncles often, your provider may give you antibiotics to prevent them.\n\nIf you are a carrier of S aureus, your provider may give you antibiotics to prevent future infection.\n\n---\n\n**Carbuncle: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nMost carbuncles are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus). A carbuncle is a cluster of several skin boils (furuncles) filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue.

    "content": "**Carcinoid Tumors**\n\n**What are carcinoid tumors?**\n\nCarcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing cancers that usually start in the lining of the digestive tract or in the lungs. They grow slowly and don't produce symptoms in the early stages.\n\n**Symptoms and diagnosis**\n\nIn later stages, the tumors sometimes produce hormones that can cause carcinoid syndrome, which includes flushing of the face and upper chest, diarrhea, and trouble breathing. Surgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors, and if they haven't spread to other parts of the body, surgery can cure the cancer.\n\n**Prevention and risk factors**\n\nThere are no known ways to prevent carcinoid tumors, but some people with a family history of these cancers may be at higher risk.\n\n**Treatment options**\n\nSurgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors. If the tumor is small and has not spread to other parts of the body, surgery can cure the cancer.\n\n**Living with carcinoid tumors**\n\nPeople diagnosed with digestive or lung carcinoids are typically around 60 years old. Living with a carcinoid tumor requires regular check-ups with a doctor to monitor the tumor's size and growth.\n\n**Research and statistics**\n\nCarcinoid tumors are rare, making up only about 1% of all gastrointestinal cancers. Research is ongoing to better understand these tumors and improve treatment options.\n\n**Related issues**\n\nCarcinoid syndrome can cause a range of symptoms, including flushing, diarrhea, and trouble breathing. Understanding the causes and effects of carcinoid syndrome is crucial for effective management and treatment.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nThe exact causes of carcinoid tumors are still not fully understood, but research suggests that genetic mutations may play a role in their development.\n\n**Statistics and research**\n\nCarcinoid tumors are rare, with an estimated 1% of all gastrointestinal cancers being carcinoid. Research is ongoing to better understand these tumors and improve treatment options.\n\n**Clinical trials**\n\nClinical trials are available for people diagnosed with carcinoid tumors. These trials aim to evaluate new treatments and improve patient outcomes.\n\n**Journal articles**\n\nRecent journal articles have explored the clinical, pathological characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes of primary ovarian carcinoid tumors, as well as the survival and chemotherapy response in metastatic lung carcinoids.\n\n**Find an expert**\n\nIf you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a carcinoid tumor, finding an experienced doctor or medical professional can make all the difference in effective treatment and management.\n\n---\n\n**Carcinoid Tumors**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\n*   Surgery to Treat Lung Carcinoid Tumors (American Cancer Society)\n*   Treatment of Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors, by Extent of Disease (American Cancer Society)\n*   Treatment of Lung Carcinoid by Type and Extent of Disease (American Cancer Society)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Living with Carcinoid Tumors**\n\n*   Living as a Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor Survivor (American Cancer Society)\n*   Living as a Lung Carcinoid Tumor Survivor (American Cancer Society)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Questions to Ask about Carcinoid Tumors**\n\n*   Questions to Ask about Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors (American Cancer Society)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Carcinoid Syndrome and Genetics**\n\n*   Carcinoid Syndrome (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n*   Frequently Asked Questions (Carcinoid Cancer Foundation)\n*   What Causes Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors (American Cancer Society)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Statistics and Clinical Trials**\n\n*   Key Statistics about Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors (American Cancer Society)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Carcinoid Tumor  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   Article: Survival and Chemotherapy Response in Metastatic Lung Carcinoids: Insights from the... \n*   Article: Clinical, pathological characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes of primary ovarian carcinoid tumors:... \n*   Article: Oncocytic and spindle cell typical carcinoids of lung: different immunophenotype and... \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Finding an Expert**\n\n*   American Cancer Society \n    *   Choosing a Cancer Doctor (American Cancer Society)\n*   National Cancer Institute",

    "content": "**Cardiac Ablation Procedures**\n\n**What is Cardiac Ablation?**\n\nCardiac ablation is a procedure that scars small areas in your heart to prevent abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through your heart.\n\n**Description**\n\nThere are two methods for performing cardiac ablation:\n\n*   **Radiofrequency Ablation**: uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area.\n*   **Cryoablation**: uses very cold temperatures.\n\nThe type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nYou will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax. The skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic. A small cut in the skin will be made, and a small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nOnce the catheter is in place, your cardiologist will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart. These electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm. In most cases, there are one or more specific areas. Once the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area.\n\n**Risks**\n\nCatheter ablation is generally safe. However, there are some rare complications that may occur:\n\n*   Bleeding or blood pooling where the catheter is inserted\n*   Blood clot that goes to arteries in your leg, heart, or brain\n*   Damage to the artery where the catheter is inserted\n*   Damage to heart valves\n*   Damage to the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood to your heart)\n*   Esophageal atrial fistula (a connection that forms between your esophagus and part of your heart)\n*   Fluid around the heart (cardiac tamponade)\n*   Heart attack\n*   Vagal or phrenic nerve damage\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care providers what medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription. During the days before the procedure:\n\n*   Ask your cardiologist which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n*   Tell your cardiologist if you are taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin), or another blood thinner such as apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa) and edoxaban (Savaysa).\n*   If you smoke, stop before the procedure. Ask your provider for help if you need it.\n*   Tell your cardiologist if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nPressure to reduce bleeding is put on the area where the catheters were inserted into your body. You will be kept in bed for at least 1 hour. You may need to stay in bed for up to 5 or 6 hours. Your heart rhythm will be checked during this time. Your cardiologist will decide whether you can go home on the same day, or if you will need to stay in the hospital overnight for continued heart monitoring.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSuccess rates are different depending on what type of heart rhythm problem is being treated.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Ablation Procedures**\n\nLearn how to cite this page:\n\n*   **Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n    *   Arrhythmia\n    *   Atrial Fibrillation\n    *   Images\n    *   Conduction system of the heart\n    *   Patient Instructions\n        + Angina - discharge\n        + Angina - when you have chest pain\n        + Antiplatelet medicines - P2Y12 inhibitors\n        + Aspirin and heart disease\n        + Atrial fibrillation - discharge\n        + Butter, margarine, and cooking oils\n        + Cholesterol and lifestyle\n        + Controlling your high blood pressure\n        + Dietary fats explained\n        + Fast food tips\n        + Heart attack – discharge\n        + Heart disease - risk factors\n        + Heart failure - discharge\n        + Heart pacemaker - discharge\n        + How to read food labels\n        + Low-salt diet\n        + Mediterranean diet\n\n**What is Cardiac Ablation?**\n\nCardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your heart rhythm problems. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through your heart.\n\nDuring the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.\n\n**Methods for Performing Cardiac Ablation**\n\nThere are two methods for performing cardiac ablation:\n\n*   **Radiofrequency Ablation**: uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area.\n*   **Cryoablation**: uses very cold temperatures.\n\nThe type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have.\n\n**Cardiac Ablation Procedure**\n\nCardiac ablation procedures are done in a hospital laboratory by a team of trained staff. This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses. The setting is safe and controlled so your risk is as low as possible.\n\nYou will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax.\n\nThe skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic.\nNext, the cardiologist will make a small cut in the skin.\nA small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area. The cardiologist will use live x-ray images to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart.\nSometimes more than one catheter is needed.\n\nOnce the catheter is in place, your cardiologist will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart.\n\nThese electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm. In most cases, there are one or more specific areas.\nOnce the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area.\nThis creates a small scar that causes the heart rhythm problem to stop.\n\nCatheter ablation is a long procedure. It can last 4 or more hours. During the procedure your heart will be monitored closely. A health care team member may ask you if you are having symptoms at different times during the procedure. Symptoms you may feel are:\n\n*   Brief burning when medicines are injected\n*   Faster or stronger heartbeat\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Burning when the electrical energy is used\n\n**Why Cardiac Ablation is Performed**\n\nCardiac ablation is used to treat certain heart rhythm problems that medicines are not controlling. These problems may be dangerous if they are not treated.\n\nCommon symptoms of heart rhythm problems may include:\n\n*   Chest pain\n*   Fainting\n*   Slow or fast heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   Lightheadedness, dizziness\n*   Paleness\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Skipping beats -- changes in the pattern of the pulse\n*   Sweating\n\nSome heart rhythm problems are:\n\n*   **AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)**\n*   Associated with an accessory pathway, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n*   Atrial fibrillation\n*   Atrial flutter\n*   Ventricular tachycardia\n\n**Risks of Cardiac Ablation**\n\nCatheter ablation is generally safe. Talk with your cardiologist about these rare complications:\n\n*   Bleeding or blood pooling where the catheter is inserted\n*   Blood clot that goes to arteries in your leg, heart, or brain\n*   Damage to the artery where the catheter is inserted\n*   Damage to heart valves\n*   Damage to the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood to your heart)\n*   Esophageal atrial fistula (a connection that forms between your esophagus and part of your heart)\n*   Fluid around the heart (cardiac tamponade)\n*   Heart attack\n*   Vagal or phrenic nerve damage\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your health care providers what medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days before the procedure:\n\nAsk your cardiologist which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\nTell your cardiologist if you are taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin), or another blood thinner such as apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa) and edoxaban (Savaysa).\nIf you smoke, stop before the procedure. Ask your provider for help if you need it.\nTell your cardiologist if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness.\n\nOn the day of the procedure:\n\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure.\nTake the medicines your cardiologist has told you to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nPressure to reduce bleeding is put on the area where the catheters were inserted into your body. You will be kept in bed for at least 1 hour. You may need to stay in bed for up to 5 or 6 hours. Your heart rhythm will be checked during this time.\n\nYour cardiologist will decide whether you can go home on the same day, or if you will need to stay in the hospital overnight for continued heart monitoring. You will need someone to drive you home after your procedure.\n\nFor 2 or 3 days after your procedure, you may have these symptoms:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Achy feeling in your chest\n*   Skipped heartbeats or times when your heartbeat is very fast or irregular\n\nYour cardiologist may keep you on your medicines, or give you new ones that help control your heart rhythm.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSuccess rates are different depending on what type of heart rhythm problem is being treated.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Ablation Procedures**\n\n**What is Cardiac Ablation?**\n\nCardiac ablation is a procedure that scars small areas in your heart to prevent abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through your heart.\n\n**How is the Procedure Performed?**\n\nDuring the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity.

    "content": "**Cardiac Amyloidosis**\n\nCardiac amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue. These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAmyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloid build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis.\n\nCardiac amyloidosis (\"stiff heart syndrome\") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block).\n\nThe condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome people may have no symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:\n\n* Excessive urination at night\n* Fatigue, reduced exercise ability\n* Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat)\n* Shortness of breath with activity\n* Swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body\n* Trouble breathing while lying down\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe signs of cardiac amyloidosis can be related to a number of different conditions. This can make the problem hard to diagnose.\n\nSigns may include:\n\n* Abnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur\n* Blood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up\n* Enlarged neck veins\n* Swollen liver\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Blood and urine protein tests\n* Chest or abdomen CT scan (considered the \"gold standard\" to help diagnose this condition)\n* Coronary angiography\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Nuclear heart scans (MUGA, RNV)\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)\n\nAn ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals. It may also show low signals (called \"low voltage\").\n\nA cardiac biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of another area, such as the abdomen, kidney, or bone marrow, is often done as well.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour health care provider may tell you to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids.\n\nYou may need to take water pills (diuretics) to help your body get rid of excess fluid. Your provider may tell you to weigh yourself every day. A weight gain of 3 or more pounds (1 kilogram or more) over 1 to 2 days can mean there is too much fluid in the body.\n\nMedicines including digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers may be used in people with atrial fibrillation. However, the medicines must be used with caution, and the dosage must be carefully monitored. People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of these medicines.\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n* Chemotherapy\n* Drugs that target the abnormal protein (tafamidis)\n* Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD)\n* Pacemaker, if there are problems with heart signals\n* Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine\n\nA heart transplant may be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function. People with hereditary amyloidosis may need a liver transplant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn the past, cardiac amyloidosis was thought to be an untreatable and rapidly fatal disease. However, the field is changing rapidly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias\n* Congestive heart failure\n* Fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)\n* Increased sensitivity to digoxin\n* Low blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination (due to medicine)\n* Sick sinus syndrome\n* Symptomatic cardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias related to abnormal conduction of impulses through the heart muscle)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have this disorder and develop new symptoms such as:\n\n* Dizziness when you change position\n* Excessive weight (fluid) gain\n* Excessive weight loss\n* Fainting spells\n* Severe breathing problems\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Amyloidosis**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAmyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloid build up in body tissues.

This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block).\n\nThe condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome people may have no symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:\n\n* Excessive urination at night\n* Fatigue, reduced exercise ability\n* Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat)\n* Shortness of breath with activity\n* Swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body\n* Trouble breathing while lying down\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe signs of cardiac amyloidosis can be related to a number of different conditions. This can make the problem hard to diagnose.\n\nSigns may include:\n\n* Abnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur\n* Blood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up\n* Enlarged neck veins\n* Swollen liver\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Blood and urine protein tests\n* Chest or abdomen CT scan (considered the \"gold standard\" to help diagnose this condition)\n* Coronary angiography\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Nuclear heart scans (MUGA, RNV)\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)\n\nAn ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals. It may also show low signals (called \"low voltage\").\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Amyloidosis**\n\n**What is Cardiac Amyloidosis?**\n\nCardiac amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins, called amyloid, accumulate in the heart. This can lead to thickening of the heart walls and impaired heart function.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSigns may include:\n\n* Abnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur\n* Blood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up\n* Enlarged neck veins\n* Swollen liver\n\n**Tests**\n\nThe following tests may be done:\n\n* Blood and urine protein tests\n* Chest or abdomen CT scan (considered the \"gold standard\" to help diagnose this condition)\n* Coronary angiography\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Nuclear heart scans (MUGA, RNV)\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAn ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals. It may also show low signals (called \"low voltage\").\n\nA cardiac biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of another area, such as the abdomen, kidney, or bone marrow, is often done as well.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour health care provider may tell you to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids.\n\nYou may need to take water pills (diuretics) to help your body get rid of excess fluid. Your provider may tell you to weigh yourself every day. A weight gain of 3 or more pounds (1 kilogram or more) over 1 to 2 days can mean there is too much fluid in the body.\n\nMedicines including digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers may be used in people with atrial fibrillation. However, the medicines must be used with caution, and the dosage must be carefully monitored. People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of these medicines.\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n* Chemotherapy\n* Drugs that target the abnormal protein (tafamidis)\n* Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD)\n* Pacemaker, if there are problems with heart signals\n* Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine\n\nA heart transplant may be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function. People with hereditary amyloidosis may need a liver transplant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn the past, cardiac amyloidosis was thought to be an untreatable and rapidly fatal disease. However, the field is changing rapidly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias\n* Congestive heart failure\n* Fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)\n* Increased sensitivity to digoxin\n* Low blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination (due to medicine)\n* Sick sinus syndrome\n* Symptomatic cardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias related to abnormal conduction of impulses through the heart muscle)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have this disorder and develop new symptoms such as:\n\n* Dizziness when you change position\n* Excessive weight (fluid) gain\n* Excessive weight loss\n* Fainting spells\n* Severe breathing problems\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Amyloidosis**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Excessive weight (fluid) gain\n*   Excessive weight loss\n*   Fainting spells\n*   Severe breathing problems\n\n**Contact Your Provider If You Have This Disorder and Develop New Symptoms Such As:**\n\n*   **Alternative Names**\n    *   Amyloidosis - cardiac; Primary cardiac amyloidosis - AL type; Secondary cardiac amyloidosis - AA type; Stiff heart syndrome; Senile amyloidosis\n*   **Images**\n    *   Heart - section through the middle\n    *   Dilated cardiomyopathy\n    *   Biopsy catheter\n\n**References**\n\n*   Elliott PM, Olivotto I.

Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is not treated within a few minutes, cardiac arrest most often causes death.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhile some people refer to a heart attack as a cardiac arrest, they are not the same thing. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery stops the flow of blood to the heart. The medical term for this is myocardial infarction. A heart attack can damage the heart, but it does not necessarily cause death. However, a heart attack can sometimes trigger a cardiac arrest.\n\nCardiac arrest is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system, such as:\n\n* **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)**: When VF occurs, the lower chambers in the heart quiver instead of beating regularly. The heart cannot pump blood, which results in cardiac arrest.\n* **Heart Block**: This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart.\n\nProblems that may lead to cardiac arrest include:\n\n* Coronary heart disease (CHD)\n* Heart attack\n* Heart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart\n* Abnormal levels of potassium or magnesium\n* Severe physical stress\n* Recreational drugs\n* Medicines\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people do not have any symptoms of cardiac arrest until it happens. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Sudden loss of consciousness; a person will fall to the floor or slump down if sitting\n* No pulse\n* No breathing\n\nIn some cases, you may notice some symptoms about an hour before cardiac arrest. These may include:\n\n* A racing heart\n* Dizziness\n* Shortness of breath\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Chest pain\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nCardiac arrest happens so quickly, there is no time to do tests. If a person survives, most tests are done afterwards to help find out what caused the cardiac arrest. These may include:\n\n* Blood tests to check for enzymes that can show if you have had a heart attack\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure your heart's electrical activity\n* Echocardiogram to show if your heart has been damaged and find other types of heart problems\n* Cardiac MRI helps your provider see detailed pictures of your heart and blood vessels\n* Intracardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) to see how well your heart's electrical signals are working\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCardiac arrest needs emergency treatment right away to get the heart started again.\n\n* **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)**: This is often the first type of treatment for cardiac arrest. It can be done by anyone who has been trained in CPR.\n* **Defibrillation**: This is the most important treatment for cardiac arrest. It is performed using a medical device that gives an electrical shock to the heart.\n\nIf you survive cardiac arrest, you will be admitted to a hospital for treatment. Depending on what caused your cardiac arrest, you may need other medicines, procedures, or surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people do not survive cardiac arrest. If you have had a cardiac arrest, you are at high risk of having another. You will need to work closely with your doctors to reduce your risk.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCardiac arrest can cause some lasting health problems including:\n\n* Brain injury\n* Heart problems\n* Lung conditions\n* Infection\n\nYou may need ongoing care and treatment to manage some of these complications.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall your provider or 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Arrest**\n\nCardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating.

This can happen without any cause or as a result of another condition.\n* **Heart Block**: This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart.\n\n**Problems that may lead to Cardiac Arrest**\n\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) -- CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, so the blood cannot flow smoothly. Over time, this can put a strain on your heart's muscle and electrical system.\nHeart attack -- A prior heart attack can create scar tissue that can lead to VF and cardiac arrest.\nHeart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart can also lead to cardiac arrest.\nAbnormal levels of potassium or magnesium -- These minerals help your heart's electrical system work. Abnormally high or low levels can cause cardiac arrest.\nSevere physical stress -- Anything that causes a severe stress on your body can lead to cardiac arrest. This can include trauma, electrical shock, or major blood loss.\nRecreational drugs -- Using certain drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, also increases your risk for cardiac arrest.\nMedicines -- Some medicines can increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people do not have any symptoms of cardiac arrest until it happens.

In this article, we'll discuss how to care for yourself after the procedure.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nDuring the procedure, a catheter was inserted into an artery in your groin or arm. It was then carefully guided up to your heart, where it was placed into the arteries that deliver blood to your heart. Contrast dye was injected to allow your heart doctor to see any areas in your coronary arteries that were blocked or narrowed.\n\nIf you had a blockage, you may have had angioplasty and a stent placed in your coronary artery during the procedure.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may feel pain in your groin or arm where the catheter was placed. You may also have some bruising around and below the incision that was made to insert the catheter.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nIn general, people who have angioplasty can walk around within 6 hours or less after the procedure. Complete recovery takes a week or less. Keep the area where the catheter was inserted dry for 24 to 48 hours.

Ask your heart doctor when it will be OK to start again.\n* You should be able to return to work in 2 to 3 days if you do not do heavy work.\n* Do not take a bath or swim for the first week. You may take showers, but make sure the area where the catheter was inserted does not get wet for the first 24 to 48 hours.\n\nYou will need to take care of your incision.\n\nYour heart doctor will tell you how often to change your dressing.\nIf your incision bleeds, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Catheterization - Discharge**\n\nYou will need to take care of your incision.\n\nYour heart doctor will tell you how often to change your dressing.\nIf your incision bleeds, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes.\n\nMany people take aspirin, often with another medicine such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta), after this procedure. These medicines are blood thinners, and they keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack. Take the medicines exactly as your heart doctor tells you. Do not stop taking them without talking to your heart doctor.\n\nYou should eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, and follow a healthy lifestyle.

Now that it's over, you're probably wondering what to expect next.\n\n**What Happened During the Procedure?**\n\nDuring the procedure, your doctor inserted a thin tube (catheter) into an artery in your leg or arm. The catheter was then guided through the artery to your heart, where dye was injected to highlight any blockages or abnormalities.\n\n**What to Expect After the Procedure**\n\nAfter the procedure, you may feel some discomfort or bruising at the insertion site. You may also experience some mild chest pain or shortness of breath. These symptoms are usually temporary and should resolve on their own within a few days.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nTo ensure a smooth recovery, follow these instructions:\n\n*   Take your medications as directed by your doctor.\n*   Rest for 24 hours after the procedure to avoid any complications.\n*   Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for at least a week.\n*   Follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to maintain your heart health.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n*   If you experience any severe symptoms, such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately.\n*   Attend all follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your progress and address any concerns.\n*   Consider making lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or reducing your salt intake, to improve your overall heart health.\n\nBy following these instructions and tips, you can ensure a successful recovery after cardiac catheterization. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor for guidance.",

    "content": "**Cardiac Catheterization**\n\n**What is Cardiac Catheterization?**\n\nCardiac catheterization involves passing a thin flexible tube (catheter) into the right or left side of the heart. The catheter is most often inserted from the groin or the arm.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will get medicine before the test to help you relax.\n\nA member of the team doing this procedure will clean a site on your arm, neck, or groin and insert a small catheter into one of your veins. This is called an intravenous (IV) line.\n\nA larger thin plastic tube called a sheath is placed into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. Then longer plastic tubes called catheters are carefully moved up into the heart using live x-rays (fluoroscopy) as a guide. Then the doctor (usually a cardiologist or heart specialist) doing the cardiac catheterization can:\n\n* Collect blood samples from the heart\n* Measure pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers and in the large arteries around the heart\n* Measure the oxygen levels in different parts of your heart\n* Examine the arteries of the heart\n* Perform a biopsy on the heart muscle\n\nFor some procedures, you may be injected with a dye that helps your doctor to visualize the structures and vessels within the heart.\n\nIf you have a blockage of one of the heart arteries, you may have angioplasty and a stent placed during the procedure.\n\nThe test may last 30 to 60 minutes. If you also need special procedures, the test may take longer. If the catheter is placed in your groin, you will often be asked to lie flat on your back for a few to several hours after the test to avoid bleeding.\n\nYou will be told how to take care of yourself when you go home after the procedure is done.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou should not eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The test takes place in a hospital or specialized procedure unit and you will be asked to wear a hospital gown. Sometimes, you will need to spend the night before the test in the hospital. Otherwise, you will come to the hospital the morning of the procedure.\n\nYour health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks.

This is called an intravenous (IV) line.\n\nA larger thin plastic tube called a sheath is placed into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. Then longer plastic tubes called catheters are carefully moved up into the heart using live x-rays (fluoroscopy) as a guide. Then the doctor (usually a cardiologist or heart specialist) doing the cardiac catheterization can:\n\n* Collect blood samples from the heart\n* Measure pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers and in the large arteries around the heart\n* Measure the oxygen levels in different parts of your heart\n* Examine the arteries of the heart\n* Perform a biopsy on the heart muscle\n\nFor some procedures, you may be injected with a dye that helps your doctor to visualize the structures and vessels within the heart.\n\nIf you have a blockage of one of the heart arteries, you may have angioplasty and a stent placed during the procedure.\n\nThe test may last 30 to 60 minutes. If you also need special procedures, the test may take longer. If the catheter is placed in your groin, you will often be asked to lie flat on your back for a few to several hours after the test to avoid bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Catheterization**\n\nThis procedure is most often done to get information about the heart or its blood vessels.

It's often used to diagnose conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, and heart failure. The procedure involves inserting a thin flexible tube (catheter) into a vein or artery in the leg or arm and guiding it to the heart.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nDuring cardiac catheterization, a doctor will insert a catheter into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. The catheter is then guided through the blood vessels to the heart, where it takes pressure readings and collects blood samples. This helps doctors diagnose and treat various heart conditions.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nCardiac catheterization has several benefits:\n\n*   It's a very safe procedure when performed by an experienced team.\n*   It can detect many types of heart problems, including coronary artery disease, heart valve issues, and heart failure.\n*   It allows doctors to collect blood samples and take pressure readings directly from the heart.\n\n**Risks**\n\nWhile cardiac catheterization is generally safe, there are some risks associated with the procedure:\n\n*   Possible complications include bleeding or bruising at the insertion site, infection, and damage to the blood vessels.\n\n**References**\n\nDangas GD, Mehran R.

    "content": "**Cardiac Event Monitors**\n\nA cardiac event monitor is a device that you control to record the electrical activity of your heart. Cardiac event monitors range in size, with the largest being about the size of a deck of cards. The device records your heart rate and rhythm.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nEach type of monitor is slightly different, but most have sensors (called electrodes) to record the electrical activity of your heart, similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). In some models, these attach to the skin on your chest using sticky patches. The sensors need good contact with your skin. Poor contact can cause poor results.\n\nYou should keep your skin free from oils, creams, and sweat (as much as possible). The technician who places the monitor will perform the following to get a good ECG recording:\n\n*   Men will have the area on their chest shaved where the electrode patches will be placed.\n*   The area of skin where the electrodes will be attached will be cleaned with alcohol before the sensors are attached.\n\n**Types of Cardiac Event Monitors**\n\nThere are several types of cardiac event monitors, including:\n\n*   **Loop Memory Monitor**: This device constantly records your ECG, but does not save it. When you feel symptoms, you press a button to activate the device, and it will then save the ECG from shortly before, during, and for a time after your symptoms begin.\n*   **Symptom Event Monitor**: This device records your ECG only when symptoms occur, not before they occur. You carry this device in a pocket or wear it on your wrist. When you feel symptoms, you turn on the device and place the electrodes on your chest to record the ECG.\n*   **Patch Recorders**: This monitor does not use wires or electrodes. It continuously monitors ECG activity for 14 days using an adhesive patch that sticks to the chest.\n*   **Implanted Loop Recorders**: This is a small monitor that is implanted under the skin on the chest. It can be left in place to monitor heart rhythms for 3 or more years.\n\n**While Wearing the Device**\n\nYou should continue your normal activities while wearing the monitor. You may be asked to exercise or adjust your activity level during the test.\n\nKeep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, how you feel, and any symptoms you have. This will help your health care provider match symptoms with your monitor findings.\n\nThe monitoring station staff will tell you how to transfer data over the telephone, if applicable.\n\nYour provider will look at the data and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nThe monitoring company or the provider who ordered the monitor may contact you if a concerning rhythm is discovered.\n\n**Things to Avoid While Wearing the Device**\n\nYou may be asked to avoid certain things that can disrupt the signal between the sensors and the monitor. These may include:\n\n*   Cell phones\n*   Electric blankets\n*   Electric toothbrushes\n*   High-voltage areas\n*   Magnets\n*   Metal detectors\n\nAsk the technician who attaches the device for a list of things to avoid.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nTell your provider if you are allergic to any tape or other adhesives.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Event Monitors**\n\nA cardiac event monitor is a device that you control to record the electrical activity of your heart. It's used when you need long-term monitoring of symptoms that occur less than daily.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nEach type of monitor is slightly different, but most have sensors (called electrodes) to record the electrical activity of your heart, similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). In some models, these attach to the skin on your chest using sticky patches. The sensors need good contact with your skin.

However, the adhesive of the electrode patches may irritate your skin. This goes away on its own once you remove the patches. For devices implanted under the skin, you may be given a small amount of local anesthetic to numb the area during the incision. You may have some pain when the device is implanted.\n\nYou must keep the monitor close to your body.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nMost often, in people with frequent symptoms, a test called Holter monitoring, which lasts 1 to 2 days, will be performed before using a cardiac event monitor. The event monitor is ordered only if no diagnosis is reached. The event monitor is also used for people who have symptoms that occur less than daily.\n\nCardiac event monitoring may be used:\n\n* To assess someone with palpitations\n* To identify the reason for a fainting or near-fainting episode\n* To check the heartbeats in people with risk factors for arrhythmias\n* To monitor your heart after a heart attack or when starting or stopping a heart medicine\n* To check if a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is working properly\n* To look for the cause of a stroke when the cause cannot be easily found with other tests.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal variations in heart rate occur with activities. A normal result is no significant changes in heart rhythms or pattern.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may include various arrhythmias. Changes may mean that the heart is not getting enough oxygen.\n\nIt may be used to diagnose or further evaluate:\n\n* Atrial fibrillation or flutter\n* Multifocal atrial tachycardia\n* Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia\n* Ventricular tachycardia\n* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)\n* Heart block\n* Premature atrial complexes\n* Premature ventricular complexes\n\n**Risks**\n\nSkin irritation is the most common complication. There is a small risk of infection from the implantable devices. If infection occurs or is suspected, the device is removed.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAmbulatory electrocardiography; Electrocardiography (ECG) - ambulatory; Continuous electrocardiograms (EKGs); Holter monitors; Transtelephonic event monitors\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Event Monitors**\n\nYou carry the device in your hand, wear it on your wrist, or keep it in your pocket.

    "content": "**Cardiac Intravascular Ultrasound**\n\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a diagnostic test that uses sound waves to see inside blood vessels, specifically evaluating the coronary arteries that supply the heart.\n\n**Description**\n\nA tiny ultrasound wand is attached to the top of a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is inserted into an artery in your groin area and moved up to the heart. This procedure is different from conventional duplex ultrasound, which is done from the outside of your body by placing the ultrasound transducer on the skin.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nIVUS is commonly done to make sure a stent is correctly placed during angioplasty. It may also be done to determine where a stent should be placed. IVUS may also be used to:\n\n* View the aorta and structure of the artery walls, which can show plaque buildup\n* Find which blood vessel is involved in aortic dissection\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a slight risk for complications with angioplasty and cardiac catheterization. However, the tests are very safe when done by an experienced team. IVUS adds little additional risk.\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots\n* Infection\n\nOther risks include:\n\n* Damage to a heart valve or blood vessel\n* Heart attack\n* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n* Kidney failure (a higher risk in people who already have kidney problems or diabetes)\n* Stroke (this is rare)\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter the test, the catheter is completely removed. A bandage is placed on the area. You will be asked to lie flat on your back with pressure on your groin area for a few hours after the test to prevent bleeding.\n\nIf IVUS was done during:\n\n* Cardiac catheterization: You will stay in the hospital for about 3 to 6 hours.\n* Angioplasty: You will stay in the hospital for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nThe IVUS does not add to the time you must stay in the hospital.\n\n---\n\n**Cardiac Intravascular Ultrasound**\n\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a medical imaging technique that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of blood vessels. It is different from conventional duplex ultrasound, which is done from the outside of the body by placing the ultrasound transducer on the skin.\n\n**How IVUS Works**\n\nA tiny ultrasound wand is attached to the top of a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin area and moved up to the heart. A computer measures how the sound waves reflect off blood vessels and changes the sound waves into pictures. IVUS gives the healthcare provider a look at the coronary arteries from the inside-out.\n\n**Why IVUS is Performed**\n\nIVUS is commonly done to make sure a stent is correctly placed during angioplasty. It may also be done to determine where a stent should be placed.

It involves inserting a small catheter into an artery and using high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of the vessel walls.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does Cardiac IVUS Work?**\n\nCardiac IVUS uses a miniature ultrasound probe attached to the end of a flexible catheter. The catheter is inserted through an artery, usually in the leg or arm, and guided to the area of interest using X-ray imaging. Once in place, the ultrasound probe emits high-frequency sound waves that bounce off the vessel walls, creating detailed images of the inner lining of the blood vessels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits of Cardiac IVUS?**\n\nCardiac IVUS offers several benefits over traditional angiography:\n\n*   **Detailed images**: IVUS provides high-resolution images of the vessel walls, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.\n*   **Improved visualization**: IVUS can help identify plaque buildup, calcifications, and other vascular abnormalities that may not be visible with angiography alone.\n*   **Enhanced treatment options**: With detailed images, healthcare providers can better assess the severity of disease and choose the most effective treatment approach.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Heart Health Tests\n*   Coronary Angiography",

This can be done through a procedure called pericardiocentesis, where a needle is inserted into the pericardium to remove the excess fluid. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or remove part of the pericardium.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe outcome for cardiac tamponade is often good if treated promptly. However, complications can arise, including heart failure, pulmonary edema, bleeding, shock, and death.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany cases of cardiac tamponade cannot be prevented. However, knowing your personal risk factors may help you get early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCardiac tamponade is also known as:\n\n*   Tamponade\n*   Pericardial tamponade\n*   Pericarditis - tamponade",
