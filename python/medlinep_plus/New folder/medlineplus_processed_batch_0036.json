    "content": "**Causes and Risks for Obesity in Children**\n\nWhen children eat more than they need, their bodies store the extra calories in fat cells to use for energy later. If their bodies do not need this stored energy, they develop more fat cells and may become overweight or develop obesity.\n\nNo single factor or behavior causes obesity. Obesity is caused by many things, including a person's habits, lifestyle, and environment. Genes and some medical problems also increase a person's chances of developing obesity.\n\n**Learned Behaviors and Habits**\n\nInfants and young children are very good at listening to their bodies' signals of hunger and fullness. They will stop eating as soon as their bodies tell them they have had enough. But sometimes a well-meaning parent tells them they have to finish everything on their plate. This forces them to ignore their fullness and eat everything that is served to them.\n\nThe way we eat when we are children may strongly affect our eating behaviors as adults. When we repeat these behaviors over many years, they become habits. They affect what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.\n\nOther learned behaviors include using food to:\n\n* Reward good behaviors\n* Seek comfort when we feel sad\n* Express love\n\nThese learned habits may lead to eating no matter if we are hungry or full. Many people have a very hard time breaking these habits.\n\n**Lifestyle and Environment**\n\nThe family, friends, schools, and community resources in a child's environment reinforce lifestyle habits regarding diet and activity.\n\nChildren are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active:\n\n* Parents have less time to plan and prepare healthy meals. As a result, children are eating more processed and fast foods that are usually less healthy than home-cooked meals.\n* Children see up to 10,000 food commercials or advertisements every year. Many of these are for fast food, candy, soft drinks, and sugared cereals.\n* More foods today are processed and high in fat and contain too much sugar.\n* Vending machines and convenience stores make it easy to get a quick snack, but they rarely sell healthy foods.\n* Overeating is a habit that is reinforced by restaurants that advertise high-calorie foods and large portion sizes.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSome children are at greater risk for obesity because of genetic factors. They have inherited genes from their parents that make their bodies gain weight easily. This would have been a very good trait hundreds of years ago, when food was hard to find and people were very active. Today, though, this can work against people who have these genes.\n\n**Medical Factors**\n\nCertain medical conditions can increase a child's appetite. These include hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines, such as steroids or anti-seizure medicines. Over time, any of these can increase the risk for obesity.\n\n---\n\n**Causes of Obesity in Children**\n\nObesity in children is a complex issue with multiple causes. It's not just about eating too much or exercising too little, but rather a combination of factors that contribute to weight gain.\n\n**Environmental Factors**\n\nThe environment plays a significant role in shaping a child's eating habits and physical activity levels. Some environmental factors that contribute to obesity include:\n\n*   **Food commercials**: Children are exposed to up to 10,000 food commercials or advertisements every year, many of which promote unhealthy foods.\n*   **Processed and fast foods**: The ease of access to processed and fast foods can lead to a diet high in unhealthy ingredients like sugar and fat.\n*   **Vending machines and convenience stores**: The availability of quick snacks can contribute to overeating and poor food choices.\n*   **Screen time**: Spending too much time watching TV, gaming, or using electronic devices can replace physical activity and lead to weight gain.\n\n**Community Factors**\n\nThe community also plays a role in shaping a child's eating habits and physical activity levels. Some community factors that contribute to obesity include:\n\n*   **Safe outdoor spaces**: Having access to safe parks or community centers can encourage outdoor play and physical activity.\n*   **School policies**: Schools can promote healthy food choices and physical activity by limiting unhealthy foods in lunches and vending machines.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSome children are more prone to obesity due to genetic factors. They may have inherited genes from their parents that make their bodies gain weight easily. This can be a challenging issue, as it's not something that can be easily changed.\n\n**Medical Factors**\n\nCertain medical conditions can increase a child's appetite and contribute to obesity. These include hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines like steroids or anti-seizure medications.\n\n**Learned Behaviors and Habits**\n\nThe way we eat when we are children may strongly affect our eating behaviors as adults. When we repeat these behaviors over many years, they become habits that can lead to obesity. Some learned behaviors include using food to:\n\n*   **Reward good behaviors**\n*   **Seek comfort when feeling sad**\n*   **Express love**\n\nThese habits can be challenging to break and may contribute to weight gain.\n\n**Breaking the Cycle**\n\nTo prevent obesity in children, it's essential to address these underlying causes. This can involve:\n\n*   **Promoting healthy food choices**: Encouraging a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources.\n*   **Increasing physical activity**: Finding activities that your child enjoys, such as sports, dance, or simply playing outside.\n*   **Modeling healthy behaviors**: As a parent, it's essential to model healthy eating habits and physical activity levels for your child.\n\nBy addressing these underlying causes, we can help our children develop healthy habits that will last a lifetime.\n\n---\n\n**Causes and Risks for Obesity in Children**\n\n**Lifestyle and Environment**\n\nThe family, friends, schools, and community resources in a child's environment reinforce lifestyle habits regarding diet and activity.\n\nChildren are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active:\n\n* Parents have less time to plan and prepare healthy meals. As a result, children are eating more processed and fast foods that are usually less healthy than home-cooked meals.\n* Children see up to 10,000 food commercials or advertisements every year. Many of these are for fast food, candy, soft drinks, and sugared cereals.\n* More foods today are processed and high in fat and contain too much sugar.\n* Vending machines and convenience stores make it easy to get a quick snack, but they rarely sell healthy foods.\n* Overeating is a habit that is reinforced by restaurants that advertise high-calorie foods and large portion sizes.\n\n**At Home**\n\nIf a parent is overweight and has poor diet and exercise habits, the child is likely to adopt the same habits.\n\nScreen time, such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer are activities that require very little energy. They take up a lot of time and replace physical activity. And, when children watch TV, they often crave the unhealthy high-calorie snacks they see in commercials.\n\n**At School**\n\nSchools have an important role in teaching students about healthy food choices and exercise. Many schools now limit unhealthy foods in lunches and vending machines. They are also encouraging students to exercise more.\n\n**In the Community**\n\nHaving a safe community that supports outdoor activities at parks, or indoor activities at community centers, is important for encouraging physical activity. If a parent feels it is not safe to allow their child to play outside, the child is more likely to do sedentary activities inside.\n\n**Eating Disorders and Obesity in Children**\n\nThe term eating disorders refers to a group of medical problems that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. Examples of eating disorders are:\n\n* Anorexia\n* Bulimia\n\nObesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teens and young adults who may be unhappy with their body image.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nSome children are at greater risk for obesity because of genetic factors. They have inherited genes from their parents that make their bodies gain weight easily. This would have been a very good trait hundreds of years ago, when food was hard to find and people were very active. Today, though, this can work against people who have these genes.\n\nGenetics is not the only cause of obesity. To develop obesity, children must also eat more calories than they need for growth and energy.\n\n---\n\n**Causes and Risks for Obesity in Children**\n\nObesity in children is a complex issue with multiple causes. While genetics play a role, they are not the only factor.\n\n*   **Genetic Factors**: Some children are at greater risk for obesity due to genetic factors. They have inherited genes from their parents that make their bodies gain weight easily. This would have been a beneficial trait hundreds of years ago when food was scarce and people were highly active.\n*   **Genetics is Not the Only Cause**: To develop obesity, children must also consume more calories than they need for growth and energy.\n\nRare genetic conditions, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, may be linked to obesity. This congenital disease is the most common genetic cause of severe and life-threatening childhood obesity.\n\n**Medical Factors**\n\nCertain medical conditions can increase a child's appetite, leading to an increased risk of obesity. These include:\n\n*   **Hormone Disorders**: Hormonal imbalances or disorders\n*   **Low Thyroid Function**: Hypothyroidism\n*   **Medicines**: Steroids and anti-seizure medicines\n\nThese conditions can affect a child's metabolism and appetite, contributing to weight gain and obesity.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on preventing childhood obesity, families can visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682729.html",
    "content": "**Cefaclor: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Cefaclor?**\n\nCefaclor is a medication used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract (lung) infections; and infections of the skin, ears, throat, tonsils, and urinary tract. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCefaclor is used to treat bacterial infections that are caused by susceptible strains of certain types of bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefaclor will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCefaclor comes as a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. The capsule and liquid are usually taken with or without food every 8 or 12 hours . The long-acting tablet is usually taken within 1 hour of eating a meal every 12 hours (twice a day) for 7 to 10 days . Take cefaclor at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefaclor exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefaclor. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Take cefaclor until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefaclor too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore cefaclor at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze liquid medicine. Keep cefaclor out of reach of children and pets. If you have any leftover cefaclor, do not flush it down the toilet or pour it into a drain unless instructed to do so by your local waste disposal company.\n\n\\n\\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much cefaclor, call your doctor or pharmacist immediately. Symptoms of an overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and seizures.\n\n\\n\\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCefaclor is available under the brand names Ceclor, Ceclor AC, and Raniclor. It is also known as cefaclor sodium or cefaclor monohydrate.\n\n---\n\n**Cefaclor: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking cefaclor, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cefaclor, other cephalosporin antibiotics such as cefadroxil , cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol), cefdinir , cefditoren (Spectracef), cefepime (Maxipime), cefixime (Suprax), cefotaxime (Claforan), cefotetan, cefoxitin (Mefoxin), cefpodoxime , cefprozil (Cefzil), ceftaroline (Teflaro), ceftazidime ( Fortaz, Tazicef, in Avycaz), ceftibuten (Cedax), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), cefuroxime (Ceftin, Kefurox, Zinacef), and cephalexin (Keflex); penicillin antibiotics; or any other medications. Also tell your doctor if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in cefaclor capsules, extended release tablets, or suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cefaclor. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nYou should know that cefaclor may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections). You will need to use another method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking cefaclor. Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had any kind of allergies, gastrointestinal disease (GI; affecting the stomach or intestines), especially colitis (condition that causes swelling in the lining of the colon [large intestine]), or kidney disease.\n\nIf you are taking antacids that contain magnesium or aluminum, take them 1 hour before or 1 hour after cefaclor extended release tablets.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking cefaclor, call your doctor.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCefaclor may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* diarrhea\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* stomach pain\n* headache\n* genital itching\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the capsules and tablets at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). The tablets should also be stored away from light. Keep liquid medicine in the refrigerator, tightly closed, and dispose of any unused medication after 14 days.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.\n\nSymptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to cefaclor.\n\nBefore having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking cefaclor.\n\nIf you are diabetic and test your urine for sugar, use Clinistix or TesTape (not Clinitest) to test your urine while taking this medication.\n\nDo not let anyone else take your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking.

    "content": "**Cefdinir: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCefdinir is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as bronchitis (infection of the airway tubes leading to the lungs); pneumonia; and infections of the skin, ears, sinuses, throat, and tonsils. Cefdinir is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\n\nAntibiotics such as cefdinir will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCefdinir comes as a capsule and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 12 or 24 hours for 5 to 10 days, depending on the condition being treated. Take cefdinir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefdinir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefdinir. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\n\nContinue to take cefdinir even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefdinir too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking cefdinir:\n\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cefdinir or any other cephalosporin antibiotic, penicillin antibiotics, or any other medications.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cefdinir.\n* If you are taking antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, iron supplements, or multivitamins that contain iron, take them 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir.\n* You should know that cefdinir may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections).

Cefpodoxime is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.\n\nAntibiotics such as cefpodoxime will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCefpodoxime comes as a tablet and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days depending on the condition being treated. A single dose is given to treat gonorrhea. Take the tablet with food; the suspension can be taken with or without food. Take cefpodoxime at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefpodoxime exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefpodoxime. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\n\nContinue to take cefpodoxime until you finish the prescription even if you feel better.

    "content": "**Celiac Disease Screening**\n\n**What is a Celiac Disease Blood Test?**\n\nA celiac disease blood test looks for signs of celiac disease in a sample of your blood. Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition, anemia, and other serious health problems.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nA celiac disease blood test is used to:\n\n* Help diagnose celiac disease if you have symptoms\n* Monitor celiac disease to see if treatment is helping\n* Screen for signs of celiac disease if the disease runs in your family (more than one person has it)\n\n**Why Do I Need a Celiac Disease Blood Test?**\n\nYou may need a celiac disease test if you have symptoms of celiac disease. Symptoms can vary a lot, and they may come and go. Children tend to have more digestive problems than adults.\n\nThe digestive symptoms of celiac disease include:\n\n* Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly)\n* Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop)\n* Constipation\n* Gas\n* Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in the abdomen (belly)\n* Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children\n\nSome people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Headaches\n* Depression and anxiety\n* Irritability (in children)\n* Itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults)\n\n**What Happens During a Celiac Disease Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nIf the test is being used to diagnose celiac disease, you'll need to continue to eat foods with gluten for a few weeks before testing. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions about how to prepare for the test.\n\nIf the test is being used to monitor celiac disease, you don't need any special preparations.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThere are different types of celiac disease antibodies, so your celiac blood test results may include information on more than one type of antibody. Your results may also include other blood tests you had to look for signs of celiac disease. Your provider can explain what all your test results say about your health.\n\nIn general, results from a celiac disease blood test may be:\n\n* Negative. This means that celiac disease antibodies weren't found in your blood. So, you probably don't have celiac disease.\n* Positive. This mean that celiac disease antibodies were found in your blood. So, you're likely to have celiac disease. To confirm the diagnosis, you will need more tests to look for damage in your intestines.\n* Uncertain, indeterminate, or inconclusive. These terms all mean that it's unclear whether you have celiac disease.\n\nYour provider may order other tests to confirm that you have celiac disease and/or to see how much damage the disease may have caused. These tests may include:\n\n* A biopsy to examine a tissue sample from your small intestine or your skin if you have a rash that could be from celiac disease.\n* An endoscopy is used to take a sample of tissue from your small intestine.\n* Capsule endoscopy to look at your small intestine. For this test, you swallow a tiny camera in a capsule. As it passes through your small intestine, it records pictures. The camera leaves your body during a bowel movement (poop).\n* Genetic testing to see if you have a gene linked to celiac disease\n* Tests for other health problems that celiac disease may cause such as anemia, osteoporosis, or a lack of certain vitamins.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Celiac Disease Test?**\n\nMost people with celiac disease will feel better if they avoid foods and products with gluten. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. Eating a gluten-free diet usually helps heals damage in the small intestine and prevents more damage.

The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems.\n\n**What causes celiac disease?**\n\nThe exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease.\n\n**Who is more likely to develop celiac disease?**\n\nCeliac disease is more common if you:\n\n* Have a family member who has the disease\n* Have Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Williams syndrome\n* Are White\n* Are female\n\n**What are the symptoms of celiac disease?**\n\nThe symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms.\n\nSome of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include:\n\n* Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly)\n* Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop)\n* Constipation\n* Gas\n* Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Pain in the abdomen (belly)\n* Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children\n\nSome people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Depression and anxiety\n* Irritability (in children)\n* Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults)\n* Bone or joint pain\n* Symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouth\n\n**What other problems can celiac disease cause?**\n\nOver time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include:\n\n* Malnutrition\n* Anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia\n* Bone loss\n* Nervous system problems such as headaches, balance problems, or peripheral neuropathy\n* Reproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and women\n\n**How is celiac disease diagnosed?**\n\nIf you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam.\n\nIf your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy.\n\n**What are the treatments for celiac disease?**\n\nThe treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage.\n\nYour provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list.

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, or rye, may also be present in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease consumes gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine's lining, impairing nutrient absorption.\n\n**Following a Gluten-Free Diet**\n\nTo maintain a healthy gluten-free diet, one must avoid all foods, drinks, and medications containing gluten. This includes eliminating items made with barley, rye, and wheat, as well as those containing all-purpose, white, or wheat flour.\n\n**Foods You Can Eat**\n\n*   Beans\n*   Cereals made without wheat or barley malt\n*   Corn\n*   Fruits and vegetables\n*   Meat, poultry, and fish (excluding breaded or regular gravy-coated options)\n*   Milk-based items\n*   Gluten-free oats\n*   Potatoes\n*   Rice\n*   Gluten-free products like crackers, pasta, and breads\n\n**Common Sources of Gluten**\n\n*   Breaded foods\n*   Breads, bagels, croissants, and buns\n*   Cakes, donuts, and pies\n*   Most cereals\n*   Crackers and many store-bought snacks, such as potato chips and tortilla chips\n*   Gravy\n*   Pancakes and waffles\n*   Pasta and pizza (except for gluten-free options)\n*   Soups (most)\n*   Stuffing\n\n**Less Obvious Foods Containing Gluten**\n\n*   Beer\n*   Some candies\n*   Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami, or sausage\n*   Communion breads\n*   Croutons\n*   Certain marinades, sauces, soy, and teriyaki sauces\n*   Salad dressings (some)\n*   Self-basting turkey\n\n**Cross-Contamination Risk**\n\nNaturally gluten-free foods may become contaminated if produced on the same line or stored with gluten-containing products. This highlights the importance of reading labels and planning ahead when eating out or socializing.\n\n**Maintaining a Healthy Gluten-Free Diet**\n\nWith education and planning, maintaining a balanced gluten-free diet is possible. Consider consulting a registered dietitian specializing in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet to help plan your diet. Joining a local support group can also provide practical advice on ingredients, baking, and coping with this life-altering condition.\n\nYour healthcare provider may recommend taking a multivitamin and mineral or individual nutrient supplement to correct or prevent deficiencies.\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease - Nutritional Considerations**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Celiac Disease?**\n\nCeliac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.

This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Following a Gluten-Free Diet**\n\nCarefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease. To follow a gluten-free diet means avoiding all foods, drinks, and medicines made with gluten.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nFOODS YOU CAN EAT:\n\n*   Beans\n*   Cereals made without wheat or barley malt\n*   Corn\n*   Fruits and vegetables\n*   Meat, poultry, and fish (not breaded or made with regular gravies)\n*   Milk-based items\n*   Gluten-free oats\n*   Potatoes\n*   Rice\n*   Gluten-free products such as crackers, pasta, and breads\n\nCommon sources of gluten include:\n\n*   Breaded foods\n*   Breads, bagels, croissants, and buns\n*   Cakes, donuts, and pies\n*   Cereals (most)\n*   Crackers and many snacks bought at the store, such as potato chips and tortilla chips\n*   Gravy\n*   Pancakes and waffles\n*   Pasta and pizza (other than gluten-free pasta and pizza crust)\n*   Soups (most)\n*   Stuffing\n\nLess obvious foods that must be eliminated if they contain gluten include:\n\n*   Beer\n*   Candies (some)\n*   Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami or sausage\n*   Communion breads\n*   Croutons\n*   Some marinades, sauces, soy, and teriyaki sauces\n*   Salad dressings (some)\n*   Self-basting turkey\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cross-Contamination**\n\nThere is a risk for cross-contamination of foods. Items that are naturally gluten-free may become contaminated if they are made on the same production line, or moved together in the same place, as foods containing gluten.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Eating Out and Social Gatherings**\n\nEating at restaurants, work, school, and social gatherings can be challenging. Call ahead and plan. Due to the widespread use of wheat and barley in foods, it is important to read labels before buying food or eating.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Maintaining a Healthy Gluten-Free Diet**\n\nDespite its challenges, maintaining a healthy, balanced gluten-free diet is possible with education and planning.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTalk to a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet to help you plan your diet. This is especially helpful because gluten contamination can happen even if a restaurant or label assures you a product is gluten-free. A dietician can help recommend products that will be safe.\n\nYou may also want to join a local support group. These groups can help people with celiac disease share practical advice on ingredients, baking, and ways to cope with this life-altering, lifelong disease.\n\nYour health care provider might suggest you take a multivitamin and mineral or an individual nutrient supplement to correct or prevent a deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease - Nutritional Considerations**\n\nIf you have celiac disease, your health care provider might suggest you take a multivitamin and mineral or an individual nutrient supplement to correct or prevent a deficiency.\n\n*   Talk to a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet to help you plan your diet.

    "content": "**Celiac Disease – Sprue**\n\n_Causes_\n\nThe exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients.\n\nWhen people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number of symptoms and other health problems.\n\nThe disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.\n\nPeople who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools.\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms include:\n\n* Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion\n* Constipation\n* Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged)\n* Diarrhea, either constant or off and on\n* Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment)\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed\n* Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight)\n\nOther problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb key nutrients include:\n\n* Easy bruising\n* Depression or anxiety\n* Fatigue\n* Growth delay in children\n* Hair loss\n* Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)\n* Missed menstrual periods\n* Mouth ulcers\n* Muscle cramps and joint pain\n* Nosebleeds\n* Seizures\n* Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet\n* Unexplained short height\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests may be performed:\n\n* Bone density\n* Cholesterol (may be low)\n* Complete blood count (CBC - test for anemia)\n* Comprehensive metabolic panel\n* Folate level (serum)\n* Iron level (serum)\n* Ferritin level (serum)\n* Prothrombin time\n* Vitamin B12 level (serum)\n* Vitamin D level (serum)\n\nBlood tests can detect antibodies, called antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) which may help detect the condition. The health care provider will order these antibody tests if celiac disease is suspected.\n\nIf the tests are positive, upper endoscopy is often performed to sample a piece of tissue (biopsy) from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). The biopsy may show a flattening or loss of the villi in the parts of the intestine affected in the duodenum.\n\nGenetic testing of the blood can also be done to help detect who may be at risk for celiac disease. Those who test negative for the common genetic variant are unlikely to have celiac disease.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCeliac disease cannot be cured. Your symptoms will go away and the villi in the intestines will heal if you follow a lifelong gluten-free diet. Do not eat foods, drink beverages, or take medicines that contain wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats.\n\nYou must read food and drug labels carefully to look for ingredients that may include these grains. It may be hard to stick to a gluten-free diet because wheat and barley grains are common in the American diet. Over time, most people are able to adapt and get better. You should NOT begin the gluten-free diet before you are diagnosed. Starting the diet will affect testing for the disease.\n\nIn most cases, following a well-balanced, gluten-free diet is the only treatment you need to stay well. Your provider may need to prescribe vitamin and mineral supplements.\n\nSometimes, short-term use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be needed if celiac disease does not respond to treatment.\n\nWhen you are diagnosed, get help from a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet. A support group may also help you cope with the disease and diet.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group. More information and support for people with celiac disease and their families can be found at the National Celiac Association.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFollowing a gluten-free diet heals the damage to the intestines and prevents further damage. This healing most often occurs within 3 to 6 months in children. Recovery may take 2 to 3 years in adults.\n\nRarely, long-term damage will be done to the lining of the intestines before the diagnosis is made.\n\nSome problems caused by celiac disease may not improve, such as a short height and damage to the teeth.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou must carefully continue to follow the gluten-free diet. When untreated, the disease can cause fatal complications.\n\nDelaying diagnosis or not following the diet puts you at risk for related conditions such as:\n\n* Autoimmune disorders\n* Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fractures)\n* Certain types of intestinal cancer\n* Low blood count (anemia)\n* Infertility or repeated miscarriage\n* Liver disease\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of celiac disease.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause the exact cause is not known, there is no way to prevent the development of celiac disease. However, you should be aware of the risk factors such as family history. This may increase your chances of early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease – Sprue**\n\n_Causes_\n\nThe exact cause of celiac disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition that damages the lining of the small intestine. This damage comes from a reaction to eating gluten, a substance found in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nThe symptoms of celiac disease can vary from person to person and may include:\n\n* Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion\n* Constipation\n* Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged)\n* Diarrhea, either constant or off and on\n* Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment)\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed\n* Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight)\n\n_Other Problems_\n\nIf left untreated, celiac disease can lead to other health problems, including:\n\n* Easy bruising\n* Depression or anxiety\n* Fatigue\n* Growth delay in children\n* Hair loss\n* Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)\n* Missed menstrual periods\n* Mouth ulcers\n* Muscle cramps and joint pain\n* Nosebleeds\n* Seizures\n* Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet\n* Unexplained short height\n\n_Diagnosis_\n\nThe diagnosis of celiac disease is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* Medical history and physical examination\n* Blood tests to detect antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTGA) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA)\n* Upper endoscopy with biopsy to examine the lining of the small intestine\n\n_Treatment_\n\nThe only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. This means avoiding foods, drinks, and medications that contain wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats. With proper treatment, most people are able to adapt and get better over time.\n\n_Support Groups_\n\nJoining a support group can help ease the stress of living with celiac disease. The National Celiac Association provides resources and support for people with celiac disease and their families.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nFollowing a gluten-free diet heals the damage to the intestines and prevents further damage. This healing most often occurs within 3 to 6 months in children, but may take 2 to 3 years in adults.\n\n_Rare Complications_\n\nIf left untreated, celiac disease can lead to rare but potentially fatal complications, including:\n\n* Autoimmune disorders\n* Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fractures)\n* Certain types of intestinal cancer\n* Low blood count (anemia)\n* Infertility or repeated miscarriage\n* Liver disease\n\n_Prevention_\n\nBecause the exact cause is not known, there is no way to prevent the development of celiac disease.

It is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Celiac Disease**\n\nCeliac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Celiac Disease**\n\nThe classic symptoms of celiac disease result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. These symptoms include:\n\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Poor absorption of nutrients\n*   Weight loss\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Swelling (distention)\n*   Food intolerances\n\nInflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Health Problems Associated with Celiac Disease**\n\nInflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include:\n\n*   Iron deficiency (anemia)\n*   Vitamin deficiencies\n*   Low bone mineral density (osteoporosis)\n*   Itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis)\n*   Defects in the enamel of the teeth\n*   Chronic fatigue\n*   Joint pain\n*   Poor growth\n*   Delayed puberty\n*   Infertility\n*   Repeated miscarriages\n\nNeurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Celiac Disease**\n\nThere are three types of celiac disease:\n\n*   Classic celiac disease: This is the most common form of the condition and is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms.\n*   Nonclassic celiac disease: This form of the condition is characterized by varied health problems but no gastrointestinal symptoms. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.\n*   Silent celiac disease: This is a type of celiac disease in which there are no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease and inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis of Celiac Disease**\n\nCeliac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Celiac Disease**\n\nThe treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. This can help to manage the symptoms of the condition and prevent complications. In some cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease**\n\n**What is Celiac Disease?**\n\nCeliac disease is a condition where the immune system reacts abnormally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley.

This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing T-cell lymphoma.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCeliac disease is a common disorder, affecting about 1 in 100 people worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system.\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**The Risk of Developing Celiac Disease**\n\nCertain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes increase the risk of developing celiac disease. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system.\n\n**How the Immune System Works**\n\nThe HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQαβ heterodimer.\n\n**Celiac Disease and the Immune System**\n\nCeliac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nCeliac disease tends to cluster in families. Parents, siblings, or children (first-degree relatives) of people with celiac disease have between a 4 and 15 percent chance of developing the disorder. However, the inheritance pattern is unknown.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Celiac sprue\n* Gluten enteropathy\n* Sprue\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Celiac disease\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CELIAC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; CELIAC1\n\n---\n\n**Celiac Disease**\n\n**What is Celiac Disease?**\n\nCeliac disease is a genetic disorder that affects the small intestine and is caused by an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease is characterized by malabsorption of nutrients, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.\n\n**Genetics of Celiac Disease**\n\nCeliac disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. The disease is associated with certain genetic variants, including HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These variants increase the risk of developing celiac disease, but not everyone with these variants will develop the condition.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   CELIAC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; CELIAC1\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Celiac disease\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide more information on celiac disease:\n\n1.

The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Prognosis of a Genetic Condition**\n\nThe prognosis of a genetic condition depends on various factors, including the severity of the condition, the presence of any complications, and the effectiveness of treatment. In the case of celiac disease, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n**Gene Variants and Health**\n\nGene variants can affect health and development in several ways. Some gene variants may increase the risk of developing certain diseases, while others may provide protection against specific conditions. Additionally, gene variants can influence an individual's response to environmental factors, such as diet or exposure to toxins.\n\n**Disorders That Seem to Run in Families**\n\nIf a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component to the condition. In the case of celiac disease, a family history of the condition can increase an individual's risk of developing it.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns of Genetic Conditions**\n\nGenetic conditions can be inherited in various patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive. The inheritance pattern of a genetic condition depends on the specific genes involved and how they are passed down through generations.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Genetic Conditions**\n\nThe treatment and management of genetic conditions depend on the specific condition being treated. In the case of celiac disease, treatment typically involves a strict gluten-free diet to manage symptoms and prevent complications.",

This may reveal:\n    *   Redness, warmth, tenderness, and swelling of the skin\n    *   Possible drainage, if there is a buildup of pus (abscess) with the skin infection\n    *   Swollen glands (lymph nodes) near the affected area\n\n    Your provider may mark the edges of the redness with a pen, to see if the redness goes past the marked border over the next several days.\n\n    Tests that may be ordered include:\n\n    *   Blood culture\n    *   Complete blood count (CBC)\n    *   Culture of any fluid or material inside the affected area\n    *   A biopsy may be done if other conditions are suspected\n\n---\n\n**Cellulitis**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou will likely be prescribed antibiotics to be taken by mouth. You may be given pain medicine as well, if needed.\n\nAt home, raise the infected area higher than your heart to reduce swelling and speed up healing. Rest until your symptoms improve.\n\nYou may need to stay in a hospital if:\n\n* You are very sick (for example, you have a very high temperature, low blood pressure, or nausea and vomiting that does not go away)\n* You have been on antibiotics and the infection is getting worse (spreading beyond the original pen marking)\n* Your immune system is not working well (due to cancer, HIV, or other medical condition)\n* You have an infection around your eyes\n* You require antibiotics through a vein (IV)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCellulitis usually goes away after taking antibiotics for 7 to 10 days. Longer treatment may be needed if cellulitis is more severe. This may occur if you have a chronic disease or your immune system is not working properly.\n\nPeople with fungal infections of the feet may have cellulitis that keeps coming back, especially if you have diabetes. Cracks in the skin from the fungal infection allow the bacteria to get into the skin.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe following may result if cellulitis isn't treated or treatment doesn't work:\n\n* Blood infection (sepsis)\n* Bone infection (osteomyelitis)\n* Inflammation of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis)\n* Inflammation of the heart (endocarditis)\n* Infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n* Shock\n* Tissue death (gangrene)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall your provider right away if:\n\n* You have symptoms of cellulitis\n* You are being treated for cellulitis and you develop new symptoms, such as persistent fever, drowsiness, lethargy, blistering over the cellulitis, or red streaks that spread\n\n**Prevention**\n\nProtect your skin by:\n\n* Keeping your skin moist with lotions or ointments to prevent cracking\n* Wearing shoes that fit well and provide enough room for your feet\n* Learning how to trim your nails to avoid harming the skin around them\n* Wearing appropriate protective equipment when participating in work or sports\n\nWhenever you have a break in the skin:\n\n* Clean the break carefully with soap and water. Apply petroleum jelly every day.\n* Cover with a bandage and change it every day.\n* Watch for redness, pain, drainage, or other signs of infection.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSkin infection - bacterial; Group A streptococcus - cellulitis; Staphylococcus - cellulitis\n\n---\n\n**Cellulitis and Erysipelas**\n\n\\n\\nIn: Lebwohl MG, Heymann WR, Coulson IH, Murrell DF, eds.

    "content": "**Cenobamate**\n\n*pronounced as (sen\" oh bam' ate)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCenobamate is used alone or with other medications to treat certain types of partial onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain) in adults. Cenobamate is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCenobamate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily with or without food. Take cenobamate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cenobamate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are unable to swallow the tablet whole, you may crush the tablet and mix with water to take either by mouth or give through a nasogastric tube. Place the crushed tablet in 25 mL water in a cup and then swirl the cup to combine the mixture. Then either drink the suspension or pull the mixture up into a syringe and place in the nasogastric tube. If giving by mouth, add 25 mL more water to the cup used to create the mixture then swirl around and drink again to make sure all of the crushed tablet is given. If more tablet pieces are left, repeat the last step. If giving through the nasogastric tube, add 10 mL more water to the syringe used to place in the nasogastric tube and place in the nasogastric tube again. Once the crushed tablet is mixed with water, it should be administered right away. Do not store for later use.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of cenobamate and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks.\n\nCenobamate may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nCenobamate may help control your condition, but it does not cure it. Do not stop taking cenobamate without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking cenobamate, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n---\n\n**Cenobamate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    *   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n    *   Before taking cenobamate, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cenobamate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in cenobamate tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n    *   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cenobamate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n    *   You should know that cenobamate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, or implants). Talk to your doctor about methods of birth control that will work for you while taking cenobamate.\n    *   Tell your doctor if you have familial short QT syndrome (an inherited condition that causes irregular heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, or sudden death).

Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or participate in activities requiring alertness or coordination until you know how this medication affects you.\n    *   Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking cenobamate. Alcohol can make the side effects from cenobamate worse.\n    *   You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking cenobamate. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants like cenobamate to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication.\n*   **What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n    *   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n*   **What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n    *   If you forget to take cenobamate, call your doctor for advice.\n\n---\n\n**Cenobamate: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

DI is a different disease than diabetes, though both share common symptoms of excessive urination and thirst.\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus is a form of DI that occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. ADH is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain.\n\nADH controls the amount of water excreted in urine. Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. This results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (10 to 15 liters a day).\n\nThe reduced level of ADH may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. This damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation, tumor, or injury to the brain.\n\nIn rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Increased urine production\n* Excessive thirst\n* Confusion and changes in alertness due to dehydration and higher than normal sodium level in the body, if the person is unable to drink\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will ask about your medical history and symptoms.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Blood sodium and osmolarity\n* Desmopressin (DDAVP) challenge\n* MRI of the head\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine concentration and osmolarity\n* Urine output\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe cause of the underlying condition will be treated.\n\nVasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP) is given either as a nasal spray, tablets, or injections.

This is the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The fluid leaks from the blood vessel layer under the retina. This layer is called the choroid.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of this condition is unknown.\n\nMen are affected more often than women, and the condition is most common at around age 45.

Rarely, people develop permanent scars that damage their central vision.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nA small number of people will have complications from laser treatment that impair their central vision. That is why most people will be allowed to recover without treatment, if possible.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if your vision gets worse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention.

    "content": "**Central Sleep Apnea**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCentral sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that cause breathing. The condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems, such as:\n\n* Problems that affect the brainstem, including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)\n* Certain medicines, such as narcotic painkillers\n* Being at high altitude\n\nIf the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.\n\n_A Condition Called Cheyne-Stokes Respiration_\n\nA condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can affect people with severe heart failure and can be associated with central sleep apnea. The breathing pattern involves alternating deep and heavy breathing with shallow, or even not breathing, usually while sleeping.\n\n_Distinguishing From Obstructive Sleep Apnea_\n\nCentral sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. Central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea can be present in the same person.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nPeople with central sleep apnea have episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep. Other symptoms may include:\n\n* Chronic fatigue\n* Daytime sleepiness\n* Morning headaches\n* Restless sleep\n\nOther symptoms may occur if the apnea is due to a problem with the nervous system, such as:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Swallowing problems\n* Voice changes\n* Weakness or numbness throughout the body\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests will be done to diagnose an underlying medical condition. A sleep study (polysomnography) can confirm sleep apnea.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n* Echocardiogram\n* Lung function testing\n* MRI of the brain, spine, or neck\n* Blood tests, such as arterial blood gas levels\n\n_Treatment_\n\nTreating the condition that is causing central sleep apnea can help manage symptoms. For example, if central sleep apnea is due to heart failure, the goal is to treat the heart failure itself.\n\nDevices used during sleep to aid breathing may be recommended, including:\n\n* Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n* Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)\n\nSome types of central sleep apnea are treated with medicines that stimulate breathing. Oxygen treatment may help ensure the lungs get enough oxygen while sleeping.\n\nIf narcotic medicine is causing the apnea, the dosage may need to be lowered or the medicine changed.\n\n_The FDA Has Approved A Medical Device To Treat Central Sleep Apnea_\n\nThe device is implanted in the chest. When a breathing pause is detected, the device stimulates the nerve that controls the breathing muscles so that you will breathe.\n\n_Outlook (Prognosis)_\n\nHow well you do depends on the medical condition causing central sleep apnea.
