    "content": "**Eprosartan**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEprosartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Eprosartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEprosartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take eprosartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take eprosartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nEprosartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 2 to 3 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of eprosartan. Continue to take eprosartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking eprosartan without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nEprosartan is also used sometimes to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body) and diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease in people with diabetes and high blood pressure). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Eprosartan: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n*   **Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking eprosartan, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to eprosartan, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in eprosartan tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor if you have diabetes (high blood sugar) and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take eprosartan if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking eprosartan. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with eprosartan: aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); potassium supplements. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking eprosartan. Do not start any of these medications while taking eprosartan without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart failure or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.\n\nYou should know that eprosartan may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking eprosartan. To help avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n\nYou should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting. Tell your doctor if you have any of these problems or develop them during your treatment.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nDo not use salt substitutes containing potassium without talking to your doctor. If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nEprosartan may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   Excessive tiredness\n*   Stomach pain\n*   Joint pain\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, or those listed in the SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS section, call your doctor immediately:\n\n*   Swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Difficulty breathing or swallowing\n\nEprosartan may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n---\n\n**Eprosartan: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n* swelling of your feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n\nIf you experience any unusual problems while taking this medication, call your doctor.\n\nIn case of a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\nKeep this medication in its original container, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way that prevents pets, children, and other people from taking them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program or talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community.\n\nVisit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIf you overdose on eprosartan, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.\n\n**What to Know**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and laboratory. Your blood pressure should be checked regularly to determine your response to eprosartan.\n\nDo not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.\n\nKeep a written list of all the prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking.

    "content": "**Epstein-Barr Virus Antibody Test**\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus antibody test is a blood test used to detect antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A blood sample is needed.\n*   The sample is sent to a lab, where a lab specialist looks for antibodies to the EBV.\n*   In the first stages of an illness, little or no antibody may be detected. For this reason, the test is often repeated in 10 days to 2 or more weeks.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising, which soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done to detect an infection with the EBV. EBV causes mononucleosis or mono. The EBV antibody test detects not only a recent infection but also one that occurred in the past. It can be used to tell the difference between a recent or previous infection.\n\nAnother test for mononucleosis is called the Monospot test, which is often done when a person has current symptoms of mononucleosis.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means no antibodies to EBV were seen in your blood sample. This result means you have never been infected with EBV.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your healthcare provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive result means there are antibodies to EBV in your blood, indicating a current or prior infection with EBV.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Epstein-Barr Virus Antibody Test**\n\n**What is the Epstein-Barr virus antibody test?**\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody test detects the presence of antibodies to EBV in your blood.

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising, which soon goes away.\n\n**Why is the EBV antibody test performed?**\n\nThe test is done to detect an infection with EBV. EBV causes mononucleosis or mono, and this test can help determine if you have a current or past infection.\n\n**What are the risks associated with the test?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. However, there may be some slight risks, including excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, multiple punctures to locate veins, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken).\n\n**What are the alternative names for this test?**\n\nEBV antibody test; EBV serology; Mono test\n\n**References:**\n\nJohannsen EC, Kaye KM.

EBV is a type of herpesvirus that infects humans and remains in the body for life.\n\n\\n\\n**How does the test work?**\n\nThe test detects the presence of antibodies against EBV in the blood. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight off infections. In people with infectious mononucleosis, the immune system produces antibodies against EBV as a response to the infection.\n\n\\n\\n**What do the results mean?**\n\n*   A positive result indicates that you have been infected with EBV and may be experiencing symptoms of infectious mononucleosis.\n*   A negative result suggests that you are not currently infected with EBV, but it does not rule out past infection or future exposure.\n\n\\n\\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Infectious Mononucleosis",

Treating the health problem may help improve your erections.\n\n**Morning Erections and Physical Causes**\n\nIf you have an erection in the morning, it can mean there is no physical cause for ED.\n\nA. True\nB. False\n\nCorrect Answer: **True**\n\nHaving 3 to 5 erections at night also may mean you don't have a physical problem. Even so, it's a good idea to talk with your doctor. An erection problem that does not go away can make you feel bad about yourself. It can also harm your relationship with your partner. In most cases, treatment can help.\n\n**Other Factors That Can Lead to ED**\n\nDepression, anxiety, feelings of doubt or anger, not communicating well with your partner, expecting too much from sex - all of these factors can lead to ED.\n\nA. Depression\nB. Anxiety\nC. Feelings of doubt or anger\nD. Not communicating well with your partner\nE. Expecting too much from sex\nF. All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: **All of the above**\n\nFeeling depressed, anxious, or out of touch with your partner can lead to ED. Make time to relax and talk openly with your partner about sex. Counseling may help. See your doctor if you have signs of depression or anxiety.\n\n**Habits That Can Make ED Worse**\n\nSmoking, drinking alcohol, using illegal drugs - all of these habits can make ED worse.\n\nA. Smoking\nB. Drinking alcohol\nC. Using illegal drugs\nD. All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: **All of the above**\n\nSmoking and smokeless tobacco can cause blood vessels all over the body to become narrow. This may keep blood from getting to the penis. Drinking alcohol or taking drugs such as cocaine also can cause erection problems. Talk with your doctor about how to quit.\n\n**Medicines That Could Cause ED**\n\nSome medicines for depression, some heart medicines, some medicines to treat ulcers, sleeping pills - all of these types of medicine could cause ED.\n\nA. Some medicines for depression\nB. Some heart medicines\nC. Some medicines to treat ulcers\nD. Sleeping pills\nE. All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: **All of the above**\n\nAsk your doctor if any of the medicines you take could be causing ED.

Regular exercise\nB. Healthy diet\nC. Getting enough sleep\nD. Reduced stress\nE. All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: **All of the above**\n\nThe same things that help you stay mentally and physically healthy can improve ED. Talk with your doctor about how to make healthy changes in your life.\n\n**Prescription Pills for ED**\n\nPrescription pills for ED will work only when you are sexually aroused.\n\nA. Myth\nB. Fact\n\nCorrect Answer: **Fact**\n\nSildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), avanafil (Stendra), and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) are prescription pills that treat ED. These medicines help make erections firmer and last longer, but only when you are sexually aroused. They take effect within 15 - 45 minutes and may last for several hours or longer.\n\n---\n\n**Erectile Dysfunction Quiz: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Content:**\n\n*   Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), avanafil (Stendra), and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) are prescription pills that treat ED. These medicines help make erections firmer and last longer, but only when you are sexually aroused. They take effect within 15 - 45 minutes and may last for several hours or longer.\n*   You should NOT take ED pills if you also take nitrates for heart disease.\n    *   The correct answer is true. Men who take nitroglycerin or nitrates for heart disease should not take pills for ED. Taking both together can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure. This can cause death. ED pills also may not be safe for men with certain health problems. Your doctor can help you decide if these pills are safe for you.\n*   Testosterone therapy can improve erections in some men.\n    *   The correct answer is fact. Low testosterone can cause erection problems and a loss of interest in sex. Testosterone therapy can help treat ED and low sex drive. Talk with your doctor if you have lost all interest in sex, notice mood changes, or have swollen breasts. These may be signs of low testosterone.\n*   When medicine doesn't work, other treatments for ED include:\n    *   The correct answer is all of the above. A vacuum device pulls blood into the penis and causes an erection. Penis implants are placed in the penis during surgery. They cause the penis to become erect. You can also have medicine injected into your penis. This may work better than ED pills. Talk to your doctor about your options to treat ED.\n*   Herbal supplements help treat ED.\n    *   The correct answer is false. Many herbs and supplements are marketed to help improve desire for sex or the ability to have sex. However, supplements have not been proven to work, and they may not always be safe. Always talk with your doctor before taking any supplements or herbal remedies.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics:**\n\n*   Erectile Dysfunction\n*   Erection problems",

Are you stressed, depressed, or anxious?\n*   Are you having relationship problems?\n\nYou may have a number of different tests to help find the cause, such as:\n\n*   Urinalysis or blood tests to check for health conditions such as diabetes, heart problems, or low testosterone\n*   A device you wear at night to check for normal nighttime erections\n*   Ultrasound of your penis to check for blood flow problems\n*   Rigidity monitoring to test how strong your erection is\n*   Psychological questionnaires to check for depression and other emotional problems\n\n---\n\n**Erection Problems**\n\n\\n\\nAn erection problem occurs when a man cannot get or keep an erection that is firm enough for intercourse.

Below are some common physical causes.\n\n* Disease:\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ High blood pressure\n\t+ Heart or thyroid conditions\n\t+ Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis)\n\t+ Depression\n\t+ Nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease\n* Medicines:\n\t+ Antidepressants\n\t+ Blood pressure medicines (especially beta-blockers)\n\t+ Heart medicines, such as digoxin\n\t+ Sleeping pills\n\t+ Some peptic ulcer medicines\n* Other physical causes:\n\t+ Low testosterone levels. This can make it difficult to get an erection. It can also reduce a man's sex drive.\n\t+ Nerve damage from prostate surgery.\n\t+ Nicotine, alcohol, or cocaine use.\n\t+ Spinal cord injury.\n\nIn some cases, your emotions or relationship problems can lead to ED, such as:\n\n* Poor communication with your partner.\n* Feelings of doubt and failure.\n* Stress, fear, anxiety, or anger.\n* Expecting too much from sex. This can make sex a task instead of a pleasure.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Trouble getting an erection\n* Trouble keeping an erection\n* Having an erection that is not firm enough for intercourse\n* Less interest in sex\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam, which may include:\n\n* Taking your blood pressure\n* Examining your penis and rectum to check for problems\n\nYour provider will also ask questions to help find the cause, such as:\n\n* Have you been able to get and keep erections in the past?\n* Are you having trouble getting an erection or keeping erections?\n* Do you have erections during sleep or in the morning?\n* How long have you had trouble with erections?\n\nYour provider will also ask about your lifestyle:\n\n* Are you taking any medicines, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements?\n* Do you drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs?\n* What is your state of mind? Are you stressed, depressed, or anxious?\n* Are you having relationship problems?\n\nYou may have a number of different tests to help find the cause, such as:\n\n* Urinalysis or blood tests to check for health conditions such as diabetes, heart problems, or low testosterone\n* A device you wear at night to check for normal nighttime erections\n* Ultrasound of your penis to check for blood flow problems\n* Rigidity monitoring to test how strong your erection is\n* Psychological questionnaires to check for depression and other emotional problems\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment may depend on what is causing the problem and how healthy you are. Your provider can talk with you about the best treatment for you.\n\nFor many men, lifestyle changes can help. These include:\n\n* Getting exercise\n* Eating a healthy diet\n* Losing extra weight\n* Sleeping well\n\nIf you and your partner have trouble talking about your relationship, it may cause problems with sex. Counseling can help both you and your partner.\n\nLifestyle changes alone may not be enough. There are many treatment options.\n\nPills you take by mouth, such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), avanafil (Stendra), and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis). They work only when you are sexually aroused. They usually start to work in 15 to 45 minutes.\nMedicine inserted into the urethra or injected into the penis to improve blood flow. Very small needles are used and cause minimal pain.\nSurgery to place implants in the penis. The implants may be inflatable or semi-rigid.\nA vacuum device. This is used to pull blood into the penis. A special rubber band is then used to keep the erection during intercourse.\nTestosterone replacement if your testosterone level is low. This comes in skin patches, gel, or injections into the muscle.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMany men overcome erection problems with lifestyle changes, treatment, or both. For more severe cases, you and your partner may have to adjust to how ED affects your sex life. Even with treatment, counseling can help you and your partner overcome the stress ED may put on your relationship.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Complications**\n\nAn erection problem that does not go away can make you feel bad about yourself. It can also harm your relationship with your partner. ED may be a sign of health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. So if you have an erection problem, do not wait to seek help.\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* The problem does not go away with lifestyle changes\n* The problem begins after an injury or prostate surgery\n* You have other symptoms, such as low back pain, abdominal pain, or a change in urination\n\nIf you think any medicine you are taking may be causing erection problems, talk with your provider. You may need to lower the dose or change to another drug. Do not change or stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Erection Problems**\n\nAn erection problem occurs when a man cannot get or keep an erection that is firm enough for intercourse. You may not be able to get an erection at all. Or, you may lose the erection during intercourse before you are ready. Erection problems do not usually affect your sex drive.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTo get an erection, your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels all need to work together.

Emotional causes are more common in younger men.\n\nIf you have erections in the morning or at night while you sleep, it is likely not a physical cause.

Erenumab-aooe injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of a certain natural substance in the body that causes migraine headaches.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nErenumab-aooe injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually given once a month. Use erenumab-aooe injection at around the same day every month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use erenumab-aooe injection exactly as directed.

Use each syringe or autoinjector only once and inject all the solution in the syringe. Dispose of used syringes and autoinjector in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\nInject erenumab-aooe injection into thigh or stomach area. If someone else will be injecting the medication for you, that person can also inject it into your upper arm. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, thick, bruised, red, scaly, hard, or has scars or stretch marks.\n\nAlways look at erenumab-aooe before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use erenumab-aooe injection, if it is colored, cloudy, or contains flakes or solid particles. Do not shake it.\n\nIf your doctor tells you to inject two separate injections one after another, use a different autoinjector or syringe for each injection. If you use the same body site (upper arm, thigh, or stomach) for the two separate injections, make sure the second injection is not at the exact same spot you used for the first injection.\n\nErenumab-aooe injection helps to prevent migraines but does not cure them. Continue to inject erenumab-aooe injection even if you feel well.

This type of bacteria may be found in fish, birds, mammals, and shellfish. Erysipeloid usually affects people who work with these animals (such as farmers, butchers, cooks, grocers, fishermen, or veterinarians). Infection results when the bacteria enters the skin through small breaks.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may develop in 2 to 7 days after bacteria enter the skin. Usually, the fingers and hands are affected. But any exposed area of the body can get infected if there is a break in the skin. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Bright red skin in the infected area\n* Swelling of the area\n* Throbbing pain with itching or burning sensation\n* Fluid-filled blisters\n* Low fever if the infection spreads\n* Swollen lymph nodes (sometimes)\n\nThe infection may spread to other fingers. It usually doesn't spread past the wrist.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you. Your provider can often make the diagnosis by looking at the infected skin and by asking how your symptoms started.\n\nTests that may be done to confirm the diagnosis include:\n\n* Skin biopsy and culture to check for the bacteria\n* Blood tests to check for bacteria if the infection has spread\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics, especially penicillin, are very effective to treat this condition.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nErysipeloid may get better on its own.

The condition may appear in the first few hours of life, or it can appear after the first day. The condition can last for several days.\n\nAlthough erythema toxicum is harmless, it can be of great concern to the new parent. Its cause is unknown, but thought to be related to the immune system.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom is a rash of small, yellow-to-white-colored bumps (papules) surrounded by red skin. There may be a few or several papules. They are usually on the face and in the middle of the body. They can also be seen on the upper arms and thighs.\n\nThe rash can change rapidly, appearing and disappearing in different areas over hours to days.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour baby's health care provider can often make a diagnosis during a routine exam after birth. Testing is usually not needed. A skin scraping may be done if the diagnosis is not clear.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe large red splotches usually disappear without any treatment or changes in skin care.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe rash usually clears within 2 weeks.

    "content": "**Erythroblastosis Fetalis | Rh Incompatibility**\n\n**What is Rh Factor?**\n\nThere are four major blood types: A, B, O, and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Rh factor is inherited through genes.\n\n**How Does Rh Incompatibility Affect Pregnancy?**\n\nWhen you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance. It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.\n\nBut Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.\n\n**Preventing Rh Incompatibility**\n\nBlood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. If treatment is needed for the baby, it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Fetal-maternal erythrocyte distribution blood test (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Hemolytic disease of the newborn (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Hydrops fetalis (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Hydrops Fetalis/Erythroblastosis Fetalis (Children's Hospital and Health System, Inc.)\n*   Red Blood Cell Antibody Screen  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Rh Factor Blood Test (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n*   Rh Factor: How It Can Affect Your Pregnancy (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)\n*   Rh incompatibility (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Rh Incompatibility During Pregnancy (Nemours Foundation)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Erythroblastosis, Fetal  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n---\n\n**Erythroblastosis Fetalis | Rh Incompatibility**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Rh Incompatibility?**\n\nRh incompatibility occurs when a mother's immune system reacts to the Rh factor of her baby's blood, leading to the production of antibodies that can harm the baby. This condition can cause erythroblastosis fetalis, a serious disorder characterized by anemia and jaundice in newborns.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n*   Symptoms may include:\n    *   Anemia\n    *   Jaundice\n    *   Pale skin\n    *   Fatigue\n*   Diagnosis is typically made through prenatal testing or after birth\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\n*   Treatment options may include:\n    *   Intrauterine intravascular blood transfusion (IIT)\n    *   Exchange transfusions\n    *   Rh immune globulin (Rhogam) to prevent further antibody production\n*   Prevention involves identifying and managing Rh incompatibility early in pregnancy\n\n\\n\\n**Research and Resources**\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is the primary NIH organization for research on Rh Incompatibility.

    "content": "**Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**\n\n**What is an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)?**\n\nAn erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can show if you have inflammation in your body. Inflammation is your immune system's response to injury, infection, and many other conditions, including immune system disorders, certain cancers, and blood disorders.\n\n**To do an ESR test**\n\nA sample of your blood is sent to a lab. A health care professional places the sample in a tall, thin test tube and measures how quickly your red blood cells settle or sink to the bottom of the tube. Typically, red blood cells sink slowly. But inflammation makes red blood cells stick together in clumps. These clumps of cells are heavier than single cells, so they sink faster.\n\n**If an ESR test shows that your red blood cells sink faster than expected**\n\nIt may mean you have a medical condition causing inflammation. How quickly the red blood cells in your sample fall to the bottom of the test tube is a sign of how much inflammation you have. Faster ESR rates mean higher levels of inflammation. But an ESR test alone cannot diagnose which condition is causing the inflammation.\n\n**Other names**\n\nESR, SED rate sedimentation rate; Westergren sedimentation rate\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn ESR test can be used with other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions that cause inflammation. Many conditions cause inflammation, including arthritis, vasculitis, infections, and inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). An ESR may also be used to monitor an existing condition.\n\n**Why do I need an ESR?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ESR if you have symptoms of a condition that causes inflammation. Your symptoms will depend on the condition you may have, but they may include:\n\n* Headaches\n* Unexplained fever\n* Unexplained weight loss\n* Joint stiffness\n* Neck or shoulder pain\n* Loss of appetite\n* Anemia\n\n**What happens during an ESR?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for an ESR?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for this test. But if your provider ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having an ESR. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour provider will use your ESR test results, medical history, symptoms, and other test results to make a diagnosis. An ESR test alone cannot diagnose conditions that cause inflammation.\n\nA high ESR test result means your red blood cells sank faster than normal. This may be from a condition that causes inflammation, such as:\n\n* Giant cell arteritis, inflammation (swelling) of your arteries, usually in your scalp, neck, and arms\n* Arthritis\n* Systemic vasculitis, inflammation of your blood vessel walls, which can affect any of your organs\n* Polymyalgia rheumatica\n* Inflammatory bowel disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Infections\n* Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases\n* Heart disease\n* Certain cancers\n\nA low ESR test result means your red blood cells sank slower than normal. This may be caused by conditions such as:\n\n* A blood disorder, such as:\n\t+ Polycythemia, an increase in your red blood cells, which causes your blood to thicken\n\t+ Sickle cell disease (SCD)\n\t+ Leukocytosis, a very high white blood cell count (WBC)\n* Heart failure\n* Certain kidney and liver problems\n\nIf your ESR results are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Normal ESR levels will vary, depending on your age and sex. Also, pregnancy, your menstrual cycle, aging, obesity, drinking alcohol regularly, and exercise can affect ESR results.  Certain medicines and supplements may also affect your results, so be sure to tell your provider about any medicines or supplements you are taking.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an ESR?**\n\nBecause an ESR can't diagnose a specific disease, your provider may order other tests at the same time. Also, it's possible to have a condition that causes inflammation and still have a normal ESR result. A C-reactive protein (CRP) test is commonly done with an ESR to provide more information.\n\n---\n\n**Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn ESR test can be used with other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions that cause inflammation.

It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.\n\nAntibiotics such as erythromycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nErythromycin comes as a capsule, tablet, delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule, delayed-release tablet, and an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken with or without food every 6 hours (four times a day), every 8 hours (three times a day), or every 12 hours (twice a day).\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take erythromycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nIf you are taking the suspension, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon, dropper, or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.\n\nSwallow the capsules and tablets whole with a full glass of water; do not chew or crush them.\n\nContinue to take erythromycin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking erythromycin without talking to your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nErythromycin is also used sometimes to prevent heart infection in people having dental or other procedures. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Erythromycin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**What is Erythromycin?**\n\nErythromycin is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.

    "content": "**Erythropoietin Test**\n\nThe erythropoietin test measures the amount of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) in blood. The hormone tells stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. EPO is made by cells in the kidney, and these cells release more EPO when the blood oxygen level is low.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be used to help determine the cause of anemia, polycythemia (high red blood cell count) or other bone marrow disorders. A change in red blood cells will affect the release of EPO. For example, people with anemia have too few red blood cells, so more EPO is produced.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 2.6 to 18.5 milliunits per milliliter (mU/mL).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIncreased EPO level may be due to secondary polycythemia. This is an overproduction of red blood cells that occurs in response to an event such as low blood oxygen level. The condition may occur at high altitudes or, rarely, because of a tumor that releases EPO.\n\nLower-than-normal EPO level may be seen in chronic kidney failure, anemia of chronic disease, or polycythemia vera.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum erythropoietin; EPO\n\n---\n\n**Erythropoietin Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe erythropoietin test measures the level of erythropoietin (EPO) in your blood.

    "content": "**Escitalopram**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEscitalopram is used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. It works by increasing the amount of certain natural substances in the brain, which helps improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take escitalopram or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects include dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, and tremor. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor right away: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore escitalopram at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\n\n\\n\\n* **Side Effects **\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as escitalopram during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so).\n\nChildren, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions.\n\nHowever, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 12 years of age should not normally take escitalopram, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that escitalopram is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\n\n\\n\\n* **Usage Information **\nEscitalopram comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take escitalopram, take it at around the same time every day, in the morning or in the evening.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take escitalopram exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of escitalopram and increase your dose after 1 week in adults and after 2 or 3 weeks in teenagers and children 7 years of age and older.\n\nIt may take 1 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of escitalopram. Continue to take escitalopram even if you feel well. Do not stop taking escitalopram without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\nIf you suddenly stop taking escitalopram, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes, irritability, agitation, nausea, dizziness, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet, anxiety, confusion, headache, sweating, shaking, frenzied or abnormally excited mood, tiredness, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\n---\n\n**Escitalopram: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **What is Escitalopram?**\n    Escitalopram is a medication used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.\n*   **How Do I Take Escitalopram?**\n    Take escitalopram exactly as directed by your doctor. The usual dose for adults is 10 mg once daily, with or without food. For teenagers and children aged 7 years and older, the initial dose is 7.5 mg once daily, which may be increased to 10 mg after 1 week.\n*   **What Should I Know Before Taking Escitalopram?**\n    Before taking escitalopram, inform your doctor if you have a history of allergies, particularly to citalopram (Celexa), or if you are taking MAO inhibitors like isocarboxazid (Marplan) or phenelzine (Nardil). Also, disclose any use of street drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, or bleeding problems.\n*   **What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n    Escitalopram may interact with certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen (Aleve), St. John's wort, or tryptophan. Inform your doctor about any nonprescription or herbal products you are taking.\n*   **What Should I Do If I Experience Withdrawal Symptoms?**\n    If you experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes, irritability, agitation, nausea, dizziness, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet, anxiety, confusion, headache, sweating, shaking, frenzied or abnormally excited mood, tiredness, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, consult your doctor. They will likely decrease your dose gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms.\n*   **What Should I Know About Escitalopram and Pregnancy?**\n    If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking escitalopram, inform your doctor. The medication may cause problems in newborns following delivery if taken during the last months of pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n**Important Information**\n\nIf you are taking escitalopram, be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking escitalopram.

    "content": "**Eslicarbazepine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEslicarbazepine is used in combination with other medications to control focal (partial) seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain). Eslicarbazepine is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEslicarbazepine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take eslicarbazepine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou can swallow the tablets whole or you can crush them.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of eslicarbazepine and increase your dose after 1 week. Your doctor may increase your dose again at least 1 week later if necessary to control your seizures.\n\nEslicarbazepine may help control your seizures but will not cure your condition. Continue to take eslicarbazepine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking eslicarbazepine without talking to your doctor even if you experience serious side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking eslicarbazepine, your seizures may happen more often or may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with eslicarbazepine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Continue to take eslicarbazepine even if you feel well.\n*   Do not stop taking eslicarbazepine without talking to your doctor even if you experience serious side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood.\n*   If you suddenly stop taking eslicarbazepine, your seizures may happen more often or may become worse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take only your regular dose. Do not take extra doses to make up for the forgotten one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of eslicarbazepine may include:\n\n*   Dizziness\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Fatigue\n*   Changes in behavior or mood (such as depression, anxiety, or irritability)\n*   Insomnia\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore eslicarbazepine at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking eslicarbazepine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver or kidney disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you are using hormonal contraceptives, you should know that this type of birth control may not work well when used with eslicarbazepine. You should not use hormonal contraceptives as your only method of birth control while you are taking eslicarbazepine. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If you become pregnant while taking eslicarbazepine, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that eslicarbazepine may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking eslicarbazepine for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as eslicarbazepine to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication.\n\nThere is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as eslicarbazepine, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication.\n\nYou, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood.\n\nBe sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nExpand Section\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n---\n\n**Eslicarbazepine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What should I do?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Prescription esomeprazole is used to treat damage from GERD in adults and children 1 month of age and older. Prescription esomeprazole is used to allow the esophagus to heal and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults with GERD. Prescription esomeprazole is also used to decrease the chance that people who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will develop ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) in adults. It is also used with other medications to treat and prevent the return of stomach ulcers caused by a certain type of bacteria (H. pylori) in adults. Prescription esomeprazole is also used to treat conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Nonprescription (over-the-counter) esomeprazole is used to treat frequent heartburn (heartburn that occurs at least 2 or more days a week) in adults.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nPrescription esomeprazole comes as a delayed-release capsule to take by mouth or to open, mix with water, and give through a feeding tube, and as packets of delayed-release granules for suspension (to be mixed with water) to take by mouth or give through a feeding tube. Nonprescription (over-the-counter) esomeprazole comes as a delayed-release capsule and tablet to take by mouth. Prescription esomeprazole is usually taken once a day at least 1 hour before a meal. When prescription esomeprazole is used to treat certain conditions in which the stomach makes too much acid, it is taken twice a day.\n\nTake esomeprazole at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take esomeprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor or stated on the package.\n\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you cannot swallow the capsule, put 1 tablespoon of cool, soft applesauce in an empty bowl. Open one esomeprazole capsule and carefully sprinkle the pellets onto the applesauce. Mix the pellets with the applesauce and swallow the entire tablespoonful of the applesauce and pellet mixture immediately. Do not crush or chew the pellets in the applesauce. Do not save the pellets and applesauce for later use.\n\nIf you are taking the granules for oral suspension, you will need to mix it with water before use. If you are using the 2.5- or 5-mg packet, place 1 teaspoonful (5 mL) of water in a container. If you are using the 10-, 20-, or 40-mg packet, place 1 tablespoonful (15 mL) of water in a container. Add the contents of the powder packet and stir. Wait 2 to 3 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken, and stir the mixture again. Drink the entire mixture within 30 minutes. If any of the mixture is stuck to the container, pour more water into the container, stir and drink all the mixture immediately.\n\nThe granules and the contents of the prescription delayed-release capsules can both be given through a feeding tube. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor or pharmacist how you should take the medication. Follow those directions carefully.\n\nDo not take nonprescription esomeprazole for immediate relief of heartburn symptoms. It may take 1 to 4 days for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 14 days or if your symptoms return sooner than 4 months after you finish your treatment.

    "content": "**Esophageal Atresia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Esophageal Atresia?**\n\nEsophageal atresia (EA) is a birth defect in which the esophagus does not develop properly. The esophagus is the tube that normally carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Esophageal Atresia**\n\nEsophageal atresia (EA) is a congenital defect, meaning it occurs before birth. There are several types of EA, and in most cases, the upper esophagus ends without connecting with the lower esophagus and stomach.\n\nMost infants with EA have another defect called tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea). Often, infants with EA/TEF also have tracheomalacia, which causes high-pitched or noisy breathing. At least half of babies with EA/TEF have other defects as well, most often heart defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Esophageal Atresia**\n\nSymptoms of EA may include:\n\n* Bluish coloration to the skin (cyanosis), often with attempted feeding\n* Coughing, gagging, and choking with attempted feeding\n* Drooling or vomiting\n* Poor feeding\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests for Esophageal Atresia**\n\nBefore birth, a mother's ultrasound may show more amniotic fluid than usual, which can be a sign of EA or other blockage of the unborn baby's digestive tract. If EA is present, the baby’s stomach may be hard to see on the ultrasound.\n\nEA is usually found shortly after birth when saliva and fluids collect in the esophagus, causing coughing, choking, and sometimes turning blue. Your baby's health care provider will try to pass a small feeding tube through your infant's mouth or nose into the stomach. If the feeding tube can't pass all the way to the stomach, your infant likely has EA.\n\nAn x-ray may also show:\n\n* An air-filled pouch in the esophagus\n* Air in the stomach and intestine\n\nOnce EA is confirmed, other tests may include:\n\n* An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) to look for any heart defects\n* Imaging to look for other defects that can occur in the spine, limbs, or kidney\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Esophageal Atresia**\n\nEA is an emergency. Surgery is done as soon as possible after birth.\n\nFirst, any connection between the esophagus and the airway must be blocked to prevent damage to the lungs. The esophagus will then be connected to the stomach, which may take time to complete depending on the gap between the esophagus and the stomach.\n\nBefore the surgery, and for some time afterward, your baby is not fed by mouth. Instead, your baby is fed either:\n\n* Through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) so that your baby can be fed directly into the stomach\n* Nutrition given through the veins\n\nCare is taken to keep your baby from breathing saliva or other fluids into the lungs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) and Possible Complications**\n\nAn early diagnosis gives a better chance of a good outcome. However, possible complications may include:\n\n* Feeding problems\n* The repeated bringing up of food from the stomach (reflux) after surgery\n* Narrowing (stricture) of the esophagus due to scarring from surgery\n\nPrematurity may complicate the condition, and there may also be defects in other areas of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nThis disorder is usually diagnosed shortly after birth.

    "content": "**Esophageal Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nEsophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over age 50 years.\n\nThere are two main types of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope.\n\nSquamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol.\n\nAdenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk for this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation)\n* Chest pain not related to eating\n* Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids\n* Heartburn\n* Vomiting blood\n* Weight loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include:\n\n* Series of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus (barium swallow)\n* Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease)\n* Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease)\n* Test to examine and remove a sample of the lining of the esophagus (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD)\n* PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible)\n\nStool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nEGD will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer.\n\nWhen the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery may be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using:\n\n* Open surgery, during which 1 or 2 larger incisions are made.\n* Minimally invasive surgery, during which 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions.\n\nRadiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus.\n\nEither chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform.\n\nIf the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable.\n\nBesides a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include:\n\n* Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open.\n* A feeding tube into the stomach.\n* Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Cancer**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States.\n*   It occurs most often in men over age 50 years.\n*   There are two main types of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.\n*   Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol.\n*   Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk for this type of cancer.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Symptoms may include any of the following:\n    *   Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation)\n    *   Chest pain not related to eating\n    *   Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids\n    *   Heartburn\n    *   Vomiting blood\n    *   Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include:\n    *   Series of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus (barium swallow)\n    *   Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease)\n    *   Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease)\n    *   Test to examine and remove a sample of the lining of the esophagus (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD)\n    *   PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible)\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   EGD will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer.\n*   When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery may be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed.\n*   Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus.\n*   Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform.\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Cancer**\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\n*   Smoking is a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer.\n*   Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can also increase the risk.\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus are conditions that may lead to an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Weight loss\n*   Pain in the chest or back\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n*   Esophageal cancer is typically diagnosed using endoscopy, which involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into the esophagus to visualize the inside of the organ.\n*   A biopsy may be performed during the procedure to obtain tissue samples for further examination.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Surgery: The most common treatment for esophageal cancer is surgery, where the affected part of the esophagus is removed. There are two types of surgical procedures:\n    *   Open surgery: This involves making one or two larger incisions in the abdomen.\n    *   Minimally invasive surgery: This involves making 2 to 4 small incisions in the belly and using a laparoscope with a tiny camera inserted into the belly through one of the incisions.\n*   Radiation therapy: This treatment uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It may be used instead of surgery or in combination with chemotherapy.\n*   Chemotherapy: This involves taking medications that kill cancer cells. It may be used alone or in combination with radiation therapy.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\n*   Joining a cancer support group can help alleviate the stress of illness by sharing experiences and problems with others who have gone through similar situations.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival.\n*   If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Severe weight loss from not eating enough\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   Contact your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better.\n*   Also contact your provider if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer.\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   To reduce the risk of cancer of the esophagus:\n    *   Do not smoke.\n    *   Limit or do not drink alcoholic beverages.\n    *   Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD.\n    *   Get regular checkups if you have Barrett's esophagus.\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Cancer**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Definition**: Esophageal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the esophagus, which is the muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n*   **Causes and risk factors**: The exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown, but certain risk factors have been identified, including smoking, heavy drinking, and a diet low in fruits and vegetables. Additionally, people with a family history of the disease or those who have had acid reflux for an extended period may be at higher risk.\n*   **Symptoms**: The symptoms of esophageal cancer can vary depending on the stage of the disease, but common signs include difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and pain in the chest or back.\n*   **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as endoscopy, biopsy, and imaging studies like X-rays or CT scans.\n*   **Treatment options**: Treatment for esophageal cancer depends on the stage and location of the tumor. Options may include surgery to remove the affected portion of the esophagus, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, radiation therapy to shrink tumors, or a combination of these approaches.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Esophageal Cancer",

The test measures the amount of stomach acid that flows into the esophagus.\n\n**How the Test Works**\n\nDuring the test, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the nose or mouth and guided into the esophagus. The catheter has sensors that measure the pH level in the esophagus over a 24-hour period. The patient is then asked to keep a diary of their symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation.\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nThe results of the test are usually available within 3-5 days. A normal result indicates that the pH level in the esophagus is within a healthy range. An abnormal result may indicate GERD, and further testing or treatment may be necessary.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, patients should avoid eating or drinking anything that can affect the results, such as antacids or acid-reducing medications. Patients should also inform their doctor about any allergies or sensitivities they may have.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe test is usually performed in a hospital or clinic setting and takes around 24 hours to complete. The patient will be asked to lie on their back during the test, and the catheter will be connected to a small device that records the pH levels. The patient may experience some discomfort or mild pain during the procedure.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nIf the test results indicate GERD, treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as avoiding trigger foods and losing weight, as well as medications that reduce stomach acid production. In severe cases, surgery may be recommended to block or divert the flow of stomach acid into the esophagus.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Gastroenterological Association.

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIncreased acid in the esophagus may be related to:\n\n* Barrett esophagus\n* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n* Esophageal scarring\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n* Heartburn\n* Reflux esophagitis\n\nYou may need to have the following tests if your provider suspects esophagitis:\n\n* Barium swallow\n* Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (also called upper GI endoscopy)\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal pH Monitoring**\n\n**What is Esophageal pH Monitoring?**\n\nEsophageal pH monitoring is a test used to measure the amount of acid in the esophagus. It helps diagnose conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, difficulty swallowing, and esophageal scarring.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThe test involves inserting a thin tube through the nose or mouth into the esophagus. The tube has sensors that measure the pH level of the esophagus over a 24-hour period. The patient can go about their normal activities during this time, except for not eating or drinking anything that might affect the results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nIncreased acid in the esophagus may be related to:\n\n* Barrett's esophagus\n* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n* Esophageal scarring\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n* Heartburn\n* Reflux esophagitis\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nRarely, the following may occur:\n\n* Arrhythmias during insertion of the tube\n* Breathing in of vomit if the catheter causes vomiting",

If surgery is needed, it is best done within 24 hours.\n* Treatment may include:\n\t+ Fluids given through a vein (IV)\n\t+ IV antibiotics to prevent or treat infection\n\t+ Draining of fluid around the lungs with a chest tube\n\t+ Mediastinoscopy to remove fluid that has collected in the area behind the breastbone and between the lungs (mediastinum)\n\t+ A stent may be placed in the esophagus if only a small amount of fluid has leaked.\n\t+ A perforation in the uppermost part of the esophagus may heal by itself if you do not eat or drink for a period of time. In this case, you will need a stomach feeding tube or another way to get nutrients.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n* The condition can progress to shock, or even death, if untreated.\n* Outlook is good if the problem is found within 24 hours of it occurring. Most people survive when surgery is done within 24 hours. Survival rate goes down if you wait longer.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n* Permanent damage to the esophagus (narrowing or stricture)\n* Abscess formation in and around the esophagus\n* Infection in and around the lungs\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Perforation**\n\nAn esophageal perforation is a hole in the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube food passes through as it goes from the mouth to the stomach.\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen there is a hole in the esophagus, the contents of the esophagus can pass into the surrounding area in the chest (mediastinum). This often results in infection of the mediastinum (mediastinitis).\n\nThe most common cause of an esophageal perforation is injury during a medical procedure. However, the use of flexible instruments has made this problem uncommon.\n\nThe esophagus may also become perforated as the result of:\n\n* A tumor\n* Gastric reflux with ulceration\n* Previous surgery on the esophagus\n* Swallowing a foreign object or caustic chemicals, such as household cleaners, disk batteries, and battery acid\n* Trauma or injury to the chest and esophagus\n* Violent vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome)\n\nLess common causes include injuries to the esophagus area (blunt trauma) and injury to the esophagus during surgery of another organ near the esophagus.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom is pain when the problem first occurs.\n\nA perforation in the middle or lower most part of the esophagus may cause:\n\n* Swallowing problems\n* Chest pain\n* Breathing problems\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look for:\n\n* Fast breathing\n* Fever\n* Low blood pressure\n* Rapid heart rate\n* Neck pain or stiffness\n* Air bubbles underneath the skin if the perforation is in the top part of the esophagus\n\nYou may have a chest x-ray to look for:\n\n* Air in the soft tissues of the chest\n* Fluid that has leaked from the esophagus into the space around the lungs\n* Collapsed lung -- X-rays taken after you drink a non-harmful dye can help pinpoint the location of the perforation\n\nYou may also have a chest CT scan to look for an abscess in the chest or esophageal cancer.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou may need surgery. Surgery will depend on the location and size of the perforation. If surgery is needed, it is best done within 24 hours.\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n* Fluids given through a vein (IV)\n* IV antibiotics to prevent or treat infection\n* Draining of fluid around the lungs with a chest tube\n* Mediastinoscopy to remove fluid that has collected in the area behind the breastbone and between the lungs (mediastinum)\n\nA stent may be placed in the esophagus if only a small amount of fluid has leaked. This may help avoid surgery.\n\nA perforation in the uppermost (neck region) part of the esophagus may heal by itself if you do not eat or drink for a period of time. In this case, you will need a stomach feeding tube or another way to get nutrients.\n\nSurgery is often needed to repair a perforation in the middle or bottom portions of the esophagus. Depending on the extent of the problem, the leak may be treated by simple repair or by removing the esophagus.\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Perforation**\n\n**What is Esophageal Perforation?**\n\nEsophageal perforation is a serious condition where there is a hole in the esophagus, which can lead to severe consequences if left untreated.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of esophageal perforation is not always known, but it can be caused by various factors such as:\n\n*   Trauma to the neck or chest\n*   Certain medical procedures like endoscopy or surgery\n*   Infections like tuberculosis or abscesses\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of esophageal perforation may include:\n\n*   Severe chest pain\n*   Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   Breathing difficulties\n*   Fever and chills\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for esophageal perforation depends on the severity of the condition and may involve:\n\n*   Surgery to repair or remove the damaged part of the esophagus\n*   Placement of a stent in the esophagus to help prevent further complications\n*   Antibiotics to treat any underlying infections\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for esophageal perforation is generally poor if left untreated, but prompt medical attention can significantly improve outcomes. In many cases, surgery can be effective in repairing the damaged area and preventing further complications.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile it is difficult to prevent esophageal perforation entirely, being aware of the risks and taking necessary precautions during medical procedures can help minimize the likelihood of this serious condition occurring.",
