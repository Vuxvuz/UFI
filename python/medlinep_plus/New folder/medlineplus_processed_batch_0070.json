    "content": "**Feeding Patterns and Diet for Children 6 Months to 2 Years**\n\nAs your child grows from 6 months to 2 years, their dietary needs change significantly. It's essential to provide an age-appropriate diet that meets their nutritional requirements, supports their development, and helps prevent childhood obesity.\n\n**6 to 8 Months**\n\nAt this stage, your baby will likely eat 4 to 6 times a day, with each feeding consisting of about 6 to 8 ounces (180 to 240 milliliters) of formula. You can introduce solid foods at 6 months, starting with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Gradually increase the amount and frequency of solid feedings.\n\n**Introducing Solid Foods**\n\n* Start with a thin mixture of cereal and milk\n* Offer 2 times a day, in small amounts (just a few spoonfuls)\n* Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin\n* Increase the amount and frequency as your baby becomes accustomed to eating solids\n\n**Recommended Foods at 6 Months**\n\n* Iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables (e.g., green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, peaches)\n* Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits\n\n**Signs of Readiness for Solid Foods**\n\n* Your baby's birth weight has doubled\n* Your baby can control their head and neck movements\n* Your baby can sit up with some support\n* Your baby shows interest in food when others are eating\n* Your baby begins to show signs of fullness (e.g., turning their head away, not opening their mouth)\n\n**Important Reminders**\n\n* Never give honey to your baby, as it may contain bacteria that cause botulism\n* Do not give cow's milk until they are 1 year old; babies under 1 have difficulty digesting it\n* Avoid putting your child to bed with a bottle, as this can lead to tooth decay\n\n**8 to 12 Months**\n\nAt this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will likely let you know when they're ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.\n\n**Good Finger Foods**\n\n* Soft cooked vegetables\n* Washed and peeled fruits\n* Graham crackers\n* Melba toast\n* Noodles\n\nYou can also introduce teething foods, such as:\n\n* Toast strips\n* Unsalted crackers and bagels\n* Teething biscuits\n\nContinue to offer breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times a day at this age.\n\n**Avoid Foods That May Cause Choking**\n\n* Apple chunks or slices\n* Grapes\n* Berries\n* Raisins\n* Dry flake cereals\n* Hot dogs\n* Sausages\n* Peanut butter\n* Popcorn\n* Nuts\n* Seeds\n* Round candies\n* Raw vegetables\n\n**1 Year of Age**\n\nAt this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula. Most mothers in the United States wean their babies by this age, but it's also fine to continue nursing if you and your baby want to.\n\nDo not give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2, as they need the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.\n\n**Tips for Parents**\n\n* If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later; often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods\n* Avoid giving sweets or sweetened beverages; they can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay\n* Do not give your child salt, strong spices, or caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate\n\n**2 Years of Age**\n\nAfter your child turns 2, their diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.\n\nEnsure your child eats a variety of foods from each food group: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.\n\nIf your water is not fluoridated, consider using toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.\n\n**Good Sources of Calcium**\n\n* Low-fat or nonfat milk\n* Yogurt\n* Cheese\n* Cooked greens\n* Canned salmon (with bones)\n\nRemember to consult with your healthcare provider if you have concerns about your child's diet or nutrition.\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Patterns and Diet for Children 6 Months to 2 Years**\n\n**Is Right for Your Child's State of Development**\n\nAn age-appropriate diet gives your child proper nutrition, is right for their state of development, and can help prevent childhood obesity.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   **6 to 8 Months:**\n    *   Feed formula about 6 to 8 ounces (180 to 240 milliliters) per feeding, but not more than 32 ounces (950 milliliters) in 24 hours.\n    *   Introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.\n    *   Start with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Offer the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.\n*   **8 to 12 Months of Age:**\n    *   Offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.\n    *   Good finger foods include soft cooked vegetables, washed and peeled fruits, graham crackers, Melba toast, and noodles.\n*   **1 Year of Age:**\n    *   You may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula. Most mothers in the United States wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.\n    *   Do not give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.\n*   **2 Years of Age:**\n    *   After your child turns 2, their diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your provider if you are concerned about your child's eating habits or overall health.\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Patterns and Diet for Children 6 Months to 2 Years**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAs a parent, it's essential to understand the feeding patterns and diet requirements of your child from 6 months to 2 years old. This period is crucial in shaping your child's eating habits and preventing potential health issues like obesity.\n\n**6 to 8 Months**\n\nAt this age, your baby will likely eat 4 to 6 times a day, with each meal consisting of more food than the first 6 months. If you're formula-feeding, your baby will consume around 6 to 8 ounces (180 to 240 milliliters) per feeding, not exceeding 32 ounces (950 milliliters) in 24 hours.\n\nYou can introduce solid foods at 6 months, with breast milk or formula still providing most of the calories. Since breast milk is not an excellent source of iron, your baby will need more iron after 6 months. Start with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula, gradually increasing the texture as your baby learns to control it in their mouth.\n\n**Introducing Solid Foods**\n\n*   Start with a few spoonfuls (2 times a day) of iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula.\n*   Gradually increase the amount and frequency of solid foods.\n*   Introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables, such as green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.\n\n**Signs of Readiness for Solid Foods**\n\nYour baby is ready to eat solid foods when:\n\n*   Their birth weight has doubled.\n*   They can control their head and neck movements.\n*   They can sit up with some support.\n*   They show signs of being full by turning their head away or not opening their mouth.\n*   They display interest in food when others are eating.\n\n**8 to 12 Months**\n\nAt this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will likely indicate readiness to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.\n\nGood finger foods include:\n\n*   Soft cooked vegetables\n*   Washed and peeled fruits\n*   Graham crackers\n*   Melba toast\n*   Noodles\n\nYou can also introduce teething foods, such as:\n\n*   Toast strips\n*   Unsalted crackers and bagels\n*   Teething biscuits\n\nContinue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times a day at this age.\n\n**Avoid Foods That May Cause Choking**\n\nFoods that may cause choking include:\n\n*   Apple chunks or slices\n*   Grapes\n*   Berries\n*   Raisins\n*   Dry flake cereals\n*   Hot dogs\n*   Sausages\n*   Peanut butter\n*   Popcorn\n*   Nuts\n*   Seeds\n*   Round candies\n*   Raw vegetables\n\n**1 Year**\n\nAt this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula. Most mothers in the United States wean their babies by this age, but it's also fine to continue nursing if you and your baby want to.\n\nDo not give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.\n\n**2 Years**\n\nAfter your child turns 2, their diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.\n\nYour child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.\n\nIf your water is not fluoridated, it's a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Patterns and Diet - Children 6 Months to 2 Years**\n\n**When Your Baby is Ready for Solid Foods (6-8 months)**\n\n* Your baby can sit up with some support.\n* Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.\n* Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.\n\n**You Should Also Know:**\n\n* Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.\n* Do not give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.\n* Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.\n* Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.\n* It is fine to start giving your baby water between feedings.\n* Do not give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.\n\n**8 to 12 Months of Age**\n\n* At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.\n* Good finger foods include:\n\t+ Soft cooked vegetables\n\t+ Washed and peeled fruits\n\t+ Graham crackers\n\t+ Melba toast\n\t+ Noodles\n* You can also introduce teething foods, such as:\n\t+ Toast strips\n\t+ Unsalted crackers and bagels\n\t+ Teething biscuits\n\n**You Should Also Know:**\n\n* Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.\n* You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So do not offer them until after age 1.\n* You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.\n\n**1 Year of Age**\n\n* At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.\n* Most mothers in the United States wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.\n* Do not give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.\n\n**You Should Also Know:**\n\n* If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.\n* Do not give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.\n* Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.\n\n**2 Years of Age**\n\n* After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.\n* Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall your provider if you are concerned your child:\n\n* Is not eating enough\n* Is eating too much\n* Is gaining too much or too little weight\n* Has an allergic reaction to food\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Patterns and Diet - Children 6 Months to 2 Years**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Breastfeeding and Human Milk**\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about the first six months of life, with continued breastfeeding along with solid foods as long as mutually desired. Breast milk provides optimal nutrition and protection against infections for infants.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Nutrition Guidelines for Healthy Infants, Children, and Adolescents**\n\nAccording to the AAP, breast milk or formula should be the primary source of nutrition for infants from birth to 12 months. For children aged 1-2 years, a variety of solid foods should be introduced around 6 months of age.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Nutrition for Toddlers**\n\nToddlers need a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. They should drink plenty of water and limit sugary drinks. A well-planned diet can help prevent nutritional deficiencies and support overall health.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Meek JY, Noble L.

    "content": "**Feeding Tube in Infants**\n\nA feeding tube is a small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose (NG) or mouth (OG) into the stomach. These tubes are used to provide feedings and medicines into the stomach until the baby can take food by mouth.\n\n**Why is a Feeding Tube Used?**\n\nFeeding from the breast or bottle requires strength and coordination. Sick or premature babies may not be able to suck or swallow well enough to bottle or breastfeed. Tube feedings allow the baby to get some or all of their feeding into the stomach. This is the most efficient and safest way to provide good nutrition. Oral medicines can also be given through the tube.\n\n**How is a Feeding Tube Placed?**\n\nA feeding tube is gently placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. An x-ray can confirm correct placement. In babies with feeding problems, the tip of the tube may be placed past the stomach into the small intestine. This provides slower, continuous feedings.\n\n**What are the Risks of a Feeding Tube?**\n\nFeeding tubes are generally very safe and effective. However, problems may occur, even when the tube is placed properly. These include:\n\n* Irritation of the nose, mouth, or stomach, causing minor bleeding\n* Stuffy nose or infection of the nose if the tube is placed through the nose\n\nIf the tube is misplaced and not in the proper position, the baby may have problems with:\n\n* An abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)\n* Breathing\n* Spitting up\n\nIn rare cases, the feeding tube can puncture the stomach.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGavage tube - infants; OG - infants; NG - infants\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Tube - Infants**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tubes for Enteric Access**\n\nAccording to George DE and Ogholikhan S, in their chapter \"Tubes for enteric access\" in the book \"Pediatric Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease\", feeding tubes are used for infants who have difficulty eating or digesting food.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Nutritional Support for Preterm Infants**\n\nPoindexter BB and Martin CR discuss nutritional support for preterm infants in their chapter \"Nutritional support for the preterm infant\" in the book \"Fanaroff and Martin's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine\".

    "content": "**Feeding Tube Insertion - Gastrostomy**\n\nA gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach.\n\n**Description**\n\nGastrostomy feeding tube insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach.\n\nAfter the endoscopy tube is inserted into the stomach, the skin over the left side of the belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. Your surgeon makes a small surgical cut in this area. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. Your surgeon uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nGastrostomy feeding tubes are put in for different reasons. They may be needed for a short time or permanently. This procedure may be used for:\n\n* Babies with birth defects of the mouth, esophagus, or stomach (for example, esophageal atresia or tracheal esophageal fistula)\n* People who cannot swallow correctly\n* People who cannot take enough food by mouth to stay healthy\n* People who often breathe in food when eating\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for surgical or endoscopic feeding tube insertion are:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Tube Insertion - Gastrostomy**\n\n**What is a gastrostomy?**\n\nA gastrostomy is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it.

In most cases, these medicines are given through a vein (IV line) in your arm. You should feel no pain and not remember the procedure.\n\nA numbing medicine may be sprayed into your mouth to prevent the urge to cough or gag when the endoscope is inserted. A mouth guard will be inserted to protect your teeth and the endoscope.\n\nDentures must be removed.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nThis is most often a simple surgery with a good outlook. Follow any self-care instructions you're given, including:\n\n* How to care for the skin around the tube\n* Signs and symptoms of infection\n* What to do if the tube is pulled out\n* Signs and symptoms of tube blockage\n* How to empty the stomach through the tube\n* How and what to feed through the tube\n* How to hide the tube under clothing\n* What normal activities can be continued\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe stomach and abdomen will heal in 5 to 7 days. Moderate pain can be treated with medicine. Feedings will start slowly with clear liquids, and increase slowly.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGastrostomy tube insertion; G-tube insertion; PEG tube insertion; Stomach tube insertion; Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion\n\n---\n\n**Feeding Tube Insertion - Gastrostomy**\n\n**What is a gastrostomy?**\n\nA gastrostomy is a surgical procedure where a feeding tube is inserted directly into the stomach through an opening in the abdominal wall. This allows for the delivery of nutrients and fluids directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus.\n\n**How is a gastrostomy performed?**\n\nThere are two main methods of performing a gastrostomy:\n\n*   **Open gastrostomy**: A surgical incision is made in the abdomen to access the stomach.\n*   **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)**: A flexible tube is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the stomach using an endoscope.\n\n**Indications for a gastrostomy**\n\nA gastrostomy may be necessary for individuals who have difficulty swallowing or digesting food, such as those with:\n\n*   **Swallowing disorders**: Conditions like Parkinson's disease or stroke can affect the ability to swallow.\n*   **Gastrointestinal diseases**: Inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or other conditions that impair digestion.\n\n**Complications and risks**\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, there are potential complications and risks associated with a gastrostomy, including:\n\n*   **Infection**\n*   **Bleeding**\n*   **Perforation of the stomach**\n*   **Displacement of the feeding tube**\n\n**Caring for a gastrostomy**\n\nTo ensure proper healing and function of the gastrostomy site, it is essential to follow these care instructions:\n\n*   **Keep the site clean**: Gently wash the area with soap and water.\n*   **Apply antibiotic ointment**: To prevent infection.\n*   **Monitor for complications**: Watch for signs of bleeding, infection, or other issues.\n\n**Nutritional Support**\n\nA gastrostomy provides a means of delivering essential nutrients and fluids directly into the stomach. It is crucial to maintain proper nutrition to support overall health and well-being.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   **Nutritional Support**\n*   **Gastrointestinal Diseases**\n*   **Swallowing Disorders**\n\nBy understanding the procedure, indications, and care instructions for a gastrostomy, individuals can better navigate this medical intervention and ensure optimal outcomes.",

Gotcha!\n\nPain, although often uncomfortable, is a protective mechanism that alerts us to potential or actual harm to the body's tissues.\n\nHere, the peripheral nervous system sent a pain message to the brain that a bee sting occurred on the nose.\n\nLet's take a look at an instant replay to see how this communication works.\n\n**The Pain Process**\n\n*   The pain receptors in the skin detect tissue damage from the bee sting.\n*   Then, the peripheral nerves send a pain signal to the brain.\n*   The brain analyzes the pain signal.\n*   In turn, the brain delivers a message back to the muscles of the arm to react.\n\nHasta la beesta, babee!\n\nAs you can tell, it's a very effective system.\n\n---\n\n**Feeling Pain**\n\n\\n\\n**What is pain?**\n\nPain is a complex and multifaceted experience that serves as a warning signal for our bodies. It's a vital function that helps us avoid harm and protect ourselves from injuries.\n\n\\n\\n**Why do we feel pain?**\n\nWe feel pain when our body detects damage or potential harm. This can be due to various reasons such as injury, infection, or inflammation. The pain sensation is triggered by specialized nerve cells called nociceptors, which release chemical signals that travel to the brain, where they are interpreted as pain.\n\n\\n\\n**How do we respond to pain?**\n\nOur response to pain involves both physical and emotional components. Physically, our body may exhibit symptoms such as redness, swelling, heat, and loss of function in the affected area. Emotionally, pain can evoke feelings of distress, anxiety, or fear. The goal is to alleviate the pain and prevent further harm.\n\n\\n\\n**What are some common types of pain?**\n\nThere are several types of pain, including:\n\n*   **Acute pain**: sudden, severe pain that typically resolves on its own\n*   **Chronic pain**: persistent pain that lasts for an extended period\n*   **Referred pain**: pain felt in a different location from the actual source of pain\n\n\\n\\n**How can we manage pain?**\n\nManaging pain involves a combination of self-care techniques, lifestyle modifications, and medical interventions. This may include:\n\n*   **Medications**: over-the-counter or prescription medications to alleviate pain\n*   **Therapy**: physical therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling to address emotional aspects of pain\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep to reduce pain\n\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\n\nPain is a vital function that serves as a warning signal for our bodies. Understanding the causes, types, and management strategies for pain can help us navigate this complex experience and improve our overall well-being.",

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of felbamate and gradually increase your dose every one or two weeks.\n\nFelbamate controls seizures but does not cure them. Continue to take felbamate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking felbamate without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking felbamate, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication should not be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking felbamate:\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to felbamate; carbamate medications such as meprobamate (Miltown), methocarbamol (Robaxin), and rivastigmine (Exelon); or any other medications.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking felbamate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of the conditions listed in the IMPORTANT WARNINGS section or kidney disease.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking felbamate, call your doctor.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.

Nearly all people with Felty syndrome have a positive test for rheumatoid factor.\n\nAn abdominal ultrasound may confirm a swollen spleen.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn most cases, people who have this syndrome are not getting recommended treatment for RA. They may need other medicines to suppress their immune system and reduce the activity of their RA.\n\n* Methotrexate may improve the low neutrophil count.\n* The drug rituximab has been successful in people who do not respond to methotrexate.\n* Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may raise the neutrophil count.\n* Some people benefit from removal of the spleen (splenectomy).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, infections may continue to occur. RA is likely to get worse. Treating the RA, however, should improve Felty syndrome.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou may have infections that keep coming back. Some people with Felty syndrome have increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes, also called LGL leukemia. This will be treated with methotrexate in many cases.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrompt treatment of RA with currently recommended medicines markedly decreases the risk of developing Felty syndrome.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSeropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA); Felty's syndrome\n\n---\n\n**Felty Syndrome**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFelty syndrome is a rare disorder that includes rheumatoid arthritis, a swollen spleen, decreased white blood cell count, and repeated infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of Felty syndrome is unknown.

It is characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor, anemia, and splenomegaly.\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of Felty syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to be related to chronic inflammation in RA. Risk factors include:\n\n*   Long-standing RA\n*   Presence of rheumatoid factor\n*   Anemia\n*   Splenomegaly\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of Felty syndrome can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Weight loss\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nFelty syndrome is typically diagnosed based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The diagnosis is often made in patients with long-standing RA who present with anemia, splenomegaly, and rheumatoid factor.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for Felty syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment may include:\n\n*   Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation\n*   Immunosuppressive drugs to suppress the immune system\n*   Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) in severe cases\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for patients with Felty syndrome is generally poor, with a high mortality rate. However, with proper treatment and management, some patients may experience improvement in their symptoms.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Savola P, Brück O, Olson T, et al.

If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from age, physical problems, hormone problems, and lifestyle or environmental factors.\n\n**Causes of Infertility**\n\nMost cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In primary ovarian insufficiency, the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nIf you think you might be infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems.

    "content": "**Female Condoms**\n\nThe female condom is a device used for birth control. Like a male condom, it creates a barrier to prevent the sperm from getting to the egg.\n\n**Information**\n\n* The female condom protects against pregnancy.\n* It also protects against infections spread during sexual contact, including HIV.\n* However, it is not thought to work as well as male condoms in protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n**The Female Condom**\n\n* The female condom is made of a thin, strong plastic called polyurethane.\n* A newer version, which costs less, is made of a substance called nitrile.\n\nThese condoms fit inside the vagina. The condom has a ring on each end.\n\n* The ring that is placed inside the vagina fits over the cervix and covers it with the rubber material.\n* The other ring is open. It rests outside of the vagina and covers the vulva.\n\n**How Effective Is It?**\n\n* The female condom is about 75% to 82% effective with normal use.\n* When used correctly all of the time, female condoms are 95% effective.\n\nFemale condoms can fail for the same reasons as male condoms, including:\n\n* There is a tear in a condom. (This can occur before or during intercourse.)\n* The condom is not put in place before the penis touches the vagina.\n* You do not use a condom each time you have intercourse.\n* There are manufacturing defects in the condom (rare).\n* The contents of the condom are spilled as it is being removed.\n\n**Convenience**\n\n* Condoms are available without a prescription.\n* They are fairly inexpensive (though more expensive than male condoms).\n* You can buy female condoms at most drugstores, STI clinics, and family planning clinics.\n* You need to plan to have a condom on hand when you have sex. However, female condoms may be placed up to 8 hours before intercourse.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Can be used during menstruation or pregnancy, or after recent childbirth.\n* Allows a woman to protect herself from pregnancy and STIs without relying on the male condom.\n* Protects against pregnancy and STIs.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Friction of the condom may reduce clitoral stimulation and lubrication. This may make intercourse less enjoyable or even uncomfortable, although using lubricant may help.\n* Irritation and allergic reactions may occur.\n* The condom may make noise (using the lubricant may help). The newer version is much quieter.\n* There is no direct contact between the penis and the vagina.\n* The woman is not aware of warm fluid entering her body. (This may be important to some women, but not to others.)\n\n**How to Use a Female Condom**\n\n1. Find the inner ring of the condom, and hold it between your thumb and middle finger.\n2. Squeeze the ring together and insert it as far as possible into the vagina. Make sure that the inner ring is past the pubic bone.\n3. Leave the outer ring outside of the vagina.\n4. Make sure that the condom has not become twisted.\n5. Put a couple of drops of water-based lubricant on the penis before and during intercourse as needed.\n6.

A newer version, which costs less, is made of a substance called nitrile.\n\nThese condoms fit inside the vagina, with a ring on each end:\n\n*   The inner ring fits over the cervix and covers it with rubber material\n*   The outer ring is open and rests outside of the vagina, covering the vulva\n\n**Effectiveness**\n\nThe female condom is about 75% to 82% effective with normal use.

    "content": "**Female Pattern Baldness**\n\n_Female pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in women._\n\n**Causes**\n\nEach strand of hair sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle. In general, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair.\n\nThe reason for female pattern baldness is not well understood, but may be related to:\n\n*   Aging\n*   Changes in the levels of androgens (hormones that can stimulate male features)\n*   Family history of male or female pattern baldness\n*   Heavy loss of blood during menstrual periods\n*   Certain medicines, such as estrogenic oral contraceptives\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nHair thinning is different from that of male pattern baldness. In female pattern baldness:\n\n*   Hair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp.\n*   It usually starts with a widening through the center hair part, known as Christmas tree pattern.\n*   The front hairline remains unaffected except for normal recession, which happens to everyone as time passes.\n*   The hair loss rarely progresses to total or near total baldness, as it may in men.\n*   If the cause is increased androgens, hair on the head is thinner while hair on the face is coarser.\n\nItching or skin sores on the scalp are generally not seen.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nFemale pattern baldness is usually diagnosed based on:\n\n*   Ruling out other causes of hair loss, such as thyroid disease or iron deficiency.\n*   The appearance and pattern of hair loss.\n*   Your medical history.\n\nThe health care provider will examine you for other signs of too much male hormone (androgen), such as:\n\n*   Abnormal new hair growth, such as on the face or between the belly button and pubic area\n*   Changes in menstrual periods and enlargement of the clitoris\n*   New acne\n\nA skin biopsy of the scalp or blood tests may be used to diagnose skin disorders that cause hair loss.\n\nLooking at the hair with a dermoscope or under a microscope may be done to check for problems with the structure of the hair shaft itself.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nUntreated, hair loss in female pattern baldness is permanent. In most cases, hair loss is mild to moderate. You do not need treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance.\n\nThe only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness is minoxidil:\n\n*   It is applied to the scalp.\n*   For women, the 2% solution or 5% foam is recommended.\n*   Minoxidil may help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 women. In most women, it may slow or stop hair loss.\n*   You must continue to use this medicine for a long time. Hair loss starts again when you stop using it. Also, the hair that it helps grow will fall out.\n\nIf minoxidil does not work, your provider may recommend other medicines or treatments, such as vitamins, spironolactone, birth control pills, ketoconazole shampoo, platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) injections, and laser treatments. Your provider can tell you more about these if needed.\n\nHair transplant is another option:\n\n*   This procedure can be effective in females who do not respond well to medical treatment or have no significant cosmetic improvement from their treatment.\n*   During hair transplant, tiny plugs of hair are removed from areas where hair is thicker, and placed (transplanted) in areas that are balding. Minor scarring may occur where hair is removed. There is a slight risk of skin infection. You will likely need many transplants, which can be expensive. However, the results can be excellent and permanent.\n\nOther solutions include:\n\n*   Hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance. This is most often the least expensive and safest way to deal with female pattern baldness.\n\n---\n\n**Female Pattern Baldness**\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Aging\n* Changes in the levels of androgens (hormones that can stimulate male features)\n* Family history of male or female pattern baldness\n* Heavy loss of blood during menstrual periods\n* Certain medicines, such as estrogenic oral contraceptives\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Hair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp\n* The front hairline remains unaffected except for normal recession\n* The hair loss rarely progresses to total or near total baldness\n* If the cause is increased androgens, hair on the head is thinner while hair on the face is coarser\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* Ruling out other causes of hair loss, such as thyroid disease or iron deficiency\n* The appearance and pattern of hair loss\n* Your medical history\n* A skin biopsy of the scalp or blood tests may be used to diagnose skin disorders that cause hair loss.\n* Looking at the hair with a dermoscope or under a microscope may be done to check for problems with the structure of the hair shaft itself.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* Untreated, hair loss in female pattern baldness is permanent\n* In most cases, hair loss is mild to moderate\n* You do not need treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance\n* Medicines:\n\t+ Minoxidil: applied to the scalp, 2% solution or 5% foam recommended\n\t+ May help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 women\n\t+ May slow or stop hair loss in most women\n\t+ You must continue to use this medicine for a long time\n\t+ Hair loss starts again when you stop using it\n* Other medicines or treatments may be recommended, such as vitamins, spironolactone, birth control pills, ketoconazole shampoo, platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) injections, and laser treatments.\n* Hair transplant: effective in females who do not respond well to medical treatment or have no significant cosmetic improvement from their treatment\n* Minor scarring may occur where hair is removed\n* There is a slight risk of skin infection\n* You will likely need many transplants, which can be expensive\n* However, the results can be excellent and permanent.\n* Other solutions: hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance.\n\n---\n\n**Female Pattern Baldness**\n\n**What is Female Pattern Baldness?**\n\nFemale pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition where women experience hair loss due to hormonal changes.\n\n**Causes of Hair Loss**\n\nThe exact cause of female pattern baldness is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to:\n\n*   Hormonal changes, particularly an increase in male hormones (androgens)\n*   Genetics\n*   Aging\n\n**Symptoms of Female Pattern Baldness**\n\nThe symptoms of female pattern baldness may include:\n\n*   Hair loss on the scalp, particularly on the crown and temples\n*   Thinning or brittle hair\n*   Itching or irritation on the scalp\n\n**Diagnosing Female Pattern Baldness**\n\nDiagnosing female pattern baldness typically involves a physical examination and medical history. Your healthcare provider may also perform tests to rule out other underlying medical conditions.\n\n**Treatment Options for Female Pattern Baldness**\n\nThere are several treatment options available for female pattern baldness, including:\n\n*   Minoxidil: a topical solution or foam applied directly to the scalp\n*   Spironolactone: an oral medication that blocks the production of androgens\n*   Birth control pills: may help regulate hormonal imbalances\n*   Hair transplantation: a surgical procedure to transplant healthy hair follicles to balding areas\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for female pattern baldness.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience hair loss and it continues, especially if you also have itching, skin irritation, or other symptoms, contact your healthcare provider. There may be a treatable medical cause for the hair loss.\n\n---\n\n**Female Pattern Baldness**\n\n**What is it?**\nFemale pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia in women, is a common condition characterized by thinning or loss of hair on the scalp. It is often hereditary and can be influenced by hormonal changes.\n\n**Prevention**\nThere is no known prevention for female pattern baldness.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Alopecia in women\n* Baldness - female\n* Hair loss in women\n* Androgenetic alopecia in women\n* Hereditary balding or thinning in women\n\n**Images**\n\nFemale-pattern baldness\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Dermatology Association website.

This can be done with open or laparoscopic surgery, and you should discuss which type is right for you with your surgeon.\n\n**Open Surgery**\n\nIn open surgery:\n\n*   You may receive general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or local anesthesia with medicine to relax.\n*   Your surgeon makes a cut in your groin area.\n*   The hernia is located and separated from the tissues around it. Some extra tissue may be removed, and the rest of the hernia contents are gently pushed back inside your abdomen.\n*   The surgeon closes your weakened abdominal muscles with stitches.\n*   A piece of mesh may be sewn into place to strengthen your abdominal wall.\n\n**Laparoscopic Surgery**\n\nIn laparoscopic surgery:\n\n*   The surgeon makes 3-5 small cuts in your groin and lower belly.\n*   A laparoscope is inserted through one cut, allowing the surgeon to see inside your belly.\n*   Gas is pumped into your belly to expand the space.\n*   Other tools are inserted through other cuts to repair the hernia.\n*   The same repair is done as in open surgery.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nUnlike an inguinal hernia, a femoral hernia should be repaired even if it doesn't cause symptoms. If not repaired, the intestine can get trapped inside the hernia, leading to an incarcerated or strangulated hernia, which can cut off blood supply to the intestines and be life-threatening.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks specific to this surgery are:\n\n*   Damage to blood vessels that go to the leg\n*   Damage to the nearby nerve\n*   Damage near the reproductive organs for women\n*   Long-term pain\n*   Return of the hernia\n\n---\n\n**Femoral Hernia Repair**\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring surgery to repair the hernia, the bulging tissue is pushed back in. The weakened area is sewn closed or strengthened. This repair can be done with open or laparoscopic surgery. You and your surgeon can discuss which type of surgery is right for you.\n\n**Open Surgery**\n\nYou may receive general anesthesia. Your surgeon makes a cut (incision) in your groin area. The hernia is located and separated from the tissues around it. Some of the extra hernia tissue may be removed. The rest of the hernia contents are gently pushed back inside your abdomen. The surgeon then closes your weakened abdominal muscles with stitches. Often a piece of mesh is also sewn into place to strengthen your abdominal wall.\n\n**Laparoscopic Surgery**\n\nThe surgeon makes 3 to 5 small cuts in your groin and lower belly. A laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. Gas is pumped into your belly to expand the space. Other tools are inserted through the other cuts. The surgeon uses these tools to repair the hernia.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nUnlike an inguinal hernia, a femoral hernia should be repaired, even if it does not cause symptoms. If the hernia is not repaired, the intestine can get trapped inside the hernia. This is called an incarcerated, or strangulated, hernia. It can cut off blood supply to the intestines. This can be life threatening.\n\n**Risks**\n\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nNote: The cleaned output has been formatted with **bold** headings and *italic* text for lists.

    "content": "**Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nFemoral nerve dysfunction is a loss of movement or sensation in parts of the legs due to damage to the femoral nerve.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe femoral nerve is located in the pelvis and goes down the front of the leg. It helps the muscles move the hip and straighten the leg. It provides feeling (sensation) to the front of the thigh and part of the lower leg.\n\nA nerve is made up of many fibers, called axons, surrounded by insulation, called the myelin sheath.\n\nDamage to any one nerve, such as the femoral nerve, is called mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy is usually due to a local cause of damage to a single nerve. Disorders that involve the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage to one nerve at a time (such as occurs with mononeuritis multiplex).\n\nMore common causes of femoral nerve dysfunction are:\n\n* Direct injury (trauma)\n* Prolonged pressure on the nerve\n* Compression, stretching, or entrapment of the nerve by nearby parts of the body or disease-related structures (such as a tumor or abnormal blood vessel)\n\nThe femoral nerve can also be damaged from any of the following:\n\n* A broken pelvis bone\n* A catheter placed into the femoral artery in the groin\n* Diabetes or other causes of peripheral neuropathy\n* Internal bleeding in the pelvis or belly area (abdomen)\n* Lying on the back with the thighs and legs flexed and turned (lithotomy position) during surgery or diagnostic procedures\n* Tight or heavy waist belts\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Sensation changes in the thigh, knee, or leg, such as decreased sensation, numbness, tingling, burning, or pain\n* Weakness of the knee or leg, including difficulty going up and down stairs -- especially down, with a feeling of the knee giving way or buckling\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine you. This will include an exam of the nerves and muscles in your legs.\n\nThe exam may show that you have:\n\n* Weakness when you straighten the knee or bend at the hip\n* Sensation changes at the front of the thigh or in the foreleg\n* An abnormal knee reflex\n* Smaller than normal quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Electromyography (EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles.\n* Nerve conduction (NCV) tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve. This test is usually done at the same time as an EMG.\n* MRI or CT scan to check for masses or tumors.\n\nYour provider may order additional tests, depending on your medical history and symptoms. Tests may include blood tests, x-rays, and other imaging tests.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider will try to identify and treat the cause of the nerve damage. You'll be treated for any medical problems (such as diabetes or bleeding in the pelvis) that may be causing the nerve damage. In some cases, the nerve will heal with treatment of the underlying medical problem.\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n* Surgery to remove a tumor or growth that is pressing on the nerve\n* Medicines to relieve pain\n* Weight loss and change in lifestyle if diabetes or excess weight is contributing to the nerve damage\n\nIn some cases, no treatment is needed and you'll recover on your own. If so, any treatment, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy, is aimed at increasing mobility, maintaining muscle strength, and independence while you recover. Braces or splints may be prescribed to help in walking.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf the cause of the femoral nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated, it is possible to recover fully. In some cases, there may be partial or complete loss of movement or sensation, resulting in some degree of permanent disability.\n\nNerve pain may be uncomfortable and can continue for a long time. Injury to the femoral area may also injure the femoral artery or vein, which can cause bleeding and other problems.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may result include:\n\n* Repeated injury to the leg that goes unnoticed due to loss of sensation\n* Injury from falls due to muscle weakness\n\n---\n\n**Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe femoral nerve is located in the pelvis and goes down the front of the leg.

This can cause a range of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nThe causes of femoral nerve dysfunction can vary widely, but common causes include:\n\n*   **Herniated discs**: When the soft, spongy tissue between the vertebrae herniates or ruptures, it can put pressure on the nearby nerves, including the femoral nerve.\n*   **Trauma**: A blow to the lower back or leg can cause damage to the femoral nerve.\n*   **Tumors**: Certain types of tumors can compress or damage the femoral nerve.\n*   **Infections**: Infections such as osteomyelitis (bone infection) or abscesses can also cause femoral nerve dysfunction.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nThe symptoms of femoral nerve dysfunction can vary depending on the severity and location of the damage. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Pain**: A sharp, stabbing pain in the lower back or leg that can radiate down to the foot.\n*   **Numbness**: A loss of sensation in the affected area, which can make it difficult to feel touch or temperature changes.\n*   **Weakness**: Muscle weakness in the affected area, which can make it hard to move or perform daily activities.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosing Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nTo diagnose femoral nerve dysfunction, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam and take a thorough medical history. They may also order imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan to rule out other conditions and confirm the presence of damage to the femoral nerve.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment Options for Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nThe treatment options for femoral nerve dysfunction depend on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Common treatments include:\n\n*   **Physical therapy**: Gentle exercises and stretches can help improve mobility and reduce pain.\n*   **Medications**: Pain relievers, muscle relaxants, or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the femoral nerve or repair damaged tissue.\n\n\\n\\n**Preventing Femoral Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nWhile it's not possible to completely prevent femoral nerve dysfunction, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n*   **Maintain good posture**: Avoid slouching or bending, which can put pressure on the lower back and increase the risk of herniated discs.\n*   **Exercise regularly**: Regular exercise can help strengthen the muscles in your back and improve flexibility.\n*   **Manage stress**: High levels of stress can contribute to muscle tension and increase the risk of injury.",

    "content": "**Femur Fracture Repair - Discharge**\n\nYou had a fracture (break) in the femur in your leg. It is also called the thigh bone. You may have needed surgery to repair the bone. You may have had surgery called an open reduction internal fixation. In this surgery, your surgeon made a cut in the skin to then align your broken bone.\n\n**Understanding Your Surgery**\n\nYour surgeon then used special metal devices to hold your bones in place while they heal. These devices are called internal fixators. The complete name of this surgery is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).\n\nIn the most common surgery to repair a femur fracture, the surgeon inserts a rod or large nail into the center of the bone. This rod helps support the bone until it heals. The surgeon may also put a plate next to your bone that is attached by screws. Sometimes, fixation devices are attached to a frame outside your leg.\n\n**Recovery at Home**\n\nRecovery most often takes 4 to 6 months. The length of your recovery will depend on how severe your fracture is, whether you have skin wounds, and how severe they are. Recovery also depends on whether your nerves and blood vessels were injured, and what treatment you had.\n\nMost of the time, the rods and plates used to help the bone heal will not need to be removed in a later surgery.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou may be able to start showering again about 5 to 7 days after your surgery. Ask your surgeon when you can start.\n\nTake special care when showering. Follow your surgeon's instructions closely.\n\n* If you are wearing a leg brace or immobilizer, cover it with plastic to keep it dry while you shower.\n* If you are not wearing a leg brace or immobilizer, carefully wash your incision with soap and water when your surgeon says this is OK. Gently pat it dry. Do not rub the incision or put creams or lotions on it.\n* Sit on a shower stool to avoid falling while showering.\n\nDo not soak in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your surgeon says it is OK.\n\nChange your dressing (bandage) over your incision when instructed. Gently wash the wound with soap and water and pat it dry.\n\n**Home Setup**\n\nHave a bed that is low enough so that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed.\n\nKeep tripping hazards out of your home.\n\nLearn how to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. Do not keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Have good lighting.\nMake your bathroom safer. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.\n\nDo not carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance.\n\nPut things where they are easy to reach.\n\nSet up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:\n\n* Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.\n* Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day.\n\nIf you do not have someone to help you at home for the first 1 to 2 weeks, ask your surgeon about having a trained caregiver come to your home to help you. This person can check the safety of your home and help you with your daily activities.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have:\n\n* Shortness of breath or chest pain when you breathe\n* Frequent urination or burning when you urinate\n* Redness or increasing pain around your incision\n* Drainage from your incision\n* Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)\n* Pain in your calf\n* Fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n* Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines\n* Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools, if you are taking blood thinners\n* Sudden difficulty with walking and putting weight on your leg\n\n---\n\n**Femur Fracture Repair - Discharge**\n\nYou've had surgery to repair a break in your femur (thigh bone). Now that you're home, it's essential to follow these instructions to ensure a smooth recovery.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\n*   You may be able to start showering again about 5 to 7 days after your surgery.

You may not be able to put all, some, or any weight on your leg for a while. Make sure you know the correct way to use a cane, crutches, or walker to follow the precautions.\n\nBe sure to do the exercises you were taught to help build strength and flexibility as you recover.\n\nBe careful not to stay in the same position for too long. Change your position at least once an hour.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have:\n\nShortness of breath or chest pain when you breathe\nFrequent urination or burning when you urinate\nRedness or increasing pain around your incision\nDrainage from your incision\nSwelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)\nPain in your calf\nFever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\nPain that is not controlled by your pain medicines\nNosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools, if you are taking blood thinners\nSudden difficulty with walking and putting weight on your leg\n\n---\n\n**Femur Fracture Repair - Discharge**\n\nIf you are taking blood thinners, be sure to contact your surgeon if you experience:\n\n* Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools\n\nAdditionally, contact your surgeon if you have:\n\n* Shortness of breath or chest pain when you breathe\n* Frequent urination or burning when you urinate\n* Redness or increasing pain around your incision\n* Drainage from your incision\n* Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)\n* Pain in your calf\n* Fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n* Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n* Sudden difficulty with walking and putting weight on your leg\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nORIF - femur - discharge; Open reduction internal fixation - femur - discharge\n\n**References**\n\nKalb RL, Fowler GC.

Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\n    Some medications should not be taken with fenfluramine. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting fenfluramine with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking fenfluramine, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist. Some medications may need to have their dose adjusted or require extra monitoring while receiving fenfluramine.\n\n    The following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with fenfluramine: dextromethorphan (in cough medications), St. John's Wort, and tryptophan. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking fenfluramine. Do not start any of these medications while taking fenfluramine without discussing it with your healthcare provider.\n\n    Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye that may cause vision loss) or high blood pressure. Also, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression, mood problems, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or kidney or liver disease.\n\n    Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking fenfluramine, call your doctor.\n\n    You should know that fenfluramine may make you drowsy and make it difficult for you to perform activities that require alertness or physical coordination. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\n    Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages and medications containing alcohol (cough and cold products, such as Nyquil, and other liquid products) while you are taking fenfluramine. Alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.\n\n    You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking fenfluramine. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants, such as fenfluramine, to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood.\n\n---\n\n**Fenfluramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Special Precautions**\n    *   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fenfluramine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fenfluramine oral solution.\n    *   Some medications should not be taken with fenfluramine.

    "content": "**Fenofibrate**\n\n*pronounced as (fen oh fye' brate)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFenofibrate is used with a low-fat diet, exercise, and sometimes with other medications to reduce the amounts of fatty substances such as cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of HDL (high-density lipoprotein; a type of fatty substance that decreases the risk of heart disease) in the blood. Build-up of cholesterol and fats along the walls of the arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases the blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. This increases the risk of heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Although fenofibrate decreases the levels of fatty substances in the blood, it has not been shown to decrease the risk of heart attacks or strokes.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFenofibrate comes as a capsule, a delayed-release (long-acting) capsule, and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. Some fenofibrate products (Fenoglide, Lipofen, and Lofibra) should be taken with a meal. Other brands (Antara, Fibricor, Tricor, Triglide, and Trilipix) may be taken with or without food. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not know if you should take your medication with food.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fenofibrate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fenofibrate and may increase or decrease your dose depending on the results of laboratory tests that you will take to measure the amount of fatty substances in your blood. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking fenofibrate if your test results do not show improvement after 2 months.\n\nSwallow the delayed-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are taking Triglide tablets, do not use any tablets that are chipped or broken.\n\nFenofibrate will help decrease the amount of fatty substances in your blood only as long as you continue to take it. Continue to take fenofibrate even if you feel well.

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   If you are taking a bile acid resin such as cholestyramine (Questran), colesevelam (WelChol), or colestipol (Colestid), take it 1 hour after or 4-6 hours before you take fenofibrate.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney, liver, or gallbladder disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fenofibrate.\n*   Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol and if you have or have ever had diabetes or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland).\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking fenofibrate, call your doctor.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. You should not breastfeed while you are taking fenofibrate.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\n*   Eat a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. You can also visit the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) website for additional dietary information at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/chol/chol_tlc.pdf.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\n*   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of fentanyl nasal spray and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain. Talk to your doctor about how well the medication is working and whether you are experiencing any side effects so that your doctor can decide whether your dose should be adjusted. If you still have pain 30 minutes after using fentanyl nasal spray, your doctor may tell you to use another pain medication to relieve that pain, and may increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray to treat your next episode of pain. Do not increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray unless your doctor tells you that you should.\n\nDo not use fentanyl nasal spray more than four times a day. Call your doctor if you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your other pain medication(s) to better control your pain.\n\n**Important:** Do not stop using fentanyl nasal spray without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using fentanyl nasal spray, you may experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl Nasal Spray**\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nFentanyl nasal spray comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose.

Blow your nose, if you have a runny nose.\n2.  Remove the cap from the child-resistant container and take the bottle of fentanyl nasal spray out. Remove the protective cap from the bottle tip.\n3.  Hold the bottle so that the nozzle is between your first and second fingers and your thumb is on the bottom.\n4.  If you are using a new bottle, you must prime the bottle before use. Prime the bottle by spraying 4 sprays into the pouch following the manufacturer's instructions in the Medication Guide.\n5.  Sit upright and insert the tip of the bottle approximately 1/2 inch (1 cm) into one nostril, pointing the tip toward the bridge of your nose. Close your other nostril with your finger.\n6.  Press down firmly on the finger grips until you hear a ''click'' sound. You may not feel the spray go into your nose, but as long as the number in the counting window increases by 1, the spray has been given.\n7.  Breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth one time after spraying. Do not sniff after spraying the medication into your nose.\n8.  If your doctor wants you to use two sprays, repeat steps 4 through 6, using your other nostril.\n9.

Your doctor may also prescribe you naloxone if you are living in a household where there are small children or someone who has abused street or prescription drugs.\n\nYou should make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you and your family members how to use the medication. Ask your pharmacist for the instructions or visit the manufacturer's website to get the instructions.\n\nIf symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\nSymptoms of overdose may include:\n\n* drowsiness\n* sleepiness\n* dizziness\n* confusion\n* difficulty breathing or slow or shallow breathing\n* unable to respond or wake up\n* smaller pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes)\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Overdose Prevention**\n\nWhile using fentanyl nasal spray, you should talk to your doctor about having a rescue medication called naloxone readily available (e.g., home, office).

Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to fentanyl.\n\nBefore having any laboratory test (especially those that involve methylene blue), tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are using fentanyl.\n\nDo not let anyone else use your medication, even if he or she has the same symptoms that you have. Selling or giving away this medication may cause severe harm or death to others and is against the law.\n\nThis prescription is not refillable. Be sure to schedule appointments with your doctor on a regular basis so that you do not run out of medication.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.\n\n**Brand Names**\n\nLazanda®",

Fentanyl sublingual spray should be prescribed by doctors who are experienced in treating pain in cancer patients.\n\n**Use in Cancer Patients**\n\nFentanyl sublingual spray should be used only to treat breakthrough cancer pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite around-the-clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients at least 18 years of age who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant to narcotic pain medications.\n\n**Accidental Use**\n\nFentanyl sublingual spray may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Even used fentanyl sublingual spray containers may contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults. Keep fentanyl sublingual spray out of reach of children.\n\n**Disposal**\n\nDispose of unused doses of fentanyl according to the manufacturer's directions. If fentanyl sublingual spray is used by a child or an adult who has not been prescribed the medication, get emergency medical help.\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl Sublingual Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFentanyl sublingual spray is used to treat breakthrough pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite round the clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications. Fentanyl is in a class of medications called narcotic (opiate) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFentanyl comes as a solution (liquid) to spray sublingually (under the tongue). It is used as needed to treat breakthrough pain but not more often than directed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of fentanyl sublingual spray and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain. Use one dose of fentanyl sublingual spray for breakthrough pain. If you are still in pain after your first dose, use a second dose 30 minutes after your first dose. Do not use more than two doses per breakthrough pain episode. After you treat an episode of pain using one or two doses of fentanyl sublingual spray, wait at least 4 hours after using fentanyl sublingual spray before treating a new episode of breakthrough pain.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nTaking certain medications with fentanyl sublingual spray may increase the risk that you will develop serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medications: certain antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin, in PrevPac), erythromycin (Erythocin, Eryc, Erythrocin, others), telithromycin (Ketek), and troleandomycin (TAO) (not available in the United States); certain antifungals such as fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox) and ketoconazole; aprepitant (Emend); benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), oxazepam, temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Halcion); diltiazem (Cardizem, Taztia, Tiazac, others); certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as amprenavir (Agenerase), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Invirase); medications for mental illness and nausea; muscle relaxants; nefazodone; sedatives; sleeping pills; tranquilizers; or verapamil (Calan, Covera, Verelan, in Tarka). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.\n\nIf you use fentanyl with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness.\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl Sublingual Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**How to Use Fentanyl Sublingual Spray**\n\nTo use the oral spray, follow these directions and those that appear in the package label:\n\n*   Remove the fentanyl sublingual spray unit from the blister package by cutting along the dashed line with a pair of scissors.\n*   Swallow any saliva in your mouth.\n*   Hold the fentanyl sublingual spray unit upright using your index and middle fingers and thumb.\n*   Point the nozzle into your mouth and under your tongue.\n*   Squeeze your fingers and thumb together to spray the medication under your tongue.\n*   Hold the medication under your tongue for 30 to 60 seconds.

The patch is usually applied to the skin once every 72 hours. Change your patch at about the same time of day every time you change it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply fentanyl patches exactly as directed.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose fentanyl patch and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days at first, and then not more often than once every 6 days.

    "content": "**Fentanyl: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFentanyl is a prescription medication used to treat breakthrough cancer pain in patients who are at least 18 years old (or at least 16 years old if using Actiq brand lozenges) and are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic pain medication. It should only be prescribed by doctors who are experienced in treating pain in cancer patients.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nFentanyl may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fentanyl. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a head injury, a brain tumor, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nFentanyl may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Even partially used fentanyl may contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults. Keep fentanyl out of reach of children, and if you are using the lozenges, ask your doctor how to obtain a kit from the manufacturer containing child safety locks and other supplies to prevent children from getting the medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath. If fentanyl is used by a child or an adult who has not been prescribed the medication, try to remove the medication from the person's mouth and get emergency medical help.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nFentanyl may increase the risk that you will develop serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if taken with certain medications. Tell your doctor what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nFentanyl comes as two different transmucosal products and several other types of products. The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one product cannot be substituted for any other fentanyl product. If you are switching from one product to another, your doctor will prescribe a dose that is best for you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant**\n\nIf you use fentanyl regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Information**\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with fentanyl and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Important Warning:** Fentanyl may be habit forming, especially with prolonged use.

Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment.\n* **Contraindications:** Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fentanyl. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, a brain tumor, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain.\n* **Special Precautions:** The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weak or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Indications:** Fentanyl should only be prescribed by doctors who are experienced in treating pain in cancer patients. It should be used only to treat breakthrough cancer pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite around-the-clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 16 years of age if using Actiq brand lozenges) who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications.\n* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used to treat pain other than chronic cancer pain, especially short-term pain such as migraines or other headaches, pain from an injury, or pain after a medical or dental procedure. Fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems or death if it is used by people who are not being treated with other narcotic medications or who are not tolerant to narcotic medications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Accidental Use:** Fentanyl may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication.

The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one product cannot be substituted for any other fentanyl product.\n* **Program:** A program has been set up for each fentanyl product to decrease the risk of using the medication. Your doctor will need to enroll in the program in order to prescribe fentanyl and you will need to have your prescription filled at a pharmacy that is enrolled in the program.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Pregnancy:** Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you use fentanyl regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.\n* **Postnatal Care:** Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Medication Guide:** Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with fentanyl and each time you get more medication.

It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nFentanyl is prescribed for cancer patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 16 years of age if using Actiq brand lozenges) who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant to its effects. It should be used along with your other pain medication(s). Do not stop taking your other pain medication(s) when you begin your treatment with fentanyl.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nFentanyl comes as a lozenge on a handle, a sublingual (underneath the tongue) tablet, and a buccal (between the gum and cheek) tablet to dissolve in the mouth. It is used as needed to treat breakthrough pain but not more often than four times a day.\n\nTo use fentanyl lozenges (Actiq), follow these steps:\n\n*   Check the blister package and the handle of the lozenge to make sure it contains the dose of medication you have been prescribed.\n*   Use scissors to cut open the blister package and remove the lozenge. Do not open the blister package until you are ready to use the medication.\n*   Place the lozenge in your mouth, between your cheek and gum. Actively suck on the lozenge, but do not chew, crush, or bite it. Move the lozenge around in your mouth, from one side to the other, using the handle.\n*   Do not eat or drink anything while the lozenge is in your mouth.\n*   Finish the lozenge in about 15 minutes.\n\nTo use fentanyl sublingual and buccal tablets, follow these steps:\n\n*   Separate one blister unit from the blister card by tearing along the perforations. Peel back the foil to open the blister unit. Do not try to push the tablet through the foil.\n*   Place the tablet in your mouth above one of your upper back teeth between your cheek and your gum or under your tongue as far back as you can.\n*   Leave the tablet in place until it dissolves completely. It may take 14 to 25 minutes for the tablet to dissolve.\n\nDo not split, chew, bite, or suck the tablet; do not swallow the tablet whole. If any of the tablet is left in your mouth after 30 minutes, swallow it with a drink of water.\n\n---\n\n**Fentanyl: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using Fentanyl Lozenges (Actiq)**\n\nTo use fentanyl lozenges (Actiq), follow these steps:\n\n*   Check the blister package and the handle of the lozenge to make sure the lozenge contains the dose of medication you have been prescribed.\n*   Use scissors to cut open the blister package and remove the lozenge.

Fentanyl is used as needed to treat breakthrough pain but not more often than four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of fentanyl and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain. If you still have pain after using one lozenge or tablet, your doctor may tell you to use a second lozenge or tablet. You may use the second lozenge (Actiq) 15 minutes after you finish the first lozenge, or use the second tablet (Fentora) 30 minutes after you started using the first tablet.\n\nAfter you treat an episode of pain using 1 or 2 doses of fentanyl as directed, you must wait at least 4 hours after using fentanyl lozenge or tablet before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain.

Naloxone is used to reverse the life-threatening effects of an overdose. It works by blocking the effects of opiates to relieve dangerous symptoms caused by high levels of opiates in the blood. Your doctor may also prescribe you naloxone if you are living in a household where there are small children or someone who has abused street or prescription drugs. You should make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to tell recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you and your family members how to use the medication. Ask your pharmacist for the instructions or visit the manufacturer's website to get the instructions. If symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.\n\n    Symptoms of overdose may include the following:\n    excessive drowsiness or sleepiness\n    slow or shallow breathing\n    difficulty breathing\n    cold, clammy skin\n    narrowing or widening of the pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes)\n    unable to respond or wake up\n    slowed heartbeat\n    unusual snoring\n\n*   **Important Reminders**\n    Keep all appointments with your doctor.\n\n    Do not let anyone else use your medication, even if he or she has the same symptoms that you have. Selling or giving away this medication may cause severe harm or death to others and is against the law.\n\n    This prescription is not refillable.

    "content": "**Ferritin Blood Test**\n\nA ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in your blood. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and stores it in your body. You need iron to make healthy red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organs, including brain development in children.\n\nYou get iron from eating food or taking supplements. There are iron-only supplements, but many multivitamin/mineral supplements also contain iron. Too little or too much iron in your body can cause serious health problems if not treated. A ferritin blood test can show how much iron you have stored in your body.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA ferritin blood test may be ordered as part of a group of iron tests to help check your iron levels. It can help your healthcare provider find out if your body is storing the right amount of iron to stay healthy.\n\nThe test may also be used to:\n\n* Help diagnose or rule out conditions related to iron levels, including:\n\t+ Hemochromatosis (having too much iron in your body)\n\t+ Iron deficiency anemia (having too few red blood cells because you lack iron)\n\t+ Liver diseases\n\t+ Restless legs syndrome\n\t+ Adult Still disease\n* Monitor chronic conditions that may affect your iron levels, such as cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases\n* Check for low levels of iron before symptoms develop if you are at high risk for developing iron deficiency, including:\n\t+ Being underweight\n\t+ Having heavy menstrual bleeding\n\t+ Being pregnant\n\t+ Not being able to absorb food well\n\n**Why do I need a ferritin blood test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of iron levels that are too low or too high. Symptoms of iron levels that are too low include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Weakness or fatigue\n* Dizziness\n* Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n* Pale skin\n* Restless legs syndrome\n\nSymptoms of iron levels that are too high can vary and tend to get worse over time. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Weakness or fatigue\n* Joint pain, commonly in the knees or hands\n* Loss of interest in sex or erectile dysfunction (ED)\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Change in skin color, which may look gray, metallic, or bronze\n\nYou may also need this test if the results of other blood tests show that you have low levels of hematocrit (the amount of your blood that is made up of red blood cells) or hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen throughout the body).\n\n**What happens during a ferritin blood test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider may ask you to fast (not eat or drink) for 12 hours before your test. The test is usually done in the morning. If you have any questions about how to prepare for your test, talk to your provider.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nLower than normal ferritin levels may mean you have iron deficiency anemia, or another condition related to low iron levels. Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia where your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Without treatment, it can lead to heart problems, infections, slow growth and brain development in children, and other health issues.\n\nHigher than normal ferritin levels can be caused by having too much iron in your body. Other conditions that may cause increased ferritin levels include:\n\n* Inflammation (like from infection or surgery)\n* An autoimmune disorder\n* Liver disease\n* Cancer\n* Obesity\n* Alcohol use disorder\n* Hyperthyroidism\n\nIf your ferritin results are not normal, it does not always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines can decrease or increase your ferritin levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a ferritin blood test?**\n\nMost conditions that cause too little or too much iron can be successfully treated with medicines, diet, and/or other therapies.\n\n---\n\n**Ferritin Blood Test**\n\nIf you're being treated for problems with iron, the test may be used to check how well the treatment is working.\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of iron levels that are too low or too high.\n\n* Symptoms of iron levels that are too low include:\n\t+ Shortness of breath\n\t+ Weakness or fatigue\n\t+ Dizziness\n\t+ Arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\n\t+ Pale skin\n\t+ Restless legs syndrome\n* Symptoms of iron levels that are too high can vary and tend to get worse over time.

    "content": "**Ferritin Blood Test**\n\nThe ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in the blood.\n\n**What is Ferritin?**\n\nFerritin is a protein inside your cells that stores iron. It allows your body to use the iron when it needs it. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider may tell you not to eat anything (to fast) for 12 hours before the test. You may also be told to have the test done in the morning.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe amount of ferritin in the blood (serum ferritin level) is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body. Iron is needed to make healthy red blood cells. These cells carry oxygen to body tissues.\n\nYour provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia due to low iron. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal value ranges for blood ferritin are:\n\n* Male: 30 to 400 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)\n* Female: 13 to 150 ng/mL\n\nThe lower the ferritin level, even within the normal range, the more likely it is that the person does not have enough iron.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA higher-than-normal ferritin level may be due to:\n\n* Liver disease due to alcohol abuse\n* An autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis\n* Frequent transfusion of red blood cells\n* Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis)\n\nA lower-than-normal level of ferritin occurs if you have anemia caused by low iron levels in the body. This type of anemia may be due to:\n\n* A diet too low in iron\n* Heavy bleeding from an injury\n* Heavy menstrual bleeding\n* Poor absorption of iron from food, medicines, or vitamins\n* Bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nRisks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Blood accumulating under the skin (hematoma)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum ferritin level; Iron deficiency anemia - ferritin\n\n---\n\n**Ferritin Blood Test**\n\n**What is Ferritin?**\n\nFerritin is a protein inside your cells that stores iron.

    "content": "**Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) Screening**\n\n**What are Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs)?**\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can happen in a child who was exposed to alcohol before birth (called prenatal alcohol exposure). These conditions can affect each person in different ways and can range from mild to severe. People with FASDs can have lifelong effects, including physical, emotional, and behavioral problems.\n\n**What happens when you drink alcohol during pregnancy?**\n\nWhen you drink alcohol during pregnancy, the alcohol passes to your developing baby through your placenta, the organ that nourishes your baby in your uterus. The alcohol can harm your baby’s development, damage their organs, or cause other health problems.\n\n**No amount of alcohol is safe to drink during pregnancy.**\n\nIf you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant, you should not drink alcohol. This includes hard liquor, beer, and wine. Exposing your developing baby to alcohol could cause them to have an FASD or other serious health problems.\n\n**What conditions are included in the term FASDs?**\n\nThe term FASDs includes all of the following conditions:\n\n*   **Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD)**: This condition can affect organ development. People with ARBD may have problems with the function of their heart, kidneys, hearing, vision, and/or bones.\n*   **Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE)**: People with this condition can have problems with mental health, memory, communication, impulse control, and skills of daily living.\n*   **Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopment Disorder (ARND)**: People with ARND have problems with the brain and nervous system. It can cause intellectual disabilities, and/or behavioral and learning problems.\n*   **Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)**: This is the most severe type of FASD. It causes both birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n*   **Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS)**: People with pFAS have some of the symptoms of an FASD, such as changes to their facial features. But the condition is not as severe as the other disorders.\n\n**What is the purpose of an FASDs screening?**\n\nThe screening is used to find out if your child has an FASD. There is no cure for FASDs, but early diagnosis and treatment may help reduce some of the symptoms and help your child reach their full potential.\n\n**Why does my child need an FASDs screening?**\n\nA screening may be needed if you drank alcohol during your pregnancy and/or your child has symptoms of an FASD. Symptoms may include a mix of physical problems, intellectual disabilities, and problems coping with daily living. They can range from mild to severe and will vary depending on your child's age.\n\n**What happens during an FASDs screening?**\n\nThere is no single test for FASDs. But your provider may:\n\n*   Check for intellectual disabilities and developmental delays\n*   Look for certain physical features such as a small head, small eyes, and thin upper lip\n*   See if your child's weight and height are below normal\n*   Look for behavioral symptoms such as short attention span and problems with impulse control\n*   Check your child's coordination, vision, and hearing\n\n**Will my child need to do anything to prepare for this test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for an FASD screening.\n\n**Are there any risks to this test?**\n\nThere are no risks to having an FASDs screening.\n\n---\n\n**Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Screening**\n\n**What are Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders?**\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can happen in a child who was exposed to alcohol before birth. These conditions can affect each person in different ways and can range from mild to severe.\n\n**Physical Issues:**\n\n*   Abnormal facial features, such as small eyes, thin upper lip, and smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip\n*   Small head size\n*   Lower than average height and weight\n*   Poor coordination\n*   Vision and hearing problems\n*   Problems with their heart, kidneys, or bones\n\n**Learning Challenges:**\n\n*   Intellectual disability\n*   Delayed development\n*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Poor memory\n*   Speech and language delays\n\n**Behavioral Issues:**\n\n*   Hyperactivity\n*   Poor social skills\n*   Poor reasoning and judgment\n\n**What Happens During an FASDs Screening?**\n\nThere is no single test for FASDs. But your provider may:\n\n*   Check for intellectual disabilities and developmental delays\n*   Look for certain physical features such as a small head, small eyes, and thin upper lip\n*   See if your child's weight and height are below normal\n*   Look for behavioral symptoms such as short attention span and problems with impulse control\n*   Check your child's coordination, vision, and hearing\n\nSome providers may also use a method called the 4-digit code when they do a physical exam on your child to check for FASDs. Your provider will rate each category on a scale of one to four, and then add the numbers.\n\n**Will My Child Need to Do Anything to Prepare for This Test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for an FASD screening.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to This Test?**\n\nThere are no risks to having an FASDs screening.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your child is diagnosed with an FASD, your provider may recommend several treatment options. There is no cure for these disorders, but the following may greatly improve a child's development and quality of life:\n\n*   Working with a team of providers that can include a special education teacher, speech therapist, physical and occupational therapists, and mental health professionals\n*   Special services in school to help with learning and behavior difficulties\n*   Behavior modification therapy\n*   Mental health therapy\n*   Social skill training\n*   Vocational and life skill therapy\n*   Medicines to help with some symptoms\n\n---\n\n**Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Screening**\n\nBecause brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. Your provider can recommend counseling and treatment programs.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Pediatrics. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Assessment.\n* Astley SJ.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most severe form of FASD._\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Using alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general.\n*   Drinking alcohol easily passes across the placenta to the fetus, posing extra risks to an unborn baby.\n*   There is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA baby with FAS may have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Poor growth while the baby is in the womb and after birth\n*   Decreased muscle tone and poor coordination\n*   Delayed developmental milestones\n*   Vision difficulties, such as nearsightedness (myopia)\n*   Hyperactivity\n*   Anxiety\n*   Extreme nervousness\n*   Short attention span\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam of the baby may show a heart murmur or other heart problems. A common defect is a hole in the wall that separates the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.\n\nThere also may be problems with the face and bones. These may include:\n\n*   Narrow and small eyes\n*   Small head and upper jaw\n*   Smooth groove in the upper lip or smooth and thin upper lip\n*   Deformed ears\n*   Flat, short, and upturned nose\n*   Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelids)\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Blood alcohol level in pregnant women who show signs of being drunk (intoxicated)\n*   Brain imaging tests (CT or MRI) after the child is born\n*   Pregnancy ultrasound\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWomen who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should not drink any amount of alcohol. Pregnant women with alcohol use disorder should join a rehab program and be checked closely by their health care provider throughout their pregnancy.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome for infants with FAS varies. Almost none of these babies have normal brain development.\n\nInfants and children with FAS have many different problems, which can be difficult to manage. Children do best if they are diagnosed early and referred to a team of providers who can work on educational and behavioral strategies that fit the child's needs.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if you are drinking alcohol regularly or heavily, and are finding it difficult to cut back or stop. Also contact your provider if you are drinking alcohol in any amount while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoiding alcohol during pregnancy prevents FAS. Counseling can help women who have already had a child with FAS.\n\nSexually active women who drink heavily should use birth control and control their drinking behaviors, or stop using alcohol before trying to get pregnant.\n\n---\n\n**Fetal Alcohol Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nUsing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general.

Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm an unborn baby.\n\nThere is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.\n\nTiming of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Drinking alcohol is likely most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy. But drinking alcohol any time during pregnancy can be harmful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA baby with FAS may have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Poor growth while the baby is in the womb and after birth\n*   Decreased muscle tone and poor coordination\n*   Delayed developmental milestones\n*   Vision difficulties, such as nearsightedness (myopia)\n*   Hyperactivity\n*   Anxiety\n*   Extreme nervousness\n*   Short attention span\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam of the baby may show a heart murmur or other heart problems.

Because it's impossible to know exactly when conception occurs, gestational age is measured from the first day of the mother's last menstrual cycle to the current date. It is measured in weeks.\n\nThis means that during weeks 1 and 2 of pregnancy, a woman is not yet pregnant. This is when your body is preparing for a baby. A normal gestation lasts anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks.\n\n**Week 3**\n\nDuring intercourse, sperm enters the vagina after the man ejaculates. The strongest sperm will travel through the cervix (the opening of the womb, or uterus), and into the fallopian tubes.\nA single sperm and the mother's egg cell meet in the fallopian tube. When the single sperm enters the egg, conception occurs. The combined sperm and egg is called a zygote.\nThe zygote contains all of the genetic information (DNA) needed to become a baby. Half the DNA comes from the mother's egg and half from the father's sperm.\n\n**Week 4**\n\nOnce the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it buries itself in the uterine wall.\nAt this point in the mother's menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus is thick with blood and ready to support a baby.\nThe blastocyst sticks tightly to the wall of the uterus and receives nourishment from the mother's blood.\n\n**Week 5**\n\nWeek 5 is the start of the \"embryonic period.\" This is when all the baby's major systems and structures develop.\nThe embryo's cells multiply and start to take on specific functions.

    "content": "**Fetal Echocardiography**\n\nFetal echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves (ultrasound) to evaluate the baby's heart for problems before birth.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nFetal echocardiography is a test that is done while the baby is still in the womb. It is most often done during the second trimester of pregnancy, when a woman is about 18 to 24 weeks pregnant. The procedure is similar to that of a pregnancy ultrasound.\n\n*   **Abdominal Ultrasound**: A clear, water-based gel is placed on your belly, and a hand-held probe is moved over the area. The probe sends out sound waves, which bounce off the baby's heart and create a picture of the heart on a computer screen.\n*   **Transvaginal Ultrasound**: A much smaller probe is placed into the vagina. This type of ultrasound can be done earlier in the pregnancy and produces a clearer image than an abdominal ultrasound.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet. You will not feel the ultrasound waves.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to detect a heart problem before the baby is born. It can provide a more detailed image of the baby's heart than a regular pregnancy ultrasound.\n\nThe test can show:\n\n*   Blood flow through the heart\n*   Heart rhythm\n*   Structures of the baby's heart\n\nThe test may be done if:\n\n*   A parent, sibling or other close family member had a heart defect or heart disease.\n*   A routine pregnancy ultrasound detected an abnormal heart rhythm or possible heart problem in the unborn baby.\n*   The mother has diabetes (prior to pregnancy), lupus, or phenylketonuria.\n*   The mother has rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n*   The mother has used medicines that can damage the baby's developing heart (such as some epilepsy drugs and prescription acne medicines).\n*   An amniocentesis revealed a chromosome disorder.\n*   There is some other reason to suspect that the baby is at higher risk for heart problems.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe echocardiogram finds no problems in the unborn baby's heart.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n*   A problem with the way the baby's heart has formed (congenital heart disease)\n*   A problem with the way the baby's heart works\n*   Heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias)\n\nThe test may need to be repeated.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no known risks to the mother or unborn baby.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nSome heart defects cannot be seen before birth, even with fetal echocardiography. These include small holes in the heart or mild valve problems. Also, because it may not be possible to see every part of the large blood vessels leading out of the baby's heart, problems in this area may go undetected. It may still be necessary to repeat an ultrasound of the baby's heart following delivery to confirm findings seen on fetal echocardiography and evaluate areas not previously seen clearly.\n\nIf the health care provider finds a problem in the structure of the heart, a detailed ultrasound may be done to look for other problems with the developing baby.\n\n---\n\n**Fetal Echocardiography**\n\nFetal echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves (ultrasound) to evaluate the baby's heart for problems before birth.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nFetal echocardiography is a test that is done while the baby is still in the womb. It is most often done during the second trimester of pregnancy, when a woman is about 18 to 24 weeks pregnant. The procedure is similar to that of a pregnancy ultrasound. You will lie down for the procedure.\n\nThe test can be performed on your belly (abdominal ultrasound) or through your vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). In an abdominal ultrasound, the person performing the test places a clear, water-based gel on your belly. A hand-held probe is moved over the area. The probe sends out sound waves, which bounce off the baby's heart and create a picture of the heart on a computer screen.\n\nIn a transvaginal ultrasound, a much smaller probe is placed into the vagina. A transvaginal ultrasound can be done earlier in the pregnancy and produces a clearer image than an abdominal ultrasound.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet.

    "content": "**Fetal-Maternal Erythrocyte Distribution Blood Test**\n\nThe fetal-maternal erythrocyte distribution test measures the number of an unborn baby's red blood cells in a pregnant woman's blood.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n* A blood sample is needed from the mother.\n* The sample will be analyzed to determine the amount of the baby's red blood cells present.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n* No special preparation is necessary for this test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n* Rh incompatibility occurs when a pregnant woman's blood type is Rh-negative (Rh-) and her unborn baby's blood type is Rh-positive (Rh+).\n* If the mother's blood is Rh- and the baby's blood is Rh+, the mother's body may produce antibodies that could harm the baby's red blood cells.\n* This test determines the amount of blood exchanged between the mother and fetus, which can help prevent anemia in the unborn baby.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\n* In a normal value, no or few of the baby's cells are present in the mother's blood.\n* The standard dose of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) is sufficient to prevent the production of abnormal proteins that attack the unborn baby in future pregnancies.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\n* An abnormal test result indicates that blood from the unborn baby is leaking into the mother's bloodstream.\n* The more of the baby's cells present, the more Rh immune globulin the mother will need to receive to prevent harm to the unborn baby.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others due to variations in vein and artery size.\n* Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, multiple punctures, fainting, hematoma, or infection.\n\n---\n\n**Fetal-Maternal Erythrocyte Distribution Blood Test**\n\n**No Special Preparation Necessary**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain, while others may only experience a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but this usually goes away soon.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nRh incompatibility occurs when the mother's blood type is Rh-negative (Rh-) and her unborn baby's blood type is Rh-positive (Rh+). If the mother is Rh+, or if both parents are Rh-, there is no reason to worry about Rh incompatibility. However, if the baby's blood is Rh+ and gets into the mother's Rh- bloodstream, her body will produce antibodies that could harm the developing baby's red blood cells, causing mild to serious anemia.\n\nThis test determines the amount of blood exchanged between the mother and fetus. All Rh- pregnant women should get this test if they have bleeding or a risk of bleeding during pregnancy. It helps find out how much Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) is needed to prevent abnormal proteins from attacking the unborn baby in future pregnancies.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIn a normal value, no or few of the baby's cells are in the mother's blood, and the standard dose of Rh immune globulin is sufficient. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal test result indicates that blood from the unborn baby is leaking into the mother's blood circulation. The more of the baby's cells present, the more Rh immune globulin the mother must receive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size, making it more difficult to take blood from some people than others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, multiple punctures to locate veins, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nKleihauer-Betke stain; Flow cytometry - fetal-maternal erythrocyte distribution; Rh incompatibility - erythrocyte distribution\n\n**References**\n\nCooling L, Downs T.

If the fever is very high, your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with fevers should not take aspirin.

Drink fluids and rest.\n\nThe illness is probably not serious if your child:\n\n*   Is still interested in playing\n*   Is eating and drinking well\n*   Is alert and smiling at you\n*   Has a normal skin color\n*   Looks well when their temperature comes down\n\nTake steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever.\n\nWhen trying to lower a fever:\n\n*   Do not bundle up someone who has chills.\n*   Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool.\n*   Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep.\n*   If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.\n*   A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.\n*   Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.\n\nHere are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever:\n\n*   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine.\n*   Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat.\n*   Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.\n*   Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you to.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider right away if your child:\n\n*   Is 3 months or younger and has a rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher\n*   Is 3 to 12 months old and has a fever of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher\n*   Is 2 years or younger and has a fever that lasts longer than 24 to 48 hours\n*   Is older and has a fever for longer than 48 to 72 hours\n*   Has a fever of 105°F (40.5°C) or higher, unless it comes down readily with treatment and the person is comfortable\n*   Has other symptoms that suggest an illness may need to be treated, such as a sore throat, earache, or cough\n*   Has had fevers come and go for up to a week or more, even if these fevers are not very high\n*   Has a serious medical illness, such as a heart problem, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, or cystic fibrosis\n*   Recently had an immunization\n*   Has a new rash or bruises\n*   Has pain with urination\n*   Has a weakened immune system (because of long-term [chronic] steroid or immune suppressing therapy, a bone marrow or organ transplant, spleen removal, HIV/AIDS, or cancer treatment)\n*   Has recently traveled to another country\n\nContact your provider right away if you are an adult and you:\n\n*   Have a fever that lasts longer than 48 to 72 hours\n*   Have a fever of 105°F (40.5°C) or higher, unless it comes down readily with treatment and the person is comfortable\n*   Have other symptoms that suggest an illness may need to be treated, such as a sore throat, earache, or cough\n*   Have had fevers come and go for up to a week or more, even if these fevers are not very high\n*   Have a serious medical illness, such as a heart problem, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, or cystic fibrosis\n*   Recently had an immunization\n*   Have a new rash or bruises\n*   Have pain with urination\n*   Have a weakened immune system (because of long-term [chronic] steroid or immune suppressing therapy, a bone marrow or organ transplant, spleen removal, HIV/AIDS, or cancer treatment)\n*   Have recently traveled to another country\n\n---\n\n**Fever: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/6)**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAlmost any infection can cause a fever, including:\n\n*   Bone infections (osteomyelitis), appendicitis, skin infections or cellulitis, and meningitis\n*   Respiratory infections such as colds or flu-like illnesses, sore throats (pharyngitis), ear infections (otitis), sinus infections (sinusitis), mononucleosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis\n*   Urinary tract infections\n*   Viral gastroenteritis and bacterial gastroenteritis\n\nChildren and adults may have a low-grade fever for 1 or 2 days after some immunizations.\n\nTeething may cause a slight increase in a child's temperature, but not higher than 100°F (37.8°C).\n\nAutoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers.

    "content": "**Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine is used in adults and children 12 years of age and older to relieve the allergy symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever'), including runny nose; sneezing; congestion (stuffy nose); red, itchy, or watery eyes; or itching of the nose, throat, or roof of the mouth.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine 12-hour tablet is usually taken once or twice a day on an empty stomach with water. The fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine 24-hour tablet is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach with water.\n\nFexofenadine and pseudoephedrine will work better if it is not taken with fruit juices such as orange, grapefruit, or apple juice. Take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nTake fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nFexofenadine and pseudoephedrine controls the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis but does not cure this condition. Continue to take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine even if you feel well and are not experiencing these symptoms. If you wait too long between doses, your symptoms may become worse.\n\nSwallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n\n---\n\n**Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Before Taking Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fexofenadine (Allegra), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, in Dimetapp, in Drixoral, others), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl), and tranylcypromine (Parnate).\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   If you are taking an antacid containing aluminum or magnesium (Maalox, Mylanta, others), take the antacid a few hours before or after fexofenadine.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Tell your doctor if you have glaucoma, difficulty urinating, high blood pressure, or coronary artery disease (condition that occurs when the blood vessels of the heart are narrowed by fat or cholesterol deposits). Also tell your doctor if you have had symptoms such as insomnia, dizziness, weakness, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, or a fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat after taking adrenergic medications such as phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine), or epinephrine (Primatene Mist, EpiPen). Your doctor may tell you not to take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had angina (chest pain or pressure), diabetes, a heart attack, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) , prostatic hypertrophy (an enlarged prostate), or heart or kidney disease.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine, call your doctor.\n\n**What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, sodas, and energy drinks) may increase the restlessness and insomnia caused by pseudoephedrine in sensitive individuals, so you may wish to drink less of these beverages. Talk to your doctor about drinking these beverages while taking this medication.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Forget a Dose?**\n\n*   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\n*   Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n    *   headache\n    *   nausea\n    *   stomach pain\n    *   heartburn\n    *   dry mouth\n    *   throat irritation\n    *   back pain\n    *   pale skin\n*   Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n    *   nervousness\n    *   dizziness\n    *   difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n    *   weakness\n    *   fear, anxiety, or tenseness\n    *   hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist)\n    *   shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control\n    *   seizure\n    *   fainting\n    *   blurred vision\n    *   hives\n    *   rash\n    *   itching\n    *   difficulty breathing or swallowing\n    *   swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n    *   hoarseness\n    *   fast pounding, or irregular heartbeat\n    *   difficulty or pain when urinating\n\n---\n\n**Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n*   irregular heartbeat\n*   difficulty or pain when urinating\n\n    Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine may cause other side effects.

It is an important part of a healthy diet._\n\n**Function**\n\n_Dietary fiber adds bulk to your diet. Because it makes you feel full faster, it can help with weight control. Fiber aids digestion and helps prevent constipation. It is sometimes used for the treatment of diverticulosis, diabetes, and heart disease._\n\n_In Western societies such as the United States, a diet low in fiber has been linked to higher rates of:_\n\n_* Irritable bowel syndrome_\n_* Diabetes_\n_* Obesity_\n_* Cardiovascular disease_\n_* Colon cancer_*\n\n**Food Sources**\n\n_Dietary fiber is found in two forms: soluble and insoluble._\n\n_Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. Research has shown that soluble fiber lowers cholesterol, which may help prevent heart disease._\n\n_Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains. It appears to speed the passage of foods through the stomach and intestines and adds bulk to the stool._\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n_Eating a large amount of fiber in a short period of time can cause intestinal gas (flatulence), bloating, and abdominal cramps. This problem often goes away once the natural bacteria in the digestive system get used to the increase in fiber. Adding fiber to the diet slowly, instead of all at one time, can help reduce gas or diarrhea._\n\n_Too much fiber may interfere with the absorption of minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium. In most cases, this is not a cause for too much concern because high-fiber foods tend to be rich in minerals._\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n_On average, Americans now eat about 16 grams of fiber per day. The recommendation for older children, adolescents, and adults is to eat 21 to 38 grams of fiber each day. Younger children will not be able to eat enough calories to achieve this amount, but it is a good idea to introduce whole grains, fresh fruits, and other high-fiber foods._\n\n_To ensure that you get enough fiber, eat a variety of foods, including:_\n\n_* Cereals_\n_* Dried beans and peas_\n_* Fruits_\n_* Vegetables_\n_* Whole grains_*\n\n_Add fiber gradually over a period of a few weeks to avoid stomach distress.

Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**What are some alternative names for the FDPs blood test?**\n\nFDPs; FSPs; Fibrin split products; Fibrin breakdown products\n\n**References:**\n\nLevi M.

    "content": "**Fibrinogen Blood Test**\n\n_Fibrinogen is a protein produced by the liver that helps stop bleeding by forming blood clots. A blood test can measure how much fibrinogen you have in your blood._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n*   A sample of blood is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   No special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n*   When the needle is inserted, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging.\n*   Afterward, there may be throbbing or slight bruising, which soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n*   Your health care provider may order this test if you have problems with blood clotting, such as excessive bleeding.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\n*   The normal range is 200 to 400 mg/dL (2.0 to 4.0 g/L).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\n*   Abnormal results may be due to:\n    *   The body using up too much fibrinogen, such as in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n    *   Fibrinogen deficiency (from birth or acquired after birth)\n    *   Breakdown of fibrin (fibrinolysis)\n    *   Too much bleeding (hemorrhage)\n\n**Risks**\n\n*   There is little risk involved with having your blood taken.\n*   Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n    *   Excessive bleeding\n    *   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n    *   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n    *   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n    *   Infection\n\n---\n\n**Fibrinogen Blood Test**\n\n**Normal Value Ranges**\n\nThe normal range for fibrinogen blood test is 200 to 400 mg/dL (2.0 to 4.0 g/L). However, normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n*   The body using up too much fibrinogen, such as in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n*   Fibrinogen deficiency (from birth, or acquired after birth)\n*   Breakdown of fibrin (fibrinolysis)\n*   Too much bleeding (hemorrhage)\n\nThe test may also be performed during pregnancy if the placenta separates from its attachment to the uterus wall (placenta abruption).\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\nThis test is most often performed on people who have bleeding disorders. The risk for excessive bleeding is slightly greater in such people than it is for those who do not have bleeding problems.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum fibrinogen; Plasma fibrinogen; Factor I; Hypofibrinogenemia test\n\n**References**\n\nPai M, Moffat KA.
