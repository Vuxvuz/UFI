This opening is called a hernia.\n\n**Why is it necessary?**\nThis rare type of birth defect needs to be addressed as early as possible after the baby is born, as it can be life-threatening and most babies with CDH are very ill.\n\n**Description**\n\nUntil the surgery is done, and usually for some time afterwards, nearly all infants need a breathing machine to improve their oxygen levels. Many babies with CDH will require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which uses a pump to circulate blood through an artificial lung and back into the bloodstream of the baby.\n\nThe surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain). The surgeon usually makes a cut (incision) in the belly under the lower ribs. This allows the organs in the area to be reached. The surgeon gently pulls these organs down into place through the opening in the diaphragm and into the abdominal cavity.\n\nIn less severe cases, the surgery can be done using smaller incisions in the chest. A small video camera called a thoracoscope is placed through one of the incisions. This allows the surgeon to view inside the chest. Instruments to repair the hole in the diaphragm are placed through the other incisions.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe diaphragm is a muscle that separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area. In a child with CDH, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed, allowing organs from the belly to go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are.\n\n**Risks**\n\nBreathing problems, which may be severe\nBleeding\nCollapsed lung\nLung problems that do not go away\nInfection\nReactions to medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBabies born with CDH usually need a breathing tube following birth and are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). It may be days or weeks before the baby is stable enough for surgery. Because the condition is life-threatening and transporting a very ill newborn is risky, babies who are known to have CDH should be delivered in a center with pediatric surgeons and neonatologists.\n\nIn the NICU, your baby will probably need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) before the surgery. This helps the baby breathe.\nIf your child is very sick, a heart-lung bypass machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenator, or ECMO) may be needed to do the work of the heart and lungs.\nBefore surgery, your baby will have x-rays and regular blood tests to see how well the lungs are working. A light sensor (called a pulse oximeter) is taped to your baby's skin to monitor the oxygen level in the blood.\nYour baby may be given medicines to control blood pressure and stay comfortable.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour baby will be on a breathing machine after the surgery and will stay in the hospital for several weeks. Once taken off the breathing machine, your baby may still need oxygen and medicines for a while.\n\nFeedings will start after your baby's bowels start working. Feedings are usually given through a small, soft feeding tube from the mouth or nose into the stomach or small intestine until your baby can take milk by mouth.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of this surgery depends on how well your baby's lungs have developed. Some babies have other medical problems, especially with the heart, brain, muscles, and joints, which often affect how well the baby does.\n\nUsually the outlook is good for infants who have well-developed lung tissue and no other problems. Even so, most babies who are born with a diaphragmatic hernia are very ill and will stay in the hospital for a long time. With advances in medicine, the outlook for these infants is improving.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Repair**\n\n**What is it?**\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair is surgery to close an opening or space in a baby's diaphragm. This opening is called a hernia.\n\n**Why is it necessary?**\nIt is a rare type of birth defect. Congenital means the problem is present at birth.\n\n**Description**\n\nUntil the surgery is done, and usually for some time afterwards, nearly all infants need a breathing machine to improve their oxygen levels. Many babies with CDH will require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which uses a pump to circulate blood through an artificial lung and back into the bloodstream of the baby.\n\nThe surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain).

A small video camera called a thoracoscope is placed through one of the incisions. This allows the surgeon to view inside the chest. Instruments to repair the hole in the diaphragm are placed through the other incisions.\n\nIn either type of operation, the surgeon repairs the hole in the diaphragm. If the hole is small, it may be repaired with stitches. Otherwise, an artificial patch is used to cover the hole.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe diaphragm is a muscle. It is essential for normal breathing. It separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area.\n\nIn a child with CDH, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed. The CDH opening allows organs from the belly (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines) to go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are. This can prevent the lungs from growing and developing normally in the womb. The blood vessels in the lungs can also develop abnormally. This can cause difficulty breathing both before and after the repair surgery. It can result in not enough oxygen getting into the baby's body.\n\nDepending on much space in the chest is taken up by the abdominal organs, and when this happened during development in the womb, there can be varying outcomes.\n\nA diaphragmatic hernia can be life threatening and most babies with CDH are very ill. Surgery to repair CDH must be done as early as possible after the baby is born. Even after surgery, some babies' lungs are not able to function on their own because they are so underdeveloped.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for this surgery include:\n\n* Breathing problems, which may be severe\n* Bleeding\n* Collapsed lung\n* Lung problems that do not go away\n* Infection\n* Reactions to medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBabies born with CDH usually need a breathing tube following birth and are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

A light sensor (called a pulse oximeter) is taped to your baby's skin to monitor the oxygen level in the blood.\nYour baby may be given medicines to control blood pressure and stay comfortable.\n\nYour baby will have tubes placed:\n\n* From the mouth or nose to the stomach to keep air out of the stomach\n* In an artery to monitor blood pressure\n* In a vein to deliver nutrients and medicines\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYour baby will be on a breathing machine after the surgery and will stay in the hospital for several weeks. Once taken off the breathing machine, your baby may still need oxygen and medicines for a while.\n\nFeedings will start after your baby's bowels start working. Feedings are usually given through a small, soft feeding tube from the mouth or nose into the stomach or small intestine until your baby can take milk by mouth.\n\nNearly all infants with CDH have reflux when they eat. This means the food or acid in their stomach moves up into their esophagus, the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This can be uncomfortable. It also leads to frequent spitting up and vomiting, which makes feedings more difficult once your baby is taking food by mouth. Reflux increases the risk for pneumonia if babies inhale milk into their lungs. It can also make it challenging for babies to take in enough calories to grow.\n\nThe nurses and feeding specialists will teach you ways to hold and feed your baby to prevent reflux. Some babies need to be on a feeding tube for a long time to help them get enough calories to grow.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of this surgery depends on how well your baby's lungs have developed. Some babies have other medical problems, especially with the heart, brain, muscles, and joints, which often affect how well the baby does.\n\nUsually the outlook is good for infants who have well-developed lung tissue and no other problems. Even so, most babies who are born with a diaphragmatic hernia are very ill and will stay in the hospital for a long time. With advances in medicine, the outlook for these infants is improving.\n\nAll babies who have had CDH repairs will need to be watched closely to make sure the hole in their diaphragm does not open up again as they grow.\n\nBabies who had a large opening or defect in the diaphragm, or who had more problems with their lungs after birth, may have lung disease after they leave the hospital. They may need oxygen, medicines, and a feeding tube for months or years.\n\nSome babies will have problems crawling, walking, talking, and eating. They will need to see physical or occupational therapists to help them develop muscles and strength.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Repair**\n\nUntil the surgery is done, and usually for some time afterwards, nearly all infants need a breathing machine to improve their oxygen levels.

    "content": "**Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\n_Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a rare group of inherited blood disorders that affects the development of red blood cells._\n\n*   In people with CDA, immature red blood cells do not develop into normal, mature cells.\n*   As a result, affected individuals have a significant reduction in the number of functional red blood cells (anemia).\n*   The term \"dyserythropoietic\" refers to the abnormal red blood cell shape that occurs in people with this condition.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with CDA typically have mild to moderate anemia. In some cases, affected individuals have severe anemia that may require frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells.\n\n*   The signs and symptoms of CDA can include:\n    *   Tiredness (fatigue)\n    *   Weakness\n    *   Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n    *   An enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)\n    *   Iron overload, which can damage tissues and organs\n\n**Types of CDA**\n\nThere are multiple types of CDA. Each type has a different genetic cause and distinct but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms.\n\n*   **CDA Type I**: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia that typically begins in childhood or adolescence.\n    *   Individuals with CDA type I can have skeletal issues, including short stature or abnormalities of the fingers or toes.\n*   **CDA Type II**: The anemia associated with CDA type II can range from mild to severe and usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood.\n    *   Individuals with CDA type II may develop hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones.\n*   **CDA Type III**: Can result in anemia that ranges from mild to severe, depending on the genetic cause, and typically begins in infancy or childhood.\n    *   Some people with CDA type III do not receive a diagnosis until later in life because they have very mild symptoms.\n    *   In some cases, individuals with CDA type III develop a blood disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy, which can lead to multiple myeloma.\n*   **CDA Type IV**: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia that typically develops early in life.\n    *   Affected individuals can have extensive swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis).\n    *   In addition to the signs and symptoms common to all types of CDA, individuals with CDA type IV often have short stature.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia?**\n\nCongenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a rare group of inherited blood disorders that affects the development of red blood cells. In people with CDA, immature red blood cells do not develop into normal, mature cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nThere are multiple types of CDA, each with a different genetic cause and distinct but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms.\n\n*   **CDA Type I**: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia that typically begins in childhood or adolescence. Individuals with CDA type I can have skeletal issues, including short stature or abnormalities of the fingers or toes.\n*   **CDA Type II**: The most common form of the disorder, characterized by mild to severe anemia that usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Individuals with CDA type II may develop hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones.\n*   **CDA Type III**: Can result in anemia that ranges from mild to severe, depending on the genetic cause, and typically begins in infancy or childhood. Some people with CDA type III do not receive a diagnosis until later in life because they have very mild symptoms.\n*   **CDA Type IV**: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia that typically develops early in life. Affected individuals can have extensive swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis). Individuals with CDA type IV often have short stature.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in multiple genes have been found to cause CDA. These variants disrupt the normal development of red blood cells (erythropoiesis), leading to abnormal erythroblasts that either develop into irregular red blood cells or do not develop at all.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nCDA is a rare disorder, though the exact prevalence of CDA is unknown. CDA type II is the most common form of the disorder. Because CDA is rare and the signs and symptoms may be mild or overlap with those of other disorders, many cases likely remain undiagnosed or are incorrectly diagnosed as other disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\n**Causes and Genetics**\n\nCongenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal red blood cell production. The causes of CDA vary depending on the type, but they all involve genetic mutations that disrupt normal erythropoiesis.\n\n*   **CDA Type I**: Caused by variants in the CDAN1 or CDIN1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that can attach to each other and play roles in cell division and erythropoiesis.\n*   **CDA Type II**: Caused by variants in the SEC23B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the transport of other proteins within cells.\n*   **CDA Type III**: Caused by variants in either the KIF23 or RACGAP1 gene. The KIF23 and RACGAP1 genes provide instructions for making proteins that can bind to each other to form a complex, playing a critical role in cell division and erythropoiesis.\n*   **CDA Type IV**: Caused by variants in the KLF1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of genes involved in erythropoiesis.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of CDA depends on the type of the disorder:\n\n*   **CDA Types I and II**: Inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.\n*   **CDA Type IV**: Appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Understanding CDA**\n\nCDAN1, CDIN1, KIF23, KLF1, RACGAP1, and SEC23B are genes associated with Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. Variants (also called mutations) in these genes cause CDA by disrupting the normal development of red blood cells (erythropoiesis). In people with CDA, immature red blood cells called erythroblasts are unusually shaped and have other abnormalities.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n*   Learn more about the genes associated with Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia\n*   Understand the inheritance pattern of CDA types I, II, III, and IV\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\n* Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\n* When CDA type III is caused by variants in the KIF23 gene, it is also inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n* When CDA type III is caused by variants in the RACGAP1 gene, it is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Anemia, dyserythropoietic, congenital\n* CDA\n* Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE IIIa; CDAN3A\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE II; CDAN2\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE Ia; CDAN1A\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE IVa; CDAN4A\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE Ib; CDAN1B\n\t+ ANEMIA, CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC, TYPE IIIb, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; CDAN3B\n\n**References**\n\n* Denecke J, Marquardt T.

There are four types of CDA: I, II, III, and IV.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\n*   **Type I**: Also known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), this type is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene. It is characterized by a mild anemia that improves with age.\n*   **Type II**: This type is caused by a mutation in the SEC23B gene and is characterized by a severe anemia that requires frequent blood transfusions.\n*   **Type III**: Also known as CDA III, this type is caused by a mutation in the SLC40A1 gene and is characterized by a mild anemia that improves with age.\n*   **Type IV**: This type is caused by a mutation in the KLF1 gene and is characterized by a severe anemia that requires frequent blood transfusions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nThe symptoms of CDA can vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Anemia**: A decrease in the number of red blood cells, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin.\n*   **Jaundice**: A yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes due to an accumulation of bilirubin.\n*   **Enlarged liver**: An enlargement of the liver due to an accumulation of abnormal red blood cells.\n*   **Splenomegaly**: An enlargement of the spleen due to an accumulation of abnormal red blood cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nThe treatment and management of CDA depend on the type and severity of the disorder. Common treatments include:\n\n*   **Blood transfusions**: Regular blood transfusions may be necessary to manage the anemia.\n*   **Supportive care**: Supportive care, such as iron supplements and antibiotics, may be necessary to manage related complications.\n*   **Bone marrow transplantation**: In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be necessary to replace the abnormal red blood cells with healthy ones.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nThe prognosis of CDA varies depending on the type and severity of the disorder. Generally, the prognosis is poor for severe forms of the disorder, such as Type II and IV. However, mild forms of the disorder, such as Type I and III, may have a better prognosis with proper treatment and management.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic Counseling for Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nGenetic counseling is an important aspect of managing CDA. Parents who are considering having children should be aware of the risk of passing on the disorder to their offspring. Genetic testing can help identify carriers of the disorder, which can inform reproductive decisions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics and Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia**\n\nGenetic disorders, such as CDA, are caused by mutations in specific genes that affect health and development. Understanding genetics is essential for managing genetic conditions and making informed reproductive decisions. By learning about the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited, individuals can better understand their risk of passing on the disorder to their offspring.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

    "content": "**Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency**\n\n**What is Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency?**\n\nCongenital fibrinogen deficiency is a very rare, inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It affects a protein called fibrinogen, which is needed for the blood to clot.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThis disease is due to a deficiency of the amount or function of fibrinogen. How fibrinogen is affected depends on how the genes that determine how it is formed are inherited:\n\n*   When the abnormal gene is passed down from both parents, a person will have a complete lack of fibrinogen (afibrinogenemia).\n*   When the abnormal gene is passed down from one parent, a person will have either a reduced level of fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) or a problem with the function of fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia). Sometimes, these two fibrinogen problems can occur in the same person.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with a complete lack of fibrinogen may have any of the following bleeding symptoms:\n\n*   Bruising easily\n*   Bleeding from the umbilical cord just after birth\n*   Bleeding in the mucous membranes\n*   Bleeding in the brain (very rare)\n*   Bleeding in the joints\n*   Heavy bleeding after injury or surgery\n*   Nosebleeds that do not stop easily\n\nPeople with a reduced level of fibrinogen bleed less often and the bleeding is not as severe when compared to people with no fibrinogen at all. Those with a problem with the function of fibrinogen often don't have symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIf your health care provider suspects this problem, you will have lab tests to confirm the type and severity of the disorder.\n\nTests include:\n\n*   Bleeding time\n*   Fibrinogen test and reptilase time to check fibrin level and quality\n*   Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)\n*   Prothrombin time (PT)\n*   Thrombin time\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe following treatments can be used for bleeding episodes or to prepare for surgery:\n\n*   Cryoprecipitate (a blood product containing concentrated fibrinogen and other clotting factors)\n*   Fibrinogen (RiaSTAP)\n*   Plasma (the liquid portion of the blood containing clotting factors)\n\nPeople with this condition should get the hepatitis B vaccine.

    "content": "**Congenital Heart Defect - Corrective Surgery**\n\nCongenital heart defect corrective surgery fixes or treats a heart defect that a child is born with. A baby born with one or more heart defects has congenital heart disease. Surgery is needed if the defect could harm the child's long-term health or well-being. Sometimes, congenital heart disease is not detected until adulthood.\n\n**Types of Pediatric Heart Surgery**\n\n*   **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Ligation**\n    *   Before birth, the baby has a blood vessel that runs between the aorta and the pulmonary artery.\n    *   If it does not close, it is called a patent ductus arteriosus.\n    *   This could cause problems later in life.\n    *   The cardiologist will close off the opening using medicine. If this does not work, then other techniques are used.\n    *   Sometimes the PDA can be closed with a procedure that does not involve surgery.\n    *   A small cut is made in the groin, and a wire and tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg and passed up to the heart.\n    *   Then, a small metal coil or another device is passed through the catheter into the infant's ductus arteriosus artery.\n    *   The coil or other device blocks the blood flow, and this corrects the problem.\n    *   Another method is to make a small surgical cut on the left side of the chest.\n    *   The surgeon finds the PDA and then ties off or clips the ductus arteriosus, or divides and cuts it. Tying off the ductus arteriosus is called ligation.\n*   **Coarctation of the Aorta Repair**\n    *   Coarctation of the aorta occurs when a part of the aorta has a very narrow section.\n    *   The narrowing makes it difficult for blood to get through to the lower extremities.\n    *   Over time, it can lead to problems such as extremely high blood pressure.\n    *   To repair this defect, a cut is most often made on the left side of the chest, between the ribs.\n    *   There are several ways to repair coarctation of the aorta.\n    *   The most common way to repair it is to cut the narrow section and make it bigger with a patch made of GORE-TEX.\n    *   Another way to repair this problem is to remove the narrow section of the aorta and stitch the remaining ends together.\n    *   This can most often be done in older children.\n    *   A third way to repair this problem is called a subclavian flap.\n    *   First, a cut is made in the narrow part of the aorta. Then, a patch is taken from the left subclavian artery to enlarge the narrow section of the aorta.\n    *   A fourth way to repair the problem is to connect a tube to the normal sections of the aorta, on either side of the narrow section.\n    *   Blood flows through the tube and bypasses the narrow section.\n*   **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Repair**\n    *   The atrial septum is the wall between the left and right atria.\n    *   A hole in that wall is called an ASD.\n    *   In the presence of this defect, blood with and without oxygen can be mixed up over time, causing medical problems and arrhythmias.\n    *   Sometimes, an ASD can be closed without open-heart surgery.\n    *   First, the surgeon makes a tiny cut in the groin. Then the surgeon inserts a wire into a blood vessel that goes to the heart.\n    *   Next, two small umbrella-shaped \"clamshell\" devices are placed on the right and left sides of the septum.\n    *   These two devices are attached to each other. This closes the hole in the heart.\n*   **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Repair**\n    *   The ventricular septum is the wall between the left and right ventricles.\n    *   A hole in the ventricular septum is called a VSD.\n    *   This hole lets blood with oxygen mix with used blood returning to the lungs.\n    *   Over time, irregular heartbeats and other heart problems can happen.\n    *   By age 1, most small VSDs close on their own.\n    *   However, those VSDs that do stay open after this age may need to be closed with surgery.\n*   **Tetralogy of Fallot Repair**\n    *   Tetralogy of Fallot is a heart defect that usually includes four defects in the heart and causes the baby to turn a bluish color (cyanosis).\n    *   Open-heart surgery is needed, and it is often done when the child is between 6 months and 2 years old.\n    *   The surgery involves closing the VSD with a patch and opening the thickened muscle (stenosis).\n    *   A patch is placed on the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery to improve blood flow to the lungs.\n*   **Transposition of the Great Vessels Repair**\n    *   In a normal heart, the aorta comes from the left side of the heart, and the pulmonary artery comes from the right side.\n    *   In transposition of the great vessels, these arteries come from the opposite sides of the heart.\n    *   The child may also have other birth defects.\n    *   Correcting transposition of the great vessels requires open-heart surgery.\n    *   If possible, this surgery is done shortly after birth.\n*   **Truncus Arteriosus Repair**\n    *   Truncus arteriosus is a rare condition that occurs when the aorta, coronary arteries, and pulmonary artery all come out of one common trunk.\n    *   The disorder may be very simple, or very complex.\n    *   In all cases, it requires open-heart surgery to repair the defect.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Defect - Corrective Surgery**\n\n**What is Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nCongenital heart disease refers to a group of congenital anomalies that affect the structure and function of the heart. These defects can be present at birth and may require surgical correction.\n\n**Types of Pediatric Heart Surgery**\n\nThere are several types of pediatric heart surgery, including:\n\n*   **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Ligation**: This procedure involves closing off a blood vessel that runs between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. If the ductus arteriosus does not close after birth, it can cause problems later in life.\n*   **Coarctation of the Aorta Repair**: This surgery corrects a narrowing of the aorta, which is the main artery to the body.\n*   **Tetralogy of Fallot Repair**: This procedure involves correcting a combination of four heart defects that occur together.\n*   **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Repair**: This surgery corrects a hole in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart.\n*   **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Repair**: This procedure involves correcting a hole in the wall between the lower chambers of the heart.\n*   **Truncus Arteriosus Repair**: This surgery corrects a condition where a single blood vessel comes out of the heart instead of separate vessels for the lungs and body.\n*   **Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) Correction**: This procedure involves correcting a condition where the pulmonary veins bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the right side of the heart instead of the left side.\n*   **Hypoplastic Left Heart Repair**: This surgery corrects a very severe heart defect caused by a poorly developed left heart.\n\n**How is Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosed?**\n\nCongenital heart disease can be diagnosed through various methods, including:\n\n*   **Ultrasound**: A non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: A test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart and its blood vessels.\n*   **Cardiac Catheterization**: A procedure where a catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg and passed up to the heart to take pictures or perform other tests.\n\n**What are the Treatment Options for Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nTreatment options for congenital heart disease depend on the type and severity of the defect. Some common treatment options include:\n\n*   **Surgery**: Open-heart surgery may be necessary to correct certain types of congenital heart defects.\n*   **Medicine**: Certain medications can help manage symptoms or prevent complications associated with congenital heart disease.\n*   **Catheter-Based Interventions**: These procedures involve using a catheter to close off holes in the heart or other blood vessels.\n\n**What are the Long-Term Outcomes for Children with Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nThe long-term outcomes for children with congenital heart disease vary depending on the type and severity of the defect. With proper treatment and management, many children with congenital heart disease can lead normal lives and have a good quality of life. However, some children may experience complications or require ongoing medical care to manage their condition.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Defects - Corrective Surgery**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tetralogy of Fallot Repair**\n\nTetralogy of Fallot is a heart defect that usually includes four defects in the heart and causes the baby to turn a bluish color (cyanosis).\n\nOpen-heart surgery is needed, and it is often done when the child is between 6 months and 2 years old.\n\nThe surgery involves closing the VSD with a patch and opening the thickened muscle (stenosis). A patch is placed on the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery to improve blood flow to the lungs.\n\nThe child may have a shunt procedure done first. A shunt moves blood from one area to another. This is done if the open-heart surgery needs to be delayed because the child is too sick to go through surgery.\n\nDuring a shunt procedure, the surgeon makes a surgical cut in the left side of the chest.\n\nOnce the child is older, the shunt is closed and the main repair in the heart is performed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Transposition of the Great Vessels Repair**\n\nIn a normal heart, the aorta comes from the left side of the heart, and the pulmonary artery comes from the right side. In transposition of the great vessels, these arteries come from the opposite sides of the heart. The child may also have other birth defects.\n\nCorrecting transposition of the great vessels requires open-heart surgery. If possible, this surgery is done shortly after birth.\n\nThe most common repair is called an arterial switch. The aorta and pulmonary artery are divided. The pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle, where it belongs. Then, the aorta and coronary arteries are connected to the left ventricle, where they belong.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Truncus Arteriosus Repair**\n\nTruncus arteriosus is a rare condition that occurs when the aorta, coronary arteries, and pulmonary artery all come out of one common trunk. The disorder may be very simple, or very complex. In all cases, it requires open-heart surgery to repair the defect.\n\nRepair is usually done in the first few days or weeks of the infant's life. The pulmonary arteries are separated from the aortic trunk, and any defects are patched. Usually, children also have a ventricular septal defect, and that is also closed. A connection is then placed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries.\n\nMost children need one or two more surgeries as they grow.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tricuspid Atresia Repair**\n\nThe tricuspid valve is between the upper and lower chambers on the right side of the heart. Tricuspid atresia occurs when this valve is deformed, narrow, or missing.\n\nBabies born with tricuspid atresia are blue because they cannot get blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n\nTo get to the lungs, blood must cross an atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). (These conditions are described above.) This condition severely restricts blood flow to the lungs.\n\nSoon after birth, the baby may be given a medicine called prostaglandin E. This medicine will help keep the patent ductus arteriosus open so that blood can continue to flow to the lungs. However, this will only work for a while. The child will eventually need surgery.\n\nThe child may need a series of shunts and surgeries to correct this defect. The goal of this surgery is to allow blood from the body to flow into the lungs. The surgeon may have to repair the tricuspid valve, replace the valve, or put in a shunt so that blood can get to the lungs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) Correction**\n\nTAPVR occurs when the pulmonary veins bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the right side of the heart, instead of the left side of the heart, where it most often goes in healthy people.\n\nThis condition must be corrected with surgery. The surgery may be done in the newborn period if the infant has severe symptoms. If it is not done right after birth, it is done in the first 6 months of the baby's life.\n\nTAPVR repair requires open-heart surgery. The pulmonary veins are routed back to the left side of the heart, where they belong, and any abnormal connections are closed.\n\nIf a PDA is present, it is tied off and divided.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Defect Corrective Surgery**\n\nThere are many types of pediatric heart surgery, including corrective surgery for congenital heart defects. A baby born with one or more heart defects has congenital heart disease. Surgery is needed if the defect could harm the child's long-term health or well-being.\n\n**Types of Congenital Heart Defects**\n\n*   Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n*   Coarctation of the aorta\n*   Atrial septal defect (ASD)\n*   Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n\n**Surgical Procedures**\n\n### PDA Ligation\n\n*   Closure with medicine: In most cases, the cardiologist will close off the opening using medicine.\n*   Catheter procedure: The surgeon makes a small cut in the groin and inserts a wire and tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg. A small metal coil or another device is passed through the catheter into the infant's ductus arteriosus artery, blocking the blood flow.\n*   Surgical ligation: A small surgical cut on the left side of the chest is made to tie off or clip the ductus arteriosus.\n\n### Coarctation of the Aorta Repair\n\n*   Cutting and patching: The narrow section is cut and enlarged with a patch made of GORE-TEX.\n*   Removing and stitching: The narrow section is removed, and the remaining ends are stitched together.\n*   Subclavian flap: A patch is taken from the left subclavian artery to enlarge the narrow section.\n*   Connecting a tube: A tube is connected to the normal sections of the aorta, bypassing the narrow section.\n*   Balloon angioplasty with stent: A small wire is placed through an artery in the groin and up to the aorta. A balloon is opened up in the narrow area, and a stent or small tube is left to keep the aorta open.\n\n### ASD Repair\n\n*   Closure without surgery: Two small umbrella-shaped \"clamshell\" devices are placed on the right and left sides of the septum, closing the hole.\n*   Open-heart surgery: The septum can be closed using stitches, or a patch can be used to cover the hole.\n\n### VSD Repair\n\n*   Patching: A patch is sewn over the defect to close it.\n*   Ligation: The surgeon ties off the defect with a ligature.\n\n---\n\n**Corrective Surgery for Congenital Heart Defects**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Repair**\n\nThe ventricular septum is the wall between the left and right ventricles (lower chambers) of the heart. A hole in the ventricular septum is called a VSD. This hole lets blood with oxygen mix with used blood returning to the lungs. Over time, irregular heartbeats and other heart problems can happen.\n\nBy age 1, most small VSDs close on their own. However, those VSDs that do stay open after this age may need to be closed with surgery. Larger VSDs and small ones in certain parts of the ventricular septum, or ones that cause heart failure or endocarditis, (inflammation) need open-heart surgery. The hole in the septum is most often closed with a patch.\n\nSome septal defects can be closed without surgery. The procedure involves passing a small wire into the heart and placing a small device to close the defect.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tetralogy of Fallot Repair**\n\nTetralogy of Fallot is a heart defect that usually includes four defects in the heart and causes the baby to turn a bluish color (cyanosis). Open-heart surgery is needed, and it is often done when the child is between 6 months and 2 years old.\n\nThe surgery involves closing the VSD with a patch and opening the thickened muscle (stenosis).

The pulmonary veins are routed back to the left side of the heart, where they belong, and any abnormal connections are closed.\n\nIf a PDA is present, it is tied off and divided.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hypoplastic Left Heart Repair**\n\nThis is a very severe heart defect that is caused by a very poorly developed left heart. If it is not treated, it causes death in most babies who are born with it. Unlike babies with other heart defects, those with hypoplastic left heart do not have any other defects.\n\nOperations to treat this defect are done at specialized medical centers. Usually, surgery corrects this defect. A series of three heart operations is most often needed. The first operation is done in the first week of the baby's life. This is a complicated surgery where one blood vessel is created from the pulmonary artery and the aorta.\n\nThis new vessel carries blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. The second operation, called a Fontan operation, is most often done when the baby is 4 to 6 months old. The third operation is done a year after the second operation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Ligation**\n\nBefore birth, the baby has a blood vessel that runs between the aorta (the main artery to the body) and the pulmonary artery (the main artery to the lungs), called the ductus arteriosus. This small vessel most often closes shortly after birth when the baby starts to breathe on their own.\n\nIf it does not close, it is called a patent ductus arteriosus. This could cause problems later in life. In most cases, the cardiologist will close off the opening using medicine. If this does not work, then other techniques are used. Sometimes the PDA can be closed with a procedure that does not involve surgery.\n\nThe procedure involves passing a small wire into the heart and placing a small device to close the defect. This is done in a laboratory that uses x-rays. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small cut in the groin. A wire and tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg and passed up to the heart.\n\nThen, a small metal coil or another device is passed through the catheter into the infant's ductus arteriosus artery. The coil or other device blocks the blood flow, and this corrects the problem. Another method is to make a small surgical cut on the left side of the chest.\n\nThe surgeon finds the PDA and then ties off or clips the ductus arteriosus, or divides and cuts it. Tying off the ductus arteriosus is called ligation. This procedure may be done in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Defect - Corrective Surgery**\n\n**Part 6/8**\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the corrective surgery for various congenital heart defects.\n\n**Coarctation of the Aorta Repair**\n\nCoarctation of the aorta occurs when a part of the aorta has a very narrow section. The shape looks like an hourglass timer. The narrowing makes it difficult for blood to get through to the lower extremities. Over time, it can lead to problems such as extremely high blood pressure.\n\nTo repair this defect, a cut is most often made on the left side of the chest, between the ribs. There are several ways to repair coarctation of the aorta.\n\n*   The most common way to repair it is to cut the narrow section and make it bigger with a patch made of GORE-TEX, a man-made (synthetic) material.\n*   Another way to repair this problem is to remove the narrow section of the aorta and stitch the remaining ends together. This can most often be done in older children.\n*   A third way to repair this problem is called a subclavian flap. First, a cut is made in the narrow part of the aorta. Then, a patch is taken from the left subclavian artery (the artery to the arm) to enlarge the narrow section of the aorta.\n*   A fourth way to repair the problem is to connect a tube to the normal sections of the aorta, on either side of the narrow section. Blood flows through the tube and bypasses the narrow section.\n\nA newer method does not require surgery. A small wire is placed through an artery in the groin and up to the aorta. A small balloon is then opened up in the narrow area of the aorta. A stent or small tube is left there to help keep the aorta open. The procedure is done in a laboratory with x-rays. This procedure is often used when the coarctation reoccurs after it has been fixed.\n\n**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Repair**\n\nThe atrial septum is the wall between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart. A hole in that wall is called an ASD. In the presence of this defect, blood with and without oxygen can be mixed up over time, causing medical problems and arrhythmias.\n\nSometimes, an ASD can be closed without open-heart surgery. First, the surgeon makes a tiny cut in the groin. Then the surgeon inserts a wire into a blood vessel that goes to the heart. Next, two small umbrella-shaped \"clamshell\" devices are placed on the right and left sides of the septum. These two devices are attached to each other. This closes the hole in the heart. Not all medical centers do this procedure.\n\nOpen-heart surgery may also be done to repair ASD. In this operation, the septum can be closed using stitches. Another way to cover the hole is with a patch.\n\n**Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Repair**\n\nThe ventricular septum is the wall between the left and right ventricles (lower chambers) of the heart. A hole in the ventricular septum is called a VSD. This hole lets blood with oxygen mix with used blood returning to the lungs. Over time, irregular heartbeats and other heart problems can happen.\n\nBy age 1, most small VSDs close on their own. However, those VSDs that do stay open after this age may need to be closed with surgery.\n\nLarger VSDs and small ones in certain parts of the ventricular septum, or ones that cause heart failure or endocarditis, (inflammation) need open-heart surgery. The hole in the septum is most often closed with a patch.\n\nSome septal defects can be closed without surgery. The procedure involves passing a small wire into the heart and placing a small device to close the defect.\n\n**Tetralogy of Fallot Repair**\n\nTetralogy of Fallot is a heart defect that usually includes four defects in the heart and causes the baby to turn a bluish color (cyanosis).\n\nOpen-heart surgery is needed, and it is often done when the child is between 6 months and 2 years old.\n\nThe surgery involves closing the VSD with a patch and opening the thickened muscle (stenosis). A patch is placed on the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery to improve blood flow to the lungs.\n\nThe child may have a shunt procedure done first. A shunt moves blood from one area to another. This is done if the open-heart surgery needs to be delayed because the child is too sick to go through surgery.\n\nDuring a shunt procedure, the surgeon makes a surgical cut in the left side of the chest.\n\nOnce the child is older, the shunt is closed and the main repair in the heart is performed.\n\n**Transposition of the Great Vessels Repair**\n\nIn a normal heart, the aorta comes from the left side of the heart, and the pulmonary artery comes from the right side. In transposition of the great vessels, these arteries come from the opposite sides of the heart. The child may also have other birth defects.\n\nCorrecting transposition of the great vessels requires open-heart surgery. If possible, this surgery is done shortly after birth.\n\nThe most common repair is called an arterial switch. The aorta and pulmonary artery are divided. The pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle, where it belongs. Then, the aorta and coronary arteries are connected to the left ventricle, where they belong.\n\n**Truncus Arteriosus Repair**\n\nTruncus arteriosus is a rare condition that occurs when the aorta, coronary arteries, and pulmonary artery all come out of one common trunk. The disorder may be very simple, or very complex. In all cases, it requires open-heart surgery to repair the defect.\n\nRepair is usually done in the first few days or weeks of the infant's life. The pulmonary arteries are separated from the aortic trunk, and any defects are patched. Usually, children also have a ventricular septal defect, and that is also closed. A connection is then placed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries.\n\nMost children need one or two more surgeries as they grow.\n\n**Tricuspid Atresia Repair**\n\nThe tricuspid valve is between the upper and lower chambers on the right side of the heart. Tricuspid atresia occurs when this valve is deformed, narrow, or missing.\n\nBabies born with tricuspid atresia are blue because they cannot get blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n\nTo get to the lungs, blood must cross an atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). (These conditions are described above.) This condition severely restricts blood flow to the lungs.\n\nSoon after birth, the baby may be given a medicine called prostaglandin E. This medicine will help keep the patent ductus arteriosus open so that blood can continue to flow to the lungs. However, this will only work for a while. The child will eventually need surgery.\n\nThe child may need a series of shunts and surgeries to correct this defect. The goal of this surgery is to allow blood from the body to flow into the lungs. The surgeon may have to repair the tricuspid valve, replace the valve, or put in a shunt so that blood can get to the lungs.\n\n**Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) Correction**\n\nTAPVR occurs when the pulmonary veins bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the right side of the heart, instead of the left side of the heart, where it most often goes in healthy people.\n\nThis condition must be corrected with surgery. The surgery may be done in the newborn period if the infant has severe symptoms. If it is not done right after birth, it is done in the first 6 months of the baby's life.\n\nTAPVR repair requires open-heart surgery. The pulmonary veins are routed back to the left side of the heart, where they belong, and any abnormal connections are closed.\n\nIf a PDA is present, it is tied off and divided.\n\n**Hypoplastic Left Heart Repair**\n\nThis condition occurs when the left ventricle is underdeveloped. There are three types of hypoplastic left heart syndrome:\n\n*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral atresia: The mitral valve is missing or very small.\n*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with aortic atresia: The aorta is either missing or very small.\n*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome without any other defects: This is the rarest form of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\nThe treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome depends on the type and severity of the condition. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged heart tissue. In other cases, a heart transplant may be required.\n\nNote: The information provided in this article is intended for general knowledge purposes only and should not be considered as medical advice. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, it's essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for personalized guidance and treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Heart Defect - Corrective Surgery**\n\n**Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Ligation**\n\nIn PDA ligation, the abnormal connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery is tied off and divided.\n\n**Hypoplastic Left Heart Repair**\n\nThis is a very severe heart defect that is caused by a very poorly developed left heart. If it is not treated, it causes death in most babies who are born with it. Unlike babies with other heart defects, those with hypoplastic left heart do not have any other defects. Operations to treat this defect are done at specialized medical centers. Usually, surgery corrects this defect.\n\nA series of three heart operations is most often needed.

    "content": "**Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nCongenital heart disease (CHD) is a problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth. It is the most common type of birth defect, causing more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nCHD can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is often divided into two types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common CHDs:\n\n* **Cyanotic:**\n\t+ Ebstein anomaly\n\t+ Hypoplastic left heart\n\t+ Pulmonary atresia\n\t+ Tetralogy of Fallot\n\t+ Total anomalous pulmonary venous return\n\t+ Transposition of the great vessels\n\t+ Tricuspid atresia\n\t+ Truncus arteriosus\n* **Non-cyanotic:**\n\t+ Aortic stenosis\n\t+ Bicuspid aortic valve\n\t+ Atrial septal defect (ASD)\n\t+ Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect)\n\t+ Coarctation of the aorta\n\t+ Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n\t+ Pulmonic stenosis\n\t+ Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n\nThese problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families.\n\nExamples include:\n\n* DiGeorge syndrome\n* Down syndrome\n* Marfan syndrome\n* Noonan syndrome\n* Edwards syndrome\n* Trisomy 13\n* Turner syndrome\n\nOften, no cause for the heart disease can be found. CHDs continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.\n\nPoorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to an increased rate of congenital heart defects.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nSymptoms depend on the condition. Although CHD is present at birth, the symptoms may not appear right away.\n\nDefects such as coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for years. Other problems, such as a small VSD, ASD, or PDA may never cause any problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost congenital heart defects are found during a pregnancy ultrasound. When a defect is found this way, a pediatric heart doctor, surgeon, and other specialists can be there when the baby is delivered. Having medical care ready at the delivery can mean the difference between life and death for some babies.\n\nWhich tests are done on the baby depend on the defect and the symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nWhich treatment is used, and how well the baby responds to it, depends on the condition. Many defects need to be followed carefully. Some will heal over time, while others will need to be treated.\n\nSome CHDs can be treated with medicine alone. Others need to be treated with one or more heart procedures or surgeries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause CHD.\n\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\n\n* Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\n* Tell your health care provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\n* Have a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\n* Pregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\n\nCertain genes may play a role in CHD. Many family members may be affected.

    "content": "**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**What is Congenital Hypothyroidism?**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is a partial or complete loss of function of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) that affects infants from birth (congenital). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It makes iodine-containing hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). People with congenital hypothyroidism have lower-than-normal levels of these important hormones.\n\n**Causes of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to develop or function properly. In 80 to 85 percent of cases, the thyroid gland is absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located. These cases are classified as thyroid dysgenesis. In the remainder of cases, a normal-sized or enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is present, but production of thyroid hormones is decreased or absent. Most of these cases occur when one of several steps in the hormone synthesis process is impaired; these cases are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Less commonly, reduction or absence of thyroid hormone production is caused by impaired stimulation of the production process (which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland), even though the process itself is unimpaired. These cases are classified as central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nSigns and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism result from the shortage of thyroid hormones. Affected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nIn the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally. Congenital hypothyroidism can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic. Some common forms of syndromic hypothyroidism include Pendred syndrome, Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, and brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* 80 to 85 percent of cases: thyroid dysgenesis\n* Remainder of cases: thyroid dyshormonogenesis or central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is not typically inherited, but some forms of the condition may be associated with genetic syndromes.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is also known as cretinism or congenital goiter.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on congenital hypothyroidism, please consult a healthcare professional or visit reputable health resources such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the American Thyroid Association (ATA).\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**What is Congenital Hypothyroidism?**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is a condition where an infant is born with a thyroid gland that does not function properly. This can result in lower-than-normal levels of thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating growth, brain development, and metabolism.\n\n**Causes of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nThe most common cause worldwide is a shortage of iodine in the diet of the mother and the affected infant. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Genetic causes account for about 15 to 20 percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n**Types of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n1. **Thyroid Dysgenesis**: This type accounts for 80-85% of cases and is characterized by an absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located thyroid gland.\n2. **Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis**: This type results from mutations in one of several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones.\n3. **Central Hypothyroidism**: This type is caused by impaired stimulation of hormone production, which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nAffected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism affects an estimated 1 in 2,000 to 4,000 newborns. For reasons that remain unclear, congenital hypothyroidism affects more than twice as many females as males.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism can be caused by a variety of factors, only some of which are genetic. The most common cause worldwide is a shortage of iodine in the diet of the mother and the affected infant. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Genetic causes account for about 15 to 20 percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n**Thyroid Dysgenesis**\n\nThe cause of the most common type of congenital hypothyroidism, thyroid dysgenesis, is usually unknown. Studies suggest that 2 to 5 percent of cases are inherited. Two of the genes involved in this form of the condition are PAX8 and TSHR. These genes play roles in the proper growth and development of the thyroid gland. Mutations in these genes prevent or disrupt normal development of the gland. The abnormal or missing gland cannot produce normal amounts of thyroid hormones.\n\n**Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis**\n\nThyroid dyshormonogenesis results from mutations in one of several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones. These genes include DUOX2, SLC5A5, TG, and TPO. Mutations in each of these genes disrupt a step in thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to abnormally low levels of these hormones. Mutations in the TSHB gene disrupt the synthesis of thyroid hormones by impairing the stimulation of hormone production. Changes in this gene are the primary cause of central hypothyroidism.\n\n**Genetic Causes**\n\nMutations in other genes that have not been as well characterized can also cause congenital hypothyroidism. Still other genes are involved in syndromic forms of the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of congenital hypothyroidism are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When inherited, the condition usually has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Typically, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Pattern**\n\nWhen congenital hypothyroidism results from mutations in the PAX8 gene or from certain mutations in the TSHR or DUOX2 gene, the condition has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

    "content": "**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**What is Congenital Hypothyroidism?**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is a partial or complete loss of function of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) that affects infants from birth (congenital). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It makes iodine-containing hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). People with congenital hypothyroidism have lower-than-normal levels of these important hormones.\n\n**Causes of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to develop or function properly. In 80 to 85 percent of cases, the thyroid gland is absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located. These cases are classified as thyroid dysgenesis. In the remainder of cases, a normal-sized or enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is present, but production of thyroid hormones is decreased or absent. Most of these cases occur when one of several steps in the hormone synthesis process is impaired; these cases are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Less commonly, reduction or absence of thyroid hormone production is caused by impaired stimulation of the production process (which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland), even though the process itself is unimpaired. These cases are classified as central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nSigns and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism result from the shortage of thyroid hormones. Affected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nIn the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally. Congenital hypothyroidism can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic. Some common forms of syndromic hypothyroidism include Pendred syndrome, Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, and brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* 80 to 85 percent of cases: thyroid dysgenesis\n* Remainder of cases: thyroid dyshormonogenesis or central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is not typically inherited, but some forms of the condition may be associated with genetic syndromes.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is also known as cretinism or congenital goiter.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on congenital hypothyroidism, please consult a healthcare professional or visit reputable health resources such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the American Thyroid Association (ATA).\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**What is Congenital Hypothyroidism?**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is a condition where an infant is born with a thyroid gland that does not function properly. This can result in lower-than-normal levels of thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating growth, brain development, and metabolism.\n\n**Causes of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\nThe most common cause worldwide is a shortage of iodine in the diet of the mother and the affected infant. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Genetic causes account for about 15 to 20 percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n**Types of Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n1. **Thyroid Dysgenesis**: This type accounts for 80-85% of cases and is characterized by an absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located thyroid gland.\n2. **Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis**: This type results from mutations in one of several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones.\n3. **Central Hypothyroidism**: This type is caused by impaired stimulation of hormone production, which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nAffected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism affects an estimated 1 in 2,000 to 4,000 newborns. For reasons that remain unclear, congenital hypothyroidism affects more than twice as many females as males.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally.\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism can be caused by a variety of factors, only some of which are genetic. The most common cause worldwide is a shortage of iodine in the diet of the mother and the affected infant. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Genetic causes account for about 15 to 20 percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n**Thyroid Dysgenesis**\n\nThe cause of the most common type of congenital hypothyroidism, thyroid dysgenesis, is usually unknown. Studies suggest that 2 to 5 percent of cases are inherited. Two of the genes involved in this form of the condition are PAX8 and TSHR. These genes play roles in the proper growth and development of the thyroid gland. Mutations in these genes prevent or disrupt normal development of the gland. The abnormal or missing gland cannot produce normal amounts of thyroid hormones.\n\n**Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis**\n\nThyroid dyshormonogenesis results from mutations in one of several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones. These genes include DUOX2, SLC5A5, TG, and TPO. Mutations in each of these genes disrupt a step in thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to abnormally low levels of these hormones. Mutations in the TSHB gene disrupt the synthesis of thyroid hormones by impairing the stimulation of hormone production. Changes in this gene are the primary cause of central hypothyroidism.\n\n**Genetic Causes**\n\nMutations in other genes that have not been as well characterized can also cause congenital hypothyroidism. Still other genes are involved in syndromic forms of the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of congenital hypothyroidism are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When inherited, the condition usually has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Typically, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Autosomal Dominant Pattern**\n\nWhen congenital hypothyroidism results from mutations in the PAX8 gene or from certain mutations in the TSHR or DUOX2 gene, the condition has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nLearn more about the genes associated with Congenital hypothyroidism\n\n* DUOX2\n* PAX8\n* SLC26A4\n* SLC5A5\n* TG\n* TPO\n* TSHB\n* TSHR\n\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\n\n* DUOXA2\n* IYD\n* NKX2-5\n* THRA\n* TRHR\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Hypothyroidism**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nMost cases of congenital hypothyroidism are sporadic, meaning they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nWhen inherited, the condition usually has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

Symptoms include easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts or injuries, and petechiae (small red spots on the skin). Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is a rare condition where a mother's immune system produces antibodies against her baby's platelets, leading to low platelet count in the newborn. Posttransfusion purpura is a rare complication of blood transfusion, characterized by severe bleeding and low platelet count.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation**\n\nHemostasis is the process by which the body stops bleeding from an injured vessel. It involves three stages: vascular spasm (constriction of the blood vessel), coagulation (formation of a blood clot), and fibrinolysis (dissolution of the blood clot). The coagulation cascade involves the activation of various clotting factors, leading to the formation of a stable blood clot.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nHall JE, Hall ME.

If you suspect you have a sexually transmitted disease such as syphilis, seek medical attention right away to avoid complications like infecting your baby during pregnancy or birth.\n\nPrenatal care is very important. Routine blood tests for syphilis are done during pregnancy. These tests help identify infected mothers so they can be treated to reduce the risks to the infant and themselves. Infants born to infected mothers who received proper antibiotic treatment during pregnancy are at minimal risk for congenital syphilis.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nFetal syphilis\n\n---\n\n**Congenital Syphilis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition and Causes**\n\n*   Congenital syphilis is a condition that occurs when a fetus has been infected with the bacteria that cause syphilis, typically through maternal transmission during pregnancy.\n*   The bacteria that cause syphilis are usually transmitted from mother to child during birth.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n*   Symptoms of congenital syphilis can vary in severity and may include:\n    *   Skin rashes or lesions\n    *   Joint pain or swelling\n    *   Fever\n    *   Poor appetite\n    *   Weight loss\n    *   Enlarged lymph nodes\n    *   Abnormal liver function tests\n*   Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests (such as blood cultures), and maternal history.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\n*   Treatment for congenital syphilis usually involves administering antibiotics to the affected child.\n*   To prevent congenital syphilis, pregnant women should be screened for syphilis during pregnancy, and those who test positive should receive prompt treatment to reduce the risk of transmission to their fetus.",

It may go away on its own when you avoid your allergy triggers. Cool compresses may help soothe allergic conjunctivitis. Eye drops that contain antihistamines for the eye or drops containing steroids, may be necessary in more severe cases.\n\nAntibiotic medicines work well to treat conjunctivitis caused by bacteria. These are most often given in the form of eye drops. Most cases of viral conjunctivitis will go away on its own without antibiotic eye drops. Mild steroid eye drops may help ease discomfort.\n\nIf your eyes are dry, it may help to use artificial tears in conjunction with any other drops you may be using. Be sure to allow about 10 minutes in between using different types of eye drops. Crustiness of the eyelids can be helped by applying warm compresses. Gently press clean cloth soaked in warm water to your closed eyes.\n\nOther helpful steps include:\n\n* Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke, direct wind, and air conditioning.\n* Use a humidifier, especially in the winter.\n* Limit medicines that may dry you out and worsen your symptoms.\n* Clean eyelashes regularly and apply warm compresses.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome for bacterial infections is most often good with early antibiotic treatment. Pinkeye (viral conjunctivitis) can easily spread through entire households or classrooms, but a full recovery is expected.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Your symptoms last longer than 3 or 4 days.\n* Your vision is affected.\n* You have light sensitivity.\n* You develop eye pain that is severe or becoming worse.\n* Your eyelids or the skin around your eyes becomes swollen or red.\n* You have a headache in addition to your other symptom.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGood hygiene can help prevent the spread of conjunctivitis.

    "content": "**Conscious Sedation for Surgical Procedures**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nA nurse, healthcare provider, or dentist will give you conscious sedation in the hospital or outpatient clinic. Most of the time, it won't be an anesthesiologist. The medicine will wear off quickly, so it's used for short, uncomplicated procedures.\n\nYou may receive the medicine through an intravenous line (IV) or a shot into a muscle. You'll begin to feel drowsy and relaxed very quickly. If your provider gives you the medicine to swallow, you'll feel the effects after about 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nYour breathing will slow, and your blood pressure may drop a little. Your provider will monitor you during the procedure to make sure you're okay. This provider will stay with you at all times during the procedure.\n\nYou shouldn't need help with your breathing, but you may receive extra oxygen through a mask or IV fluids through a catheter (tube) into a vein.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nConscious sedation is safe and effective for people who need minor surgery or a procedure to diagnose a condition.\n\nSome of the tests and procedures that conscious sedation may be used for are:\n\n*   Breast biopsy\n*   Dental prosthetic or reconstructive surgery\n*   Minor bone fracture repair\n*   Minor foot surgery\n*   Minor skin surgery\n*   Plastic or reconstructive surgery\n*   Procedures to diagnose and treat some stomach (upper endoscopy), colon (colonoscopy), lung (bronchoscopy), and bladder (cystoscopy) conditions\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nConscious sedation is usually safe. However, if you're given too much of the medicine, problems with your breathing may occur. A provider will be watching you during the whole procedure.\n\nProviders always have special equipment to help you with your breathing, if needed. Only certain qualified providers can administer conscious sedation.\n\n---\n\n**Conscious Sedation for Surgical Procedures**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect Before Your Procedure**\n\nIf you are or could be pregnant, tell your provider. Also, inform them about any medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days leading up to your procedure:\n\n*   Tell your provider about allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.\n*   You may have blood or urine tests and a physical exam.\n*   Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic for the procedure.\n*   If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**On the Day of Your Procedure**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital or clinic on time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter conscious sedation, you will feel sleepy and may have a headache or feel sick to your stomach. During recovery, your finger will be clipped to a special device (pulse oximeter) to check the oxygen levels in your blood. Your blood pressure will be checked with an arm cuff about every 15 minutes.\n\nYou should be able to go home 1 to 2 hours after your procedure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**At Home**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions about when and what to eat and drink. You should be able to return to your everyday activities the next day. Avoid driving, operating machinery, drinking alcohol, and making legal decisions for at least 24 hours. Check with your provider before taking any medicines or herbal supplements.

    "title": "Considering plastic surgery after a large weight loss: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000958.htm",
    "content": "**Considering Plastic Surgery After a Large Weight Loss**\n\nWhen you lose a lot of weight, such as 100 pounds or more, your skin may not be elastic enough to shrink back to its natural shape. This can cause the skin to sag and hang, especially around the upper face, arms, stomach, breasts, and buttocks. Some people don't like the way this skin looks. In some cases, extra or hanging skin can cause rashes or sores. It may make it hard to get dressed or do some activities. One way to fix this problem is to have plastic surgery to remove the excess skin.\n\n**Who Can Have This Surgery**\n\nPlastic surgery to remove extra skin is not right for everyone. You will need to meet with a plastic surgeon to see if you're a good candidate. Your surgeon will talk with you to make sure you're ready for this type of surgery. Some things to think about before having this surgery include:\n\n*   **Your weight**: If you are still losing weight, your skin may sag more after the surgery. If you gain the weight back, you could stress the skin where you had the surgery, and compromise the result. Your surgeon will talk with you about how long after losing weight you should wait before having surgery. In general, your weight should have been stable for at least a year or longer.\n*   **Your overall health**: As with any surgery, plastic surgery has risks. If you have a health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, you may have a higher risk for problems after the surgery. Talk with your surgeon about whether you are healthy enough for surgery.\n*   **Your smoking history**: Smoking increases your risk of problems during and after surgery and can make you heal more slowly. Your surgeon will likely suggest you quit smoking before having this surgery. Your surgeon may not operate on you if you continue to smoke.\n*   **Your expectations**: Try to be realistic about how you will look after surgery. It can improve your shape, but it won't get your body back to how it looked before your weight gain. Skin naturally sags with age and this surgery will not stop that. You may also have some scarring from the surgery.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nIn general, the benefits of this surgery are mostly psychological. You may feel better about yourself and have more confidence if you like the way your body looks. In some cases, removing extra skin may also reduce your risk for rashes and infection.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nAs with any surgery, there are risks with plastic surgery after weight loss. There is also a chance you may not be happy with the results of the surgery.\n\nYour surgeon will review the full list of risks with you. These include:\n\n*   **Scarring**\n*   **Bleeding**\n*   **Infection**\n*   **Loose skin**\n*   **Poor wound healing**\n*   **Blood clots**\n*   **Fluid collections that may require drainage**\n\n**Areas of the Body for Surgery**\n\nPlastic surgery after weight loss can be done on many different areas of the body. Depending on what areas you want to treat, you may need several surgeries. Common areas include:\n\n*   **Abdomen**\n*   **Thighs**\n*   **Arms**\n*   **Breasts**\n*   **Face and neck**\n*   **Buttocks and upper thighs**\n\nYour surgeon will talk with you about what areas are best for you to treat.\n\n**Cost of Surgery**\n\nMany insurance plans do not pay for plastic surgery after weight loss. They also may not cover any treatment you need if you have a problem with the surgery. Make sure to check with your insurance company before the surgery to find out about your benefits.\n\nThe cost of plastic surgery after weight loss can vary depending on what you have done, your surgeon's experience, and the area where you live.\n\n**After Surgery**\n\nYou should notice results from the surgery soon after it's done. It takes about three months for swelling to go down and wounds to heal. It can take up to two years to see the final results of the surgery and for scars to fade. Although everyone's results are different, you will get the most from your surgery if you maintain a healthy weight and get regular exercise.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon right away if you have any of these symptoms after surgery:\n\n*   **Shortness of breath**\n*   **Chest pains**\n*   **Unusual heartbeat**\n*   **Fever**\n*   **Signs of infection such as swelling, pain, redness, and thick or bad-smelling discharge at the incision site**\n\nAlso contact your surgeon if you have any other questions.\n\n---\n\n**Considering Plastic Surgery After a Large Weight Loss**\n\n\\n\\nWhen you lose a lot of weight, such as 100 pounds or more, your skin may not be elastic enough to shrink back to its natural shape. This can cause the skin to sag and hang, especially around the upper face, arms, stomach, breasts, and buttocks.\n\n**Who Can Have This Surgery**\n\nPlastic surgery to remove extra skin is not right for everyone. You will need to meet with a plastic surgeon to see if you're a good candidate. Your surgeon will talk with you to make sure you're ready for this type of surgery. Some things to think about before having this surgery include:\n\n*   Your weight. If you are still losing weight, your skin may sag more after the surgery. If you gain the weight back, you could stress the skin where you had the surgery, and compromise the result.\n*   Your overall health. As with any surgery, plastic surgery has risks. If you have a health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, you may have a higher risk for problems after the surgery.\n*   Your smoking history. Smoking increases your risk of problems during and after surgery and can make you heal more slowly.\n*   Your expectations. Try to be realistic about how you will look after surgery.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nIn general, the benefits of this surgery are mostly psychological. You may feel better about yourself and have more confidence if you like the way your body looks. In some cases, removing extra skin may also reduce your risk for rashes and infection.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nAs with any surgery, there are risks with plastic surgery after weight loss. There is also a chance you may not be happy with the results of the surgery.\n\nYour surgeon will review the full list of risks with you. These include:\n\n*   Scarring\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Loose skin\n*   Poor wound healing\n*   Blood clots\n*   Fluid collections that may require drainage\n\n---\n\n**Considering Plastic Surgery After a Large Weight Loss**\n\nAre you considering plastic surgery after a large weight loss?

Your stool may become hard and dry, and it can be difficult to pass.\n\n**Signs, Symptoms, and Causes**\n\nYou might feel bloated and have pain, or you might have to strain when you try to go.\n\nSome medicines, and even some vitamins, can make you constipated. You can get constipated if you do not get enough fiber, drink enough water, or get enough exercise. You can also get constipated if you put off going to the bathroom even though you have the urge to go.\n\nTry to get to know your normal bowel movement pattern, so that you can prevent constipation and keep it from getting worse.\n\n**How to Relieve Constipation**\n\nExercise regularly. Drink more water and eat more fiber. Try to walk, swim, or do something active at least 3 or 4 times a week.\n\nIf you feel the urge to go to the bathroom, go.

Berries, grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, raisins, rhubarb, and prunes are just some of the fruits that may help. Do not peel fruits that have edible skins, because a lot of the fiber is in the skin.\n\nChoose breads, crackers, pasta, pancakes, and waffles made with whole grains, or make your own.

Too much water gets absorbed by the colon, leaving hard, dry stools.\n\nConstipation may be caused by:\n\n*   Ignoring the urge to use the toilet\n*   Not eating enough fiber\n*   Not drinking enough fluids\n*   Switching to solid foods or from breast milk to formula (infants)\n*   Changes in situation, such as travel, starting school, or stressful events\n\nMedical causes of constipation may include:\n\n*   Diseases of the bowel, such as those that affect the bowel muscles or nerves\n*   Other medical conditions that affect the bowel\n*   Use of certain medicines\n\n---\n\n**Constipation in Infants and Children**\n\nConstipation in infants and children means they have hard stools or have problems passing stools. A child may have pain while passing stools or may be unable to have a bowel movement after straining or pushing.\n\n**What is Normal?**\n\nNormal bowel movements are different for each child. In the first month, infants tend to have bowel movements about once a day. After that, babies can go a few days or even a week between bowel movements. It's also difficult to pass stools because their abdominal muscles are weak. So babies tend to strain, cry, and get red in the face when they have a bowel movement. This does not mean they are constipated. If bowel movements are soft, then there is likely no problem.\n\n**Signs of Constipation**\n\nSigns of constipation in infants and children may include:\n\n*   Being very fussy and spitting up more often (infants)\n*   Difficulty passing stools or seeming uncomfortable\n*   Hard, dry stools\n*   Pain when having a bowel movement\n*   Belly pain and bloating\n*   Large, wide stools\n*   Blood on the stool or on toilet paper\n*   Traces of liquid or stool in a child's underwear (may be a sign of fecal impaction)\n*   Having less than 3 bowel movements a week (children)\n*   Moving their body in different positions or clenching their buttocks\n\n**When to Treat Constipation**\n\nMake sure your infant or child has a problem before treating constipation.\n\n---\n\n**Constipation in Infants and Children**\n\n**What is Constipation?**\n\nConstipation occurs when the stool remains in the colon for too long.

These changes can also be used to treat it.\n\nFor infants:\n\n* Give your baby extra water or juice during the day in between feedings.\n* Over 2 months old: Try 2 to 4 ounces (59 to 118 mL) of fruit juice (grape, pear, apple, cherry, or prune) twice a day.\n* Over 4 months old: If the baby has started to eat solid foods, try baby foods with high-fiber content such as peas, beans, apricots, prunes, peaches, pears, plums, and spinach twice a day.\n\nFor children:\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids each day. Your child's health care provider can tell you how much.\n* Eat more fruits and vegetables and foods high in fiber, such as whole grains.\n* Avoid certain foods such as cheese, fast food, prepared and processed foods, meat, and ice cream.\n* Stop toilet training if your child becomes constipated. Resume after your child is no longer constipated.\n* Teach older children to use the toilet right after eating a meal.\n\nStool softeners (such as those containing docusate sodium) may help for older children. Bulk laxatives such as psyllium may help add fluid and bulk to the stool. Suppositories or gentle laxatives may help your child have regular bowel movements. Electrolyte solutions like Miralax can also be effective.\n\nSome children may need enemas or prescription laxatives. These methods should be used only if fiber, fluids, and stool softeners do not provide enough relief.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider right away if:\n\n* An infant (except those who are only breastfed) goes 3 days without a stool and is vomiting or irritable\n* An infant younger than 2 months is constipated.\n* Non-breastfeeding infants go 3 days without having a bowel movement (Contact your child's provider right away if there is vomiting or irritability.)\n* A child is holding back bowel movements to resist toilet training.\n* There is blood in the stools.\n\n---\n\n**Contact Your Child's Provider Right Away If:**\n\n* An infant (except those who are only breastfed) goes 3 days without a stool and is vomiting or irritable.\n* An infant younger than 2 months is constipated.\n\n**Also Contact Your Child's Provider If:**\n\n* A non-breastfeeding infant goes 3 days without having a bowel movement.

The provider may ask you questions about your child's diet, symptoms, and bowel habits. The following tests may help find the cause of constipation:\n\n* Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC)\n* X-rays of the abdomen\n\nThe provider may recommend the use of stool softeners or laxatives.

    "title": "Contact dermatitis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000869.htm",
    "content": "**Contact Dermatitis**\n\nContact dermatitis is a condition in which the skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed after direct contact with a substance.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are 2 types of contact dermatitis:\n\n*   **Irritant Dermatitis**: This is the most common type. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to irritating substances or friction.\n*   **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.\n\n**Common Allergens**\n\nSome common allergens include:\n\n*   Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees\n*   Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin\n*   Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)\n*   Fabrics and clothing, including both materials and dyes\n*   Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers\n*   Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions\n*   Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)\n*   Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants\n*   Rubber or latex gloves or shoes\n*   Preservatives commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter topical medicines\n*   Formaldehyde, which is used in a broad number of manufactured items\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary, depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.\n\nAllergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months or years of exposure.\n\nContact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.\n\nItching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.\n\nYou may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.\n\nThe rash may:\n\n*   Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters\n*   Feel warm and tender\n*   Ooze, drain, or crust\n*   Become scaly, raw, or thickened\n\nDermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.\n\nAllergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may be necessary to determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires at least 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.\n\nOn the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed at the second visit 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.\nA third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction. For certain allergens such as metals, a final visit may be necessary on the 10th day.\nIf you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.\n\nOther tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.\n\nOften, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.\n\nEmollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating irritant contact dermatitis.\n\nTopical corticosteroid medicines are commonly used to treat contact dermatitis.\n\nTopical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.\nDO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your provider advises you to use it.\n\nYour provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.\n\nIn severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot.\n\nWet dressings and soothing anti-itch (antipruritic) lotions may be recommended to reduce other symptoms.\n\nTopical corticosteroids should be used only for short periods.

It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to irritating substances or friction.\n    Irritating substances may include acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. Very irritating chemicals may cause a reaction after just a short period of contact. Milder chemicals can also cause a reaction after repeated contact.\n\n    People who have atopic dermatitis are at increased risk of developing irritant contact dermatitis.\n\n    Common materials that may irritate your skin include:\n\n    *   Cement\n    *   Hair dyes\n    *   Long-term exposure to wet diapers\n    *   Pesticides or weed killers\n    *   Rubber gloves\n    *   Shampoos\n\n*   **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.\n\n    Common allergens include:\n\n    *   Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees.\n    *   Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin.\n    *   Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks).\n    *   Fabrics and clothing, including both materials and dyes.\n    *   Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers.\n    *   Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions.\n    *   Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts).\n    *   Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants.\n    *   Rubber or latex gloves or shoes.\n    *   Preservatives commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter topical medicines.\n    *   Formaldehyde, which is used in a broad number of manufactured items.\n\nYou will not have an allergic reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. It is possible to tolerate the substance for years or even decades before developing allergy. Once you develop an allergy you will be allergic for life.\n\nThe reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure. The rash may persist for weeks after the exposure stops.\n\nSome products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:\n\n*   Shaving lotions\n*   Sunscreens\n*   Sulfa ointments\n*   Some perfumes\n*   Coal tar products\n*   Oil from the skin of a lime\n\n---\n\n**Contact Dermatitis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Contact Dermatitis?**\n\nContact dermatitis is a type of skin inflammation caused by exposure to certain substances. It can be either an allergic reaction or an irritant reaction.\n\n**Types of Contact Dermatitis**\n\nThere are two types of contact dermatitis:\n\n*   **Irritant Dermatitis**: This is the most common type, which is not caused by an allergy but rather the skin's reaction to irritating substances or friction.\n*   **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.\n\n**Common Substances That Can Cause Contact Dermatitis**\n\nSome common substances that can cause contact dermatitis include:\n\n*   Shaving lotions\n*   Sunscreens\n*   Sulfa ointments\n*   Some perfumes\n*   Coal tar products\n*   Oil from the skin of a lime\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Contact Dermatitis**\n\nSymptoms vary, depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.\n\nAllergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months or years of exposure.\n\nContact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.\n\nItching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.\n\nYou may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.\n\nThe rash may:\n\n*   Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters\n*   Feel warm and tender\n*   Ooze, drain, or crust\n*   Become scaly, raw, or thickened\n\nDermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.\n\nAllergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may be necessary to determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires at least 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.\n\nOn the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed at the second visit 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.\n\nA third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction. For certain allergens such as metals, a final visit may be necessary on the 10th day.\n\nIf you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.\n\nOther tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.\n\n---\n\n**Contact Dermatitis**\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n*   Your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.\n*   Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may be necessary to determine what is causing the reaction.

It is acceptable to do so if the benefits outweigh the risk.\n* **Absolute Contraindication**: An event or substance could cause a life-threatening situation. A procedure or medicine that falls under this category must be avoided.\n\nSome treatments may cause unwanted or dangerous reactions in people with allergies, high blood pressure, or pregnancy. For example:\n\n* Isotretinoin, a drug used to treat acne, is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects.\n* Certain decongestants are contraindicated in people with high blood pressure and should be avoided.\n\nMany medicines should not be used together by the same person. For instance:\n\n* A person who takes warfarin to thin the blood should not take aspirin, which is also a blood thinner.

This is because your blood vessels become stiffer as you age. When that happens, your blood pressure goes up.\n\n**When Is Your Blood Pressure a Concern?**\n\nIf your blood pressure is high, you need to lower it and keep it under control. Your blood pressure reading has 2 numbers. One or both of these numbers can be too high.\n\n* The top number is called the systolic blood pressure. For most people, this reading is too high if it is 130 or higher.\n* The bottom number is called the diastolic blood pressure. For most people, this reading is too high if it is 80 or higher.\n\nThe above blood pressure numbers are goals that most experts agree on for most people. For some people age 60 years and above, some health care providers recommend a different blood pressure goal. Some patients may have blood pressure goals lower than these targets, in particular circumstances.

Do you want to learn how to control it and live a healthier life? Look no further! In this article, we'll explore the latest guidelines for managing high blood pressure in adults.\n\n**Understanding High Blood Pressure**\n\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a condition where your blood pressure is consistently too high. This can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. The good news is that with proper management, you can control your blood pressure and reduce your risk of these complications.\n\n**Managing High Blood Pressure**\n\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on clinical practice guidelines has developed a comprehensive report on the management of high blood pressure in adults. According to this report, lifestyle changes are just as important as medication in controlling blood pressure.\n\n*   **Lose weight**: If you're overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower your blood pressure.\n*   **Exercise regularly**: Regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure and improve overall health.\n*   **Eat a healthy diet**: Focus on consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. Limit your intake of sodium, sugar, and saturated fats.\n*   **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your blood pressure.\n\n**Medications for High Blood Pressure**\n\nIn addition to lifestyle changes, medications may be necessary to control high blood pressure. There are several types of medications available, including:\n\n*   **ACE inhibitors**: These medications work by relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure.\n*   **Beta blockers**: These medications slow the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart's contractions, which can help lower blood pressure.\n*   **Calcium channel blockers**: These medications relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nControlling high blood pressure is a crucial step in maintaining overall health. By making lifestyle changes and working with your healthcare provider to find the right medication, you can effectively manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of related complications.

Some common materials used in cookware and utensils are:\n\n*   **Aluminum**: Nonstick, scratch-resistant anodized aluminum cookware is a good choice.\n*   **Copper**: Copper pots are popular due to their even heating, but large amounts of copper from unlined cookware can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n*   **Iron**: Iron cookware may be a good choice, as cooking in cast iron pots may increase the amount of iron in the diet.\n*   **Lead**: Children should be protected from ceramic cookware containing lead. Acidic foods such as oranges, tomatoes, or foods containing vinegar will cause more lead to be leached from ceramic cookware than non-acidic foods like milk.\n*   **Stainless Steel**: Stainless steel cookware is low in cost and can be used at high heat.\n*   **Teflon**: Teflon is a brand name for a nonstick coating found on certain pots and pans. It contains a substance called polytetrafluoroethylene.\n\n**Using Cookware Safely**\n\nTo use cookware safely, follow these guidelines:\n\n*   Choose metal cookware and bakeware that can be easily cleaned. There should be no cracks or rough edges that can trap or hold food or bacteria.\n*   Avoid using metal or hard plastic utensils on cookware. These utensils can scratch surfaces and cause pots and pans to wear out faster.

In this article, we'll explore the different types of cookware and provide guidance on how to choose the right one for your needs.\n\n**Lead-Contaminated Ceramic Cookware**\n\nChildren should be protected from ceramic cookware containing lead. Some ceramic cookware should not be used to hold food, including items bought in another country or considered to be a craft, antique, or collectable. These pieces may not meet FDA specifications. Test kits can detect high levels of lead in ceramic cookware, but lower levels may also be dangerous.\n\n**Iron Cookware**\n\nIron cookware may be a good choice. Cooking in cast iron pots may increase the amount of iron in the diet. Most of the time, this is a very small source of dietary iron.\n\n**Teflon Nonstick Coating**\n\nTeflon is a brand name for a nonstick coating found on certain pots and pans. It contains a substance called polytetrafluoroethylene. The nonstick types of these pans should be used only at low or medium heat. They should never be left unattended at high heat. This may cause the release of fumes that can irritate humans and household pets.\n\n**Copper Cookware**\n\nCopper pots are popular due to their even heating. But large amounts of copper from unlined cookware can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some copper and brass pans are coated with another metal to prevent food from coming into contact with copper. Over time, these coatings can break down and allow copper to dissolve in food.\n\n**Stainless Steel Cookware**\n\nStainless steel cookware is low in cost and can be used at high heat. It has a sturdy cookware surface that does not wear down easily. Most stainless steel cookware has copper or aluminum bottoms for even heating. Health problems from stainless steel are rare.\n\n**Cutting Boards**\n\nChoose a surface such as plastic, marble, glass, or pyroceramic. These materials are easier to clean than wood. Avoid contaminating vegetables with meat bacteria. Use one cutting board for fresh produce and bread. Use a separate one for raw meat, poultry, and seafood.\n\n**Cleaning Cutting Boards**\n\nWash all cutting boards with hot, soapy water after each use. Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels. Acrylic, plastic, glass, and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher (laminated boards may crack and split).\n\n**Sanitizing Cutting Boards**\n\nUse a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon (3.8 liters) of water for both wood and plastic cutting boards. Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes. Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels.\n\n**Replacing Cutting Boards**\n\nPlastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time. Throw out cutting boards that are very worn or have deep grooves.\n\n**Kitchen Sponges**\n\nKitchen sponges can grow harmful bacteria, yeasts, and molds. The United States Department of Agriculture says that the best ways to kill germs on a kitchen sponge are:\n\n*   Microwave the sponge on high for one minute, which kills up to 99% of germs.\n*   Clean it in the dishwasher, using both wash and dry cycles and a water temperature of 140°F (60°C) or higher.\n\nSoap and water or bleach and water do not work as well for killing germs on sponges. Another option is to buy a new sponge each week.\n\n---\n\n**Cooking Utensils and Nutrition**\n\n\\n\\nAs we've discussed in previous sections, the type of cooking utensil used can have a significant impact on the nutritional value of our food. In this final section, we'll explore the importance of cleanliness in preventing foodborne illness.\n\n**Cleanliness Helps Prevent Foodborne Illness**\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, cleanliness is key to preventing foodborne illness. It's essential to handle and store food safely to avoid contamination. The FDA also provides guidance on lead contamination in ceramics, emphasizing the importance of proper handling and storage.\n\n**References**\n\n*   United States Food & Drug Administration.

    "content": "**The Coombs Test**\n\nThe Coombs test looks for antibodies that may stick to your red blood cells and cause them to die too early.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\n* A blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are two types of the Coombs test:\n\n* **Direct**: used to detect antibodies that are stuck to the surface of red blood cells\n* **Indirect**: looks for antibodies that are in the blood\n\nThe direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies that are stuck to the surface of red blood cells. Many diseases and medicines can cause this to happen. These antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells and cause anemia. Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).\n\nThe indirect Coombs test looks for antibodies that are in the blood. These antibodies could act against certain red blood cells. This test is most often done to determine if you may have a reaction to a blood transfusion.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result is called a negative result. It means there was no clumping of cells and you have no antibodies to red blood cells.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal (positive) direct Coombs test means you have antibodies that act against your red blood cells. This may be due to:\n\n* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia\n* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or similar disorder\n* Blood disease in newborns called erythroblastosis fetalis (also called hemolytic disease of the newborn)\n* Infectious mononucleosis\n* Mycoplasma infection\n* Syphilis\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Transfusion reaction, such as one due to improperly matched units of blood\n\nThe test result may also be abnormal without any clear cause, especially among the older people.\n\nAn abnormal (positive) indirect Coombs test means you have antibodies that will act against red blood cells that your body views as foreign. This may suggest:\n\n* Erythroblastosis fetalis\n* Incompatible blood match (when used in blood banks)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n---\n\n**Coombs Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe Coombs test is a blood test used to detect antibodies that are stuck to the surface of red blood cells.\n\n**How is it performed?**\n\nThere are two types of the Coombs test:\n\n* **Direct**: This test detects antibodies that are directly attached to the surface of red blood cells.\n* **Indirect**: This test looks for antibodies in the blood that could act against certain red blood cells.\n\n**Why is it performed?**\n\nThe direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies that may be causing anemia or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn abnormal (positive) direct Coombs test means you have antibodies that act against your red blood cells, which could be due to various conditions such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An abnormal indirect Coombs test suggests the presence of antibodies that will act against red blood cells that your body views as foreign.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. However, other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight and may include fainting, multiple punctures to locate veins, hematoma, excessive bleeding, or infection.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nThe Coombs test is also known as the direct antiglobulin test, indirect antiglobulin test, or anemia - hemolytic.\n\n---\n\n**Coombs Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nThe Coombs test is a crucial diagnostic tool in identifying and managing various blood disorders. According to Elghetany MT and Banki K, the Coombs test plays a vital role in diagnosing erythrocytic disorders, as discussed in their chapter \"Erythrocytic Disorders\" in Henry's Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods (2022). Similarly, Michel M highlights the importance of the Coombs test in detecting autoimmune and intravascular hemolytic anemias in Goldman-Cecil Medicine (2024).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Blood Disorders**\n\n*   **Blood Disorders**: The Coombs test is a key diagnostic tool for various blood disorders, including erythrocytic disorders, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and intravascular hemolytic anemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nElghetany MT, Banki K.

    "content": "**Coping with Cancer - Hair Loss**\n\nMany people who go through cancer treatment worry about hair loss. While it may be a side effect of some treatments, it does not happen to everyone. Some treatments are less likely to make your hair fall out. Even with the same treatment, some people lose their hair and some do not. Your health care provider can tell you how likely it is that your treatment will make you lose your hair.\n\n**Why Cancer Treatments Can Cause Hair Loss**\n\nMany chemotherapy medicines are designed to attack fast-growing cells. This is because cancer cells divide rapidly. Since the cells in hair follicles also grow rapidly, cancer treatment medicines that go after cancer cells often attack hair cells at the same time. With chemo, your hair might get thinner, but not all fall out. You also may lose your eyelashes, eyebrows, and pubic or bodily hair.\n\nLike chemo, radiation kills fast-growing cells. While chemo can cause hair loss all over your body, radiation only affects the hair in the area being treated.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nHair loss mostly happens 1 to 3 weeks after the first chemo or radiation treatment.\n\nThe hair on your head may come out in clumps. You will probably see hair in your brush, in the shower, and on your pillow.\n\n**Tips to Deal with Hair Loss**\n\nIf your provider has told you treatment may cause hair loss, you might want to cut your hair short before your first treatment. This could make losing your hair less shocking and upsetting. If you decide to shave your head, use an electric razor and be careful not to cut your scalp.\n\nSome people get wigs and some cover their heads with scarves or hats. Some people do not wear anything on their heads. What you decide to do is up to you.\n\n*   **Wig Options:**\n    *   If you think you will want to have a wig, go to the salon before your hair falls out so they can set you up with a wig that matches your hair color.\n    *   Try different wig styles to decide what you like best.\n    *   If you want, you can also try a different hair color. The stylist can help you find a color that looks good with your skin tone.\n    *   Find out if the cost of the wig is covered by your insurance.\n\n**Other Suggestions:**\n\n*   Scarves, hats, and turbans are comfortable options.\n*   Ask your provider if cold cap therapy is right for you. With cold cap therapy, the scalp is cooled. This causes the hair follicles to go into a state of rest. As a result, hair loss may be limited.\n\n**Care for Thinning Hair**\n\nIf you lose some, but not all of your hair, there are many ways you can be gentle with the hair you have.\n\n*   Wash your hair two times a week or less.\n*   Use gentle shampoo and conditioner.\n*   Pat your hair dry with a towel. Avoid rubbing or pulling.\n*   Avoid products with strong chemicals. This includes permanents and hair colors.\n*   Put away things that will put stress on your hair. This includes curling irons and brush rollers.\n*   If you blow-dry your hair, put the setting at cool or warm, not hot.\n\n**How You May Feel About Losing Your Hair**\n\nIt may take a while to adjust to not having hair. Lost hair may be the most visible sign of your cancer treatment.\n\nIf you feel self-conscious about going out in public, ask a close friend or family member to go with you the first few times.\nThink ahead about how much you want to tell people. If someone asks questions you do not want to answer, you have the right to cut the conversation short. You might say, \"This is a hard subject for me to talk about.\"\nA cancer support group might help you feel less alone knowing that other people are going through this too.\n\n**Your New Hair**\n\nHair often grows back 2 to 3 months after your last chemo or radiation treatment. It may grow back a different color. It may grow back curly instead of straight. Over time, your hair may go back to the way it was before.\n\nWhen your hair starts to grow back, be gentle with it so it can get strong again. Consider a short style that is easy to care for. Continue to avoid things like harsh dyes or curling irons that can damage your hair.\n\n---\n\n**Coping with Cancer - Hair Loss**\n\nMany people who go through cancer treatment worry about hair loss.

One approach is to use cold caps or scalp cooling devices, which can help reduce hair loss by cooling the scalp and reducing blood flow. These devices have been shown to be effective in reducing hair loss in some patients.\n\n\\n\\nAccording to a study published in Abeloff's Clinical Oncology, dermatologic toxicities of anticancer therapy can include hair loss as a side effect. The American Cancer Society website provides information on coping with hair loss, including the use of cold caps and scalp cooling devices.\n\n\\n\\n**Related Topics:**\n\n*   **Cancer--Living with Cancer**\n*   **Hair Loss**\n\n\\n\\n**Learn More:** If you're interested in learning more about managing cancer side effects, including hair loss, we recommend checking out the American Cancer Society website for additional resources and information.",

    "content": "**Coping with Cancer - Looking and Feeling Your Best**\n\nCancer treatment can affect the way you look. It can change your hair, skin, nails, and weight. These changes often do not last after treatment ends. But during treatment, it can make you feel down about yourself.\n\nWhether you are a man or woman, taking time to look and feel your best may help boost your mood. Here are some grooming and lifestyle tips that can help you feel your best during cancer treatment.\n\n**Keep a Routine**\n\nStick with your regular daily grooming habits. Comb and fix your hair, shave, brush your teeth, wash your face, put on makeup, and change into something you did not sleep in, even if it is a fresh pair of pajamas. Doing so will help you feel more in control and ready for the day.\n\n**Care for Your Hair**\n\nHair loss is one of the most visible side effects of cancer treatment. Not everyone loses their hair during chemotherapy or radiation. Your hair might get thinner and more delicate. Either way, here are some things you can do.\n\n* Treat your hair gently. Avoid pulling or breaking it.\n* Consider getting a haircut that does not require a lot of styling.\n* Wash your hair no more than twice a week with gentle shampoo.\n* If you plan to wear a wig, consider meeting with a wig stylist while you still have hair.\n* Treat yourself to hats and scarves that you feel good wearing.\n* Wear a soft cap to protect your scalp from itchy hats or scarves.\n* Ask your provider if cold cap therapy is right for you. With cold cap therapy, the scalp is cooled. This causes the hair follicles to go into a state of rest. As a result, hair loss may be limited.\n\n**Care for Your Skin**\n\nYour skin may become sensitive and delicate during treatment. If your skin gets very itchy or breaks out into a rash, call your health care provider. Otherwise, here are some things you can do to take care of your skin.\n\n* Take short, warm showers to avoid drying out your skin.\n* Shower no more than once a day.\n* If you like baths, take no more than two baths a week. Ask your provider if a special oatmeal bath may help dry skin.\n* Use mild soap and lotion. Avoid soaps or lotions with perfume or alcohol. Apply lotion right after you bathe to lock in moisture.\n* Pat your skin dry. Avoid rubbing your skin with a towel.\n* Shave with an electric razor so you are less likely to get nicks and cuts.\n* Take time off from shaving if it hurts your skin.\n* Try to stay in the shade when the sun is strong.\n* Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and clothes to protect your skin from the sun.\n* Both men and women can apply a small amount of concealer (makeup) to hide skin blotches.\n\n**Care for Your Mouth**\n\nSmall cuts in your mouth can become painful during chemo or radiation therapy. If mouth sores get infected, they can hurt and make it hard to eat or drink. But, there are ways you can keep your mouth healthy.\n\n* Check the inside of your mouth every day. If you notice cuts or sores, tell your provider.\n* Gently brush your teeth, gums, and tongue after every meal and before bed.\n* Use a soft, clean toothbrush. You can also buy soft foam mouth swabs to use instead.\n* Floss daily. As an alternative, a water pick may be gentler on your gums.\n* Do not wear dentures to bed. You also may want to take them off between meals.\n* Keep your mouth from drying out by drinking water or sucking on ice chips.\n* Avoid dry or crunchy food or food that makes your mouth burn.\n* Do not smoke.\n* Do not drink alcohol.\n* Rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon (5 grams) baking soda added to 2 cups (475 milliliters) water. Do this after meals and before bed.\n* If mouth pain makes it hard to eat, tell your provider.\n* If mouth pain persists and is not relieved by routine treatments, your provider may order a prescription mouthwash.\n\n**Care for Your Nails**\n\nYour nails often become dry and brittle during treatment. They may pull away from the bed, get darker in color, and develop ridges. These changes will not last but may take quite some time to go away. Try these tips to keep your nails looking better.\n\n* Keep your fingernails short and clean.\n* Keep your nail clippers and files clean to avoid infection.\n* Wear gloves when you do dishes or work in the garden.\n* Also be careful about what you put on your nails.\n* Keep your cuticles healthy with moisturizer, cuticle cream, or olive oil.\n* Do not cut your cuticles while you are in treatment.\n* Polish is OK, but avoid polish with formaldehyde.\n* Remove polish with an oily remover.\n* Do not use artificial nails. The glue is too harsh.\n* Bring your own, sterilized tools if you get a manicure or pedicure.\n\n**Your Clothes**\n\nYour weight may change during cancer treatment. Some people lose weight and some people gain weight. You might have a surgical scar you do not want to show. The best clothes will be comfortable, fit loosely, and make you feel good. Even a new pair of fun pajamas can brighten your day.\n\n* Go for soft fabrics that feel good next to your skin.\n* Try on pants with different kinds of waistlines. Do not wear tight pants that cut into your tummy. This can upset your stomach.\n* Your skin tone may change, so favorite colors may no longer look as flattering. Jewel tones, like emerald green, turquoise blue, and ruby red look good on almost everyone. A bright scarf or hat can add color to your outfit.\n* If you have lost weight, look for large knits and extra layers to give yourself more bulk.\n* If you have gained weight, structured shirts and jackets can flatter your shape without pinching or squeezing.\n\n**Look Good Feel Better (LGFB)**\n\nLook good feel better is a website that offers additional tips for both men and women to help you feel good about your appearance during cancer treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Coping with Cancer - Looking and Feeling Your Best**\n\nWhether you're a man or woman, taking time to look and feel your best may help boost your mood during cancer treatment.\n\n**Keep a Routine**\n\nStick with your regular daily grooming habits.

    "content": "**Coping with Cancer - Managing Fatigue**\n\nFatigue is a feeling of tiredness, weakness, or exhaustion. It's different from drowsiness, which can be relieved with a good night's sleep.\n\n**What Causes Fatigue?**\n\nYour fatigue could be caused by one or more factors. Here are ways having cancer can cause fatigue:\n\n*   **Simply Having Cancer**: Some cancers release proteins called cytokines that can make you feel fatigued. Some tumors can change the way your body uses energy and leave you feeling tired.\n*   **Many Cancer Treatments**: Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and biologic therapy can all cause fatigue as a side effect.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nTalk to your health care provider about your fatigue. Keep track of when it started, whether it's getting worse over time, times of day when you feel most fatigued, and anything that makes it worse or better. Knowing the level and trigger of your fatigue can help your provider better treat it.\n\nSave your energy by taking steps to organize your home and life. Ask friends and family for help with things like grocery shopping and cooking meals. Put things you use often within easy reach so you don't have to use energy looking for them.\n\nEat well by making healthy nutrition a priority. If you've lost your appetite, eat foods high in calories and protein to keep your energy up. Stay active by taking a daily walk with as many breaks as you need.\n\nReach out to friends, family, and support groups if you're struggling to manage basic tasks or emotional needs. Contact your provider right away if you feel dizzy, confused, unable to get out of bed for 24 hours, lose your sense of balance, or have trouble catching your breath.\n\n---\n\n**Coping with Cancer - Managing Fatigue**\n\nFatigue is a feeling of tiredness, weakness, or exhaustion. It's different from drowsiness, which can be relieved with a good night's sleep. Most people feel fatigue while being treated for cancer. The severity of fatigue depends on the type of cancer, its stage, and the treatments used.\n\n**What Causes Fatigue**\n\nYour fatigue could be caused by one or more factors:\n\n*   **Simply having cancer**: Some cancers release proteins called cytokines that can make you feel fatigued. Others can change the way your body uses energy and leave you feeling tired.\n*   **Many cancer treatments**: Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and biologic therapy can all cause fatigue as a side effect.\n*   **Other factors**:\n    *   Anemia: Some cancer treatments decrease or kill red blood cells that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body.\n    *   Poor nutrition: Nausea or lost appetite can make it hard to keep your body fueled. Even if your eating habits don't change, your body may have trouble taking in nutrients during cancer treatment.\n    *   Emotional stress: Having cancer can make you feel anxious, depressed, or distressed. These emotions can drain your energy and motivation.\n    *   Medicines: Many of the medicines for treating pain, depression, insomnia, and nausea can also cause fatigue.\n    *   Sleep problems: Pain, distress, and other cancer side effects can make it hard to get truly rested.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nTo manage fatigue, try these tips:\n\n*   **Talk to your health care provider**: Keep track of when the fatigue started, whether it's getting worse over time, times of day when you feel most fatigued, and anything that seems to make it worse or better.\n*   **Save your energy**: Take steps to organize your home and life. Ask friends and family for help with things like grocery shopping and cooking meals.\n*   **Eat well**: Make healthy nutrition a priority. Eat small meals throughout the day instead of 2 or 3 big meals. Drink smoothies and vegetable juice for healthy calories.\n*   **Stay active**: Sitting still for too long can make fatigue worse. Take a daily walk with as many breaks as you need to help boost your energy and sleep better.\n*   **Reach out**: If you have cancer, your fatigue may make it difficult to deal with your practical, financial, and emotional needs. Friends, family, and support groups can help.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if fatigue is making it difficult or impossible for you to manage basic tasks. Contact your provider right away if you feel any of these things:\n\n*   Dizzy\n*   Confused\n*   Unable to get out of bed for 24 hours\n*   Lose your sense of balance\n*   Have trouble catching your breath\n\n---\n\n**Coping with Cancer - Managing Fatigue**\n\nHaving cancer can be draining in more ways than one. There are e proteins called cytokines that can make you feel fatigued. Some tumors can change the way your body uses energy and leave you feeling tired.\n\nMany cancer treatments cause fatigue as a side effect:\n\n*   **Chemotherapy**: You may feel most worn out for a few days after each chemo treatment. Your fatigue may get worse with each treatment.\n*   **Radiation**: Fatigue often gets more intense with each radiation treatment until about halfway through the cycle.\n*   **Surgery**: Fatigue is common when recovering from any surgery. Having surgery along with other cancer treatments can make fatigue last longer.\n*   **Biologic therapy**: Treatments that use vaccines or bacteria to trigger your immune system to fight cancer can cause fatigue.\n\nOther factors:\n\n*   **Anemia**: Some cancer treatments decrease, or kill, red blood cells that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body.\n*   **Poor nutrition**: Nausea or lost appetite can make it hard to keep your body fueled. Even if your eating habits do not change, your body may have trouble taking in nutrients during cancer treatment.\n*   **Emotional stress**: Having cancer can make you feel anxious, depressed, or distressed. These emotions can drain your energy and motivation.\n*   **Medicines**: Many of the medicines for treating pain, depression, insomnia, and nausea can also cause fatigue.\n*   **Sleep problems**: Pain, distress, and other cancer side effects can make it hard to get truly rested.\n\nYour fatigue could be caused by one or more factors. Here are ways having cancer can cause fatigue.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\nTo manage your fatigue, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Talk to your health care provider**: Keep track of the following details so you can tell your provider about your fatigue.\n    *   When the fatigue started\n    *   Whether your fatigue is getting worse over time\n    *   Times of day when you feel most fatigued\n    *   Anything (activities, people, food, medicine) that seem to make it worse or better\n    *   Whether you have trouble sleeping or feel rested after a full night's sleep\n2.  **Save your energy**: Take steps to organize your home and life. Then you can spend your energy doing what matters most to you.\n3.  **Eat well**: Make healthy nutrition a priority. If you have lost your appetite, eat foods high in calories and protein to keep your energy up.\n4.  **Stay active**: Sitting still for too long can make fatigue worse. Some light activity can get your circulation going.\n5.  **Reach out**: If you have cancer, your fatigue may make it difficult to deal with your practical, financial, and emotional needs. Friends, family, and support groups can help.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if fatigue is making it difficult or impossible for you to manage basic tasks. Contact your provider right away if you feel any of these things:\n\n*   Dizzy\n*   Confused\n*   Unable to get out of bed for 24 hours\n*   Lose your sense of balance\n*   Have trouble catching your breath\n\n---\n\n**Coping with Cancer - Managing Fatigue**\n\n**What is cancer-related fatigue?**\n\nCancer-related fatigue, also known as tiredness or exhaustion, is a common side effect of cancer and its treatment. It can be caused by the disease itself, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or other treatments.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Doroshow JH. Approach to the patient with cancer.

    "content": "**Copper in Diet**\n\nCopper is an essential trace element present in all body tissues. A small amount is needed for the body to function, but the body cannot make its own copper. You must get it from food.\n\n**Function**\n\n* Copper works with iron to help the body form red blood cells.\n* It also helps keep the blood vessels, nerves, immune system, and bones healthy.\n* Copper also aids in iron absorption.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\n* Oysters and other shellfish\n* Whole grains\n* Beans\n* Nuts\n* Potatoes\n* Organ meats (kidneys, liver)\n* Dark leafy greens\n* Dried fruits such as prunes\n* Cocoa\n* Black pepper\n* Yeast\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n* Normally people get enough copper from the foods they eat.\n* Menkes disease (kinky hair syndrome) is a very rare disorder of copper metabolism that is present before birth. It occurs in male infants and affects their copper levels.\n* Lack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis.\n* In large amounts, copper is poisonous. A rare inherited disorder, Wilson disease, causes deposits of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nDosages for copper, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people.\n\n* Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people.\n* Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.\n\n**Dietary Reference Intakes for Copper**\n\n* Infants (AI)\n\t+ 0 to 6 months: 200 micrograms per day (mcg/day)\n\t+ 7 to 12 months: 220 mcg/day\n* Children (RDA)\n\t+ 1 to 3 years: 340 mcg/day\n\t+ 4 to 8 years: 440 mcg/day\n\t+ 9 to 13 years: 700 mcg/day\n* Adolescents and adults (RDA)\n\t+ Males and females age 14 to 18 years: 890 mcg/day\n\t+ Males and females age 19 and older: 900 mcg/day\n\t+ Pregnant females: 1,000 mcg/day\n\t+ Lactating females: 1,300 mcg/day\n\n**The Best Way to Get the Daily Requirement of Essential Vitamins**\n\n* The best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods from the food guide plate.\n\n**Specific Recommendations Depend on Age, Sex, and Other Factors**\n\n* Women who are pregnant or producing breast milk (lactating) need higher amounts.

It also helps keep the blood vessels, nerves, immune system, and bones healthy. Copper also aids in iron absorption.\n\n**Food Sources**\n\nOysters and other shellfish, whole grains, beans, nuts, potatoes, and organ meats (kidneys, liver) are good sources of copper. Dark leafy greens, dried fruits such as prunes, cocoa, black pepper, and yeast are also sources of copper in the diet.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nNormally people get enough copper from the foods they eat. Menkes disease (kinky hair syndrome) is a very rare disorder of copper metabolism that is present before birth. It occurs in male infants and affects their copper levels.\n\nLack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis.\n\nIn large amounts, copper is poisonous. A rare inherited disorder, Wilson disease, causes deposits of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000129.htm",
    "content": "**Cor Pulmonale**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nHigh blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs is called pulmonary hypertension. It is the most common cause of cor pulmonale.\n\nIn people who have pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs can lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. If this high pressure continues, it puts a strain on the right side of the heart. That strain can cause cor pulmonale.\n\nLung conditions that cause a low blood oxygen level in the blood over a long time can also lead to cor pulmonale. Some of these are:\n\n*   Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n*   Chronic blood clots in the lungs\n*   Cystic fibrosis (CF)\n*   Severe bronchiectasis \n*   Scarring of the lung tissue (interstitial lung disease)\n*   Severe curving of the upper part of the spine (kyphoscoliosis)\n*   Obstructive sleep apnea, which causes stops in breathing during sleep\n*   Idiopathic (no specific cause) tightening (constriction) of the blood vessels of the lungs, also called primary pulmonary hypertension\n*   Severe left-sided heart failure\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nShortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom of cor pulmonale. You may also have a fast heartbeat and feel like your heart is pounding.\n\nOver time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while you are at rest. Symptoms you may have are:\n\n*   Fainting spells during activity\n*   Chest discomfort, usually in the front of the chest\n*   Chest pain\n*   Swelling of the feet or ankles\n*   Symptoms of lung disorders, such as wheezing or coughing or phlegm production\n*   Bluish lips and fingers (cyanosis)\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find:\n\n*   Fluid buildup in your belly\n*   Abnormal heart sounds\n*   Bluish skin\n*   Liver swelling\n*   Swelling of the neck veins, which is a sign of high pressure in the right side of the heart\n*   Ankle swelling\n\nThese tests may help diagnose cor pulmonale as well as its cause:\n\n*   Blood antibody tests\n*   Blood test to check for a substance called brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   CT scan of the chest, with or without an injection of a contrast fluid (dye)\n*   Echocardiogram\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Lung biopsy (rarely done)\n*   Measurement of blood oxygen by checking arterial blood gas (ABG)\n*   Pulmonary (lung) function tests\n*   Right heart catheterization\n*   Ventilation and perfusion scan of the lungs (V/Q scan)\n*   Tests for autoimmune lung disease\n\n---\n\n**Cor Pulmonale**\n\n**Causes**\n\nHigh blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension, is the most common cause of cor pulmonale.\n\nIn people with pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs, putting a strain on the right side of the heart that can cause cor pulmonale.\n\nLung conditions that cause low blood oxygen levels over time can also lead to cor pulmonale, including:\n\n*   Autoimmune diseases like scleroderma\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n*   Chronic blood clots in the lungs\n*   Cystic fibrosis (CF)\n*   Severe bronchiectasis\n*   Scarring of lung tissue (interstitial lung disease)\n*   Severe curving of the upper part of the spine (kyphoscoliosis)\n*   Obstructive sleep apnea\n*   Idiopathic tightening of blood vessels in the lungs (primary pulmonary hypertension)\n*   Severe left-sided heart failure\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nShortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom of cor pulmonale. You may also experience a fast heartbeat and feel like your heart is pounding.\n\nOver time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest, including:\n\n*   Fainting spells during activity\n*   Chest discomfort in the front of the chest\n*   Chest pain\n*   Swelling of the feet or ankles\n*   Symptoms of lung disorders, such as wheezing or coughing or phlegm production\n*   Bluish lips and fingers (cyanosis)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control symptoms. It's essential to treat underlying medical problems that cause pulmonary hypertension, as they can lead to cor pulmonale.\n\nMany treatment options are available, and the cause of your cor pulmonale will determine which treatment you receive.\n\nMedicines may be prescribed to take by mouth (oral), receive through a vein (intravenous or IV), or breathe in (inhaled). You'll be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and see how well the medicine works for you.

    "content": "**Cord Blood Testing and Banking**\n\n**What are cord blood testing and cord blood banking?**\n\nCord blood is the blood left in the umbilical cord after a baby is born. The umbilical cord connects a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy. It contains blood vessels that bring nourishment to the baby and remove waste products.\n\nAfter a baby is born, the cord is clamped shut and cut. The blood that remains in the cord may be collected and used in two ways:\n\n* **Cord Blood Testing**: This means doing a variety of tests on cord blood to check the baby's health.\n* **Cord Blood Banking**: This means saving blood from the baby's umbilical cord in a special facility called a cord blood bank.\n\n**What is Cord Blood Used For?**\n\nCord blood can be used to treat certain blood disorders, including leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and some types of anemia. It can also be used to treat certain inherited metabolic and immune system disorders.\n\nResearchers are studying whether stem cell treatment can also help treat other types of diseases.\n\n**How is Cord Blood Collected?**\n\nCollecting cord blood does not change anything about your birth experience. After your baby is born, the umbilical cord will be pinched closed with a clamp and cut. Then the provider will either use a needle to remove blood from the cord or let the blood drip out of the cord.\n\n**Is There Any Preparation Needed for Cord Blood Testing or Banking?**\n\nFor cord blood testing, you don't need to prepare anything.\n\nFor cord blood banking, you need to plan in advance. If you're considering donating cord blood or privately banking it, talk with your provider at least three months before your baby is due.\n\n**What Do Cord Blood Test Results Mean?**\n\nCord blood test results will depend on what was measured. If the results were not normal, ask your baby's provider to explain what they mean for your baby's health.\n\n---\n\n**Cord Blood Testing and Banking**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cord Blood?**\n\nCord blood is the blood left in the umbilical cord after a baby is born. The umbilical cord connects a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy. It contains blood vessels that bring nourishment to the baby and remove waste products.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cord Blood Testing**\n\nCord blood testing means doing a variety of tests on cord blood to check the baby's health. Tests may also be done on cord blood if a healthcare provider is concerned that the baby may have a health condition, such as an infection or an acid-base (pH) imbalance. Some hospitals may routinely collect cord blood samples to do tests to check a baby's general health.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cord Blood Banking**\n\nCord blood banking means saving blood from the baby's umbilical cord in a special facility called a cord blood bank. The blood is saved so it can be used to treat certain diseases. Umbilical cord blood is full of special cells called stem cells. Stem cells can develop into many different types of cells found in the body, such as blood, brain, muscle, and organ cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Cord Blood Used For?**\n\nStem cells from cord blood can be used to treat certain blood disorders, including leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and some types of anemia. They can also be used to treat certain inherited metabolic and immune system disorders. Researchers are studying whether stem cell treatment can also help treat other types of diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cord Blood Testing Uses**\n\nCord blood tests may be done after your baby is born to:\n\n*   Measure blood gases\n*   Measure bilirubin levels\n*   Do a blood culture test\n*   Do a complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Check blood glucose (sugar) levels\n*   Check for exposure to illegal drugs or certain prescription drugs\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cord Blood Banking Uses**\n\nCord blood banking is used to save cord blood so that the stem cells can be used to treat certain blood disorders and cancers. You may want to consider donating cord blood if you want to help others. A public blood cord bank provides lifesaving stem cells to people who need treatment now.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Consider Cord Blood Banking**\n\nYou may want to consider family cord blood banking if:\n\n*   You have a family history of a genetic disorder or cancer that can be treated with stem cells\n*   You or a family member currently has a disorder that may be treated with stem cells\n\n---\n\n**Cord Blood Testing and Banking**\n\n**What is Cord Blood Testing?**\n\nCord blood testing involves collecting a sample of blood from the umbilical cord after birth. The blood is then sent to a lab for testing.\n\n**How is Cord Blood Collected?**\n\nTo collect cord blood, a provider will either use a needle to remove blood from the cord or let the blood drip out of the cord. The blood is collected in a special bag and sent to a lab for testing or to a cord blood bank for long-term storage.\n\n**Is There Any Preparation Needed for Cord Blood Testing?**\n\nNo preparation is needed for cord blood testing.\n\n**What Do I Need to Plan For If I Want To Bank My Baby's Cord Blood?**\n\nIf you're considering donating cord blood or privately banking it, talk with your provider at least three months before your baby is due. This will give you time to:\n\n* Decide whether to donate the blood to a public bank or save it in a family cord blood bank\n* Get information about your options for collecting the blood\n* Finish paperwork about your medical history and your family health history\n* Receive a cord blood collection kit if you are using a family cord blood bank\n\n**Are There Any Risks To Cord Blood Testing Or Banking?**\n\nCord blood testing has no risks. With cord blood banking, the mother will need to have a blood test to check for infections to help make sure the cord blood is safe to use. There is very little risk to having a blood test.\n\n**What Do Cord Blood Test Results Mean?**\n\nCord blood test results will depend on what was measured. If the results were not normal, ask your baby's provider to explain what they mean for your baby's health.\n\n**References**\n\n* ACOG: The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n* Armstrong L, Stenson BJ.

This blood contains stem cells that can be used to treat various medical conditions.\n\n\\n\\n**Why is Cord Blood Banking Important?**\n\nCord blood banking is important because it allows parents to store their child's stem cells for future use in case of a medical emergency. The stored stem cells can be used to treat a variety of diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and other types of cancer.\n\n\\n\\n**How Does Cord Blood Testing Work?**\n\nCord blood testing involves collecting a sample of the newborn's cord blood after birth.

It is one of the most common transplants done.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had a corneal transplant. There are two ways to do this:\n\n* In one (penetrating or PK), most of the tissue of your cornea was replaced with tissue from a donor.\n* In the other (lamellar keratoplasty or Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty - DSEK), only the outer layers (lamellar) or inner layers (DSEK) of the cornea are transplanted. Recovery is often faster with this method.\n\nNumbing medicine was injected into the area around your eye so you did not feel any pain during surgery. You may have taken a sedative to help you relax.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\n* If you had a PK, the first stage of healing will take about 3 weeks.\n* After this, you will likely need contact lenses or glasses. These may need to be changed or adjusted several times in the first year after your transplant.\n* If you had a lamellar keratoplasty or DSEK, visual recovery is often quicker and you may even be able to use your old glasses.\n\n**Self-care**\n\n* Do not touch or rub your eye.\n* If you had a PK, your surgeon probably put a patch over your eye at the end of surgery. You can remove this patch the next morning but you will probably have an eye shield for sleeping.\n* If you had a DSEK, you probably won't have a patch or shield after the first day. Sunglasses will still be helpful.\n* You should not drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, or make any major decisions for at least 24 hours after surgery.\n* Limit activities that could make you fall or increase pressure on your eye, such as climbing a ladder or dancing. Avoid heavy lifting. Try not to do things that place your head lower than the rest of your body.\n* Follow your surgeon's instructions for using eye drops carefully.\n\n**Follow up with Your Surgeon**\n\nYou may need to have stitches removed, and your surgeon will want to check your healing and eyesight.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if you have:\n\n* Decreased vision\n* Flashes of light or floaters in your eye\n* Light sensitivity (sunlight or bright lights hurt your eye)\n* More redness in your eye\n* Eye pain\n\n---\n\n**Corneal Transplant - Discharge**\n\nYou had a corneal transplant. There are two ways to do this.\n\nIn one (penetrating or PK), most of the tissue of your cornea (the clear surface on the front of your eye) was replaced with tissue from a donor. During your surgery, a small round piece of your cornea was taken out. Then the donated cornea was sewn into the opening of your eye.\n\nIn the other (lamellar keratoplasty or Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty - DSEK), only the outer layers (lamellar) or inner layers (DSEK) of the cornea are transplanted.

Sunglasses will still be helpful.\n\nYou should not drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, or make any major decisions for at least 24 hours after surgery. The sedative will take this long to fully wear off. Before it does, it may make you very sleepy and unable to think clearly.\n\nLimit activities that could make you fall or increase pressure on your eye, such as climbing a ladder or dancing. Avoid heavy lifting. Try not to do things that place your head lower than the rest of your body. It may help to sleep with your upper body elevated by a couple pillows. Stay away from dust and blowing sand.\n\nFollow your surgeon's instructions for using eye drops carefully. The drops help prevent infection. They also help prevent your body from rejecting your new cornea.\n\nFollow up with your surgeon as directed.

This can be due to several factors, including:\n\n*   **Astigmatism**: A condition where the new cornea is shaped unevenly, causing blurred vision at different distances.\n*   **Myopia** (nearsightedness): The new cornea is too steep, causing close objects to appear blurry.\n*   **Hyperopia** (farsightedness): The new cornea is too flat, causing distant objects to appear blurry.\n\nIn some cases, the vision problems may be due to the way the transplant was performed. For example:\n\n*   **Incorrect placement of the graft**: If the new cornea is not placed correctly, it can cause vision problems.\n*   **Incomplete healing of the graft**: If the new cornea does not heal properly, it can lead to vision problems.\n\nTo manage vision problems after a corneal transplant, you may need to:\n\n*   **Wear corrective lenses**: Glasses or contact lenses can help correct astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia.\n*   **Undergo additional surgery**: In some cases, additional surgery may be needed to correct the shape of the new cornea.\n\nIt's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and address any vision problems that arise.",

It is one of the most common transplants done.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou will most likely be awake during the transplant. You will get medicine to relax you. Local anesthesia (numbing medicine) will be injected around your eye to block pain and prevent eye movement during the surgery.\n\nThe tissue for your corneal transplant will come from a person (donor) who has recently died. The donated cornea is processed and tested by a local eye bank to make sure it is safe for use in your surgery.\n\n**Types of Corneal Transplants**\n\nThere are two main types of corneal transplants:\n\n*   **Penetrating Keratoplasty**: This is the most common type of corneal transplant.

The donated tissue will then be sewn into the opening of your cornea.\n*   **Lamellar Keratoplasty**: This is a newer technique that replaces only the inner or outer layers of the cornea, rather than all the layers. There are several different lamellar techniques, which differ mostly on which layer is replaced and how the donor tissue is prepared.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA corneal transplant is recommended for people who have:\n\n*   Vision problems caused by thinning of the cornea, most often due to keratoconus.\n*   Scarring of the cornea from severe infections or injuries.\n*   Vision loss caused by cloudiness of the cornea, most often due to Fuchs dystrophy.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe body may reject the transplanted tissue. This occurs in about 1 out of 3 patients in the first 5 years. Rejection can sometimes be controlled with steroid eye drops. There have been rare cases of graft rejection reported soon after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nOther risks for a corneal transplant are:\n\n*   Bleeding\n*   Cataracts\n*   Infection of the eye\n*   Glaucoma (high pressure in the eye that can cause vision loss)\n*   Loss of vision\n*   Scarring of the eye\n*   Swelling of the cornea\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon and health care provider about any medical conditions you may have, including allergies. Also tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, and herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nYou may need to limit medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot (blood thinners) for 10 days before the surgery. Some of these are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin).\n\nAsk your surgeon which of your other daily medicines, such as water pills, insulin or pills for diabetes, you should take on the morning of your surgery.\n\nYou will need to stop eating and drinking most fluids after midnight the night before your surgery. Most surgeons will let you have water, apple juice, and plain coffee or tea (without cream or sugar) up to 2 hours before surgery. Do not drink alcohol 24 hours before or after surgery.\n\nOn the day of your surgery, wear loose, comfortable clothing. Do not wear any jewelry. Do not put creams, lotions, or makeup on your face or around your eyes.\n\nYou will need to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will go home on the same day as your surgery. Your surgeon will give you an eye patch to wear for about 1 to 4 days.\n\nYour surgeon will prescribe eye drops to help your eye heal and prevent infection and rejection.\n\nYour surgeon will remove the stitches at a follow-up visit. Some stitches may stay in place for as long as a year, or they might not be removed at all.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFull recovery of eyesight may take up to a year. This is because it takes time for the swelling to go down. Most people who have a successful corneal transplant will have good vision for many years. If you have other eye problems, you may still have vision loss from those conditions.\n\nYou may need glasses or contact lenses to achieve the best vision.

The study, conducted by Gómez-Benlloch A,, Montesel A, Pareja-Aricò L, et al., identified several reasons for transplant failure, including improper surgical technique, inadequate donor tissue quality, and patient non-compliance with post-operative care.\n\n\\n\\n**Dramatic Reduction in Corneal Transplants for Keratoconus**\n\nA study published in Cornea found that there was a dramatic reduction in corneal transplants for keratoconus 15 years after the introduction of corneal collagen crosslinking. The study, conducted by Hagem AM, Thorsrud A, Sæthre M, Sandvik G, Kristianslund O, Drolsum L., revealed that the use of crosslinking has significantly reduced the need for corneal transplants in patients with keratoconus.\n\n\\n\\n**LiQD Cornea: Pro-regeneration Collagen Mimetics as Patches and Alternatives to Corneal Transplantation**\n\nResearchers have been exploring alternative methods to corneal transplantation, including the use of pro-regeneration collagen mimetics. A study published in Science Advances found that LiQD cornea, a type of collagen mimetic, has shown promise as a patch or an alternative to corneal transplantation. The study, conducted by McTiernan CD, Simpson FC, Haagdorens M, et al., highlighted the potential of LiQD cornea in regenerating damaged corneas.\n\n\\n\\n**Global Impact of COVID-19 on Corneal Donor Tissue Harvesting and Corneal Transplantation**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on various aspects of healthcare, including corneal transplantation. A study published in Front Med (Lausanne) found that the global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic led to a decrease in corneal donor tissue harvesting and transplantation. The study, conducted by Mousavi M, Kahuam-López N, Iovieno A, Yeung SN., emphasized the need for healthcare providers to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of future pandemics on organ donation and transplantation.\n\n\\n\\n**Characteristics of Endothelial Corneal Transplant Rejection Following Immunisation with SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA Vaccine**\n\nResearchers have been investigating the potential risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines, including the risk of endothelial corneal transplant rejection. A study published in Br J Ophthalmol found that patients who received the SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccine were at a higher risk of developing antibodies against their transplanted corneas. The study, conducted by Phylactou M, Li JO, Larkin DFP., highlighted the importance of monitoring patients for signs of rejection following vaccination.\n\n\\n\\n**Corneal Transplantation in Ocular Surface Disease**\n\nCorneal transplantation is a common treatment option for patients with ocular surface disease. A chapter published in Cornea emphasized the importance of careful patient selection and proper surgical technique to ensure successful outcomes. The chapter, written by Pierson KL, Holland EJ, Mannis MJ., provided an overview of the indications, contraindications, and post-operative care for corneal transplantation in patients with ocular surface disease.\n\n\\n\\n**Surgical Ocular Surface Reconstruction**\n\nSurgical ocular surface reconstruction is a treatment option for patients with severe ocular surface disease. A chapter published in Ophthalmology discussed the various surgical techniques used to reconstruct the ocular surface. The chapter, written by Venkateswaran N, Nikpoor N, Perez VL., highlighted the importance of careful patient selection and proper surgical technique to ensure successful outcomes.\n\n\\n\\n**Diseases of the Visual System**\n\nCorneal transplantation is a treatment option for various diseases affecting the visual system. A chapter published in Goldman-Cecil Medicine provided an overview of the diseases that can affect the cornea and visual system, including keratoconus, Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, and corneal ulcers. The chapter, written by Cioffi GA, Liebmann JM., emphasized the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent vision loss.\n\n\\n\\n**Review Date: 8/5/2024**\n\nThis article was last reviewed on August 5, 2024, by Franklin W.
