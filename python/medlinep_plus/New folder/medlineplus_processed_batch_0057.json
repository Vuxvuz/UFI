Disopyramide is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmic medications. It works by making your heart more resistant to abnormal activity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDisopyramide comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. Disopyramide capsules may be taken every 6 or 8 hours. The extended-release capsule is usually taken every 12 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take disopyramide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nSwallow the extended-release capsules; do not open, crush, or chew them.\n\nDisopyramide helps control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take disopyramide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking disopyramide without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking disopyramide,\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to disopyramide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in disopyramide capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking disopyramide. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\ntell your doctor if you have heart block (condition in which electrical signals are not passed normally from the upper chambers of the heart to the lower chambers) or have or have ever had a prolonged QT interval (condition that increases the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat that may cause fainting or sudden death). Your doctor may tell you not to take disopyramide.\n\ntell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease, low or high blood levels of potassium in your blood, diabetes, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness), urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy, kidney or liver disease.\n\ntell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking disopyramide, call your doctor.\n\ntalk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking disopyramide if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take disopyramide because it is not as safe or effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.\n\nif you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking disopyramide.\n\nask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking disopyramide.\n\n---\n\n**Disopyramide: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Before Taking Disopyramide**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to disopyramide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in disopyramide capsules.\n*   Inform your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking disopyramide.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   If you have heart block (condition in which electrical signals are not passed normally from the upper chambers of the heart to the lower chambers) or a prolonged QT interval (condition that increases the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat), your doctor may advise against taking disopyramide.\n*   Inform your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease, low or high blood levels of potassium in your blood, diabetes, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy, kidney, or liver disease.\n\n**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**\n\n*   If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking disopyramide, consult your doctor.\n*   Inform your doctor if you are breastfeeding.\n\n**Older Adults**\n\n*   Discuss the risks and benefits of taking disopyramide with your doctor if you are 65 years of age or older.

If these proteins become abnormally active throughout the body, you could develop DIC. The underlying cause is usually due to inflammation, infection, or cancer.\n\nIn some cases of DIC, small blood clots form in the blood vessels. Some of these clots can clog the vessels and cut off the normal blood supply to organs such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. Lack of blood flow can damage and cause major injury to the organs.\n\nIn other cases of DIC, the clotting proteins in your blood are consumed. When this happens, you may have a high risk of serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. You may also have bleeding that starts spontaneously (on its own).

    "content": "**Disseminated Tuberculosis**\n\nDisseminated tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection in which mycobacteria spread from the lungs to other parts of the body through the blood or lymph system.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTuberculosis (TB) infection can develop after breathing in droplets sprayed into the air from a cough or sneeze by someone infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The resulting lung infection is called primary TB.\n\nThe usual site of TB is the lungs (pulmonary TB), but other organs can be involved. In the United States, most people with primary TB get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in a small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection.\n\nDisseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it occurs years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weakened immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medicines. Infants and older adults are also at higher risk.\n\nYour risk of catching TB increases if you:\n\n* Are around people who have the disease (such as during overseas travel)\n* Live in crowded or unclean conditions\n* Are immunocompromised by a disease or medicines\n* Have poor nutrition\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDisseminated tuberculosis can affect many different body areas. Symptoms depend on the affected areas of the body and can include:\n\n* Abdominal pain or swelling\n* Chills\n* Cough and shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\n* Joint pain\n* Pale skin due to anemia (pallor)\n* Sweating\n* Swollen glands\n* Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show:\n\n* Swollen liver\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n* Swollen spleen\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Biopsies and cultures of affected organs or tissues\n* Bronchoscopy for biopsy or culture\n* Chest x-ray\n* CT scan of the affected area\n* Fundoscopy to check for retinal lesions\n* Interferon-gamma release blood test, such as the QFT-Gold test to test for prior exposure to TB\n* Lung biopsy\n* Mycobacterial culture of bone marrow or blood\n* Pleural biopsy\n* Tuberculin skin test (PPD test)\n* Sputum examination and cultures\n* Thoracentesis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to cure the infection with medicines that fight the TB bacteria. Treatment of disseminated TB involves a combination of several medicines (usually 4). All medicines are continued until lab tests show which work best.\n\nYou may need to take many different pills for 6 months or longer. It is very important that you take the pills the way your provider instructs.\n\nWhen people do not take their TB medicines as instructed, the infection can become much more difficult to treat. The TB bacteria can become resistant to treatment. This means the medicines no longer work.\n\nWhen there is concern that a person may not take all the medicines as directed, a provider may need to watch the person take the prescribed medicines. This approach is called directly observed therapy. In this case, medicines may be given 2 or 3 times a week, as prescribed by a provider.\n\nYou may need to stay at home or be admitted to a hospital for 2 to 4 weeks to avoid spreading the disease to others until you are no longer contagious.\n\nYour provider may be required by law to report your TB illness to the local health department. Your health care team will ensure that you receive the best care.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost forms of disseminated TB respond well to treatment. The tissue that is affected, such as the bones or joints, may have permanent damage due to the infection.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of disseminated TB can include:\n\n* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n* Liver inflammation\n* Lung failure\n* Return of the disease\n\nMedicines used to treat TB can cause side effects, including:\n\n* Changes in vision\n* Orange- or brown-colored tears and urine\n* Rash\n* Liver inflammation\n\nA vision test may be done before treatment so your provider can monitor any changes in the health of your eyes.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you know or suspect that you have been exposed to TB. All forms of TB and exposure need prompt evaluation and treatment.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTB is a preventable disease, even in those who have been exposed to an infected person. Skin testing for TB is used in high-risk populations or in people who may have been exposed to TB, such as health care workers.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to TB should be skin tested immediately and have a follow-up test at a later date, if the first test is negative.\n\nA positive skin test means you have come into contact with the TB bacteria. It does not mean that you have active disease or are contagious. Talk to your provider about how to prevent developing active disease.\n\nPrompt treatment is extremely important in controlling the spread of TB from those who have active TB disease to those who have never been infected with TB.\n\nSome countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccination (called BCG) to prevent TB. The effectiveness of this vaccine is limited and it is not routinely used in the United States.\n\nPeople who have had BCG may still be skin tested for TB. Discuss the test results (if positive) with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Disseminated Tuberculosis**\n\n\\n\\nThis type of TB is more likely to occur if you have a weakened immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medicines.

It is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition if left untreated.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of disseminated TB is not fully understood, but it is believed to occur when the bacteria that cause TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are able to spread from one part of the body to another through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. This can happen in people who have a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS or taking immunosuppressive medications.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of disseminated TB can vary depending on which parts of the body are affected, but may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Chills\n* Coughing up blood\n* Chest pain\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing disseminated TB typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n* Chest X-ray or CT scan to look for signs of TB in the lungs\n* Blood tests to check for the presence of TB bacteria or antibodies against them\n* Sputum test to check for TB bacteria in the respiratory tract\n* Biopsy of affected tissue to confirm the diagnosis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for disseminated TB typically involves a combination of antibiotics, such as isoniazid and rifampicin, which are taken orally for 6-12 months. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to receive treatment and close monitoring.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTB is a preventable disease, even in those who have been exposed to an infected person. Skin testing for TB is used in high-risk populations or in people who may have been exposed to TB, such as health care workers.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to TB should be skin tested immediately and have a follow-up test at a later date, if the first test is negative.\n\nA positive skin test means you have come into contact with the TB bacteria.

    "content": "**Distal Arthrogryposis Type 1**\n\n**Description**\n\nDistal arthrogryposis type 1 is a disorder characterized by joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet. The term \"arthrogryposis\" comes from the Greek words for joint (arthro-) and crooked or hooked (gryposis). The characteristic features of this condition include permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), overlapping fingers, and a hand deformity in which all of the fingers are angled outward toward the fifth finger (ulnar deviation). Clubfoot, which is an inward- and upward-turning foot, is also commonly seen with distal arthrogryposis type 1. The specific hand and foot abnormalities vary among affected individuals. However, this condition typically does not cause any signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDistal arthrogryposis type 1 affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDistal arthrogryposis type 1 can be caused by mutations in at least two genes: TPM2 and MYBPC1. These genes are active (expressed) in muscle cells, where they interact with other muscle proteins to help regulate the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). It is unclear how mutations in the TPM2 and MYBPC1 genes lead to the joint abnormalities characteristic of distal arthrogryposis type 1. However, researchers speculate that contractures may be related to problems with muscle contraction that limit the movement of joints before birth.\n\nIn some cases, the genetic cause of distal arthrogryposis type 1 is unknown. Researchers are looking for additional genetic changes that may be responsible for this condition.\n\n**Learn more about the genes associated with Distal arthrogryposis type 1**\n\n*   MYBPC1\n*   TPM2\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

    "content": "**Distal Median Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nDistal median nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy that affects the movement of or sensation in the hands.\n\n**A Common Type: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a common type of distal median nerve dysfunction.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDysfunction of one nerve group, such as the distal median nerve, is called a mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy usually means there is a local cause of the nerve damage. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.\n\nThis condition occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. The most common reason is trapping (entrapment) by a ligament in the wrist. This causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Trapping puts pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly. Or, it may increase the risk for trapping the nerve later on.\n\nInflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) or joints (arthritis) can also put pressure on the nerve. Some repetitive movements increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment. Women are more affected than men.\n\nProblems that affect the tissue near the nerve or cause deposits to form in the tissue can block blood flow and lead to pressure on the nerve. Such conditions include:\n\n* Too much growth hormone in the body (acromegaly)\n* Diabetes\n* Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n* Kidney disease\n* A blood cancer called multiple myeloma\n* Pregnancy\n* Obesity\n* Amyloidosis\n\nIn some cases, no cause can be found. Diabetes can make this condition worse.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Pain in the wrist or hand that may be severe and wake you up at night, and that may be felt in other areas, such as the upper arm (this is called referred pain)\n* Sensation changes in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers, such as a burning feeling, decreased sensation, numbness and tingling\n* Weakness of the hand that causes you to drop things or have difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine your wrist and ask about your medical history. Tests that may be done include:\n\n* Electromyogram (EMG) to check the electrical activity of the muscles\n* Nerve conduction tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve\n* Neuromuscular ultrasound to view problems with the muscles and nerves\n* Nerve biopsy in which nerve tissue is removed for examination (rarely needed)\n* Blood tests to look for medical conditions associated with mononeuropathy\n* Magnetic resonance neurography (very detailed imaging of the peripheral nerves)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is aimed at the underlying cause.\n\nIf the median nerve is affected by carpal tunnel syndrome, a wrist splint can reduce further injury to the nerve and help relieve symptoms. Wearing the splint at night rests the area and decreases inflammation. An injection into the wrist may help with symptoms, but it won't fix the underlying problem. Surgery may be needed if a splint or medicines don't help. Using proper ergonomics at work is essential.\n\nFor other causes, treatment may involve any of the following:\n\n* Medicines to control nerve pain (such as gabapentin or pregabalin)\n* Treating the medical problem causing nerve damage, such as diabetes or kidney disease\n* Physical therapy to help maintain muscle strength\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be identified and treated, there is a good chance of full recovery. In some cases, there is some or complete loss of movement or sensation. Nerve pain may be severe and persist for a long time.\n\nPossible complications include:\n\n* Deformity of the hand (rare)\n* Partial or complete loss of hand movement\n* Partial or complete loss of sensation in the fingers\n* Recurrent or unnoticed injury to the hand\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of distal median nerve dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of curing or controlling symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention varies, depending on the cause. In people with diabetes, controlling blood sugar may reduce the risk of developing nerve disorders.\n\nFor people with jobs that involve repetitive wrist movements, a change in the way the job is performed may be needed. Frequent breaks in activity may also help.\n\n---\n\n**Distal Median Nerve Dysfunction**\n\nA form of peripheral neuropathy that affects the movement of or sensation in the hands.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Trapping (entrapment) by a ligament in the wrist, causing carpal tunnel syndrome\n*   Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) or joints (arthritis)\n*   Repetitive movements that increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment\n*   Women are more affected than men\n*   Problems that affect the tissue near the nerve or cause deposits to form in the tissue, such as:\n    *   Too much growth hormone in the body (acromegaly)\n    *   Diabetes\n    *   Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n    *   Kidney disease\n    *   A blood cancer called multiple myeloma\n    *   Pregnancy\n    *   Obesity\n    *   Amyloidosis\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt\n*   Weakness or numbness in the hand or wrist\n*   Pain or tingling in the hand or wrist\n\n---\n\n**Distal Median Nerve Dysfunction**\n\n**Causes**\n\nConditions that compress or damage the median nerve include:\n\n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome\n*   Diabetes\n*   Injuries to the wrist or hand\n*   Tumors or cysts on the nerve\n*   Infections such as Lyme disease\n*   Other medical conditions associated with mononeuropathy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Pain in the wrist or hand that may be severe and wake you up at night, and that may be felt in other areas, such as the upper arm (this is called referred pain)\n*   Sensation changes in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers, such as a burning feeling, decreased sensation, numbness and tingling\n*   Weakness of the hand that causes you to drop things or have difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will examine your wrist and ask about your medical history.

As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis).\n\n**Causes**\n\nWhen the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood becomes too acidic. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.\n\nThe kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine.\n\nDistal renal tubular acidosis (type I RTA) is caused by a defect in the kidney tubes that causes acid to build up in the blood.\n\nType I RTA is caused by a variety of conditions, including:\n\n* Amyloidosis, a buildup of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in the tissues and organs\n* Fabry disease, an abnormal buildup in the body of a certain type of fatty substance\n* High level of calcium in the blood\n* Sickle cell disease, red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shape\n* Sjögren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue\n* Wilson disease, an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues\n* Use of certain medicines, such as amphotericin B, lithium, and analgesics\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following:\n\n* Confusion or decreased alertness\n* Fatigue\n* Impaired growth in children\n* Increased breathing rate\n* Kidney stones\n* Nephrocalcinosis (too much calcium deposited in the kidneys)\n* Osteomalacia (softening of the bones)\n* Muscle weakness\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Bone pain\n* Decreased urine output\n* Increased heart rate or irregular heartbeat\n* Muscle cramps\n* Pain in the back, flank, or abdomen\n* Skeletal abnormalities\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Arterial blood gas\n* Blood chemistry\n* Urine pH and acid loading test\n* Bicarbonate infusion test\n* Urinalysis\n\nCalcium deposits in the kidneys and kidney stones may be seen on:\n\n* X-rays\n* Ultrasound\n* CT scan\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal is to restore normal acid level and electrolyte balance in the body.

    "content": "**Distal Splenorenal Shunt**\n\nA distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) is a type of surgery done to relieve high pressure in the portal vein. The portal vein carries blood from your digestive organs to your liver.\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring DSRS, the vein from your spleen is disconnected from the portal vein. The vein is then attached to the vein to your left kidney. This helps reduce blood flow through the portal vein.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe portal vein brings blood from the intestine, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder to the liver. When blood flow is blocked, the pressure in this vein becomes too high. This is called portal hypertension. It often occurs due to liver damage caused by:\n\n*   Cirrhosis due to alcohol use\n*   Chronic viral hepatitis\n*   Blood clots\n*   Certain congenital disorders\n*   Primary biliary cirrhosis (liver scarring caused by blocked bile ducts)\n\nWhen blood can't flow normally through the portal vein, it takes another path. As a result, swollen blood vessels called varices form. The most important location for these is in the esophagus. They develop thin walls that can break and bleed into the esophagus and stomach.\n\nYou may have this surgery if imaging tests such as upper GI endoscopy or x-rays show that you have bleeding varices in the esophagus or stomach. DSRS surgery reduces pressure in the varices and helps control bleeding.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines or breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of this surgery include:\n\n*   Buildup of fluid in the belly (ascites)\n*   Repeat bleeding from the varices\n*   Encephalopathy (loss of brain function because the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood)\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or a pancreatic pseudocyst (fluid collection that forms by the pancreas that can cause pain)\n*   Clotting of the shunt\n*   Portal vein thrombosis\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the surgery, you may have certain tests:\n\n*   Angiogram (to view inside the blood vessels)\n*   Blood tests\n*   Upper GI endoscopy\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n*   You are or could be pregnant\n*   You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nExpect to stay in the hospital after surgery to recover for 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhen you wake up after the surgery you will have at least one or more of the following:\n\n*   A tube in your vein (IV) that will carry fluid and medicine into your bloodstream\n*   A catheter in your bladder to drain urine\n*   An NG tube (nasogastric) that goes through your nose into your stomach to remove gas and fluids\n*   A pump with a button you can press when you need pain medicine (also called patient controlled analgesia)\n\nAs you are able to eat and drink, you will be given liquids and food.\n\nYou may have an imaging test to see if the shunt is working.\n\nYou may meet with a dietitian, and learn how to eat a low-fat, low-salt diet.\n\n---\n\n**Distal Splenorenal Shunt**\n\n\\n\\n**After the Procedure**\n\nExpect to stay in the hospital after surgery to recover for 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhen you wake up after the surgery, you will have at least one or more of the following:\n\n* A tube in your vein (IV) that will carry fluid and medicine into your bloodstream\n* A catheter in your bladder to drain urine\n* An NG tube (nasogastric) that goes through your nose into your stomach to remove gas and fluids\n* A pump with a button you can press when you need pain medicine (also called patient controlled analgesia)\n\nAs you are able to eat and drink, you will be given liquids and food.\n\nYou may have an imaging test to see if the shunt is working.\n\nYou may meet with a dietitian, and learn how to eat a low-fat, low-salt diet.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter DSRS surgery, bleeding in the varices is controlled in most people with portal hypertension. The highest risk of bleeding again is in the first month after surgery.\n\n\\n\\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDSRS; Distal splenorenal shunt procedure; Renal - splenic venous shunt; Warren shunt; Cirrhosis - distal splenorenal; Liver failure - distal splenorenal; Portal vein pressure - distal splenorenal shunt\n\n\\n\\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe portal vein brings blood from the intestine, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder to the liver.

As a result, swollen blood vessels called varices form. The most important location for these is in the esophagus. They develop thin walls that can break and bleed into the esophagus and stomach.\n\nYou may have this surgery if imaging tests such as upper GI endoscopy or x-rays show that you have bleeding varices in the esophagus or stomach. DSRS surgery reduces pressure in the varices and helps control bleeding.\n\n\\n\\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines or breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks of this surgery include:\n\n* Buildup of fluid in the belly (ascites)\n* Repeat bleeding from the varices\n* Encephalopathy (loss of brain function because the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood)\n* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or a pancreatic pseudocyst (fluid collection that forms by the pancreas that can cause pain)\n* Clotting of the shunt\n* Portal vein thrombosis\n\n\\n\\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the surgery, you may have certain tests:\n\n* Angiogram (to view inside the blood vessels)\n* Blood tests\n* Upper GI endoscopy\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n* Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n---\n\n**Distal Splenorenal Shunt**\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the surgery, you may have certain tests:\n\n* Angiogram (to view inside the blood vessels)\n* Blood tests\n* Upper GI endoscopy\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\n\n* You are or could be pregnant\n* You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nDuring the week before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery:\n\n* Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\n* Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nExpect to stay in the hospital after surgery to recover for 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhen you wake up after the surgery, you will have at least one or more of the following:\n\n* A tube in your vein (IV) that will carry fluid and medicine into your bloodstream\n* A catheter in your bladder to drain urine\n* An NG tube (nasogastric) that goes through your nose into your stomach to remove gas and fluids\n* A pump with a button you can press when you need pain medicine (also called patient controlled analgesia)\n\nAs you are able to eat and drink, you will be given liquids and food.\n\nYou may have an imaging test to see if the shunt is working.\n\nYou may meet with a dietitian, and learn how to eat a low-fat, low-salt diet.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter DSRS surgery, bleeding in the varices is controlled in most people with portal hypertension. The highest risk of bleeding again is in the first month after surgery.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* DSRS\n* Distal splenorenal shunt procedure\n* Renal - splenic venous shunt\n* Warren shunt\n* Cirrhosis - distal splenorenal\n* Liver failure - distal splenorenal\n* Portal vein pressure - distal splenorenal shunt",

    "content": "**Diverticulitis and Diverticulosis - Discharge**\n\nYou were in the hospital to treat diverticulitis, an infection and inflammation of an abnormal pouch (called a diverticulum) in your intestinal wall. This article tells you how to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\n*   You likely had a CT scan or other tests that helped your healthcare provider diagnose your symptoms and check your colon.\n*   You may have received fluids and medicines that fight infections through an intravenous (IV) tube in your vein.\n*   You were probably on a special diet to help your colon rest and heal.\n*   If your diverticulitis was very bad, or a repeat of a prior episode, you may need surgery.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\n*   Your pain and other symptoms should go away after a few days of treatment. If they do not get better, or if they get worse, you should contact the provider.\n*   Once these pouches have formed, you have them for life. If you make a few simple changes in your lifestyle, you may not have diverticulitis again.\n\n**Self-care**\n\n*   Your provider may have given you antibiotics to treat any infection. Take them as you were told to. Make sure you finish the whole prescription. Contact your provider if you have any side effects.\n*   Do not put off having a bowel movement. This can lead to a firmer stool, which will make you need to use more force to pass it.\n*   Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. Do not smoke. Exercise regularly. Avoid constipation.\n*   Fiber supplements such as psyllium may decrease your risk of diverticulitis.\n*   If you are taking NSAIDs (such as naproxen or ibuprofen) ask your provider if you can stop them. NSAIDs can increase the risk of diverticulitis.\n\n**Diet**\n\n*   When you first go home or after an attack, your provider may ask you to drink liquids only at first, then slowly increase your diet.\n*   In the beginning, you may need to avoid whole-grain foods, fruits, and vegetables. This will help your colon rest.\n*   After you are better, your provider will suggest that you add more fiber to your diet and avoid certain foods. Eating more fiber may help prevent future attacks.

This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel movements.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of diverticulitis is not known, but it is thought to be related to a low-fiber diet, which can lead to constipation and increased pressure on the colon. Other risk factors include:\n\n*   **Low fiber intake**: A diet that is low in fiber can contribute to constipation and increase the risk of developing diverticulitis.\n*   **Age**: Diverticulitis is more common in people over 40 years old.\n*   **Family history**: Having a family history of diverticulitis may increase your risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of diverticulitis can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: Pain in the lower abdomen that worsens with eating or bowel movements.\n*   **Fever**: A high temperature, usually above 101.5°F (38.6°C).\n*   **Changes in bowel movements**: Diarrhea or constipation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiverticulitis is typically diagnosed using a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A doctor will perform a physical exam to check for signs of inflammation, such as tenderness in the abdomen.\n*   **Imaging tests**: X-rays, CT scans, or MRI may be used to visualize the colon and confirm the presence of diverticula.\n*   **Blood tests**: Laboratory tests may be performed to check for signs of infection, such as elevated white blood cell count.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of diverticulitis depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may be treated with:\n\n*   **Antibiotics**: To help clear up any bacterial infections.\n*   **Dietary changes**: Increasing fiber intake and staying hydrated can help manage symptoms.\n*   **Rest**: Getting plenty of rest to allow the body to recover.\n\nMore severe cases may require hospitalization for further treatment, which may include:\n\n*   **Fluid replacement**: Receiving intravenous fluids to stay hydrated.\n*   **Pain management**: Using medication to manage abdominal pain.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected portion of the colon.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent diverticulitis, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reduce the risk. This includes:\n\n*   **Increasing fiber intake**: Eating foods high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n*   **Staying hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water to help prevent constipation.\n\nBy being aware of the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for diverticulitis, you can take steps to manage your risk and maintain good overall health.",

    "content": "**Diverticulosis | Diverticulitis**\n\n\\n\\n**What is diverticulosis?**\n\nDiverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that bulge outward through weak spots in your colon. They mostly form in the lower part of the colon. Diverticulosis is a condition in which you have these pouches. Most people who have diverticulosis do not have symptoms or problems. But sometimes the pouches can cause symptoms or become inflamed.\n\n\\n\\n**What is diverticulitis?**\n\nDiverticulitis is the name for the condition you have when one or more of the pouches get inflamed. Diverticulitis may come on suddenly. It can sometimes cause serious health problems.\n\n\\n\\n**What causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis?**\n\nResearchers aren't sure what causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis. They think certain factors may play a role in causing or increasing the risk for these conditions, including:\n\n*   Your genetics. Certain genes may make some people more likely to develop the conditions.\n*   Lifestyle factors such as:\n    *   Diets low in fiber and high in red meat\n    *   Lack of physical activity\n    *   Taking certain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids\n    *   Having obesity\n    *   Smoking\n\n\\n\\n**Who is more likely to develop diverticulosis and diverticulitis?**\n\nDiverticulosis is common, especially as people age. More than one-third of U.S. adults between the ages of 50 and 59 have diverticulosis. More than two-thirds who are over age 80 have it. Most of those people will not have symptoms or problems. But some of them will develop diverticulitis.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis?**\n\nDiverticulosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. But some people can have chronic symptoms such as:\n\n*   Bloating\n*   Constipation or diarrhea\n*   Cramping or pain in the lower abdomen (belly)\n\nDiverticulitis may cause acute symptoms such as:\n\n*   Abdominal pain, most often in the lower left side of your abdomen\n*   Constipation or diarrhea\n*   Fevers and chills\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n\nThe pain caused by diverticulitis is usually severe and comes on suddenly. Less often, the pain may be mild and worsen over several days.\n\n\\n\\n**What other problems can diverticulosis and diverticulitis cause?**\n\nSome people with diverticulosis and diverticulitis may develop serious health problems (complications). Diverticular bleeding happens when a small blood vessel within the wall of a pouch bursts. The bleeding may be severe and sometimes even life-threatening.\n\nPeople with diverticulitis can also develop serious problems such as:\n\n*   Abscess, a painful, swollen, pus-filled area caused by infection\n*   Fistula, an abnormal opening or passage between the colon and another part of the body, such as the bladder or vagina\n*   Intestinal obstruction, a partial or total blockage that keeps food, fluids, air, or stool from moving through your intestines\n*   Perforation, or a hole, in your colon\n*   Peritonitis, an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity\n\n\\n\\n**How are diverticulosis and diverticulitis diagnosed?**\n\nDiverticulosis may be found when your health care provider is doing tests for another reason. Diverticulitis is usually found when you are having an acute attack.\n\nTo make a diagnosis, your provider will review your medical history, do a physical exam, and order tests. The tests may include:\n\n*   Blood tests\n*   Stool tests\n*   Imaging tests such as CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI\n*   Colonoscopy\n\n\\n\\n**What are the treatments for diverticulosis and diverticulitis?**\n\nIf your diverticulosis is causing chronic symptoms, your provider may recommend:\n\n*   High-fiber foods or fiber supplements\n*   Antibiotics\n*   Medicines to reduce inflammation\n*   Probiotics\n\nIf you have diverticulitis without complications, your provider may recommend treatment at home. However, you probably need treatment in the hospital if you have severe diverticulitis, diverticulitis with complications, or a high risk for complications.\n\nTreatments for diverticulitis may include:\n\n*   Antibiotics, except for very mild cases.\n*   A clear liquid diet for a short time to rest the colon. Your provider may suggest slowly adding solid foods to your diet as your symptoms improve.\n*   Medicines for pain. This is usually acetaminophen instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs may increase the chance of diverticulitis complications.\n*   Antispasmodic medicines to relieve spasms.\n\nIf your diverticulitis doesn't improve with treatment or if it causes complications, you may need surgery to remove part of your colon.\n\n\\n\\n**Can diverticulitis be prevented?**\n\nYour provider may recommend lifestyle changes to prevent diverticulitis:\n\n*   Eating a diet high in fiber and low in red meat\n*   Being physically active on a regular basis\n*   Not smoking (and quitting smoking if you are a smoker)\n*   Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight\n\n---\n\n**Diverticular Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Start Here**\n\n*   **What is Diverticular Disease?**\n    *   A condition where small pouches (diverticula) form in the wall of the colon, leading to symptoms like bloating, constipation, and abdominal pain.\n*   **Who is at Risk?**\n    *   Common among people over 50, especially those with a family history or certain lifestyle factors like low-fiber diet, lack of physical activity, and smoking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Blood Tests**: To check for signs of inflammation or infection.\n*   **Stool Tests**: To detect bacteria or other abnormalities in the stool.\n*   **Imaging Tests**: Such as CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs to visualize the colon and diverticula.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: A procedure where a flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the colon to examine the interior.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\n*   **High-Fiber Foods or Supplements**: To reduce symptoms and prevent complications.\n*   **Antibiotics**: For infections or abscesses related to diverticulitis.\n*   **Medicines to Reduce Inflammation**: Such as corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*   **Probiotics**: To promote a healthy gut microbiome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Living With**\n\n*   **Dietary Changes**: Increasing fiber intake through foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help manage symptoms.\n*   **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve digestion and reduce the risk of complications.\n*   **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor for signs of diverticulitis or other complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Specifics**\n\n*   **Diverticular Bleeding**: A rare but potentially life-threatening complication where a blood vessel bursts in a diverticulum.\n*   **Abscess**: A collection of pus that forms as a result of an infection.\n*   **Fistula**: An abnormal connection between the colon and another organ, such as the bladder or vagina.\n*   **Intestinal Obstruction**: A blockage that prevents food, fluids, air, or stool from moving through the intestines.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Research**\n\n*   **Clinical Trials**: Ongoing studies investigating new treatments and therapies for diverticular disease.\n*   **Journal Articles**: Recent publications exploring the causes, symptoms, and complications of diverticulosis and diverticulitis.\n\n---\n\n**Diverticulosis | Diverticulitis**\n\n**What is diverticulosis?**\n\nDiverticulosis is a condition in which small pouches, or sacs, bulge outward through weak spots in your colon.

These sacs are called diverticula. Most often, these pouches form in the large intestine (colon). They may also occur in the jejunum in the small intestine, although this is less common.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nDiverticulosis is less common in people age 40 and younger. It's more common in older adults. About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80.\n\nNo one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form.\n\nFor many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall. However, whether a low-fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven.\n\nOther possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity.\n\nEating nuts, popcorn, or corn does not appear to lead to inflammation of these pouches (diverticulitis).\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with diverticulosis have no symptoms.\n\nWhen symptoms occur, they may include:\n\nPain and cramps in your stomach especially in the left lower abdomen\nConstipation (sometimes diarrhea)\nBloating or gas\nNot feeling hungry and not eating\n\nYou may notice small amounts of blood in your stools or on toilet paper. Rarely, more severe bleeding may occur.\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDiverticulosis is often found during an exam for another health problem. For example, it is often discovered during a colonoscopy.\n\nIf you do have symptoms, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\nBlood tests to see if you have an infection or have lost too much blood\nCT scan or ultrasound of the abdomen if you have bleeding, loose stools, or pain\n\nA colonoscopy is needed to make the diagnosis.\n\nA colonoscopy is an exam that views the inside of the colon and rectum. A small camera attached to a tube can reach the length of the colon.\n\nThis test should not be done when you are having symptoms of acute diverticulitis.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nBecause most people have no symptoms, most of the time, no treatment is needed.\n\nYour health care provider may recommend getting more fiber in your diet. A high-fiber diet has many health benefits. Most people don't get enough fiber. To help prevent constipation, you should:\n\nEat plenty of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Limit processed foods.\nDrink plenty of fluids.\nGet regular exercise.\nTalk with your provider about taking a fiber supplement.\n\nYou should avoid NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). These medicines can make bleeding and diverticulitis (inflammation) more likely.\n\nFor bleeding that does not stop or recurs:\n\nColonoscopy may be used to inject medicines or burn a certain area in the intestine to stop the bleeding.\nAngiography may be used to infuse medicines or block off a blood vessel.\n\nIf bleeding does not stop or recurs many times, removal of a section of the colon may be needed.\n\n---\n\n**Diverticulosis**\n\n**What is diverticulosis?**\n\nDiverticulosis is a condition where small pouches or sacs form in the lining of the colon and rectum. These pouches are called diverticula.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with diverticulosis do not have any symptoms. However, some people may experience:\n\n* Diverticulitis: inflammation or infection of the diverticula\n* Bleeding: bleeding from the anus or rectum\n* Abdominal pain: pain in the abdomen\n* Constipation: difficulty passing stools\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDiverticulosis is often found during an exam for another health problem. For example, it is often discovered during a colonoscopy.\n\nIf you do have symptoms, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\n* Blood tests to see if you have an infection or have lost too much blood\n* CT scan or ultrasound of the abdomen if you have bleeding, loose stools, or pain\n\nA colonoscopy is needed to make the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBecause most people have no symptoms, most of the time, no treatment is needed.\n\nYour health care provider may recommend getting more fiber in your diet.

Once these pouches have formed, you will have them for life.\n\nUp to 25% of people with the condition will develop diverticulitis. This occurs when small pieces of stool become trapped in the pouches, causing infection or swelling.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nMore serious problems that may develop include:\n\n* Abnormal connections that form between parts of the colon or between the colon and another part of the body (fistula)\n* Hole or tear in the colon (perforation)\n* Narrowed area in the colon (stricture)\n* Pockets filled with pus or infection (abscess)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if symptoms of diverticulitis occur.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDiverticula - diverticulosis; Diverticular disease - diverticulosis; G.I. bleed - diverticulosis; Gastrointestinal hemorrhage - diverticulosis; Gastrointestinal bleed - diverticulosis; Jejunal diverticulosis\n\n---\n\n**Diverticulosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is diverticulosis?**\n\nDiverticulosis is a condition where small pouches or sacs, called diverticula, form in the wall of the colon. These pouches can become inflamed and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and blood in the stool.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact causes of diverticulosis are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including:\n\n*   A low-fiber diet\n*   Physical inactivity\n*   Family history\n*   Age (it is more common in people over 40)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of diverticulosis can vary from person to person, but may include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain or cramping\n*   Changes in bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation\n*   Blood in the stool\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiverticulosis is typically diagnosed using a combination of the following tests:\n\n*   Colonoscopy: A flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted through the rectum to visualize the inside of the colon.\n*   X-ray: An imaging test that uses radiation to create images of the inside of the body.\n*   CT scan: A type of X-ray that uses computer technology to create detailed images of the inside of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for diverticulosis, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment may include:\n\n*   Dietary changes: Increasing fiber intake through a healthy diet or supplements.\n*   Medications: To manage pain, inflammation, or infection.\n*   Surgery: In severe cases where complications arise.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent diverticulosis, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing the condition. This includes:\n\n*   Eating a high-fiber diet\n*   Staying physically active\n*   Getting regular check-ups with your healthcare provider\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related topics**\n\n*   Diverticulitis: A complication of diverticulosis where the pouches become inflamed and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel movements.\n*   Colon cancer: A type of cancer that affects the colon and can be related to diverticulosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Images**\n\nColon diverticula - series",

    "content": "**Dizziness and Vertigo - Aftercare**\n\n**What is Dizziness?**\n\nDizziness is a word used by people to describe a variety of symptoms. You may feel lightheaded, woozy, unsteady, or like you might faint.\n\n**The Feeling of Spinning**\n\nThis is called vertigo. The feeling of spinning:\n\n* Often starts suddenly\n* Is usually started by moving the head\n* Lasts a few seconds to minutes\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nMost often, people say the spinning feeling can start when they roll over in bed or tilt their head up to look at something.\n\nAlong with dizziness and vertigo, you may also have:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Hearing loss\n* Ringing in your ears (tinnitus)\n* Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving\n* Loss of balance, difficulty standing up\n\n**Causes of Dizziness**\n\nMild dizziness usually gets better by itself, or is easily treated. However, it can be a symptom of other problems. There are many causes. Medicines may cause dizziness, or problems with your inner ear. Motion sickness can also make you dizzy.\n\nVertigo can be a symptom of many disorders, as well. Some may be chronic, long-term conditions. Some may come and go. Depending on the cause of your vertigo, you may have other symptoms, like benign positional vertigo or Meniere disease. It is important to have your health care provider decide if your vertigo is a sign of a serious problem.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nIf you have vertigo, you may be able to prevent your symptoms from getting worse by:\n\n* Avoiding sudden movements or position changes, especially of your head\n* Keeping still and resting when you have symptoms\n* Avoiding bright lights, TV, and reading when you have symptoms\n\nWhen you feel better, slowly increase your activity. If you lose your balance, you may need help walking to stay safe.\n\nA sudden, dizzy spell during certain activities can be dangerous. Wait one week after a severe spell of vertigo is gone before you climb, drive, or operate heavy machinery or consult your provider for advice. Chronic dizziness or vertigo can cause stress. Make healthy lifestyle choices to help you cope:\n\n* Get enough sleep.\n* Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. Do not overeat.\n* Exercise regularly, if possible.\n* Learn and practice ways to relax, such as guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, tai chi, or meditation.\n* Keep a diary to record when you have dizziness, and what you were doing when it started.

For example:\n\n* Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another.\n* Remove loose throw rugs.\n* Install night lights.\n* Put nonskid mats and grab bars near the bathtub and toilet.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines for nausea and vomiting. Dizziness and vertigo may improve with some medicines. Commonly used medicines include:\n\n* Dimenhydrinate\n* Meclizine\n* Sedatives such as diazepam (Valium)\n\nToo much water or fluid in your body may make the symptoms worse by increasing fluid pressure in your inner ear. Your provider may suggest a low salt diet or water pills (diuretics).\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number, or go to an emergency room if you are dizzy and have:\n\n* A head injury\n* Fever over 101°F (38.3°C)\n* Headache or a very stiff neck\n* Seizures\n* Trouble keeping fluids down; vomiting that does not stop\n* Chest pain\n* Irregular heart beat\n* Shortness of breath\n* Weakness\n* Cannot move an arm or leg\n* Change in vision or speech\n* Fainting and losing alertness\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* New symptoms, or symptoms that are getting worse\n* Dizziness after taking medicine\n* Hearing loss\n\n---\n\n**Dizziness and Vertigo - Aftercare**\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nMost often, people say the spinning feeling can start when they roll over in bed or tilt their head up to look at something.\n\nAlong with dizziness and vertigo, you may also have:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Hearing loss\n* Ringing in your ears (tinnitus)\n* Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving\n* Loss of balance, difficulty standing up\n\nMild dizziness usually gets better by itself, or is easily treated.

    "content": "**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nNo, only a small percentage of variants cause genetic disorders—most have no impact on health or development. For example, some variants alter a gene's DNA sequence but do not change the function of the protein made from the gene.\n\n**How does the body protect itself from disease?**\n\nOften, gene variants that could cause a genetic disorder are repaired by certain enzymes before the gene is expressed and an altered protein is produced. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair errors in DNA. Because DNA can be changed or damaged in many ways, DNA repair is an important process by which the body protects itself from disease.\n\n**What about beneficial gene variants?**\n\nA very small percentage of all variants actually have a positive effect. These variants lead to new versions of proteins that help an individual better adapt to changes in his or her environment. For example, a beneficial variant could result in a protein that protects an individual and future generations from a new strain of bacteria.\n\n**How do we determine if a gene variant is associated with a genetic disorder?**\n\nWhen determining if a gene variant is associated with a genetic disorder, the variant is evaluated using scientific research to date, such as information on how the variant affects the function or production of the protein that is made from the gene and previous variant classification data. The variant is then classified on a spectrum based on how likely the variant is to lead to the disorder.\n\n**How are gene variants classified?**\n\nGene variants, as they relate to genetic disorders, are classified into one of five groups:\n\n* **Pathogenic**: The variant is responsible for causing disease. There is ample scientific research to support an association between the disease and the gene variant.\n* **Likely pathogenic**: The variant is probably responsible for causing disease, but there is not enough scientific research to be certain.\n* **Variant of uncertain significance (VUS or VOUS)**: The variant cannot be confirmed to play a role in the development of disease. There may not be enough scientific research to confirm or refute a disease association or the research may be conflicting.\n* **Likely benign**: The variant is probably not responsible for causing disease, but there is not enough scientific research to be certain.\n* **Benign**: The variant is not responsible for causing disease. There is ample scientific research to disprove an association between the disease and the gene variant.\n\n**Why is evaluation of each variant important?**\n\nEvaluation needs to be done for each variant. Just because a gene is associated with a disease, does not mean that all variants in that gene are pathogenic. Additionally, evaluation of a variant needs to be done for all diseases with which it is thought to be associated. A variant that is pathogenic for one disease, is not necessarily pathogenic for a different disease. It is important to re-evaluate variants periodically; the classification of a variant can change over time as more information about the effects of variants becomes known through additional scientific research.\n\n**Scientific journal article for further reading**\n\nRichards S, Aziz N, Bale S, Bick D, Das S, Gastier-Foster J, Grody WW, Hegde M, Lyon E, Spector E, Voelkerding K, Rehm HL; ACMG Laboratory Quality Assurance Committee.

Epub 2015 Mar 5.\n\n---\n\n**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nNo, only a small percentage of variants cause genetic disorders—most have no impact on health or development. For example, some variants alter a gene's DNA sequence but do not change the function of the protein made from the gene.\n\n**How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nGene variants that could cause a genetic disorder are often repaired by certain enzymes before the gene is expressed and an altered protein is produced. Each cell has multiple pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair errors in DNA. Because DNA can be changed or damaged in many ways, DNA repair is an important process by which the body protects itself from disease.\n\n**What kinds of gene variants are possible?**\n\nA very small percentage of all variants actually have a positive effect. These variants lead to new versions of proteins that help an individual better adapt to changes in their environment. For example, a beneficial variant could result in a protein that protects an individual and future generations from a new strain of bacteria.\n\n**Can a change in the number of genes affect health and development?**\n\nBecause a person's genetic code can have many variants with no effect on health, diagnosing genetic disorders can be difficult. Just because a gene is associated with a disease, does not mean that all variants in that gene are pathogenic. Additionally, evaluation of a variant needs to be done for all diseases with which it is thought to be associated.\n\n**Gene variant classification**\n\nGene variants, as they relate to genetic disorders, are classified into one of five groups:\n\n* Pathogenic: the variant is likely to cause the disorder\n* Likely pathogenic: the variant may cause the disorder, but more research is needed\n* Uncertain significance: the variant's impact on health is unknown\n* Likely benign: the variant is unlikely to cause the disorder\n* Benign: the variant has no effect on health\n\n**Re-evaluation of variants**\n\nIt is essential to re-evaluate variants periodically; the classification of a variant can change over time as more information about the effects of variants becomes known through additional scientific research.\n\n---\n\n**Do all gene variants affect health and development?**\n\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed how gene variants can affect health and development. But do all gene variants have an impact on our well-being?\n\nThe answer is no, not all gene variants affect health and development. In fact, most gene variants don't have a significant effect on our lives. It's only when certain gene variants are present in specific combinations or quantities that they can lead to problems.\n\nSo, what kinds of gene variants are possible? Well, there are several types, including:\n\n*   **Point mutations**: changes in a single nucleotide base\n*   **Insertions**: extra nucleotides inserted into the DNA sequence\n*   **Deletions**: nucleotides removed from the DNA sequence\n*   **Duplications**: repeated sections of DNA\n*   **Translocations**: chromosomes break and reattach at different locations\n\nThese variations can occur in different parts of our genome, including:\n\n*   **Coding regions**: where genes are located\n*   **Noncoding regions**: areas between genes that don't contain instructions for making proteins\n*   **Mitochondrial DNA**: the genetic material found in the energy-producing structures within cells\n\nNow, let's talk about complex or multifactorial disorders. These conditions result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. For example, heart disease is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle choices.\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to a disease means that you're more likely to develop it due to your inherited traits. However, having the predisposition doesn't guarantee that you'll get the disease.\n\nGene variants can also be involved in evolution. As populations adapt to their environments, certain gene variants may become more common or disappear over time.\n\nStatistics can provide valuable information about a genetic condition. By analyzing data from large groups of people, researchers can identify patterns and trends that help us understand the condition better.\n\nFinally, let's discuss how genetic conditions and genes are named. The naming conventions for genes and conditions are standardized to ensure clarity and consistency across the scientific community.\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

It's essential to be aware of how much you're drinking and know how your alcohol use may affect your life and those around you.\n\n**One Drink Equals...**\n\nOne drink equals one 12-ounce (oz), or 360 milliliters (mL), can or bottle of beer, one 5-oz (150 mL) glass of wine, 1 wine cooler, 1 cocktail, or 1 1/2-oz (45 mL) shot of liquor.\n\n**Think About...**\n\n* How often you have an alcoholic drink\n* How many drinks you have when you do drink\n* How any drinking you are doing affects your life or the lives of others\n\n**Responsible Drinking**\n\nHere are some guidelines for drinking alcohol responsibly, as long as you don't have a drinking problem:\n\n* Healthy men of legal drinking age should limit themselves to:\n\t+ No more than 2 drinks in 1 day\n\t+ No more than 14 drinks in a week\n* Healthy women of legal drinking age should limit themselves to:\n\t+ No more than 1 drink in 1 day\n\t+ No more than 7 drinks in a week\n\n**When You Start to Drink Too Much**\n\nHealth care providers consider your drinking medically unsafe when you drink:\n\n* You are a man of legal drinking age who has 15 or more drinks a week, or often has 5 or more drinks at a time\n* You are a woman of legal drinking age who has 8 or more drinks a week, or often has 4 or more drinks at a time\n\n**Knowing When You Have a Drinking Problem**\n\nYou may have a drinking problem if you have at least two of the following characteristics:\n\n1. There are times when you drink more or longer than you planned to.\n2. You have not been able to cut down or stop drinking on your own, even though you've tried or want to.\n3. You spend a lot of time drinking, being sick from drinking, or getting over the effects of drinking.\n4. Your urge to drink is so strong, you cannot think about anything else.\n5. As a result of drinking, you do not do what you are expected to do at home, work, or school. Or, you keep getting sick because of drinking.\n6. You continue to drink, even though alcohol is causing problems with your family or friends.\n7. You spend less time on or no longer take part in activities that used to be important to you or that you enjoyed. Instead, you use that time to drink.\n8. Your drinking has led to situations that you or someone else could have been injured, such as driving while drunk or having unsafe sex.\n9. Your drinking makes you anxious, depressed, forgetful, or causes other health problems, but you keep drinking.\n10. You need to drink more than you did to get the same effect from alcohol. Or, the number of drinks you are used to having now have less effect than before.\n11. When the effects of alcohol wear off, you have symptoms of withdrawal. These include tremors, sweating, nausea, or insomnia. You may even have had a seizure or hallucinations (sensing things that are not there).\n\n**When to Call a Health Care Provider**\n\nIf you or others are concerned, make an appointment with your provider to talk about your drinking.

Docetaxel injection is in a class of medications called taxanes. It works by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease or have ever been treated with cisplatin (Platinol) or carboplatin (Paraplatin) for lung cancer. You may have a higher risk of developing certain serious side effects such as low levels of certain types of blood cells, severe mouth sores, severe skin reactions, and death.\n\nDocetaxel injection may cause low levels of white blood cells in the blood. Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly during your treatment to check whether the number of white blood cells in your body has decreased. Your doctor may also recommend that you check your temperature frequently during your treatment. Follow these instructions carefully. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, chills, sore throat, or other signs of infection.\n\nDocetaxel injection may cause severe allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to docetaxel injection or drugs made with polysorbate 80, an ingredient found in some medications. Ask your doctor if you are unsure if a medication you are allergic to contains polysorbate 80. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: rash, hives, itching, warm sensation, chest tightness, fainting, dizziness, nausea or difficulty breathing or swallowing.\n\nDocetaxel injection may cause serious or life-threatening fluid retention (condition where the body keeps excess fluid). Fluid retention does not usually start immediately, and most commonly occurs around the fifth dosing cycle. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; weight gain; shortness of breath; difficulty swallowing; hives; redness; rash; chest pain;cough; hiccups; rapid breathing; fainting; lightheadedness; swelling of the stomach area; pale, grayish skin; or pounding heartbeat.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to docetaxel injection.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of using docetaxel injection.\n\n---\n\n**Docetaxel Injection**\n\n**What is Docetaxel Injection?**\n\nDocetaxel injection is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, including breast, lung, stomach, and head and neck cancers.\n\n**How Should I Use This Medicine?**\n\nDocetaxel injection comes as a liquid to be given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. It is usually given over 1 hour once every 3 weeks. Your doctor will tell you how often you will receive docetaxel.\n\nYour doctor will probably prescribe a steroid medication such as dexamethasone for you to take during each dosing cycle to help prevent certain side effects. Be sure to follow the directions carefully and take this medication exactly as prescribed.\n\nBecause certain docetaxel injection preparations contain alcohol, you may experience certain symptoms during or for 1–2 hours after your infusion. If you experience any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away: confusion, stumbling, becoming very sleepy, or feeling like you are drunk.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nDocetaxel injection is also sometimes used to treat ovarian cancer (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed).

    "content": "**Doctor of Medicine Profession (MD)**\n\nThe practice of medicine in the United States dates back to the early 1600s. At the beginning of the 17th century, medical practice in England was divided into three groups: the physicians, the surgeons, and the apothecaries.\n\n*   **Physicians**: Seen as elite, they most often held a university degree.\n*   **Surgeons**: Typically hospital-trained and did apprenticeships. They often served the dual role of barber-surgeon.\n*   **Apothecaries**: Learned their roles (prescribing, making, and selling medicines) through apprenticeships, sometimes in hospitals.\n\nThis distinction between medicine, surgery, and pharmacy did not persist in colonial America. When university-prepared MDs from England arrived in America, they were expected to also perform surgery and prepare medicines.\n\n**Regulation of Medical Practice**\n\nThe New Jersey Medical Society, chartered in 1766, was the first organization of medical professionals in the English colonies in America. It was developed to \"form a program embracing all the matters of highest concern to the profession: regulation of practice; educational standards for apprentices; fee schedules; and a code of ethics.\" Later this organization became the Medical Society of New Jersey.\n\nProfessional societies began regulating medical practice by examining and licensing practitioners as early as 1760. By the early 1800s, the medical societies were in charge of establishing regulations, standards of practice, and certification of doctors.\n\n**Development of Proprietary Programs**\n\nA natural next step was for such societies to develop their own training programs for doctors. These society-affiliated programs were called \"proprietary\" medical colleges.\n\nThe first of these proprietary programs was the medical college of the Medical Society of the County of New York, founded March 12, 1807. Proprietary programs began to spring up everywhere. They attracted a large number of students because they eliminated two features of university-affiliated medical schools: a long general education and a long lecture term.\n\n**American Medical Association (AMA)**\n\nOn May 5, 1847, nearly 200 delegates representing 40 medical societies and 28 colleges from 22 states and the District of Columbia met. They resolved themselves into the first session of the American Medical Association (AMA). Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) was elected as the first president of the association.\n\nThe AMA set educational standards for MDs, including:\n\n*   A liberal education in the arts and sciences\n*   A certificate of completion in an apprenticeship before entering the medical college\n*   An MD degree that covered 3 years of study, including two 6-month lecture sessions, 3 months devoted to dissection, and a minimum of one 6-month session of hospital attendance\n\n**Advancements in Medical Education**\n\nBetween 1802 and 1876, 62 fairly stable medical schools were established. In 1810, there were 650 students enrolled and 100 graduates from medical schools in the United States.\n\nDaniel Hale Williams (1856-1931) was one of the first black MDs. After graduating from Northwestern University in 1883, Dr. Williams practiced surgery in Chicago and was later a main force in establishing Provident Hospital, which still serves Chicago's South Side.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell (1821-1920), after graduating from Geneva College of Medicine in upstate New York, became the first woman granted an MD degree in the United States.\n\n**Modern Developments**\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine opened in 1893. It is cited as being the first medical school in America of \"genuine university-type, with adequate endowment, well-equipped laboratories, modern teachers devoted to medical investigation and instruction, and its own hospital in which the training of physicians and healing of sick persons combined to the optimal advantage of both.\"\n\nThe Flexner Report, published in 1910, led to the closing of many substandard schools and the creation of standards of excellence for a real medical education.\n\nSir William Osler established the first residency training (after graduation from medical school) and was the first to bring students to the patient's bedside. Before that time, medical students only learned from textbooks until they went out to practice, so they had little practical experience.\n\nBy 1930, nearly all medical schools required a liberal arts degree for admission and provided a 3- to 4-year graded curriculum in medicine and surgery. Many states also required candidates to complete a 1-year internship in a hospital setting after receiving a degree from a recognized medical school in order to receive a license to practice medicine.\n\n**Specialization**\n\nAmerican doctors did not begin to specialize until the middle of the 20th century. People objecting to specialization said that \"specialties operated unfairly toward the general practitioner, implying that he is incompetent to properly treat certain classes of diseases.\" They also said specialization tended \"to degrade the general practitioner in the view of the public.\"\n\nHowever, as medical knowledge and techniques expanded many doctors chose to concentrate on certain specific areas and recognize that their skill set could be more helpful in some situations.\n\nEconomics also played an important role, because specialists typically earned higher incomes than the generalist physicians. The debates between specialists and generalists continue and have recently been fueled by issues related to modern health care reform.\n\n**Scope of Practice**\n\nThe practice of medicine includes the diagnosis, treatment, correction, advisement, or prescription for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain, or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary.\n\n---\n\n**Doctor of Medicine Profession (MD)**\n\n**Regulation of the Profession**\n\nMedicine was the first of the professions to require licensing. State laws on medical licensing outlined the \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" of human conditions in medicine. Any individual who wanted to diagnose or treat as part of the profession but who was not properly credentialed, could be charged with \"practicing medicine without a license.\"\n\nToday, medicine, like many other professions, is regulated at several different levels:\n\n*   Medical Schools must adhere to the standards of the American Association of Medical Colleges\n*   Licensure is a process that takes place at the state level in accordance with specific state laws\n*   Certification is established through national organizations with consistent national requirements for minimal professional practice standards\n\n**Licensure**\n\nAll states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1 to 3. Steps 1 and 2 are completed while in medical school and step 3 is completed after some medical training (usually between 12 to 18 months, depending on the state). People who earned their medical degrees in other countries also must satisfy these requirements before practicing medicine in the United States.\n\n**Certification**\n\nMDs who wish to specialize must complete an additional 3 to 9 years of postgraduate work in their specialty area, then pass board certification examinations. Family Medicine is the specialty with the broadest scope of training and practice. Doctors who claim to practice in a specialty should be board-certified in that specific area of practice. However, not all \"certifications\" come from recognized academic agencies. Most credible certifying agencies are part of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Many hospitals will not permit physicians or surgeons to practice on their staffs if they are not board-certified in an appropriate specialty.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPhysician\n\n**References**\n\nFederation of State Medical Boards website.

Proprietary programs began to spring up everywhere. They attracted a large number of students because they eliminated two features of university-affiliated medical schools: a long general education and a long lecture term.\n\nTo address the many abuses in medical education, a national convention was held in May 1846. Proposals from that convention included the following:\n\n*   A standard code of ethics for the profession\n*   The adoption of uniform higher educational standards for MDs, including courses of premedical education\n*   The creation of a national medical association\n\nOn May 5, 1847, nearly 200 delegates representing 40 medical societies and 28 colleges from 22 states and the District of Columbia met. They resolved themselves into the first session of the American Medical Association (AMA). Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) was elected as the first president of the association. The AMA has become an organization that has a great deal of influence over issues related to health care in the United States.\n\nThe AMA set educational standards for MDs, including the following:\n\n*   A liberal education in the arts and sciences\n*   A certificate of completion in an apprenticeship before entering the medical college\n*   An MD degree that covered 3 years of study, including two 6-month lecture sessions, 3 months devoted to dissection, and a minimum of one 6-month session of hospital attendance\n\nIn 1852, the standards were revised to add more requirements:\n\n*   Medical schools had to provide a 16-week course of instruction that included anatomy, medicine, surgery, midwifery, and chemistry\n*   Graduates had to be at least 21 years of age\n*   Students had to complete a minimum of 3 years of study, 2 years of which were under an acceptable practitioner\n\nBetween 1802 and 1876, 62 fairly stable medical schools were established. In 1810, there were 650 students enrolled and 100 graduates from medical schools in the United States. By 1900, these numbers had risen to 25,000 students and 5,200 graduates. Nearly all of these graduates were white males.\n\nDaniel Hale Williams (1856-1931) was one of the first black MDs. After graduating from Northwestern University in 1883, Dr. Williams practiced surgery in Chicago and was later a main force in establishing Provident Hospital, which still serves Chicago's South Side. Previously black physicians found it impossible to obtain privileges to practice medicine in hospitals.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell (1821-1920), after graduating from Geneva College of Medicine in upstate New York, became the first woman granted an MD degree in the United States.\n\n---\n\n**Doctor of Medicine Profession (MD)**\n\n**History of Medical Practice**\n\nThe practice of medicine in the United States dates back to the early 1600s.

It is cited as being the first medical school in America of \"genuine university-type, with adequate endowment, well-equipped laboratories, modern teachers devoted to medical investigation and instruction, and its own hospital in which the training of physicians and healing of sick persons combined to the optimal advantage of both.\" It is considered the first, and the model for all later research universities. Johns Hopkins Medical School served as a model for the reorganization of medical education.\n\nMedical schools had become mostly diploma mills, with the exception of a few schools in large cities. Two developments changed that. The first was the \"Flexner Report,\" published in 1910. Abraham Flexner was a leading educator who was asked to study American medical schools. His highly negative report and recommendations for improvement led to the closing of many substandard schools and the creation of standards of excellence for a real medical education.\n\nThe other development came from Sir William Osler, a Canadian who was one of the greatest professors of medicine in modern history. He worked at McGill University in Canada, and then at the University of Pennsylvania, before being recruited to be the first physician-in-chief and one of the founders of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. There he established the first residency training (after graduation from medical school) and was the first to bring students to the patient's bedside. Before that time, medical students only learned from textbooks until they went out to practice, so they had little practical experience.\n\nBy 1930, nearly all medical schools required a liberal arts degree for admission and provided a 3- to 4-year graded curriculum in medicine and surgery.

To become a licensed doctor of medicine (MD), one must adhere to the standards set by the American Association of Medical Colleges, obtain licensure through the state's specific laws, and meet national certification requirements.\n\n**Licensure**\n\nTo practice medicine in the United States, an individual must be a graduate of an approved medical school and complete the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1 to 3. These steps are completed while in medical school (Steps 1 and 2) and after some medical training (usually between 12 to 18 months, depending on the state). Individuals who earned their medical degrees in other countries must also satisfy these requirements before practicing medicine in the United States.\n\nWith the introduction of telemedicine, there has been concern regarding how to handle state licensure issues when the practice of medicine is shared between states through telecommunications. Laws and guidelines are being developed, with some states establishing procedures for recognizing the licenses of physicians practicing in other states in times of emergency.\n\n**Certification**\n\nMDs who wish to specialize must complete an additional 3 to 9 years of postgraduate work in their specialty area and pass board certification examinations.

At the beginning of the 17th century, medical practice in England was divided into three groups: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. Physicians were seen as elite, holding a university degree. Surgeons were typically hospital-trained and served as barber-surgeons. Apothecaries learned their roles through apprenticeships.\n\nThis distinction between medicine, surgery, and pharmacy did not persist in colonial America. When university-prepared MDs from England arrived in America, they were expected to also perform surgery and prepare medicines.\n\n**Early Medical Societies**\n\nThe New Jersey Medical Society, chartered in 1766, was the first organization of medical professionals in the English colonies in America.

Nathaniel Chapman was elected as the first president of the association.\n\nThe AMA set educational standards for MDs, including a liberal education in the arts and sciences, a certificate of completion in an apprenticeship before entering the medical college, and an MD degree that covered 3 years of study. In 1852, the standards were revised to add more requirements, such as a 16-week course of instruction and graduation at the age of 21.\n\n**The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine**\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine opened in 1893.

Many proprietary medical colleges sprouted up, attracting students with their shorter programs and lower admission requirements.\n\nTo address these issues, a national convention was held in 1846, proposing reforms such as standardized curricula and more rigorous admissions standards. The American Medical Association (AMA) was founded in 1847, with Nathaniel Chapman as its first president. The AMA set educational standards for MDs, including requirements such as:\n\n*   A minimum of 3 years of study\n*   A comprehensive curriculum that included both theoretical and practical training\n*   A rigorous admissions process\n\nThese standards were revised in 1852 to add more requirements, including a minimum of 4 years of study. The AMA's efforts led to the establishment of 62 fairly stable medical schools between 1802 and 1876.\n\n**The Rise of Medical Specialization**\n\nAmerican doctors did not begin to specialize until the middle of the 20th century.

State laws on medical licensing outlined the \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" of human conditions in medicine. Any individual who wanted to diagnose or treat as part of the profession but who was not properly credentialed, could be charged with \"practicing medicine without a license.\"\n\nToday, medicine, like many other professions, is regulated at several different levels:\n\n*   Medical Schools must adhere to the standards of the American Association of Medical Colleges\n*   Licensure is a process that takes place at the state level in accordance with specific state laws\n*   Certification is established through national organizations with consistent national requirements for minimal professional practice standards\n\nLicensure: All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1 to 3.

Family Medicine is the specialty with the broadest scope of training and practice. Doctors who claim to practice in a specialty should be board-certified in that specific area of practice. However, not all \"certifications\" come from recognized academic agencies. Most credible certifying agencies are part of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Many hospitals will not permit physicians or surgeons to practice on their staffs if they are not board-certified in an appropriate specialty.\n\n**The Practice of Medicine in Colonial America**\n\nThe practice of medicine in colonial America was influenced by the English system, which divided medical practitioners into three groups: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. Physicians were seen as elite, holding university degrees. Surgeons were typically hospital-trained and did apprenticeships. They often served the dual role of barber-surgeon. Apothecaries also learned their roles (prescribing, making, and selling medicines) through apprenticeships, sometimes in hospitals.\n\nThis distinction between medicine, surgery, and pharmacy did not persist in colonial America. When university-prepared MDs from England arrived in America, they were expected to also perform surgery and prepare medicines.\n\n**The New Jersey Medical Society**\n\nThe New Jersey Medical Society, chartered in 1766, was the first organization of medical professionals in the English colonies in America. It was developed to \"form a program embracing all the matters of highest concern to the profession: regulation of practice; educational standards for apprentices; fee schedules; and a code of ethics.\" Later this organization became the Medical Society of New Jersey.\n\nProfessional societies began regulating medical practice by examining and licensing practitioners as early as 1760. By the early 1800s, the medical societies were in charge of establishing regulations, standards of practice, and certification of doctors.\n\n**The Rise of Proprietary Medical Colleges**\n\nA natural next step was for such societies to develop their own training programs for doctors. These society-affiliated programs were called \"proprietary\" medical colleges.\n\nThe first of these proprietary programs was the medical college of the Medical Society of the County of New York, founded March 12, 1807. Proprietary programs began to spring up everywhere. They attracted a large number of students because they eliminated two features of university-affiliated medical schools: a long general education and a long lecture term.\n\n**The American Medical Association**\n\nTo address the many abuses in medical education, a national convention was held in May 1846. Proposals from that convention included the following:\n\n*   A standardized curriculum for all medical schools\n*   More rigorous admissions standards\n*   Improved training and certification programs for doctors\n\nOn May 5, 1847, nearly 200 delegates representing 40 medical societies and 28 colleges from 22 states and the District of Columbia met. They resolved themselves into the first session of the American Medical Association (AMA). Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) was elected as the first president of the association. The AMA has become an organization that has a great deal of influence over issues related to health care in the United States.\n\nThe AMA set educational standards for MDs, including requirements such as:\n\n*   A minimum of 3 years of study\n*   A comprehensive curriculum that included both theoretical and practical training\n*   A rigorous admissions process\n\nThese standards were revised in 1852 to add more requirements, including a minimum of 4 years of study. The AMA's efforts led to the establishment of 62 fairly stable medical schools between 1802 and 1876.\n\n**The Rise of Medical Specialization**\n\nAmerican doctors did not begin to specialize until the middle of the 20th century.

The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, established in 1893, set a new standard for medical education. It was the first \"genuine university-type\" medical school, with well-equipped laboratories and modern teachers devoted to medical investigation and instruction.\n\n**Reform and Standardization**\n\nThe Flexner Report, published in 1910, was a highly negative report on American medical schools. It led to the closing of many substandard schools and the creation of standards for excellence in medical education. Sir William Osler, a Canadian physician, also played a significant role in reforming medical education. He established the first residency training program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and emphasized patient-oriented care.\n\n**Specialization**\n\nAmerican doctors did not begin to specialize until the middle of the 20th century.

However, osteopathic physicians receive an additional 300 to 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, called osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT).\n\nOsteopathic physicians hold to the principle that a person's history of illness and physical trauma are written into the body's structure. The osteopathic physician's highly developed sense of touch allows the physician to feel (palpate) the person's living anatomy (the flow of fluids, motion and texture of tissues, and structural makeup).\n\nLike MDs, osteopathic physicians are licensed at the state level. Osteopathic physicians who wish to specialize may become board certified (in the same manner as MDs) by completing a 2- to 6-year residency within the specialty area, often side-by-side with MDs, and passing the same board certification exams as MDs.\n\nDOs practice in all specialties of medicine, ranging from emergency medicine and cardiovascular surgery to psychiatry and geriatrics.

    "content": "**Dolutegravir and Lamivudine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine is used alone to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in certain people who have never been treated with any HIV medications before or in certain people who have responded well to their HIV medication regimens and have no history of poor response to their past HIV regimens. Lamivudine is in a class of medications called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and dolutegravir is in a class of medications called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). They work together to decrease the amount of HIV in your blood. Although dolutegravir and lamivudine will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take dolutegravir and lamivudine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dolutegravir and lamivudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you have or think you may have hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with dolutegravir and lamivudine. If you have HBV and you take dolutegravir and lamivudine, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking dolutegravir and lamivudine. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking dolutegravir and lamivudine to see if your HBV has worsened.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of dolutegravir and lamivudine, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then to take the medication - do not take extra medicine to make up for the missed dose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDolutegravir and lamivudine may cause serious side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Dizziness\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep dolutegravir and lamivudine in its original container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not store it in the bathroom. Keep dolutegravir and lamivudine out of reach of children. Dispose of any unused medicine after talking to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much dolutegravir and lamivudine, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 (US only).

    "content": "**Domestic Violence**\n\nDomestic violence is when a person uses abusive behavior to control a partner or other family member. The abuse can be physical, emotional, economic, or sexual. It can affect people of any age, sex, culture, or class. When domestic violence is aimed at a child, it is called child abuse. Domestic violence is a crime.\n\n**Types of Domestic Violence**\n\nDomestic violence can include:\n\n*   **Physical Abuse**: hitting, kicking, biting, slapping, choking, or attacking with a weapon\n*   **Sexual Abuse**: forcing someone to have any type of sexual activity he or she does not want\n*   **Emotional Abuse**: name-calling, humiliation, threats to the person or his or her family, or not letting the person see family or friends\n*   **Economic Abuse**: controlling access to money or bank accounts\n\n**Signs of Domestic Violence**\n\nMost people do not start out in abusive relationships. The abuse often starts slowly and gets worse over time, as the relationship deepens.\n\nSome signs that your partner may be abusive include:\n\n*   Wanting most of your time\n*   Hurting you and saying it is your fault\n*   Trying to control what you do or whom you see\n*   Keeping you from seeing family or friends\n*   Being overly jealous of time you spend with others\n*   Pressuring you to do things you do not want to do, such as having sex or doing illicit drugs\n*   Keeping you from going to work or school\n*   Putting you down\n*   Intimidating you or threatening your family or pets\n*   Accusing you of having affairs\n*   Controlling your finances\n*   Threatening to hurt himself or herself if you leave\n\n**How to Get Help**\n\nLeaving an abusive relationship is not easy. You may be afraid your partner will harm you if you leave, or that you will not have the financial or emotional support you need.\n\nDomestic violence is not your fault. You cannot stop your partner's abuse. But you can find ways to get help for yourself.\n\n*   **Tell Someone**: The first step in getting out of an abusive relationship is often telling someone else about it. You can talk to a friend, family member, your health care provider, or a clergy member.\n*   **Have a Safety Plan**: This is a plan in case you need to leave a violent (or potentially violent) situation right away. Decide where you will go and what you will bring. Gather important items you will need, like credit cards, cash, or papers, in case you need to leave quickly. You can also pack a suitcase and keep it with a family member or friend.\n*   **Call for Help**: You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline toll-free at 800-799-7233, 24 hours a day. The staff at the hotline can help you find resources for domestic violence in your area, including legal help.\n*   **Get Medical Care**: If you are hurt, get medical care from your provider or at the emergency room.\n*   **Call the Police**: Do not hesitate to call the police if you are in danger. Domestic violence is a crime.\n\n**How to Help a Loved One**\n\nIf a friend or family member is being abused, there are many ways you can help.\n\n*   **Offer Support**: Your loved one may feel scared, alone, or ashamed. Let him or her know you are there to help however you can.\n*   **Do Not Judge**: Leaving an abusive relationship is difficult. Your loved one may stay in the relationship despite the abuse. Or, your loved one may leave and return many times. Try to support these choices, even if you do not agree with them.\n*   **Help with a Safety Plan**: Suggest that your loved one make a safety plan in case of danger. Offer your home as a safe zone if he or she needs to leave, or help find another safe place.\n*   **Find Help**: Help your loved one connect with a national hotline or a domestic violence agency in your area.\n\n---\n\n**Domestic Violence**\n\nDomestic violence is when a person uses abusive behavior to control a partner or other family member.

It is usually given over 30 minutes every 4 weeks.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of donanemab-azbt for 3 doses and then increase your dose.\n\n\\n\\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nDonanemab-azbt injection may cause a severe reaction during or shortly after the infusion of the medication. A doctor or nurse will monitor you carefully while you are receiving the medication. You may be given other medications to help prevent and treat reactions. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: fever, chills, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness or lightheadedness, feeling of racing heart rate or chest pounding, or difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nYour doctor may need to interrupt your treatment or stop your treatment depending on your response to the medication and any side effects that you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose, contact your doctor as soon as possible to schedule an appointment for the missed dose.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDonanemab-azbt may cause a potentially serious reaction called amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which most commonly includes temporary swelling in areas of the brain; small spots of bleeding on the surface of the brain and, infrequently, larger areas of bleeding in the brain may also occur. Swelling in areas of the brain usually does not cause symptoms and usually resolves over time. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, nausea, difficulty walking or loss of balance, or seizures.\n\nThe chance that you will develop ARIA during your treatment with donanemab-azbt may be higher if you have a genetic (inherited) risk factor. Your doctor may order a blood test to help decide if this medication is right for you. Tell your doctor if you are taking medications that may cause bleeding.\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body) scans before and during treatment to check your body's response to donanemab-azbt.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with donanemab-azbt and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nDonanemab-azbt injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies.

    "content": "**The Donath-Landsteiner Test**\n\nThe Donath-Landsteiner test is a blood test used to detect harmful antibodies related to a rare disorder called paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. These antibodies form and destroy red blood cells when the body is exposed to cold temperatures.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed for this test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed before taking the Donath-Landsteiner test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain, while others may only experience a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but this usually goes away soon.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done to confirm a diagnosis of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe test is considered normal if no Donath-Landsteiner antibodies are present. This is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, so it's best to talk to your healthcare provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results mean that Donath-Landsteiner antibodies are present, which is a sign of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other, so taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

    "content": "**Donepezil: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDonepezil is used to treat dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and may cause changes in mood and personality) in people who have Alzheimer's disease (AD; a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and the ability to think, learn, communicate and handle daily activities). Donepezil is in a class of medications called cholinesterase inhibitors. It improves mental function (such as memory, attention, the ability to interact with others, speak, think clearly, and perform regular daily activities) by increasing the amount of a certain naturally occurring substance in the brain. Donepezil may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities in people who have AD. However, donepezil will not cure AD or prevent the loss of mental abilities at some time in the future.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDonepezil comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food, in the evening just before bedtime. Take donepezil at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take donepezil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDonepezil helps control the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but does not cure it. Continue to take donepezil even if you feel well. Do not stop taking donepezil without talking to your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of donepezil and increase your dose after 4 to 6 weeks. Your doctor may increase your dose again 3 or more months later.\n\nSwallow the 23-mg tablet whole; do not split, crush or chew it.

    "content": "**Dong Quai**\n\n**What is it?**\nDong quai (Angelica sinensis) is a plant that has been used for a variety of conditions, with little evidence. It may be unsafe when too much is consumed.\n\nDong quai is a member of the same plant family as parsley, celery, and carrots. It's popular in Chinese medicine for female health concerns. The root might affect estrogen and other hormones.\n\nPeople commonly use dong quai for menopausal symptoms, menstrual cramps, migraine, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using dong quai for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Dong quai is possibly safe when taken for up to 6 months. It's been safely used in combination with other ingredients in doses up to 150 mg daily. It might make the skin extra sensitive to sunlight. Common side effects include burping, gas, and high blood pressure.\n\nTaking dong quai in higher doses for more than 6 months is possibly unsafe. Dong quai contains chemicals that might cause cancer.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if dong quai is safe or what the side effects might be.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: Taking dong quai by mouth during pregnancy is possibly unsafe for the baby. Dong quai seems to affect the uterus. Some research suggests that taking dong quai with other herbs during the first 3 months of pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects. Do not use dong quai if you are pregnant.\n* Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if dong quai is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Bleeding disorders: Dong quai might slow blood clotting and increase the chance of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.\n* Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Dong quai might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use dong quai.\n* Surgery: Dong quai might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking dong quai at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\nMajor:\n\n* Do not take this combination:\n\t+ Warfarin (Coumadin): Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. Dong quai might also slow blood clotting. Taking dong quai along with warfarin might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin might need to be changed.\n\nModerate:\n\n* Be cautious with this combination:\n\t+ Estrogens: Dong quai might act like the hormone estrogen. When taken together, dong quai might increase the risk of estrogen side effects.\n\t+ Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs): Dong quai might slow blood clotting. Taking dong quai along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\nHerbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting:\n\n* Dong quai might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\nDong quai is most often used in combination products. There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of dong quai might be.\n\n---\n\n**Dong Quai**\n\nKeep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nDong quai is most often used in combination products.

The disease is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas such as southeast India, Guyana, and New Guinea. There are about 100 cases reported per year in the United States. Most of these cases occur in people who have traveled to or are from places where the disease is common.\n\nThe disease spreads mostly through vaginal or anal intercourse. Very rarely, it spreads during oral sex.\n\nMost infections occur in people ages 20 to 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can occur 1 to 12 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria.\n\n* Sores in the anal area (in about half of cases)\n* Small, beefy-red bumps on the genitals or around the anus\n* The skin gradually wears away, and the bumps turn into raised, beefy-red, velvety nodules called granulation tissue. They are often painless, but they bleed easily if injured.\n* The disease slowly spreads and destroys genital tissue. Tissue damage may spread to the groin. The genitals and the skin around them lose skin color.\n\nIn its early stages, it may be hard to tell the difference between donovanosis and chancroid.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Culture of tissue sample (hard to do and not routinely available)\n* Scrapings or biopsy of lesion\n\nLaboratory tests for diagnosing donovanosis are available only on a research basis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat donovanosis. These may include:\n\n* Azithromycin\n* Doxycycline\n* Ciprofloxacin\n* Erythromycin\n* Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\n\nTo cure the condition, long-term treatment is needed. Most treatment courses require 3 weeks or until the sores have completely healed.\n\nA follow-up exam is needed because the disease can reappear after it seems to be cured.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEarly treatment helps prevent tissue damage or scarring. Untreated, the disease leads to damage of the genital tissue.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHealth problems that may result from this disease include:\n\n* Genital damage and scarring\n* Loss of skin color in the genital area\n* Permanent genital swelling due to scarring\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider for an appointment if:\n\n* You have had sexual contact with a person who is known to have donovanosis\n* You develop symptoms of donovanosis\n* You develop an ulcer in the genital area\n\n---\n\n**Donovanosis (Granuloma Inguinale)**\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe only absolute way to prevent an STD such as donovanosis is by avoiding all sexual activity. However, safer sex behaviors may reduce your risk.\n\n*   The proper use of condoms, either the male or female type, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STD.\n*   You need to wear the condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Granuloma inguinale\n*   Sexually transmitted disease - donovanosis\n*   STD - donovanosis\n*   Sexually transmitted infection - donovanosis\n*   STI - donovanosis\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Skin layers\n\n**References**\n\n*   Belda W.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/doppler-ultrasound/",
    "content": "**Doppler Ultrasound**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound is a type of ultrasound imaging test that uses sound waves to show how well your blood flows through your blood vessels. It can be used to examine blood flow in many parts of your body, including many of your organs and your neck, arms, and legs.\n\n*   **What does it do?** A Doppler ultrasound can examine your arteries (blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart and lungs to your body) and veins (blood vessels that carry blood from your body back to your heart and lungs to get more oxygen).\n*   **How does it work?** Doppler ultrasound works by bouncing sound waves off red blood cells flowing through your blood vessels. The ultrasound device measures the echoes that bounce back from the cells.\n\n**Types of Doppler Ultrasound Tests**\n\nThere are different types of Doppler ultrasound tests that can be used to gather different information:\n\n*   **Color Doppler**: This test uses a computer to change sound wave measurements into different colors. The colors show the speed and direction of blood flow.\n*   **Power Doppler**: This is a newer type of color Doppler. It can show much smaller blood vessels and slower blood flow than standard color Doppler. But it can't show the direction of blood flow.\n*   **Spectral Doppler**: This test shows blood flow information in a graph. It can show how much of a blood vessel is blocked.\n*   **Duplex Doppler**: This test uses standard ultrasound to take images showing blood flow. Then a computer turns the images into a graph, as in spectral Doppler.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nDoppler ultrasound tests are used to help diagnose problems that affect the flow of blood in many parts of the body, including:\n\n*   **Your heart**: A Doppler ultrasound is part of an echocardiogram, which is a test that shows the size and shape of your heart and how well it's pumping blood.\n*   **Your arms and legs**: The test can check for conditions that reduce blood flow including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots, usually in your legs; peripheral arterial disease (PAD), narrow or blocked arteries in your legs or arms; varicose veins, weak valves in your veins that let blood flow backwards, usually in your legs.\n*   **Your neck and brain**: The test can look for conditions that affect blood flow to your brain and cause stroke. These include narrowed arteries and blood clots in your neck (carotid artery disease) and narrowed arteries in your brain.\n*   **Your abdomen (belly)**: The test can be used to check blood flow in your organs and to look for aneurysms.\n\n**Why do I need a Doppler ultrasound?**\n\nYou may need a Doppler ultrasound if you have symptoms of abnormal blood flow. Your symptoms will depend on the part of your body that's affected and the cause of abnormal blood flow.\n\n*   **High risk of having a stroke**: An ultrasound of your brain, called a transcranial Doppler ultrasound, can diagnose the cause of a stroke and/or help estimate your risk for having a stroke in the future.\n*   **Had an injury to your blood vessels**: You may need a Doppler ultrasound if you've had an injury to your blood vessels.\n*   **High blood pressure**: You may need a Doppler ultrasound if you have high blood pressure that could be caused by blocked arteries in your kidneys.\n*   **Pregnant**: You may need this test if your unborn baby may be smaller than normal for your stage of pregnancy. You may also need this test if you have certain health problems such as high blood pressure in pregnancy (preeclampsia) or sickle cell disease.\n\n**What happens during a Doppler ultrasound?**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound is often done by a sonographer, a health care professional who has special training to do ultrasound exams. The test may be done in different ways depending on the part of your body that's being examined. Most Doppler ultrasound exams include these general steps:\n\n*   **You will remove clothing from the area that will be examined and lie on a table**.\n*   **The sonographer will spread a special gel on your skin over the area that will be examined**.\n*   **The sonographer will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, across your skin**. The device sends sound waves into your body, but you can't feel them.\n*   **You may hear whooshing sounds as the ultrasound device picks up the echoes and turns them into images or graphs on a computer screen**.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nPreparations for a Doppler ultrasound depend on what part of your body is being checked. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to prepare and what to do. You may need to:\n\n*   **Fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test**.\n*   **Stop smoking or using products that have nicotine for two hours or more before your test**.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nDoppler ultrasound has not been linked to any health harms. It's generally considered safe when trained sonographers use it correctly. Doppler ultrasound doesn't use ionizing radiation like x-rays use, which makes it safer than x-ray. That's why ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging method for viewing an unborn baby during pregnancy.\n\nBut in certain cases, ultrasound can affect fluids and tissues in the body. That's why most medical experts recommend using ultrasound only when it's needed to provide important medical information.\n\n---\n\n**Doppler Ultrasound**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound is a type of ultrasound imaging test that uses sound waves to show how well your blood flows through your blood vessels. It can be used to examine blood flow in many parts of your body, including many of your organs and your neck, arms, and legs.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nDoppler ultrasound works by bouncing sound waves off red blood cells flowing through your blood vessels. The ultrasound device measures the echoes that bounce back from the cells. Cells that are moving away from the sound waves make different echoes than cells that are moving closer to the sound waves. This is called the Doppler effect, named after the scientist who discovered it.\n\n**Types of Doppler Ultrasound Tests**\n\nThere are different types of Doppler ultrasound tests that can be used to gather different information. They include:\n\n* **Color Doppler**: This test uses a computer to change sound wave measurements into different colors. The colors show the speed and direction of blood flow.\n* **Power Doppler**: This is a newer type of color Doppler. It can show much smaller blood vessels and slower blood flow than standard color Doppler. But it can't show the direction of blood flow.\n* **Spectral Doppler**: This test shows blood flow information in a graph. It can show how much of a blood vessel is blocked. There are two types of spectral Doppler ultrasound:\n\t+ \"Pulsed wave\" Doppler: This type can show where blood is flowing at different speeds, but it can't record blood flowing at high speeds.\n\t+ \"Continuous wave\" Doppler: This type can record very fast blood flow, but it can't show the exact location in the blood vessel.\n* **Duplex Doppler**: This test uses standard ultrasound to take images showing blood flow. Then a computer turns the images into a graph, as in spectral Doppler.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nDoppler ultrasound tests are used to help diagnose problems that affect the flow of blood in many parts of your body, including:\n\n* Your heart: A Doppler ultrasound is part of an echocardiogram, which is a test that shows the size and shape of your heart and how well it's pumping blood.\n* Your arms and legs: The test can check for conditions that reduce blood flow, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and varicose veins.\n* Your neck and brain: The test can look for conditions that affect blood flow to your brain and cause stroke.\n* Your abdomen (belly): The test can be used to check blood flow in your organs and to look for aneurysms.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Doppler Ultrasound?**\n\nYou may need a Doppler ultrasound if you have symptoms of abnormal blood flow, such as:\n\n* High risk of having a stroke or having had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (a stroke that lasts a few minutes).\n* Had an injury to your blood vessels.\n* Have high blood pressure that could be caused by blocked arteries in your kidneys.\n* Are being treated for a condition that affects blood flow.\n* Are pregnant and have certain health problems, such as high blood pressure in pregnancy (preeclampsia) or sickle cell disease.\n\n**What Happens During a Doppler Ultrasound?**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound is often done by a sonographer, a health care professional who has special training to do ultrasound exams.

The device sends sound waves into your body, but you can't feel them.\n* The sound waves bounce off red blood cells in your bloodstream.\n* You may hear whooshing sounds as the ultrasound device picks up the echoes and turns them into images or graphs on a computer screen.\n* After the exam is over, the sonographer will wipe the gel off your body.\n\n---\n\n**Doppler Ultrasound**\n\n**What is a Doppler Ultrasound?**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound is a type of medical test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. It's called \"Doppler\" because it measures the speed at which objects move towards or away from the ultrasound device.\n\n**How Does a Doppler Ultrasound Work?**\n\nDuring a Doppler ultrasound, a trained sonographer will apply a special gel to your skin and then place an ultrasound device on your body. The device sends sound waves into your body, which bounce back and create images of your internal organs or blood vessels.\n\n**Will I Need to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nPreparations for a Doppler ultrasound depend on what part of your body is being checked. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to prepare and what to do. You may need to:\n\n* Fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\n* Stop smoking or using products that have nicotine for two hours or more before your test.\n\n**Is a Doppler Ultrasound Safe?**\n\nDoppler ultrasound has not been linked to any health harms. It's generally considered safe when trained sonographers use it correctly. However, in certain cases, ultrasound can affect fluids and tissues in the body.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf your Doppler ultrasound results are normal, it means that the blood vessels that were checked looked healthy. They have no narrowing or blood clots. The blood flow was normal.\n\nIf your results aren't normal, the meaning will depend on what area of your body was tested and the type of Doppler ultrasound that you had. Talk with your provider about what your results say about your health and need for treatment.\n\n**References**\n\n* Cheung ME, Singh V, Firstenberg MS. Duplex Ultrasound.

    "content": "**Doppler Ultrasound Exam of an Arm or Leg**\n\nThis test uses ultrasound to look at the blood flow in the large arteries and veins in the arms or legs.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done in the ultrasound or radiology department, a hospital room, or in a peripheral vascular lab.\n\nDuring the exam:\n\n* A water-soluble gel is placed on a handheld device called a transducer. This device directs high-frequency sound waves to the artery or veins being tested.\n* Blood pressure cuffs may be put around different parts of the body, including the thigh, calf, ankle, and different points along the arm.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou will need to remove clothes from the arm or leg being examined.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSometimes, the person performing the test will need to press on the vein to make sure it does not have a clot. Some people may feel slight pain from the pressure.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is done as the first step to look at arteries and veins. Sometimes, arteriography and venography may be needed later. The test is done to help diagnose:\n\n* Arteriosclerosis of the arms or legs\n* Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis)\n* Venous insufficiency\n\nThe test may also be used to:\n\n* Look at injury to the arteries\n* Monitor arterial reconstruction and bypass grafts\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means the blood vessels show no signs of narrowing, clots, or closure, and the arteries have normal blood flow.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Blockage in an artery by a blood clot\n* Blood clot in a vein (DVT)\n* Narrowing or widening of an artery\n* Spastic arterial disease (arterial contractions brought on by cold or emotion)\n* Venous occlusion (closing of a vein)\n* Venous reflux (blood flow going the wrong direction in veins)\n* Arterial occlusion from atherosclerosis\n\nThis test may also be done to help assess the following conditions:\n\n* Atherosclerosis of the extremities\n* Deep venous thrombosis\n* Superficial thrombophlebitis\n\n---\n\n**Doppler Ultrasound Exam of an Arm or Leg**\n\n**What is the Doppler ultrasound exam?**\n\nThe Doppler ultrasound exam is a test used to evaluate the blood flow in your arm or leg. It's a non-invasive procedure that uses sound waves to create images of your blood vessels.\n\n**How do I prepare for the test?**\n\nYou'll need to remove any clothing from the arm or leg being examined. You may also be asked to remove any jewelry or accessories that could interfere with the test.\n\n**What happens during the exam?**\n\nA water-soluble gel will be applied to your skin, and a handheld device called a transducer will be placed on top of it. The transducer directs high-frequency sound waves into your blood vessels, which bounce back and create images on a screen. Blood pressure cuffs may also be placed around different parts of your body, such as your thigh, calf, ankle, or arm.\n\n**How long does the test take?**\n\nThe test typically takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.\n\n**What are the risks associated with the test?**\n\nThere are no risks associated with this procedure. However, it's worth noting that cigarette smoking may alter the results of the test, as nicotine can cause your arteries to constrict.\n\n**What is the purpose of the Doppler ultrasound exam?**\n\nThe primary purpose of this test is to diagnose conditions such as:\n\n* Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)\n* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis)\n* Venous insufficiency\n* Injury to your arteries\n* Monitoring arterial reconstruction and bypass grafts\n\n**What are the normal results for the Doppler ultrasound exam?**\n\nA normal result means that your blood vessels show no signs of narrowing, clots, or closure, and your arteries have normal blood flow.\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\n\nAbnormal results may indicate:\n\n* Blockage in an artery by a blood clot\n* Blood clot in a vein (DVT)\n* Narrowing or widening of an artery\n* Spastic arterial disease (arterial contractions brought on by cold or emotion)\n* Venous occlusion (closing of a vein)\n* Venous reflux (blood flow going the wrong direction in veins)\n* Arterial occlusion from atherosclerosis\n\nThis test may also be used to help assess conditions such as:\n\n* Atherosclerosis of the extremities\n* Deep venous thrombosis\n* Superficial thrombophlebitis\n\n---\n\n**Doppler Ultrasound Exam of an Arm or Leg**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Doppler ultrasound exam?**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound exam uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. It's used to check for problems with blood flow in your arms and legs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nDuring the exam, a technician will place a special device called a transducer on your skin. The transducer sends out sound waves that bounce off the blood vessels in your arm or leg. The echoes are then picked up by the transducer and used to create images of the inside of your body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What can it detect?**\n\nA Doppler ultrasound exam can detect problems with blood flow, such as:\n\n*   **Atherosclerosis**: a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can cause them to narrow or harden\n*   **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)**: a condition where the arteries in your legs become narrowed or blocked, reducing blood flow\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Atherosclerosis\n*   Peripheral Arterial Disease",

It is a congenital problem, which means that it is present at birth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDouble aortic arch is a common form of a group of defects that affect the development of the aorta in the womb. These defects cause an abnormal formation called a vascular ring (a circle of blood vessels).\n\nNormally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). As babies develop in the womb, the arches split into several parts. The body breaks down some of the arches, while others form into arteries. A normally developed aorta is a single arch that leaves the heart and moves leftward.\n\nIn double aortic arch, some of the arches that should have disappeared are still present at birth in addition to the normal arch. Babies with a double aortic arch have an aorta that is made up of two vessels instead of one. The two parts to the aorta have smaller arteries branching off of them.

The surgeon ties off the smaller branch and separates it from the larger branch. Then the surgeon closes the ends of the aorta with stitches. This relieves pressure on the esophagus and windpipe.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children feel better right after surgery, although some may continue to have breathing symptoms for some time after surgical repair.

The right ventricle is the pumping chamber that sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs._\n\n**How it Affects the Heart**\n\n_In the normal heart, the right and left ventricles receive blood from the right and left atria. The atria are upper chambers of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flows to the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps blood to the pulmonary artery. This is the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen._\n\n_Blood with fresh oxygen returns to the left atrium and left ventricle. The aorta then carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body from the left ventricle. The aorta is the major artery leading out of the heart._\n\n_In people with DILV, only the left ventricle is developed. Both atria empty blood into this ventricle. This means that oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. The mixture is then pumped to both the body and the lungs._\n\n---\n\n**Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Double Inlet Left Ventricle?**\n\nDouble inlet left ventricle (DILV) is a rare heart defect where the left ventricle is developed, but the right ventricle is small. Both atria empty blood into the left ventricle, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\nThe exact cause of DILV is unknown, but it is believed to occur early in pregnancy when the baby's heart develops. People with DILV often have other heart problems, such as:\n\n* Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta)\n* Pulmonary atresia (pulmonary valve of the heart is not formed properly)\n* Pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\nSymptoms of DILV may include:\n\n* Bluish color to the skin and lips (cyanosis) due to low oxygen in the blood\n* Failure to gain weight and grow\n* Pale skin (pallor)\n* Poor feeding from becoming tired easily\n* Sweating\n* Swollen legs or abdomen\n* Trouble breathing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\nSigns of DILV may include:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythm, as seen on an electrocardiogram\n* Buildup of fluid around the lungs\n* Heart failure\n* Heart murmur\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nTests to diagnose DILV may include:\n\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity in the heart\n* Echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound exam of the heart\n* Cardiac catheterization, which involves passing a thin, flexible tube into the heart to examine the arteries\n* Heart MRI\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment for Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\nSurgery is needed to improve blood circulation through the body and into the lungs. The most common surgeries to treat DILV are a series of 2 to 3 operations. These surgeries are similar to the ones used to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome and tricuspid atresia.\n\nThe first surgery may be needed when your baby is only a few days old. In most cases, the baby can go home from the hospital afterward. Your child will most often need to take medicines every day and be closely followed by a pediatric heart specialist (cardiologist). Your child's cardiologist will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done.\n\nThe next surgery (or first surgery, if your baby didn't need a procedure as a newborn) is called the bidirectional Glenn shunt or Hemifontan procedure. This surgery is usually done when your child is 4 to 6 months old.\n\nEven after the above operations, your child may still look blue (cyanotic). The final step is called the Fontan procedure. This surgery is most often done when your child is 18 months to 3 years old. After this final step, your baby is no longer blue.\n\nThe Fontan operation does not create normal circulation in the body. But, it does improve blood flow enough for the child to live and grow.\n\nYour child may need more surgeries for other defects or to extend survival while waiting for the Fontan procedure.\n\nYour child may need to take medicines before and after surgery. These may include:\n\n---\n\n**Double Inlet Left Ventricle**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is needed to improve blood circulation through the body and into the lungs.

It is often associated with other congenital anomalies such as pulmonary atresia or truncus arteriosus.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants born with double inlet left ventricle may exhibit symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and poor appetite due to the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. In severe cases, it can lead to cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin) and failure to thrive.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDouble inlet left ventricle is typically diagnosed prenatally using ultrasound or after birth through physical examination and diagnostic tests such as echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for double inlet left ventricle depends on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, treatment may involve monitoring and supportive care. In more severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair or replace the heart valves, correct any associated anomalies, and improve blood flow.\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for infants born with double inlet left ventricle varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management and care, many children can lead normal lives with minimal symptoms. However, some may require ongoing medical attention to manage their condition.\n\n\\n\\n**Related Topics**\n\n* Congenital Heart Defects\n* Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease: Lesions Associated with Increased Pulmonary Blood Flow",

The symptoms and severity of the problem depend on the type of DORV.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSigns of DORV may include:\n\n* Enlarged heart\n* Heart murmur\n* Rapid breathing\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nSymptoms of DORV may include:\n\n* Poor feeding due to becoming tired easily\n* Bluish color of the skin and lips (cyanosis)\n* Clubbing (thickening of the nail beds) of toes and fingers (late sign)\n* Failure to gain weight and grow\n* Pale coloring (pallor)\n* Sweating\n* Swollen legs or abdomen\n* Trouble breathing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests to diagnose DORV include:\n\n* Chest x-rays\n* Echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound exam of the heart\n* Cardiac catheterization, which is passing a thin, flexible tube into the heart to measure blood pressure and inject dye for special pictures of the heart and arteries\n* Heart MRI\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment requires surgery to close the hole in the heart and direct blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. Surgery may also be needed to move the pulmonary artery or aorta.\n\nFactors that determine the type and number of operations your baby needs include:\n\n* The type of DORV\n* The severity of the defect\n* The presence of other problems in the heart\n* Your child's overall condition\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the baby does depends on:\n\n* The size and location of the VSD\n* The size of the pumping chambers\n* The location of the aorta and pulmonary artery\n* The presence of other complications (such as coarctation of the aorta and mitral valve problems)\n* Your baby's overall health at the time of diagnosis\n* Whether lung damage has occurred from too much blood flowing to the lungs for a long period of time\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications from DORV may include:\n\n* Heart failure\n* High blood pressure in the lungs, which untreated can lead to permanent lung damage\n* Death\n\nChildren with this heart condition may need to take antibiotics before surgeries or dental treatments. This prevents infections in the heart.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if your child seems to tire easily, has trouble breathing, or has bluish skin or lips. You should also consult your provider if your baby is not growing or gaining weight.\n\n---\n\n**Double Outlet Right Ventricle**\n\nA congenital heart defect where the two main arteries that carry blood out of the heart are connected to the right ventricle instead of the left and right ventricles.\n\n**What is Double Outlet Right Ventricle?**\n\nDouble outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a rare congenital heart defect where the two main arteries that carry blood out of the heart, the aorta and pulmonary artery, are connected to the right ventricle instead of the left and right ventricles. This means that both the aorta and pulmonary artery receive blood from the right ventricle.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of DORV is not known, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations during fetal development. It can occur in isolation or as part of a larger syndrome.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nInfants with DORV may experience symptoms such as:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Poor appetite\n* Failure to gain weight\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDORV is typically diagnosed through echocardiography, an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for DORV depends on the severity of the defect and may involve:\n\n* Surgery to repair or replace the defective valve\n* Medications to manage symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for infants with DORV varies depending on the severity of the defect. With prompt treatment, most infants can lead normal lives.\n\n**References**\n\nBichell D. Double-outlet right ventricle. In: Ungerleider RM, Meliones JN, McMillian KN, Cooper DS, Jacobs JP, eds.
