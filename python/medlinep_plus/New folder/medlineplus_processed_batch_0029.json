    "content": "**Brimonidine Ophthalmic**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOphthalmic brimonidine is used to lower pressure in the eyes in patients who have glaucoma (high pressure in the eyes that may damage nerves and cause vision loss) and ocular hypertension (pressure in the eyes that is higher than normal but not high enough to cause vision loss). Brimonidine is in a class of drugs called alpha adrenergic agonists. Brimonidine works by decreasing the amount of fluid in the eyes.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nOphthalmic brimonidine comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually instilled in the affected eye(s) 3 times a day. Use brimonidine eye drops at around the same times every day, and try to space your 3 daily doses about 8 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use brimonidine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nBrimonidine eye drops may control your condition, but will not cure it. Continue to use brimonidine eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using brimonidine eye drops without talking to your doctor.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n*   Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n*   Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n*   If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n*   Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of brimonidine eye drops, use it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then to use the medication and skip the missed dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up for a missed dose.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBrimonidine eye drops may cause some people to become dizzy or drowsy. Make sure you know how you react to brimonidine by having someone else count how many drops you put in your eye, or by counting the number of times you press the dropper against your eye.\n\nOther side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts. However, if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome, check with your doctor:\n\n*   dryness in the mouth\n*   redness, swelling, or pain at the place where the eye drop is applied\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep brimonidine eye drops away from children. Store brimonidine eye drops in an upright position with the cap tightly closed.\n\nDo not share your medicine with others, and do not keep unused eye drops beyond the period specified on the label or for a longer time than directed by your doctor.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you have taken too much brimonidine eye drops, check the Medication Guide that came with your medication for instructions on how to recognize and treat an overdose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for a copy when you pick up your prescription.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nIf you are using any of the following medicines, you may need to adjust your dose or watch for side effects: beta blockers (e.g., propranolol), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide), epinephrine-like medicines (e.g., epinephrine), and other eye medicines.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist may already be aware of any possible drug interactions and may be monitoring you for them. Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicine without your doctor's approval.\n\nSome products that may interact with brimonidine include:\n\n*   beta blockers (e.g., propranolol)\n*   carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide)\n*   epinephrine-like medicines (e.g., epinephrine)\n*   other eye medicines\n\n**Brand names**\n\nAlphagan P, Alphagan P Ophthalmic Solution\n\n---\n\n**Brimonidine Ophthalmic: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using brimonidine eye drops, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to brimonidine eye drops or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using brimonidine eye drops. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nIf you are using any other topical eye medications, instill them 5 minutes before or 5 minutes after you instill brimonidine eye drops. Tell your doctor if you often feel dizzy when you sit or stand from a lying position and if you have or have ever had depression; conditions that affect your blood circulation including Raynaud's disease (a condition that causes attacks of low blood circulation to the fingers and toes), thromboangiitis obliterans (a condition that causes poor blood circulation in the hands and feet), and problems with blood flow to your heart or brain; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are using brimonidine eye drops, call your doctor. Do not breast-feed while you are using brimonidine eye drops. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using brimonidine eye drops.\n\nYou should know that brimonidine eye drops may make you drowsy. Your vision may be blurry for a few minutes after you instill the eye drops. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are using brimonidine eye drops. Alcohol can make the drowsiness caused by brimonidine eye drops worse.\n\nTell your doctor if you wear soft contact lenses. Remove your soft contact lenses before instilling brimonidine eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes after using the medication to replace your lenses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nInstill the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not instill a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nBrimonidine eye drops may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* Itchy, irritated, red, stinging, or burning eyes\n* Dry eyes\n* Watery or runny eyes\n* Red or swollen eyelids\n* Sensitivity to light\n* Blurred vision\n* Headache\n* Drowsiness\n* Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* Dry mouth\n* Runny nose and other cold symptoms\n* Cough\n* Sore throat\n* Flu-like symptoms\n* Pain or pressure in the face\n* Heartburn\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* Rash\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Seeing specks or flashes of light\n* Blind spots\n* Fainting\n* Dizziness\n* Nausea\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\n---\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

    "content": "**Brivaracetam**\n\n*   **Pronounced as:** (briv'' a ra' se tam)\n*   **Why is this medication prescribed?**\n    *   Brivaracetam is used alone and in combination with other medications to control partial onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain) in adults, children, and infants 1 month of age and older.\n    *   It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\n*   Brivaracetam comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice daily.\n*   Take brivaracetam at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.**\n\n*   If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.\n\n**Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on how well the medication works for you, and the side effects you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with brivaracetam.**\n\n*   Brivaracetam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Brivaracetam may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take brivaracetam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking brivaracetam without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking brivaracetam, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.**\n\n*   Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with brivaracetam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n---\n\n**Brivaracetam: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking brivaracetam, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to brivaracetam, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in brivaracetam tablets or liquid. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, Teril), levetiracetam (Elepsia, Keppra, Spritam), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you currently drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, used street drugs, or over-used prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression, mood problems, suicidal thoughts or behavior, kidney disease that was treated with dialysis (treatment to clean the blood outside the body when the kidneys are not working well), or liver disease.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking brivaracetam, call your doctor.\n\nYou should know that brivaracetam may make you dizzy or drowsy, and may cause blurred vision or problems with coordination and balance. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or participate in activities requiring alertness or coordination until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nAsk your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking brivaracetam. Brivaracetam can make the side effects from alcohol worse.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking brivaracetam. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants like brivaracetam to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication.\n\nThere is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as brivaracetam, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication.\n\nYou, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nCleaned output ends here.\n\n---\n\n**Brivaracetam: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n**How to Follow Your Dosage Schedule**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n**What If I Forget a Dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule.

It is not known whether brodalumab injection causes suicidal thoughts and behavior. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you have a history of depression or suicidal thoughts.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n*   new or worsening depression or anxiety\n*   thoughts of suicide, dying, or hurting yourself, or planning or trying to do so\n*   changes in your behavior or mood\n*   acting on dangerous impulses\n\nYour healthcare provider will give you a Patient Wallet Card with a list of symptoms. If any of these symptoms occur, you should get medical help right away. Carry the card with you at all times during your treatment with brodalumab injection, and show it to all of your healthcare providers.\n\nBecause of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with this medication, brodalumab injection is only available through a special program called Siliq REMS®. You, your doctor, and your pharmacist must be enrolled in this program before you can receive brodalumab injection.\n\nAll people who are prescribed brodalumab injection must have a prescription from a doctor who is registered with Siliq REMS® and have the prescription filled at a pharmacy that is registered with Siliq REMS® in order to receive this medication.

It works by blocking the action of a certain natural substance in the body that causes the symptoms of psoriasis.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   **Administration:** Brodalumab injection comes as a liquid in a prefilled syringe to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a week for the first 3 doses and then once every 2 weeks.\n*   **Dosage:** Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use brodalumab injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   **Self-Administration:** You can inject brodalumab injection yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Before you use brodalumab injection for the first time, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it.\n*   **Disposal:** Use each prefilled syringe only once and inject all the solution in the syringe. Dispose of used syringes and pens in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.\n\n**Important Precautions:**\n\n*   Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method.\n*   Do not put the prefilled syringe back in the refrigerator after it has reached room temperature.\n*   Do not shake the medication.\n*   Always look at brodalumab solution before you inject it. The medication should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use the syringe if the medicine is cloudy, discolored, or contains flakes or particles.\n\n**Injection Sites:**\n\nYou can inject brodalumab injection anywhere on your thighs (upper leg), upper outer arms, or stomach except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, affected by psoriasis, or where you have scars or stretch marks.\n\n**Monitoring Progress:**\n\nYour healthcare provider may tell you to stop using brodalumab injection if your psoriasis does not improve within 12 to 16 weeks of treatment. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Brodalumab Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using Brodalumab Injection**\n\nUse a different site for each injection.

    "content": "**Broken Bone**\n\nIf more pressure is put on a bone than it can stand, it will split or break. A break of any size is called a fracture. If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open fracture (compound fracture).\n\nA stress fracture is a break in the bone that develops because of repeated or prolonged forces against the bone. The repeated stress weakens the bone until it finally breaks.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe following are common causes of broken bones:\n\n* Fall from a height\n* Trauma\n* Motor vehicle accidents\n* Direct blow\n* Child abuse\n* Repetitive forces, such as those caused by running, can cause stress fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, or hip\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of a broken bone include:\n\n* A visibly out-of-place or misshapen limb or joint\n* Swelling, bruising, or bleeding\n* Intense pain\n* Numbness and tingling\n* Broken skin with bone protruding\n* Limited mobility or inability to move a limb or put weight on the leg\n\n**First Aid**\n\nFirst aid steps include:\n\n* Check the person's airway and breathing. If necessary, call 911 or the local emergency number and begin rescue breathing, CPR, or bleeding control.\n* Keep the person still and calm.\n* Examine the person closely for other injuries.\n* In most cases, if medical help responds quickly, allow the medical personnel to take further action.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n* The person is not responding or is losing consciousness.\n* There is a suspected broken bone in the head, neck, or back.\n* There is a suspected broken bone in the hip, pelvis, or upper leg.\n* You cannot completely immobilize the injury at the scene by yourself.\n* There is severe bleeding.\n* An area below the injured joint is pale, cold, clammy, or blue.\n* There is a bone projecting through the skin.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTake the following steps to reduce your risk of a broken bone:\n\n* Wear protective gear while skiing, biking, roller blading, and participating in contact sports. This includes using a helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, wrist guards, and shin pads.\n* Create a safe home for young children. Place a gate at stairways and keep windows closed.\n* Teach children how to be safe and look out for themselves.\n* Supervise children carefully. There is no substitute for supervision, no matter how safe the environment or situation appears to be.\n* Prevent falls by not standing on chairs, counter tops, or other unstable objects. Remove throw rugs and electrical cords from floor surfaces. Use handrails on staircases and non-skid mats in bathtubs. These steps are especially important for older people.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\nFractures\nImages\nX-ray\nFracture types (1)\nFracture, forearm - x-ray\nOsteoclast\nBone fracture repair - series\nFracture types (2)\nExternal fixation device\nFractures across a growth plate\nInternal fixation devices\n\n---\n\n**Broken Bone: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Fall from a height\n*   Trauma\n*   Motor vehicle accidents\n*   Direct blow\n*   Child abuse\n*   Repetitive forces, such as those caused by running, can cause stress fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, or hip\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   A visibly out-of-place or misshapen limb or joint\n*   Swelling, bruising, or bleeding\n*   Intense pain\n*   Numbness and tingling\n*   Broken skin with bone protruding\n*   Limited mobility or inability to move a limb or put weight on the leg\n\n**First Aid**\n\n1.

Examine the person closely for other injuries.\n4.  In most cases, if medical help responds quickly, allow the medical personnel to take further action.\n5.  If the skin is broken, it should be treated right away to prevent infection. Call emergency help right away. DO NOT breathe on the wound or probe it. Try to cover the wound to avoid further contamination. Cover with sterile dressings if they are available. Don't try to line up the fracture unless you are medically trained to do so.\n6.  If needed, immobilize the broken bone with a splint or sling. Possible splints include a rolled up newspaper or strips of wood. Immobilize the area both above and below the injured bone.\n7.  Apply ice packs to reduce pain and swelling. Elevating the limb can also help to reduce swelling.\n8.  Take steps to prevent shock. Lay the person flat, elevate the feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters) above the head, and cover the person with a coat or blanket. However, DO NOT move the person if a head, neck, or back injury is suspected.\n\n**Check Blood Circulation**\n\n*   Check the person's blood circulation. Press firmly over the skin beyond the fracture site. (For example, if the fracture is in the leg, press on the foot). It should first blanch white and then \"pink up\" in about 2 seconds.\n*   Signs that circulation is inadequate include pale or blue skin, numbness or tingling, and loss of pulse.\n\n**Treat Bleeding**\n\n*   Place a dry, clean cloth over the wound to dress it.\n*   If the bleeding continues, apply direct pressure to the site of bleeding. DO NOT apply a tourniquet to the extremity to stop the bleeding unless it is life threatening. Tissue can only survive for a limited amount of time once a tourniquet is applied.\n\n**Do Not**\n\n*   Do not move the person unless the broken bone is stable.\n*   Do not move a person with an injured hip, pelvis, or upper leg unless it is absolutely necessary. If you must move the person, pull the person to safety by their clothes (such as by the shoulders of a shirt, a belt, or pant legs).\n*   Do not move a person who has a possible spine injury.\n*   Do not attempt to straighten a bone or change its position unless blood circulation appears hampered and no medically trained personnel are nearby.\n*   Do not try to reposition a suspected spine injury.\n*   Do not test a bone's ability to move.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   The person is not responding or is losing consciousness.\n*   There is a suspected broken bone in the head, neck, or back.\n*   There is a suspected broken bone in the hip, pelvis, or upper leg.\n*   You cannot completely immobilize the injury at the scene by yourself.\n*   There is severe bleeding.\n*   An area below the injured joint is pale, cold, clammy, or blue.\n*   There is a bone projecting through the skin.\n\nEven though other broken bones may not be medical emergencies, they still deserve medical attention. Contact your health care provider to find out where and when to be seen.\n\nIf a young child refuses to put weight on an arm or leg after an accident, won't move the arm or leg, or you can clearly see a deformity, assume the child has a broken bone and get medical help.\n\n---\n\n**Broken Bone: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Symptoms of a Broken Bone**\n\n* Numbness and tingling\n* Broken skin with bone protruding\n* Limited mobility or inability to move a limb or put weight on the leg\n\n**First Aid Steps**\n\n1. Check the person's airway and breathing. If necessary, call 911 or the local emergency number and begin rescue breathing, CPR, or bleeding control.\n2. Keep the person still and calm.\n3.

    "content": "**Broken Collarbone - Aftercare**\n\nYou have been diagnosed with a broken collarbone. Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for your broken bone. Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n**Where is the Collarbone?**\n\nThe collarbone is a long, thin bone between your breastbone (sternum) and your shoulder. It is also called the clavicle. You have two collarbones, one on each side of your breastbone. They help to keep your shoulders in line.\n\n**A Broken or Fractured Collarbone Often Occurs From:**\n\n* Falling and landing on your shoulder\n* Stopping a fall with your outstretched arm\n* Car, motorcycle, or bicycle accident\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nA broken collarbone is a common injury in young children and teenagers. This is because these bones do not become hard until adulthood and these individuals are more active.\n\n**Symptoms of a Mild Broken Collarbone Include:**\n\n* Pain where the broken bone is\n* Having a hard time moving your shoulder or arm, and pain when you do move them\n* A shoulder that seems to be sagging\n* A cracking or grinding noise when you raise your arm\n* Bruising, swelling, or bulging over your collarbone\n\n**Signs of a More Serious Break Are:**\n\n* Decreased feeling or a tingling feeling in your arm or fingers\n* Bone that is pushing against or through the skin\n* Difficulty breathing\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nThe type of break you have will determine your treatment. If the bones are:\n\n* Aligned (meaning that the broken ends meet), the treatment is to wear a sling and relieve your symptoms. Casts are not used for broken collarbones.\n* Not aligned or displaced (meaning the broken ends do not meet), you may need surgery.\n* Shortened quite a bit or out of position and not aligned, you will likely need surgery.\n\nIf you have a broken collarbone, you should follow up with a bone specialist (orthopedic surgeon).\n\n**Healing of Your Collarbone Depends On:**\n\n* Where the break in the bone is (in middle or at the end of the bone).\n* If the bones are aligned.\n* Your age. Children may heal in 3 to 6 weeks. Adults may need up to 12 weeks.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nApplying an ice pack can help relieve your pain. Make an ice pack by putting ice in a zip lock plastic bag and wrapping a cloth around it. Do not put the bag of ice directly on your skin. This could injure your skin.\n\nOn the first day of your injury, apply the ice for 20 minutes of every hour while awake. After the first day, ice the area every 3 to 4 hours for 20 minutes each time. Do this for 2 days or longer.\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n\n**Activity**\n\nAt first you need to wear a sling or brace as the bone heals. This will keep:\n\n* Your collarbone in the right position to heal\n* You from moving your arm, which would be painful\n\nOnce you can move your arm without pain, you can start gentle exercises if your provider says it's OK. These will increase the strength and movement in your arm. At this point, you will be able to wear your sling or brace less.\n\nWhen you restart an activity after a broken collarbone, build up slowly. If your arm, shoulder, or collarbone begins to hurt, stop and rest.\n\nMost people are advised to avoid contact sports for a few months after their collarbones have healed.\n\nDo not place rings on your fingers on the same side of the injury until your provider tells you it is safe to do so. Swelling can work its way down the arm and cause your fingers to swell up.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider or orthopedic surgeon if you have questions or concerns about the healing of your collarbone.\n\nGet care right away or go to the emergency room if:\n\n* Your arm is numb or has a pins and needles feeling.\n* You have pain that does not go away with pain medicine.\n* Your fingers look pale, blue, black, or white.\n* It is hard to move the fingers of your affected arm.\n* Your shoulder looks deformed and the bone is coming out of the skin.\n* Redness around the collarbone.\n\n---\n\n**Broken Collarbone - Aftercare**\n\nYou've been diagnosed with a broken collarbone.

If you have a minor fracture, it can heal on its own. You may only need pain medicines. You will probably have to eat soft foods or stay on a liquid diet for a while.\n\nSurgery is often needed for moderate to severe fractures. The jaw may be wired to the teeth of the opposite jaw to keep the jaw stable while it heals. Jaw wires are usually left in place for 6 to 8 weeks. Small rubber bands (elastics) are used to hold the teeth together. After a few weeks, some of the elastics are removed to allow motion and reduce joint stiffness.\n\nIf the jaw is wired, you can only drink liquids or eat very soft foods. Have blunt scissors readily available to cut the elastics in the event of vomiting or choking. If the wires must be cut, call your health care provider right away so that the wires can be replaced.\n\n**Dislocated Jaw**\n\nIf your jaw is dislocated, a doctor may be able to place it back into the correct position using the thumbs. Numbing medicines (anesthetics) and muscle relaxants may be needed to relax the jaw muscles.\n\nAfterward, your jaw may need to be stabilized. This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely. In some cases, surgery is needed to do this, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations occur.\n\nAfter dislocating your jaw, you should not open your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks.

    "content": "**Broken Toe - Self-Care**\n\nEach toe is made up of 2 or 3 small bones. These bones are small and fragile. They can break after you stub your toe or drop something heavy on it.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nBroken toes are a common injury. The fracture is most often treated without surgery and can be taken care of at home.\n\nSevere injuries include:\n\n* Breaks that cause the toe to be crooked\n* Breaks that cause an open wound\n* Injuries that involve the big toe\n\nIf you have a severe injury, you should seek medical help.\n\nInjuries that involve the big toe may need a cast or splint to heal. In rare cases, tiny pieces of bone can break off and keep the bone from healing properly. In this case, you may need surgery.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nSymptoms of a broken toe include:\n\n* Pain\n* Swelling\n* Bruising that can last up to 2 weeks\n* Stiffness\n\nIf your toe is crooked after the injury, the bone may be out of place and may need to be straightened in order to heal properly. This may be done either with or without surgery.\n\nMost broken toes will heal on their own with proper care at home. It can take 4 to 6 weeks for complete healing. Most pain and swelling will go away within a few days to a week.\n\nIf something was dropped on your toe, the area under the toenail can bruise. This will go away in time with nail growth. If there is substantial blood under the nail, it may be removed to reduce pain and potentially prevent the loss of the nail.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nFor the first few days after your injury:\n\n* Rest. Stop doing any physical activity that causes pain, and keep your foot immobile whenever possible.\n* For the first 24 hours, ice your toe for 20 minutes every hour you are awake, then 2 to 3 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.\n* Keep your foot raised to help keep swelling down.\n* Take pain medicine if necessary.\n\nFor pain, you can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), aspirin, or acetaminophen (Tylenol).

Once swelling has gone down, wear a solid, stable shoe to protect your toe.\n* Activity\n\nSlowly increase the amount of walking you do each day. You can return to normal activity once the swelling has gone down, and you can wear a stable and protective shoe.\n\nThere may be some soreness and stiffness when you walk. This will go away once the muscles in your toe begin to stretch and strengthen.\n\nIce your toe after activity if there is any pain.\n\n**Follow-Up**\n\nFollow up with your provider 1 to 2 weeks after your injury.

It works by stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) that may cause vision loss.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should I Use Brolucizumab-dbll Injection?**\n\nBrolucizumab-dbll comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into the eye by a doctor. If you are receiving brolucizumab-dbll injection to treat wet AMD, it is usually given in a doctor's office once every 25 to 31 days for the first 3 doses, then once every 8 to 12 weeks. If you are receiving brolucizumab-dbll injection to treat DME, it is usually given in a doctor's office once every 39 to 45 days for the first 5 doses, then once every 8 to 12 weeks.\n\nBefore you receive a brolucizumab-dbll injection, your doctor will clean your eye to prevent infection and numb your eye to reduce discomfort during the injection. You may feel pressure in your eye when the medication is injected. After your injection, your doctor will need to examine your eyes before you leave the office.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBrolucizumab-dbll controls wet AMD and DME, but does not cure it.

Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n6. Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n7. While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n8. Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n9. Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n10. Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n11. Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n12.

    "content": "**Bromocriptine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat symptoms of hyperprolactinemia (high levels of a natural substance called prolactin in the body), including lack of menstrual periods, discharge from the nipples, infertility (difficulty becoming pregnant), and hypogonadism (low levels of certain natural substances needed for normal development and sexual function). Bromocriptine (Parlodel) may be used to treat hyperprolactinemia caused by certain types of tumors that produce prolactin, and may shrink these tumors. Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is also used alone or with other treatments to treat acromegaly (condition in which there is too much growth hormone in the body) and Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance). Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is used with a diet and exercise program and sometimes with other medications to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBromocriptine (Parlodel) comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth. Bromocriptine (Cycloset) comes as a tablet to take by mouth. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, it is usually taken once a day with food. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat acromegaly, it is usually taken once a day at bedtime with food. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat Parkinson's disease, it is usually taken twice a day with food. Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is usually taken once a day with food within 2 hours of waking in the morning.\n\nTake bromocriptine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bromocriptine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of bromocriptine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 28 days. The timing of the dose increases depends on the condition being treated and on your response to the medication.\n\nBromocriptine may help to control your condition but will not cure it. It may take some time for you to feel the full benefit of bromocriptine. Do not stop taking bromocriptine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking bromocriptine, you may experience a lack of interest or concern for usual activities or things you usually care about, anxiety, depression, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, sweating, or pain. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n---\n\n**Bromocriptine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   Bromocriptine (Parlodel) comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth.\n*   Bromocriptine (Cycloset) comes as a tablet to take by mouth.\n*   When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, it is usually taken once a day with food.\n*   When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat acromegaly, it is usually taken once a day at bedtime with food.\n*   When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat Parkinson's disease, it is usually taken twice a day with food.\n*   Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is usually taken once a day with food within 2 hours of waking in the morning.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Before taking bromocriptine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bromocriptine; ergot alkaloids such as cabergoline (Dostinex), dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergoloid mesylates (Germinal, Hydergine), ergonovine (Ergotrate), ergotamine (Bellergal-S, Cafergot, Ergomar, Wigraine), methylergonovine (Methergine), methysergide (Sansert), and pergolide (Permax); any other medications; or any of the ingredients in bromocriptine tablets or capsules.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking bromocriptine.\n*   If you have high blood pressure or migraine headaches that cause fainting, do not take bromocriptine.\n*   If you have recently given birth, if you have ever fainted, and if you have or have ever had a heart attack; a slow, fast, or irregular heartbeat; mental illness; low blood pressure; ulcers; bleeding in the stomach or intestines; Raynaud's syndrome (condition in which the hands and feet become numb and cool when exposed to cold temperatures); heart, kidney, or liver disease; or any condition that prevents you from digesting foods containing sugar, starch, or dairy products normally, tell your doctor.\n*   If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, use a method of birth control other than hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, or injections) while taking bromocriptine.\n\n---\n\n**Bromocriptine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**Before Taking Bromocriptine**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bromocriptine; ergot alkaloids such as cabergoline (Dostinex), dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergoloid mesylates (Germinal, Hydergine), ergonovine (Ergotrate), ergotamine (Bellergal-S, Cafergot, Ergomar, Wigraine), methylergonovine (Methergine), methysergide (Sansert), and pergolide (Permax); any other medications; or any of the ingredients in bromocriptine tablets or capsules.

Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n*   Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking bromocriptine. Alcohol can make the side effects from bromocriptine worse.\n*   You should know that some people who used medications such as bromocriptine developed intense urges or behaviors that were compulsive or unusual for them, such as gambling, increased sexual urges or behaviors, and excessive shopping. Call your doctor if you have intense urges to shop, have sex, or gamble, or you are unable to control your behavior. Tell your family members about this risk so that they can call the doctor even if you do not realize that your gambling or any other intense urges or unusual behaviors have become a problem.\n*   You should know that bromocriptine may cause dizziness, nausea, sweating, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking bromocriptine or when your dose is increased. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n*   Ask your doctor what to do if you get sick, develop an infection or fever, experience unusual stress, or are injured. These conditions can affect your blood sugar and the amount of bromocriptine (Cycloset) you may need.\n\n\\n\\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\n*   Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.\n*   Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian.\n\n---\n\n**Bromocriptine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n*   **Missed Dose:** If you take bromocriptine (Cycloset) once a day and miss your morning dose, wait until the next morning to take your medication.

It can also develop later in life due to various causes, including:\n\n* Inflammation or an infection of the airways that keeps coming back\n* Severe lung infections or inhaling foreign objects in childhood\n* Breathing in food particles\n* Cystic fibrosis, a disease causing thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs\n* Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease\n* Allergic lung diseases\n* Leukemia and related cancers\n* Immune deficiency syndromes\n* Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease)\n* Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria\n* As a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans\n* Asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease (uncommon)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms develop over time, often months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis. The main symptom is long-term (chronic) cough with large amounts of foul-smelling sputum. Other symptoms may include:\n\n* Breath odor\n* Coughing up blood (less common in children)\n* Fatigue\n* Paleness\n* Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise\n* Weight loss\n* Wheezing\n* Low-grade fever and night sweats\n* Clubbing of fingers (rare, depends on the cause)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, listening to your chest with a stethoscope to detect small clicking, bubbling, wheezing, rattling, or other sounds in the lower lungs. Tests that may be done include:\n\n* Aspergillosis precipitin test (to check for signs of an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fungus)\n* Alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test\n* Chest x-ray\n* Chest CT\n* Sputum culture\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Genetic testing, including sweat test for cystic fibrosis and tests for other diseases (like primary ciliary dyskinesia)\n* PPD skin test to check for a past tuberculosis infection\n* Serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis to measure proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood\n* Lung function tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning\n* Immune deficiency workup\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is aimed at:\n\n* Reducing infections and sputum\n* Relieving airway blockage\n* Preventing the problem from becoming worse\n* Treating the underlying cause (for example, modulator therapy for people with cystic fibrosis)\n\nDaily drainage to remove sputum is part of treatment. A respiratory therapist can show you coughing exercises that will help. Medicines are often prescribed, including:\n\n* Antibiotics to treat infections\n* Bronchodilators to open up airways\n* Expectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum\n\nIn severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the specific cause of the disease. With treatment, most people live without major disability, and the disease progresses slowly.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of bronchiectasis may include:\n\n* Cor pulmonale\n* Coughing up blood\n* Low oxygen levels (in severe cases)\n* Recurrent pneumonia\n* Depression\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you experience:\n\n* Chest pain or shortness of breath that gets worse\n* A change in the color or amount of phlegm you cough up, or if it is bloody\n* Other symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment\n\n---\n\n**Bronchiectasis**\n\n**What is Bronchiectasis?**\n\nBronchiectasis is a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged.

When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear small clicking, bubbling, wheezing, rattling, or other sounds, usually in the lower lungs.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Aspergillosis precipitin test (to check for signs of an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fungus)\n*   Alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Chest CT\n*   Sputum culture\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Genetic testing, including sweat test for cystic fibrosis and tests for other diseases (like primary ciliary dyskinesia)\n*   PPD skin test to check for a past tuberculosis infection\n*   Serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis to measure proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood\n*   Lung function tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning\n*   Immune deficiency workup\n\n---\n\n**Bronchiectasis**\n\nWhen listening to the chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear small clicking, bubbling, wheezing, rattling, or other sounds, usually in the lower lungs.\n\n**Tests that may be done include:**\n\n*   Aspergillosis precipitin test (to check for signs of an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fungus)\n*   Alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Chest CT\n*   Sputum culture\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Genetic testing, including sweat test for cystic fibrosis and tests for other diseases (like primary ciliary dyskinesia)\n*   PPD skin test to check for a past tuberculosis infection\n*   Serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis to measure proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood\n*   Lung function tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning\n*   Immune deficiency workup\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is aimed at:\n\n*   Reducing infections and sputum\n*   Relieving airway blockage\n*   Preventing the problem from becoming worse\n*   Treating the underlying cause (for example modulator therapy for people with cystic fibrosis)\n\nDaily drainage to remove sputum is part of treatment. A respiratory therapist can show the person coughing exercises that will help.\n\nMedicines are often prescribed. These include:\n\n*   Antibiotics to treat infections\n*   Bronchodilators to open up airways\n*   Expectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum\n\nSurgery to remove (resect) the lung may be helpful if medicine does not work and the disease is in a small area, or if the person has a lot of bleeding in the lungs. It is more commonly considered if there is no genetic or acquired predisposition to bronchiectasis (for example, more likely to consider if there is bronchiectasis in one segment of the lung only because of prior obstruction).\n\nIn severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the specific cause of the disease. With treatment, most people live without major disability and the disease progresses slowly.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of bronchiectasis may include:\n\n*   Cor pulmonale\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Low oxygen levels (in severe cases)\n*   Recurrent pneumonia\n*   Depression\n\n---\n\n**Bronchiectasis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nBronchiectasis is a condition where the bronchial tubes in the lungs are damaged, leading to chronic inflammation and infection. The causes of bronchiectasis can be complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and infectious factors.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nThe diagnosis of bronchiectasis typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies (such as high-resolution computed tomography), and pulmonary function tests. Treatment options for bronchiectasis depend on the underlying cause and severity of the disease, but may include antibiotics, bronchodilators, and in severe cases, lung transplantation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Complications and Prognosis**\n\nBronchiectasis can lead to various complications, including respiratory failure, malnutrition, and increased susceptibility to infections. The prognosis for patients with bronchiectasis varies widely depending on the underlying cause, severity of the disease, and effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n* Breathing Problems\n* Bronchial Disorders",

It is usually due to a viral infection.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months. It is a common, and sometimes severe illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. More than half of all infants are exposed to this virus by their first birthday.\n\nOther viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include:\n\n*   Adenovirus\n*   Influenza\n*   Parainfluenza\n\nThe virus is spread to infants by coming into direct contact with nose and throat fluids of someone who has the illness. This can happen when another child or an adult who has a virus:\n\n    Sneezes or coughs nearby and tiny droplets in the air are then breathed in by the infant\n    Touches toys or other objects that are then touched by the infant\n\nBronchiolitis occurs more often in the fall and winter than other times of the year. It is a very common reason for infants to be hospitalized during winter and early spring.\n\nRisk factors of bronchiolitis include:\n\n*   Being around cigarette smoke\n*   Being younger than 6 months old\n*   Living in crowded conditions\n*   Not being breastfed\n*   Being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSome children have few or mild symptoms.\n\nBronchiolitis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection.

Some children may need to stay in the hospital if their breathing problems do not improve after being observed in the clinic or emergency room.\n\nAntibiotics do not work against viral infections. Medicines that treat viruses may be used to treat very ill children.\n\nAt home, measures to relieve symptoms can be used. For example:\n\n*   Have your child drink plenty of fluids. Breast milk or formula is fine for children younger than 12 months. Electrolyte drinks, such as Pedialyte, are also OK for infants.\n*   Have your child breathe moist (wet) air to help loosen sticky mucus. Use a humidifier to moisten the air.\n*   Give your child saline nose drops. Then use a nasal suction bulb to help relieve a stuffy nose.\n*   Be sure your child gets plenty of rest.\n\nDo not allow anyone to smoke in the house, car, or anywhere near your child. Children who are having trouble breathing may need to stay in the hospital. There, treatment may include oxygen therapy and fluids given through a vein (IV).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBreathing often gets better by the third day and symptoms mostly clear within a week. In rare cases, pneumonia or more severe breathing problems develop.\n\nSome children may have problems with wheezing or asthma as they get older.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away or go to the emergency room if your child:\n\n*   Becomes extremely tired\n*   Has bluish color in the skin, nails, or lips\n*   Starts breathing very fast\n*   Has a cold that suddenly worsens\n*   Has difficulty breathing\n*   Has nostril flaring or chest retractions when trying to breathe\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost cases of bronchiolitis cannot be prevented because the viruses that cause the infection are common in the environment.

    "content": "**Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia**\n\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a long-term lung condition that affects newborn babies who were either put on a breathing machine (ventilator) after birth or were born very early (prematurely).\n\n**Causes**\n\nBPD occurs in very ill infants who received high levels of oxygen for a long period. BPD can also occur in infants who were on a breathing machine.\n\nBPD is more common in infants born early, whose lungs were not fully developed at birth.\n\nRisk factors include:\n\n* Congenital heart disease (problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth)\n* Prematurity, usually in infants born before 32 weeks gestation\n* Severe respiratory or lung infection\n\nRisk of severe BPD has decreased in recent years.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n* Cough\n* Rapid breathing\n* Shortness of breath\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done to help diagnose BPD include:\n\n* Arterial blood gas\n* Chest CT scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Pulse oximetry\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIN THE HOSPITAL\n\nInfants who have breathing problems are often put on a ventilator. This is a breathing machine that sends pressure to the baby's lungs to keep them inflated and to deliver more oxygen. As the baby's lungs develop, the pressure and oxygen are slowly reduced. The baby is weaned from the ventilator. The baby may continue to get oxygen by a mask or nasal tube for several weeks or months.\n\nInfants with BPD are usually fed by tubes inserted into the stomach (NG tube). These babies need extra calories due to the effort of breathing. To keep their lungs from filling with fluid, their fluid intake may need to be limited. They may also be given medicines (diuretics) that remove water from the body. Other medicines can include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and surfactant. Surfactant is a slippery, soapy-like substance in the lungs that helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBabies with BPD get better slowly over time. Oxygen therapy may be needed for many months. Some infants have long-term lung damage and require oxygen and breathing support, such as with a ventilator. Some infants with this condition may not survive.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBabies who have had BPD are at greater risk for repeated respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and RSV that require a hospital stay.\n\nOther possible complications in babies who have had BPD are:\n\n* Developmental problems\n* Poor growth\n* Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs)\n* Long-term lung and breathing problems such as scarring or bronchiectasis\n* In severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf your baby had BPD, watch for any breathing problems. Contact your child's provider if you see any signs of a respiratory infection.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo help prevent BPD:\n\n* Prevent premature delivery whenever possible. If you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, get prenatal care to help keep you and your baby healthy.\n* If your baby is on breathing support, ask the provider how soon your baby can be weaned from the ventilator.\n* Your baby may receive surfactant to help keep the lungs open.\n\n---\n\n**Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)**\n\n**What is BPD?**\n\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a long-term (chronic) lung condition that affects newborn babies who were either put on a breathing machine (ventilator) after birth or were born very early (prematurely).\n\n**Causes of BPD**\n\n*   BPD occurs in very ill infants who received high levels of oxygen for a long period.\n*   BPD can also occur in infants who were on a breathing machine.\n*   BPD is more common in infants born early, whose lungs were not fully developed at birth.\n*   Risk factors include:\n    *   Congenital heart disease (problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth)\n    *   Prematurity, usually in infants born before 32 weeks gestation\n    *   Severe respiratory or lung infection\n\n**Symptoms of BPD**\n\n*   Symptoms may include any of the following:\n    *   Bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n    *   Cough\n    *   Rapid breathing\n    *   Shortness of breath\n\n**Diagnosing BPD**\n\nTests that may be done to help diagnose BPD include:\n\n*   Arterial blood gas\n*   Chest CT scan\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Pulse oximetry\n\n**Treatment for BPD**\n\nIN THE HOSPITAL\n\n*   Infants who have breathing problems are often put on a ventilator.\n*   The baby may continue to get oxygen by a mask or nasal tube for several weeks or months.\n*   Infants with BPD are usually fed by tubes inserted into the stomach (NG tube).\n*   These babies need extra calories due to the effort of breathing.\n\nAT HOME\n\n*   Infants with BPD may need oxygen therapy for weeks to months after leaving the hospital.\n*   Follow your health care provider's instructions to ensure your baby gets enough nutrition during recovery.\n*   Your baby may need tube feedings or special formulas.\n\n---\n\n**Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia?**\n\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious lung disease that affects premature infants. It occurs when the lungs are not fully developed and are damaged by oxygen therapy or other treatments.\n\n**Causes of BPD**\n\nThe exact cause of BPD is unknown, but it is thought to be related to:\n\n* Premature birth\n* Low birth weight\n* Oxygen therapy\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Infection\n\n**Symptoms of BPD**\n\nInfants with BPD may experience:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Fever\n* Coughing\n* Wheezing\n\n**Treatment of BPD**\n\nTreatment for BPD typically involves:\n\n* Oxygen therapy\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Medications to reduce inflammation and improve lung function\n* Fluid restriction to prevent fluid buildup in the lungs\n* Diuretics to remove excess fluid from the body\n\n**Preventing RSV Infection**\n\nTo prevent RSV infection, parents should:\n\n* Wash their hands frequently with warm water and soap before touching their baby\n* Tell others to wash their hands before touching their baby\n* Ask others to avoid contact with their baby if they have a cold or fever, or ask them to wear a mask\n* Be aware that kissing their baby can spread RSV\n* Keep young children away from their baby, as RSV is common among young children and spreads easily from child-to-child\n* Avoid smoking inside the house, car, or anywhere near their baby\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBabies with BPD get better slowly over time. Oxygen therapy may be needed for many months. Some infants have long-term lung damage and require oxygen and breathing support, such as with a ventilator. Some infants with this condition may not survive.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBabies who have had BPD are at greater risk for repeated respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and RSV that require a hospital stay. Other possible complications include:\n\n* Developmental problems\n* Poor growth\n* Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs)\n* Long-term lung and breathing problems such as scarring or bronchiectasis\n* In severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed\n\n---\n\n**Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia**\n\n**What is bronchopulmonary dysplasia?**\n\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious lung disease that affects premature babies. It occurs when the lungs are not fully developed and are damaged by oxygen therapy or other treatments.\n\n**Causes of BPD**\n\nBPD can be caused by:\n\n* Premature birth\n* Low birth weight\n* Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Oxygen therapy\n\n**Symptoms of BPD**\n\nThe symptoms of BPD may include:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Rapid heartbeat\n* Fever\n* Wheezing or coughing\n* Recurrent respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and RSV that require a hospital stay.\n\n**Complications of BPD**\n\nBabies who have had BPD are at risk for other complications, including:\n\n* Chronic lung disease\n* Heart problems\n* Developmental delays\n\n**Prevention of BPD**\n\nTo help prevent BPD:\n\n* Prevent premature delivery whenever possible. If you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, get prenatal care to help keep you and your baby healthy.\n* If your baby is on breathing support, ask the provider how soon your baby can be weaned from the ventilator.\n* Your baby may receive surfactant to help keep the lungs open.\n\n**References**\n\nGreenberg JM, Narendran V, Brady JM, Nathan AT, Haberman BB.

    "content": "**Bronchoscopy - Aftercare**\n\nBronchoscopy is a test to view the inside of the airways and lungs. It is used to help diagnose lung disease and treat certain lung conditions.\n\n* View and clear the airways of any obstruction or blockage.\n* Diagnose an unexplained cough or wheezing.\n* Extract samples of lung tissue or fluid for biopsy.\n* Diagnose or treat some lung conditions.\n\n**About the Test**\n\nBronchoscopy is usually performed as an outpatient procedure using a bronchoscope. A bronchoscope uses a thin tube and a tiny camera at the end to view the inside of your lungs. The tube is inserted through your mouth or nose.\n\nThere are two types of bronchoscopy: flexible and rigid. A flexible scope is almost always used. Rarely, a rigid bronchoscope is used.\n\nYou will likely get medicines through a vein (IV, or intravenously) to help you relax. Or, you may be asleep under general anesthesia, especially if a rigid scope is used.\nA numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be sprayed in your mouth and throat. If bronchoscopy is done through your nose, numbing jelly will be placed in the nostril the tube goes through.\n\nThe procedure generally takes 30 to 45 minutes, but may last longer.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nAfter the procedure, you will go to the recovery room. You will be monitored for rare signs of potential damage to the airways or lungs by the bronchoscope.\n\nIf you had a rigid bronchoscopy your provider may order a chest x-ray to rule out pneumothorax (collapsed lung) following the bronchoscopy.\n\nYou will lose your cough or gag reflex because of the numbing medicine used to relax your throat muscles while performing the bronchoscopy. Your ability to cough or gag will return in 1 to 2 hours as the anesthetic wears off.\n\n**Precautions After Bronchoscopy**\n\nDon't eat or drink until you get your gag or cough reflex back. There is a significant risk of choking if you swallow anything before the numbing medicine wears off.\nOnce the numbness goes away, start by drinking water slowly, sip by sip, to avoid choking.\n\nYou will likely go home the same day. Rarely, some people may need to stay overnight in the hospital.\n\n**Self-Care at Home**\n\nBe sure to rest the day after the procedure. Arrange for help with work, child care, or other tasks. Aftereffects of anesthesia may make you drowsy or sluggish for 24 hours, sometimes longer (rare).\nIf your provider gives you pain medicines, take them as prescribed. Don't take over-the-counter medicines without consulting your provider.\nEat soft foods such as soup, yogurt, Jell-O, and pudding for a day or two. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated unless you have been instructed not to have them.\nYour throat may be scratchy for several days after the test. Ask your provider which medicines or home therapy can help relieve the discomfort.\nAsk your provider before resuming your regular medicines.\nFollow up with your provider for the test results. If your bronchoscopy has been done for a biopsy, it may take longer to get the test results.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nBronchoscopy is usually a safe procedure. Side effects such as bleeding in the airways or lung infection are very rare.\n\nContact your provider right away if you have any of these symptoms after bronchoscopy:\n\nHoarseness or a sore throat that doesn't go away\nPain when swallowing\nCough with blood\nTrouble breathing\nChest pain\nFever that lasts more than 24 hours\n\n---\n\n**Bronchoscopy - Aftercare**\n\nAfter the procedure, you will go to the recovery room.

    "content": "**Bronchoscopy and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)**\n\n\\n\\n**What are bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)?**\n\nA bronchoscopy is a procedure that's used to check for the cause of a lung problem. It can also be used to treat some lung diseases.\n\nThe procedure uses a bronchoscope, which is a thin, lighted tube with a tiny camera. This allows your health care provider to view images of your airways. The tube is put through your mouth or nose, down your throat, and into your airways. The tube is usually flexible but can also be rigid:\n\n*   A flexible bronchoscope may be used to keep your airway open, suck up secretions (mucus made in your airways), or take a tissue sample (biopsy).\n*   A rigid bronchoscope may be used to treat a tumor or bleeding or to remove something large stuck in your airway. It may also be used to insert a stent, which is a tiny tube placed in your airway to help you breathe.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure that is sometimes done during a bronchoscopy. It's done to collect a sample from your lungs. It is also called bronchoalveolar washing. During the procedure, a saline solution is put through the bronchoscope to wash your airways and capture a fluid sample. The cells or bacteria in the fluid sample may be tested for infections or certain lung conditions.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nBronchoscopy may be used to:\n\n*   Find and treat growths or other blockages in your airways\n*   Remove lung tumors\n*   Control bleeding in your airway\n*   Help find the cause of certain lung symptoms such as a cough that doesn't go away\n*   Help guide placement of a breathing tube\n*   Place medicine in your lungs to treat certain conditions\n*   Help determine how severe lung cancer is (if you have already been diagnosed with it)\n\nBronchoscopy with BAL is used to collect tissue for testing, to help diagnose certain lung diseases such as:\n\n*   Bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia\n*   Fungal infections\n*   Lung cancer\n\n**Why do I need bronchoscopy and BAL?**\n\nYou may need one or both tests if you have symptoms of a lung disease, such as:\n\n*   A cough that doesn’t go away\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Coughing up blood\n\nYou may also have one or both tests if a chest x-ray or another imaging test shows a potential problem with your lungs.\n\nIf you have an immune system disorder, you may be more likely to get certain lung problems. For example, HIV or an organ transplant can put you at higher risk for some lung infections. If your provider thinks that you may have a lung infection or other lung problem, they can use bronchoscopy, often with a BAL, to make a diagnosis. Getting an early diagnosis helps you get the correct treatment as soon as possible.\n\n**What happens during bronchoscopy and BAL?**\n\nBronchoscopy and BAL are often done by a pulmonologist. A pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases.\n\nA bronchoscopy takes about 30 to 90 minutes and usually includes the following steps:\n\n*   You may need to remove some or all of your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.\n*   You may also need to remove dentures and any removable dental appliances.\n*   You will lie on a bed or table with your head raised. \n*   You may get medicine (sedative) to help you relax. The medicine will be injected into a vein or given through an IV (intravenous) line placed in your arm or hand. \n*   Your provider will spray a numbing medicine in your mouth and throat so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure.\n*   Your provider will insert the bronchoscope down your throat and into your airways. The camera on the bronchoscope will take photos and connect to a video screen. \n*   As the bronchoscope is moved down, your provider can look into your airways and lungs through the bronchoscope and on the video screen.\n*   Your provider may perform other treatments at this time, such as removing a tumor or clearing a blockage. \n*   At this point, you may also get a BAL.\n\nDuring a BAL:\n\n*   Your provider will put a small amount of saline through the bronchoscope.\n*   After washing the airways, the saline is sucked up into the bronchoscope.\n*   The saline solution will contain cells and other substances, such as bacteria, which will be taken to a lab for testing.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your procedure. Your provider will let you know how long you need to avoid food and drink.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don’t stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**What to expect after the test:**\n\n*   Your mouth and throat may be numb for a few hours.\n*   You will have to wait to eat or drink until the numbness is gone.\n*   If you’ve been given a sedative, you may be drowsy for a few hours after your procedure and should arrange to have someone take you home.\n*   You may have a sore throat, cough, or hoarseness for a day or more.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a bronchoscopy or a BAL. Serious complications are rare, but they may include bleeding in the airways, infection, or a pneumothorax (collapse of part of your lung).\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf your bronchoscopy results were not normal, it may be a sign of lung disorder such as:\n\n*   A blockage, growth, or tumor in the airways\n*   Narrowing of part of the airways\n*   Lung damage due to an immune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis\n\nIf you had BAL and your lung sample results were not normal, it may be a sign of lung cancer or a type of infection such as:\n\n*   Tuberculosis\n*   Bacterial pneumonia\n*   Fungal infection\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests to understand the results of your procedure.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about bronchoscopy and BAL?**\n\nIn addition to BAL, other procedures can be done during a bronchoscopy. These include:\n\n*   Sputum culture. Sputum is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs. It is different than spit or saliva. A sputum culture checks for certain types of infections.\n*   Laser therapy or radiation to treat tumors or cancer\n*   Treatment to control bleeding in the lungs\n\nIf you had a tissue sample taken, you may also have a chest x-ray done to check for any issues.\n\n---\n\n**Bronchoscopy and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA bronchoscopy is a procedure that's used to check for the cause of a lung problem.

This washes the lungs and allows your provider to collect samples of lung cells, fluids, microbes and other materials inside the air sacs. This part of the procedure is called a lavage.\nSometimes, tiny brushes, needles, or forceps may be passed through the bronchoscope to take very small tissue samples (biopsies) from your lungs.\nYour provider can also place a stent in your airway or view your lungs with ultrasound during the procedure. A stent is a small tube-like medical device. Ultrasound is a painless imaging method that allows your provider to see inside your body.\nSometimes ultrasound is used to see the lymph nodes and tissues around your airways, and small needles can be inserted there to obtain tissue and make certain diagnoses.\nAt the end of the procedure, the scope is removed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow instructions on how to prepare for the test. You will likely be told:\n\nNot to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before your test.\nNot to take aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other blood-thinning medicines before your procedure. Ask the provider who will do your bronchoscopy if and when to stop taking these medicines.\nArrange for a ride to and from the hospital.\nArrange for help with work, child care, or other tasks, as you will likely need to rest the next day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nLocal anesthetic is used to relax and numb your throat muscles. Until this medicine begins to work, you may feel fluid running down the back of your throat. This may cause you to cough or gag.\n\nOnce the medicine takes effect, you may feel pressure or mild tugging as the tube moves through your windpipe. Although you may feel like you are not able to breathe when the tube is in your throat, there is no risk of this happening. The medicines you receive to relax will help with these symptoms. You will likely forget most of the procedure.\n\nWhen the anesthetic wears off, your throat may be scratchy for several days. After the test, your ability to cough (cough reflex) will return in 1 to 2 hours. You will not be allowed to eat or drink until your cough reflex returns.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may have a bronchoscopy to help your provider diagnose lung problems. Your provider will be able to inspect your airways or take a biopsy sample.\n\nCommon reasons to do a bronchoscopy for diagnosis are:\n\nAn imaging test showed abnormal changes of your lung, such as a growth or tumor, changes or scarring of lung tissue, or collapse of one area of your lung.\nTo biopsy lymph nodes near your lungs.\nTo see why you are coughing up blood.\nTo explain shortness of breath or low oxygen levels.\nTo see if there is a foreign object in your airway.\nYou have a cough that has lasted more than 3 months without any clear cause.\nYou have an infection in your lungs and major airways (bronchi) that cannot be diagnosed any other way or need a certain type of diagnosis.\nYou inhaled a toxic gas or chemical.\nTo see if lung rejection after a lung transplant is occurring.\n\nYou may also have a bronchoscopy to treat a lung or airway problem. For example, it may be done to:\n\nRemove fluid or mucus plugs from your airways\nRemove a foreign object from your airways\nWiden (dilate) an airway that is blocked or narrowed\nDrain an abscess\nTreat cancer using a number of different techniques\nWash out an airway\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal results mean normal cells and fluids are found. No foreign substances or blockages are seen.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nMany disorders can be diagnosed with bronchoscopy, including:\n\nInfections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, or tuberculosis.\nLung damage related to allergic-type reactions.\nLung disorders in which the deep lung tissues become inflamed due to the immune system response, and then damaged. For example, changes from sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis may be found.\nLung cancer, or cancer in the area between the lungs.\nNarrowing (stenosis) of the trachea or bronchi.\nAcute rejection or infection after a lung transplant.\nRisks\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe main risks of bronchoscopy are:\n\nBleeding from biopsy sites (most dangerous complication in very rare occasions)\nInfection\n\nThere is also a small risk for:\n\nAbnormal heart rhythms\nBreathing difficulties\nFever\nHeart attack, in people with existing heart disease\nLow blood oxygen\nCollapsed lung\nSore throat\n\nRisks when general anesthesia is used include:\n\nMuscle pain\nChange in blood pressure\nSlower heart rate\nNausea and vomiting\n\n---\n\n**Bronchoscopy**\n\nBronchoscopy is a test to view the airways and diagnose lung disease. It may also be used during the treatment of some lung conditions.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA bronchoscope is a device used to see the inside of the airways and lungs. The scope can be flexible or rigid. A flexible scope is almost always used. It is a tube less than one half inch (1.27 centimeter) wide and about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long. In rare cases, a rigid bronchoscope is used.\n\nYou will likely get medicines through a vein (IV, or intravenously) to help you relax. Or, you may be asleep under general anesthesia, especially if a rigid scope is used.\n\nA numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be sprayed in your mouth and throat. If bronchoscopy is done through your nose, numbing jelly will be placed in the nostril the tube goes through.\n\nThe scope is gently inserted. It will likely make you cough at first.

    "content": "**Brown Recluse Spider**\n\n**What is a Brown Recluse Spider?**\n\nA brown recluse spider is a type of spider that is found in the southern and central states of the United States. It is identified by its dark brown, violin-shaped mark on its upper body and light brown legs.\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\n* Length: 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.5 centimeters)\n* Dark brown, violin-shaped mark on upper body\n* Light brown legs\n* Lower body may be dark brown, tan, yellow, or greenish\n* 3 pairs of eyes (instead of the usual 4 pairs)\n\n**Venomous Bite**\n\nThe bite of a brown recluse spider is venomous and can cause serious symptoms.\n\n**Where are Brown Recluse Spiders Found?**\n\nBrown recluse spiders are most common in the south and central states of the United States, especially in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, eastern Texas, and Oklahoma. However, they have been found in several large cities outside these areas.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo avoid getting bitten by a brown recluse spider:\n\n* Wear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders live\n* Avoid putting your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places\n\n**Symptoms of a Brown Recluse Spider Bite**\n\nWhen the spider bites you, you may feel a sharp sting or nothing at all. Pain usually develops within the first several hours after being bitten, and may become severe. Children may have more serious reactions.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Chills\n* Itching\n* General ill-feeling or discomfort\n* Fever\n* Nausea\n* Reddish or purplish color in a circle around bite\n* Sweating\n* Large sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite\n\nRarely, these symptoms may occur:\n\n* Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n* Blood in urine\n* Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Kidney failure\n* Seizures\n\n---\n\n**Brown Recluse Spider**\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the spider to the emergency room with you, if possible. Make sure it is in a secure container.\n\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n\nSymptoms will be treated. Because brown recluse spider bites can be painful, pain medicines may be given. Antibiotics may also be prescribed if the wound is infected.\n\nIf the wound is near a joint (such as a knee or elbow), the arm or leg may be placed into a brace or sling. If practical, elevate the arm or leg.\n\nIn more serious reactions, the person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith proper medical attention, survival past 48 hours is usually a sign that recovery will follow. Even with appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks. The original bite, which may be small, may progress to a blood blister and look like a bull's eye. It may then become deeper, and additional symptoms such as fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may develop. If scarring from an ulcer has developed, surgery may be needed to improve the appearance of the scar formed at the site of the bite.\n\nDeath from brown recluse spider bites is more common in children than adults.\n\n---\n\n**Brown Recluse Spider**\n\n**Where Found**\n\nThe brown recluse spider is most common in the south and central states of the United States, especially in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, eastern Texas, and Oklahoma. However, they have been found in several large cities outside these areas.\n\nThey prefer dark, sheltered areas, such as under porches and in woodpiles.\n\n**Protective Measures**\n\nWear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders live. DO NOT put your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places, such as dark, sheltered areas under logs or underbrush, or other damp, moist areas.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen the spider bites you, you may feel a sharp sting or nothing at all. Pain usually develops within the first several hours after being bitten, and may become severe. Children may have more serious reactions.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Chills\n* Itching\n* General ill-feeling or discomfort\n* Fever\n* Nausea\n* Reddish or purplish color in a circle around bite\n* Sweating\n* Large sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite\n\nRarely, these symptoms may occur:\n\n* Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n* Blood in urine\n* Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Kidney failure\n* Seizures\n\nIn serious cases, blood supply is cut off from the area of the bite. This results in black tissue scarring (eschar) at the site. The eschar sloughs off after about 2 to 5 weeks, leaving an ulcer through skin and fatty tissue. The ulcer may take many months to heal and leave a deep scar.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSeek emergency medical treatment right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or poison control.\n\nFollow these steps until medical help is given:\n\n* Clean the area with soap and water.\n* Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\n* Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.\n* Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* The body part affected\n* The time the bite occurred\n* The type of spider, if known\n\nTake the person to the emergency room for treatment. The bite may not look serious, but it can take some time to become severe. Treatment is important to reduce complications. If possible, place the spider in a secure container and bring it to the emergency room for identification.\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Brown Recluse Spider: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/5)**\n\n**National Poison Control Hotline**\n\nCall the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service.

A bruise occurs when small blood vessels break and leak their contents into the soft tissue beneath the skin.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThere are three types of bruises:\n\n*   **Subcutaneous**: beneath the skin\n*   **Intramuscular**: within the belly of the underlying muscle\n*   **Periosteal**: bone bruise\n\nBruises can last from days to months. A bone bruise is the most severe and painful.\n\n**Causes**\n\nBruises are often caused by falls, sports injuries, car accidents, or blows received from other people or objects.\n\nIf you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), or clopidogrel (Plavix), you are likely to bruise more easily.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMain symptoms are pain, swelling, and skin discoloration. The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised. For example, a deep thigh bruise is painful when you walk or run.\n\nEventually, the bruise changes to a bluish color, then greenish-yellow, and finally returns to the normal skin color as it heals.\n\n**First Aid**\n\nPlace ice on the bruise to help it heal faster and to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in a clean towel. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Apply the ice for up to 15 minutes each hour.\n\nKeep the bruised area raised above the heart, if possible. This helps keep blood from pooling in the bruised tissue.\n\nTry to rest the bruised body part by not overworking your muscles in that area.\n\nIf needed, take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help reduce pain.\n\nIn the rare case of compartment syndrome, surgery is often done to relieve the extreme buildup of pressure. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure on the soft tissues and structures beneath the skin. It can decrease the supply of blood and oxygen to the tissues.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\nDo not try to drain the bruise with a needle.\n\nDo not continue running, playing, or otherwise using the painful, bruised part of your body.\n\nDo not ignore the pain or swelling.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider right away if you feel extreme pressure in a bruised part of your body, especially if the area is large or very painful. This may be due to compartment syndrome, and can be life-threatening. You should receive emergency care.\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n*   You are bruising without any injury, fall, or other reason.\n*   There are signs of infection around the bruised area including streaks of redness, pus or other drainage, or fever.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause bruises are usually the direct result of an injury, the following are important safety recommendations:\n\n*   Teach children how to be safe.\n*   Be mindful to avoid falls around the house. For example, be careful when climbing on ladders or other objects. Avoid standing or kneeling on counter tops.\n*   Wear seat belts in motor vehicles.\n*   Wear proper sports equipment to pad those areas most frequently bruised, such as thigh pads, hip guards, and elbow pads in football and hockey. Wear shin guards and knee pads in soccer and basketball.\n\n---\n\n**Bruise: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause bruises are usually the direct result of an injury, the following are important safety recommendations:\n\n*   Teach children how to be safe.\n*   Be mindful to avoid falls around the house.

    "content": "**Bruised Rib Care**\n\nA rib contusion, also called a bruised rib, can occur after a fall or blow to your chest area. A bruise occurs when small blood vessels break and leak their contents into the soft tissue beneath the skin. This causes the skin to become discolored.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Car accidents\n*   Sports injuries\n*   Falls\n*   Severe or prolonged coughing\n\nA rib bruise due to a blunt force may cause bleeding and injury to the tissues under the skin. Depending on the force of the blow, you may have other injuries, such as broken ribs or damage to the lungs, liver, spleen, or kidney. This is more likely in car accidents or falls from a great height.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Pain\n*   Swelling\n*   Skin discoloration\n\nThe skin overlying the bruise may turn blue, purple, or yellow. The bruised area is tender and sore. You may feel pain both when you move and while at rest. Breathing, coughing, laughing, or sneezing can all cause or increase pain.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nBruised ribs recover in the same manner as fractured ribs, but a bruise takes less time to recover than a rib fracture. Healing takes about 4 to 6 weeks. An x-ray, MRI, or CT scan is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging studies may be needed to check for more serious injuries, such as a rib fracture or damage to internal organs.\n\nYou will not have a belt or a bandage around your chest because these would keep your ribs from moving when you breathe or cough. This may lead to lung infection (pneumonia).\n\n**Self-care at Home**\n\nHere are some ways to help relieve pain and discomfort as you heal:\n\n*   **ICING**: Icing helps reduce swelling by decreasing the blood flow in the area. It also numbs the area and helps relieve pain.\n    *   Apply an ice pack to the injured area for 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times per day for the first one to two days.\n    *   Wrap the ice pack in a cloth before applying to the injured area.\n*   **PAIN MEDICINES**: If your pain is not severe, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) for pain relief. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n    *   Talk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\n    *   Do not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n*   **BREATHING EXERCISES**: Being in pain when you breathe can cause you to take shallow breaths. If you take shallow breaths for too long, it can put you at risk for pneumonia. To help prevent problems, your provider may recommend deep breathing exercises.\n    *   Do slow deep-breathing and gentle coughing exercises every 2 hours, to get rid of the mucous from your lungs and prevent partial lung collapse.\n    *   Take 10 deep breaths every hour, even if you awaken during the first few nights.\n*   **PRECAUTIONS**: Do not rest in bed all day. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs. Don't smoke or use any tobacco products. Try to sleep in a comfortable semi-upright position for the first few nights. You can do this by placing a few pillows under your neck and upper back. This position will help you breathe more comfortably.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact your provider right away if you have:\n\n*   Pain that does not allow deep breathing or coughing despite using pain relievers\n*   Fever\n*   Cough or an increase in mucus that you cough up\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Side effects of pain medicine such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, or allergic reactions, such as skin rashes, facial swelling, or difficulty breathing\n\n---\n\n**Bruised Rib Care**\n\nA bruised rib, also known as a rib contusion, can occur after a fall or blow to your chest area.

    "content": "**Bruxism**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Bruxism?**\n\nBruxism is when you grind your teeth (slide your teeth back and forth over each other).\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople can clench and grind without being aware of it. It can happen during the day and night. Bruxism during sleep is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.\n\nThere is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench or grind their teeth and never feel symptoms.\n\nFactors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:\n\n*   How much stress you have\n*   How long and how tightly you clench and grind your teeth\n*   Whether your teeth are misaligned\n*   Your posture\n*   Your ability to relax\n*   Your diet\n*   Your sleeping habits\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nGrinding your teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ).\n\nGrinding can wear down your teeth. It can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.\n\nSymptoms of bruxism include:\n\n*   Anxiety, stress, and tension\n*   Depression\n*   Earache (partly because the structures of the temporomandibular joint are very close to the ear canal, and because you can feel pain in a different location than its source; this is called referred pain)\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle tenderness, especially in the morning\n*   Hot, cold, or sweet sensitivity in the teeth\n*   Insomnia\n*   Sore or painful jaw\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAn exam can check for other disorders that may cause similar jaw pain or ear pain, including:\n\n*   Dental disorders\n*   Ear disorders, such as ear infections\n*   Problems with the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\n\nYou may have a history of a high stress level and tension.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce pain, prevent permanent damage to the teeth, and reduce clenching as much as possible.\n\nThese self-care tips may help relieve pain:\n\n*   Apply ice or wet heat to sore jaw muscles. Either can help.\n*   Avoid eating hard or dense foods like nuts, candies, and steak.\n*   Do not chew gum.\n*   Drink plenty of water every day.\n*   Get plenty of sleep.\n*   Learn physical therapy stretching exercises to help the muscles and joints on each side of your head get back to normal.\n*   Massage the muscles of your neck, shoulders, and face. Look for small, painful nodules called trigger points that can cause pain throughout your head and face.\n*   Relax your face and jaw muscles throughout the day. The goal is to make facial relaxation a habit.\n*   Try to reduce your daily stress and learn relaxation techniques.\n\nTo prevent damage to your teeth, mouth guards or appliances (splints) are often used to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders. A splint may help protect your teeth from the pressure of grinding.\n\nA well-fitting splint should help minimize the effects of grinding. However, some people find that the symptoms go away as long as they use the splint, but pain returns when they stop. The splint may also not work as well over time.\n\nThere are many types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, some on the bottom. They may be designed to keep your jaw in a more relaxed position or provide some other function. If one type doesn't work, another may. Botox injections into the jaw muscles have also shown some success in controlling clenching and grinding.\n\nAfter splint therapy, adjustment of the bite pattern may help some people.\n\nFinally, many approaches try to help people unlearn their clenching behaviors. These are more successful for daytime clenching.\n\nIn some people, just relaxing and modifying daytime behavior is enough to reduce nighttime bruxism. Methods to directly modify nighttime clenching have not been well studied. They include biofeedback devices, self-hypnosis, and other alternative therapies.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nBruxism is not a dangerous disorder. However, it can cause permanent damage to the teeth and uncomfortable jaw pain, headaches, or ear pain.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBruxism may cause:\n\n*   Depression\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Insomnia\n*   Increased dental or TMJ problems\n*   Fractured teeth\n*   Receding gums\n\nNightly grinding can awaken roommates or sleeping partners.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSee a dentist right away if you are having trouble eating or opening your mouth. Keep in mind that a wide variety of possible conditions, from arthritis to whiplash injuries, can cause TMJ symptoms. Therefore, see your dentist for a full evaluation if self-care measures do not help within several weeks.\n\nGrinding and clenching does not fall clearly into one medical discipline. There is no recognized TMJ specialty in dentistry. For a massage-based approach, look for a massage therapist trained in trigger point therapy, neuromuscular therapy, or clinical massage.\n\nDentists who have more experience with TMJ disorders will typically take x-rays and prescribe a mouth guard. Surgery is now considered a last resort for TMJ.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nStress reduction and anxiety management may reduce bruxism in people who are prone to the condition.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nTeeth grinding; Clenching\n\n---\n\n**Bruxism**\n\nBruxism is when you grind your teeth (slide your teeth back and forth over each other).\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople can clench and grind without being aware of it.

    "title": "Budesonide Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601030.html",
    "content": "**Budesonide Nasal Spray**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nBudesonide nasal spray is used to relieve sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose caused by hay fever or other allergies (caused by an allergy to pollen, mold, dust, or pets). Budesonide nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Budesonide nasal spray is in a class of drugs called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nBudesonide comes as a suspension (liquid) (prescription and nonprescription) to spray in the nose. Budesonide nasal spray is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. If you are an adult, you will begin your treatment with a higher dose of budesonide nasal spray and then decrease your dose when your symptoms improve. If you are giving budesonide nasal spray to a child, you will begin treatment with a lower dose of the medication and increase the dose if the child's symptoms do not improve. Decrease the dose when the child's symptoms improve.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nBudesonide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth.\n\nEach bottle of budesonide nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share budesonide nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBudesonide nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve 1 to 2 days after you first use budesonide, but it may take up to 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of budesonide. Budesonide works best when used regularly. Use budesonide on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use budesonide nasal spray daily for 2 weeks.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are giving budesonide nasal spray to a child, ask the child's doctor how and when to give the missed dose. Do not give extra doses of this medication without consulting your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects may include:\n\n* Nosebleeds\n* Stuffy nose\n* Runny nose\n* Sneezing\n* Coughing\n\nLess common side effects may include:\n\n* Headache\n* Dizziness\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep track of the number of sprays you have used and throw away the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.\n\nBefore you use budesonide nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Follow these steps:\n\n* Shake the bottle gently before each use.\n* Remove the dust cover.\n* If you are using the pump for the first time or have not used it for 2 or more days in a row, you must prime it by following steps 4 to 5 below. If you have used the pump before and have not missed 2 days in a row of medication, skip to step 6.\n* Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your face.\n* If you are using the pump for the first time, press down and release the pump eight times. If you have used the pump before, but not within the past 2 days, press down and release the pump once until you see a fine spray. If you have not used the pump for more than 14 days, rinse the applicator tip and prime with two or more sprays until you see a fine spray.\n* Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.\n* Hold one nostril closed with your finger.\n* Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the nasal applicator tip into your other nostril. Be sure to keep the bottle upright.\n* Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom resting on your thumb.\n* Begin to breathe in through your nose.\n* While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.\n* Lean your head back and breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.\n* If your doctor told you to use additional sprays in that nostril, repeat steps 6 to 12.\n* Repeat steps 6 to 13 in the other nostril.\n* Do not blow your nose for 15 minutes after you use the nasal spray.\n* Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the dust cover.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Budesonide Nasal Spray**\n\n**Using the Pump for the First Time or After a Break**\n\nBefore using budesonide nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Shake the bottle gently before each use.\n2. Remove the dust cover.\n3. If you are using the pump for the first time or have not used it for 2 or more days in a row, you must prime it by following steps 4 to 5 below. If you have used the pump before and have not missed 2 days in a row of medication, skip to step 6.\n4. Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your face.\n5. If you are using the pump for the first time, press down and release the pump eight times. If you have used the pump before, but not within the past 2 days, press down and release the pump once until you see a fine spray. If you have not used the pump for more than 14 days, rinse the applicator tip and prime with two or more sprays until you see a fine spray.\n\n**Using Budesonide Nasal Spray**\n\n1. Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.\n2. Hold one nostril closed with your finger.\n3. Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the nasal applicator tip into your other nostril. Be sure to keep the bottle upright.\n4. Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom resting on your thumb.\n5. Begin to breathe in through your nose.\n6. While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.\n7. Lean your head back and breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n* Before using budesonide nasal spray, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to budesonide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in budesonide nasal spray. Check the package label for a list of the ingredients.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using budesonide nasal spray. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* Tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery on your nose, have injured your nose in any way, or if you have sores in your nose. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), glaucoma (an eye disease), asthma (sudden episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, and trouble breathing), any type of infection, a herpes infection of the eye (an infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface), or liver disease. Tell your doctor if you have chicken pox, measles, or tuberculosis (TB; a type of lung infection), or if you have been around someone who has one of these conditions.\n* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.\n\n**Other Important Information**\n\n* Budesonide nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and throw away the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.\n* An adult should help children younger than 12 years old to use budesonide nasal spray. Children younger than 6 years of age should not use this medication.\n* Budesonide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth.\n* Each bottle of budesonide nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share budesonide nasal spray because this may spread germs.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nBudesonide nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions.

Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\n\nTell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment with budesonide.\n\n---\n\n**Budesonide Oral Inhalation**\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\n*   Budesonide comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a suspension to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled).\n*   Budesonide powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled twice a day.\n*   Budesonide suspension for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once or twice a day.\n*   Try to use budesonide at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n**Using the Inhaler**\n\n1.

Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\n\n**How Long Does My Budesonide Inhaler Last?**\n\n*   Each budesonide inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size.\n*   After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication.\n*   You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used.\n*   You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last.\n\n**Disposing of Your Budesonide Inhaler**\n\n*   Dispose of the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.\n\n**Using Your Budesonide Nebulizer Suspension**\n\n*   Do not swallow budesonide nebulizer suspension.\n\n**Before You Use Budesonide Inhaler or Jet Nebulizer for the First Time**\n\n*   Read the written instructions that come with your budesonide inhaler or jet nebulizer.\n*   Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler or nebulizer.\n*   Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler or nebulizer.\n*   Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\n*   This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Budesonide Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\n*   If you get sick while taking budesonide inhalation, call your doctor right away.

    "content": "**Budesonide and Formoterol Oral Inhalation**\n\n*pronounced as (byoo des' oh nide)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of budesonide and formoterol is used to prevent and treat difficulty breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older. The combination of budesonide and formoterol is also used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways, that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema) in adults.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of budesonide and formoterol comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It is usually taken as 2 puffs twice a day, in the morning and the evening, about 12 hours apart. Inhale budesonide and formoterol at about the same times every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide and formoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should take your other oral or inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with budesonide and formoterol inhalation. If you were using a short-acting beta agonist inhaler such as albuterol (Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) on a regular basis, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly but to continue to use it to treat sudden attacks of asthma symptoms.\n\nDo not use budesonide and formoterol inhalation during an attack of asthma or COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting (rescue) inhaler to use during attacks. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of asthma or COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\n\nBudesonide and formoterol controls symptoms of asthma and COPD but does not cure them. Continue to use budesonide and formoterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using budesonide and formoterol without talking to your doctor. If you stop using budesonide and formoterol inhalation, your symptoms may return.\n\nIf your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that they know how to use it. Watch your child each time they use the inhaler to be sure that they are using it correctly.\n\nBefore you use the budesonide and formoterol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler. Practice using the inhaler while they watch you so you are sure you are doing it the right way.\n\nAfter inhalation, rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out; do not swallow the water.\n\nStop using the inhaler and throw the inhaler away when the dose counter shows zero.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Budesonide and Formoterol Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using the Inhaler**\n\n*   Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler.\n*   Practice using the inhaler while they watch you so you are sure you are doing it the right way.\n\n**After Inhalation**\n\n*   Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out; do not swallow the water.\n\n**Stopping Use of the Inhaler**\n\n*   Stop using the inhaler and throw the inhaler away when the dose counter shows zero.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n*   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\n*   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Before using budesonide and formoterol inhalation, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to budesonide (Ortikos, Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Tarpeyo, others), formoterol (Perforomist, in Bevespi, in Duaklir Pressair, in Dulera), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in budesonide and formoterol oral inhalation. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) and if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, QT prolongation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to fainting, loss of consciousness, seizures, or sudden death), heart disease, high blood pressure, low levels of potassium in your blood, diabetes, seizures, tuberculosis (TB; a serious lung infection) in your lungs, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), glaucoma (an eye disease) or high pressure in the eye, or thyroid or liver disease. Also tell your doctor if you have any condition that affects your immune system, any type of untreated infection anywhere in your body or a herpes eye infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface), if you smoke or use tobacco products, or if you are on bedrest or unable to move around.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using budesonide and formoterol inhalation, call your doctor.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n*   If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using budesonide and formoterol inhalation.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and have not been vaccinated against these infections.

If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nMost bug repellents contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) as their active ingredient. DEET is one of the few insect sprays that work to repel bugs. It is recommended for preventing diseases that mosquitos spread, such as malaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus.\n\n**Other Less Effective Bug Sprays**\n\nSome bug sprays contain pyrethrins, a pesticide made from the chrysanthemum flower. Pyrethrins are generally considered nonpoisonous but can cause breathing problems if you breathe in large amounts.\n\n**Where Found**\n\nBug sprays are sold under various brand names.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of using bug spray vary depending on what type of spray it is.\n\n**Symptoms of Swallowing Sprays Containing Pyrethrins**\n\n* Breathing difficulty\n* Coughing\n* Loss of alertness (stupor), from the blood oxygen level being out of balance\n* Tremors (if a large amount is swallowed)\n* Seizures (if a large amount is swallowed)\n* Upset stomach, including cramps, stomach pain, and nausea\n* Vomiting\n\n**Symptoms of Using Sprays Containing DEET**\n\n* EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT:\n\t+ Temporary burning and redness, if DEET is sprayed into these parts of the body. Washing the area will usually make the symptoms go away.\n\t+ Burns to the eye may require medicine.\n* HEART AND BLOOD (IF A LARGE AMOUNT OF DEET IS SWALLOWED):\n\t+ Low blood pressure\n\t+ Very slow heartbeat\n* LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:\n\t+ Breathing difficulty due to throat swelling\n\t+ Burns of the breathing passages\n\t+ Irritation\n* NERVOUS SYSTEM:\n\t+ Clumsiness when walking.\n\t+ Coma (lack of responsiveness).\n\t+ Disorientation.\n\t+ Insomnia and mood changes. These symptoms may occur with long-term use of large amounts of DEET (over 50% concentration).\n\t+ Death.\n\t+ Seizures.\n* SKIN:\n\t+ Hives or mild skin redness and irritation. These symptoms are usually mild and will go away when the product is washed off the skin.\n\t+ More severe skin reactions that include blistering, burning, and permanent scars of the skin. These symptoms may occur when someone uses products that contain a large amount of DEET over a long period of time.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nDo not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the product is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the person swallowed the product, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness. If the person breathed in the product, move them to fresh air right away.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition\n* Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n* Time it was swallowed or inhaled\n* Amount swallowed or inhaled\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nTake the container with you to the hospital, if possible.\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.\n\nThe person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen given through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Bronchoscopy: camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n* Fluids through a vein (IV)\n* Medicine to treat the effects of the poison\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFor sprays that contain pyrethrins:\n\n* For simple exposure or inhaling small amounts, recovery should occur.\n* Severe breathing difficulty can quickly become life threatening.\n\nFor sprays that contain DEET:\n\n* When used as directed in small amounts, DEET is not very harmful. It is the preferred bug repellent for preventing diseases that mosquitos spread. It is usually the sensible choice to use DEET to repel mosquitos, compared to the danger of any of those diseases, even for pregnant women.\n* Serious problems can occur if someone swallows a large amount of a DEET product that is very strong. How well the person does depends on the amount they swallowed, how strong it is, and how quickly they receive medical treatment. Seizures can lead to permanent brain damage and possibly death.\n\n**References**\n\nElston DM. Bites and stings. In: Lebwohl MG, Heymann WR, Berth-Jones J, Coulson IH, Murrell DF, eds.

    "content": "**Bullous Pemphigoid**\n\n_Bullous pemphigoid is a skin disorder characterized by blisters._\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake.\n*   Specifically, the immune system attacks the proteins that attach the top layer of skin (epidermis) to the bottom layer of skin.\n*   This disorder usually occurs in older persons and is rare in young people.\n*   Symptoms come and go. The condition often goes away within 5 years.\n*   In some cases, the condition is triggered by a medicine.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Most people with this disorder have itchy skin that may be severe.\n*   In most cases, there are blisters, called bullae.\n*   Blisters are usually located on the arms, legs, or middle of the body. In rare cases, blisters can form in the mouth.\n*   The blisters may break open and form open sores (ulcers).\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   Your health care provider will examine the skin and ask about the symptoms. They will review your list of medicines.\n*   Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:\n    *   Blood tests\n    *   Skin biopsy of the blister or the area next to it\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids may be prescribed. They may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin.\n*   More powerful medicines may be used to help suppress the immune system if steroids do not work, or to allow lower steroid doses to be used.\n*   Antibiotics in the tetracycline family may be useful. Niacin (a B complex vitamin) is sometimes given along with tetracycline.\n*   Your provider may suggest self-care measures. These may include:\n    *   Applying anti-inflammatory creams to the skin\n    *   Using mild soaps and applying moisturizer to the skin after bathing\n    *   Protecting the affected skin from sun exposure and injury\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   Bullous pemphigoid usually responds well to treatment.\n*   The medicine can often be stopped after several years.\n*   The disease sometimes returns after treatment is stopped.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   Skin infection is the most common complication.\n*   Complications resulting from treatment may also occur, especially from taking corticosteroids.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   Contact your provider if you have:\n    *   Unexplained blisters on your skin\n    *   An itchy rash that continues despite home treatment\n\n---\n\n**Bullous Pemphigoid**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Blisters are usually located on the arms, legs, or middle of the body.

It is harmful to both the victims and the bullies, and it always involves:\n\n*   Aggressive behavior.\n*   A difference in power, meaning that the victim is weaker or is seen as weaker.\n*   Repetition, meaning it happens more than once or that it probably will happen again\n\n**Types of Bullying**\n\nThere are three types of bullying:\n\n*   **Physical Bullying**: hurting a person's body or belongings. Examples include hitting, kicking, and stealing or breaking someone's stuff.\n*   **Social Bullying (Relational Bullying)**: hurts someone's reputation or relationships.

So it is important to know the signs of a bullying problem:\n\n*   Depression, loneliness, or anxiety\n*   Low self-esteem\n*   Headaches, stomachaches, or poor eating habits\n*   Disliking school, not wanting to go to school, or getting worse grades than before\n*   Self-destructive behaviors, such as running away from home, harming themselves, or talking about suicide\n*   Unexplained injuries\n*   Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry\n*   Trouble sleeping or frequent nightmares\n*   Sudden loss of friends or avoidance of social situations\n\n**How to Help Someone Who is Being Bullied**\n\nTo help a child who is being bullied, support the child and address the bullying behavior:\n\n*   Listen and focus on the child.

Consider referring them to a school counselor, psychologist, or other mental health service.\n*   Give advice about what to do. This may involve role-playing and thinking through how the child might react if the bullying occurs again.\n*   Work together to resolve the situation and protect the bullied child.

Some examples are:\n\n*   Posting rumors on social media\n*   Sharing embarrassing pictures or videos online\n*   Sharing someone else's private information online (doxing)\n*   Making threats against someone online\n\n**How is Cyberbullying Different from Bullying?**\n\nCyberbullying is a type of bullying, but there are some differences between the two. Cyberbullying can be:\n\n*   Anonymous - people can hide their identities when they are online or using a cell phone\n*   Persistent - people can send messages instantly, at any time of the day or night\n*   Permanent - a lot of electronic communication is permanent and public, unless it's reported and removed\n\n**Which Children are More Likely to be Bullied?**\n\nChildren are more likely to be bullied if they:\n\n*   Are seen as different from their peers (e.g., being overweight or underweight, dressing differently, or being of a different race/ethnicity)\n*   Are seen as weak\n*   Have depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem\n*   Don't have many friends or are less popular\n*   Don't socialize well with others\n*   Have an intellectual or developmental disability\n\n**Which Children are More Likely to be Bullies?**\n\nThere are two types of children who are more likely to bully others:\n\n1.  **Children who are well-connected to peers**: have social power, are overly worried about popularity, and like to be in charge of others.\n2.  **Children who are more isolated from peers**: may be depressed or anxious, have low self-esteem, are easily pressured by peers, and have trouble understanding other people's feelings.\n\n**Factors that Make Someone More Likely to be a Bully**\n\nCertain factors make someone more likely to be a bully. They include:\n\n*   Being aggressive or easily frustrated\n*   Having trouble at home (e.g., violence or bullying in the home or having uninvolved parents)\n*   Having trouble following rules\n*   Seeing violence positively\n*   Having friends who bully others\n\n**Effects of Bullying**\n\nBullying is a serious problem that causes harm. And it doesn't just hurt the person who is being bullied; it can also be harmful for the bullies and for any kids who witness the bullying.\n\nKids who are bullied can have problems at school and with their mental and physical health. They are at risk for:\n\n*   Depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem\n*   Health complaints (e.g., headaches, stomachaches)\n*   Lower grades and test scores\n*   Missing or dropping out of school\n\nKids who bully others have a higher risk for substance use, problems in school, and violence later in life.\n\nKids who witness bullying are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol and have mental health problems. They may also miss or skip school.\n\n**Signs of Being Bullied**\n\nOften, kids who are being bullied don't report it. They may fear a backlash from the bully, or they may think that no one cares. Sometimes they feel too ashamed to talk about it.
