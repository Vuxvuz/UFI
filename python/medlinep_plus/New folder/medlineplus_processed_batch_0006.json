    "content": "**Acne - Self-Care**\n\nAcne is a skin condition that causes pimples or \"zits.\" Whiteheads (closed comedones), blackheads (open comedones), red, inflamed papules, and nodules or cysts may develop. These most often occur on the face, neck, upper trunk, and upper arms.\n\n**What Causes Acne?**\n\nAcne occurs when tiny pores on the surface of the skin become clogged. The pores can become plugged by substances on the surface of the skin. More commonly they develop from a mixture of the natural oils of the skin and the dead cells shed from the inside of the pore. These plugs are called comedones. Acne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne.\n\n**Acne Breakouts Can Be Triggered By:**\n\n* Hormonal changes\n* Use of oily skin or hair care products\n* Certain medicines\n* Sweat\n* Humidity\n* Diet\n\n**Daily Skin Care Tips:**\n\n1. Clean your skin gently with a mild, non-drying soap.\n2. Remove all dirt or makeup.\n3. Wash once or twice a day, and also after exercising.\n4. Avoid scrubbing or repeated, frequent skin washing.\n5. Shampoo your hair daily if it's oily.\n6. Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.\n7. Avoid using rubbing alcohol or toners that are very drying to the skin.\n8. Avoid oil-based cosmetics.\n\n**Acne Medicines:**\n\n* Can cause skin drying or peeling\n* Use a moisturizer or skin cream that is water-based or \"noncomedogenic\"\n* Avoid any product that makes your acne worse\n\n**Preventing Acne:**\n\n1. Don't aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub pimples.\n2. Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.\n3. Avoid touching your face.\n4. Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.\n5. Don't leave makeup on overnight.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor:**\n\n* Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine don't help after several months\n* Your acne is painful (e.g., you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts)\n* Your acne is getting worse\n* You develop scars as your acne clears up\n* Acne is causing emotional stress.\n\n---\n\n**Acne - Self-Care**\n\n\\n\\n**Daily Skin Care**\n\nTo keep your pores from clogging and your skin from becoming too oily:\n\n* Clean your skin gently with a mild, non-drying soap.\n* It may help to use a wash with salicylic acid or benzoyl if your skin is oily and prone to acne. Remove all dirt or make up.\n* Wash once or twice a day, and also after exercising. Avoid scrubbing or repeated, frequent skin washing.\n* Shampoo your hair daily, if it is oily.\n* Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.\n* Avoid using rubbing alcohol or toners that are very drying to the skin.\n* Avoid oil-based cosmetics.\n\n**Acne Medicines**\n\nIf daily skin care does not clear up blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin. These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, adapalene, resorcinol, or salicylic acid. They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.\n\nIf these acne medicines cause your skin to become irritated:\n\n* Try using smaller amounts. A drop the size of a pea will cover the entire face.\n* Use the medicines only every other or third day until your skin gets used to them.\n* Wait 10 to 15 minutes after washing your face before applying these medicines.\n\n**Treatments From Your Health Care Provider**\n\nIf pimples are still a problem after you've tried over-the-counter medicines, your health care provider may suggest:\n\n* Antibiotics in the form of pills or creams that you put on your skin\n* Prescription gels or creams containing a retinoid to help clear up the pimples\n* Hormone pills for women whose acne is made worse by hormonal changes\n* Isotretinoin pills for severe acne\n* A light based procedure called photodynamic therapy\n* Chemical peels\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider or your dermatologist if:\n\n* Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months.\n* Your acne is painful (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts).\n* Your acne is getting worse.\n* You develop scars as your acne clears up.\n* Acne is causing emotional stress.\n\n---\n\n**Acne - Self-Care**\n\n**Preventing Acne**\n\n*   Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.\n*   Avoid touching your face.\n*   Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.\n*   Do not leave makeup on overnight.\n\n**Minimizing Dairy and High Glycemic Index Foods**\n\n*   Minimizing dairy and high glycemic index foods may help decrease acne flares.\n\n**Using Acne Medicines**\n\n*   If daily skin care does not clear up blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.\n*   These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, adapalene, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.\n*   They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.\n*   They may cause redness or peeling of the skin.\n\n**Treating Irritated Skin**\n\n*   If these acne medicines cause your skin to become irritated:\n    *   Try using smaller amounts. A drop the size of a pea will cover the entire face.\n    *   Use the medicines only every other or third day until your skin gets used to them.\n    *   Wait 10 to 15 minutes after washing your face before applying these medicines.\n\n**Treatments From Your Health Care Provider**\n\n*   If pimples are still a problem after you've tried over-the-counter medicines, your health care provider may suggest:\n    *   Antibiotics in the form of pills or creams that you put on your skin\n    *   Prescription gels or creams containing a retinoid to help clear up the pimples\n    *   Hormone pills for women whose acne is made worse by hormonal changes\n    *   Isotretinoin pills for severe acne\n    *   A light-based procedure called photodynamic therapy\n    *   Chemical peels\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\n*   Contact your provider or your dermatologist if:\n    *   Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months.\n    *   Your acne is painful (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts).\n    *   Your acne is getting worse.\n    *   You develop scars as your acne clears up.\n    *   Acne is causing emotional stress.\n\n---\n\n**Self-Care for Acne**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diet and Acne**\n\nCan the right diet get rid of acne? The American Academy of Dermatology Association website suggests that a healthy diet may help prevent or reduce acne. However, more research is needed to confirm this relationship.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Acne**\n\nAcne vulgaris is a common skin condition characterized by inflamed pimples, particularly on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when hair follicles become clogged with dead skin cells and oil. According to Zaenglein et al., acne affects approximately 85% of adolescents and 50% of adults in the United States.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Acne**\n\nAcne is caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n*   **Hormonal fluctuations**: Changes in hormone levels during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can lead to acne.\n*   **Stress**: Stress can increase oil production and lead to clogged pores.\n*   **Diet**: A diet high in processed foods, sugar, and dairy products can contribute to acne.\n*   **Genetics**: Family history plays a role in the development of acne.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nWhile there is no cure for acne, various treatment options are available, including:\n\n*   **Topical retinoids**: Applying retinoid creams or gels to the skin can help prevent clogged pores.\n*   **Benzoyl peroxide**: Using benzoyl peroxide products can help kill bacteria that cause acne.\n*   **Hormonal treatments**: For women, hormonal treatments such as birth control pills may help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce acne symptoms.\n*   **Antibiotics**: In severe cases, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat bacterial infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent or reduce acne, consider the following self-care tips:\n\n*   **Maintain good hygiene**: Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser.\n*   **Use non-comedogenic products**: Choose products labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"oil-free\" to avoid clogged pores.\n*   **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods and limit processed and sugary foods.\n*   **Manage stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities like exercise, meditation, or deep breathing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAcne is a common skin condition that can be managed with self-care techniques and medical treatment. By understanding the causes of acne and implementing prevention strategies, you can reduce its severity and improve your overall skin health.",

    "content": "**Acne**\n\nAlso called: Pimples, Zits\n\n**What is Acne?**\n\nAcne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair follicles under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders.\n\n**Who Can Get Acne?**\n\nAnyone can get acne, but it is common in teenagers and young adults. It is not serious, but it can cause scars.\n\n**What Causes Acne?**\n\nNo one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes, such as those during the teenage years and pregnancy, probably play a role. There are many myths about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed, but there is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. Another common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however, blackheads and pimples are not caused by dirt. Stress doesn't cause acne, but stress can make it worse.\n\n**How to Prevent Acne**\n\nIf you have acne:\n\n* Clean your skin gently\n* Try not to touch your skin\n* Avoid the sun\n\n**Treatments for Acne**\n\nTreatments for acne include medicines and creams.\n\n**NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases**\n\n**Start Here**\n\n* Acne (American Academy of Family Physicians)\n* Acne (Acne Vulgaris) (VisualDX)\n* What Can I Do About Acne?

This is a treatment where a chemical that is activated by blue light is applied to the skin, followed by exposure to the light.\nYour provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.\n\nPeople who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin. You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.\n\nPregnant women should NOT take isotretinoin, because it causes severe birth defects.\n\nWomen taking isotretinoin must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.\nMen also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.\nYour provider will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, acne goes away after the teenage years, but it may last into middle age.

Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for wrinkles and skin cancer.\n\nMEDICINES FROM YOUR PROVIDER\n\nIf pimples are still a problem, your provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you.\n\nAntibiotics may help some people with acne:\n\nOral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin\n\nTopical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone\n\nCreams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:\n\nDerivatives of vitamin A such as retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, tazarotene)\n\nPrescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid\n\nTopical azelaic acid\n\nFor women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:\n\nA pill called spironolactone may help.\n\nBirth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.\n\nMinor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:\n\nPhotodynamic therapy may be used. This is a treatment where a chemical that is activated by blue light is applied to the skin, followed by exposure to the light.\n\nYour provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.\n\n---\n\n**Acne**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**SELF-CARE**\n\nSteps you can take to help your acne:\n\n*   Clean your skin gently with a mild, nondrying soap (such as Dove, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, CeraVe, or Basics).\n*   Look for water-based or \"noncomedogenic\" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne in most people.)\n*   Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.\n*   Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.\n*   Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.\n*   Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.\n\nWhat NOT to do:\n\n*   Try not to aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections, slower healing, and scarring.\n*   Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.\n*   Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers.\n*   Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.\n*   DO NOT leave make-up on overnight.\n\nIf these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.

You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.\n\nPregnant women should NOT take isotretinoin, because it causes severe birth defects.\n\nWomen taking isotretinoin must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.\nMen also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.\nYour provider will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**OUTLOOK (PROGNOSIS)**\n\nMost of the time, acne goes away after the teenage years, but it may last into middle age. The condition often responds well to treatment, but responses may take 6 to 8 weeks, and acne may flare up from time to time.\n\nScarring may occur if severe acne is not treated. Some people become very depressed if acne is not treated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months.\n*   Your acne is very bad (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts).\n*   Your acne is getting worse.\n*   You develop scars as your acne clears up.\n*   Acne is causing emotional stress.\n\nIf your baby has acne, contact the baby's provider if acne does not clear up on its own within 3 months.\n\n---\n\n**Acne**\n\nAcne does not clear up on its own within 3 months.\n\n*   **Contact your provider if:**\n    *   Your baby has acne, contact the baby's provider if acne does not clear up on its own within 3 months.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Acne vulgaris\n*   Cystic acne\n*   Pimples\n*   Zits\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Hair follicle sebaceous gland\n*   Baby acne\n*   Adult facial acne\n*   Acne - close-up of pustular lesions\n*   Blackheads (comedones)\n*   Acne - cystic on the chest\n*   Acne - cystic on the face\n*   Acne - vulgaris on the back\n*   Acne on the back\n\n**References**\n\n*   Dinulos JGH.

The tumor usually grows slowly.\n\n**Symptoms of acoustic neuroma**\n\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include:\n\n* Loss of hearing on one side\n* Ringing in ears\n* Dizziness and balance problems\n\nThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.\n\n**Diagnosing acoustic neuroma**\n\nAcoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems. Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have it.\n\n**Treatment options for acoustic neuroma**\n\nIf the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly. If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.\n\n**Related issues**\n\nIf the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n* NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders\n* Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma) and Neurofibromatosis  (National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders)\n* What Is Acoustic Neuroma?

Because the tumor grows so slowly, symptoms most often start after age 30.\n\n* Common symptoms include:\n\t+ Abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo)\n\t+ Hearing loss in the affected ear that makes it hard to hear conversations\n\t+ Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear\n* Less common symptoms include:\n\t+ Difficulty understanding speech\n\t+ Dizziness\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Loss of balance\n\t+ Numbness in the face or one ear\n\t+ Pain in the face or one ear\n\t+ Weakness of the face or facial asymmetry\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider may suspect an acoustic neuroma based on your medical history, an exam of your nervous system, or tests.\n\n* Often, the physical exam is normal when the tumor is diagnosed. Sometimes, the following signs may be present:\n\t+ Decreased feeling on one side of the face\n\t+ Drooping on one side of the face\n\t+ Unsteady walk\n* The most useful test to identify an acoustic neuroma is an MRI of the brain. Other tests to diagnose the tumor and tell it apart from other causes of dizziness or vertigo include:\n\t+ Hearing test\n\t+ Test of equilibrium and balance (electronystagmography)\n\t+ Test of hearing and brainstem function (brainstem auditory evoked response)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the size and location of the tumor, your age, and your overall health. You and your provider must decide whether to watch the tumor without treatment, use radiation treatment to stop it from growing, or try to remove it.\n\n* Many acoustic neuromas are small and grow very slowly. Small tumors with few or no symptoms may be watched for changes, especially in older people. Regular MRI scans will be done.\n* If not treated, some acoustic neuromas can:\n\t+ Damage the nerves involved in hearing and balance\n\t+ Place pressure on nearby brain tissue\n\t+ Harm the nerves responsible for movement and feeling in the face\n\t+ Lead to a buildup of fluid (hydrocephalus) in the brain (with very large tumors)\n\n**Removing an Acoustic Neuroma**\n\nRemoving an acoustic neuroma is more commonly done for:\n\n* Larger tumors\n* Tumors that are causing symptoms\n* Tumors that are growing quickly\n* Tumors that are pressing on the brain\n\nSurgery or a type of radiation treatment is done to remove the tumor and prevent other nerve damage. Depending on the type of surgery performed, hearing can sometimes be preserved.\n\nThe surgical technique to remove an acoustic neuroma is called microsurgery. A special microscope and small, precise instruments are used. This technique offers a higher chance of cure.\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area. It is a form of radiation therapy, not a surgical procedure. It may be used to slow down or stop the growth of tumors that are hard to remove with surgery. It may also be done to treat people who are unable to have surgery, such as older adults or people who are very sick.\n\nRemoving an acoustic neuroma can damage the acoustic or other nerves. This may cause loss of hearing or weakness in the face muscles. This damage is more likely to occur when the tumor is large.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAn acoustic neuroma is not cancer. The tumor does not spread to other parts of the body. However, it may continue to grow and press on structures in the skull.\n\nPeople with small, slow-growing tumors may not need treatment.\n\nHearing loss present before treatment is not likely to return after surgery or radiosurgery. In cases of smaller tumors, hearing loss that occurs after surgery may return.\n\nMost people with small tumors will have no permanent weakness of the face after surgery. However, people with large tumors are more likely to have some permanent weakness of the face after surgery.\n\nSigns of nerve damage such as loss of hearing or weakness of the face may be delayed after radiosurgery.\n\nIn most cases, brain surgery can completely remove the tumor.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Hearing loss that is sudden or getting worse\n* Ringing in one ear\n* Dizziness (vertigo)\n\n---\n\n**Acoustic Neuroma**\n\nAn acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing tumor of the nerve that connects the ear to the brain.

It is usually located near the auditory nerve and can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear, and balance problems.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of acoustic neuroma is unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are more likely to develop acoustic neuroma. Other risk factors include age, with most cases occurring in people over 50.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of acoustic neuroma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   Hearing loss or ringing in one ear\n*   Dizziness (vertigo)\n*   Loss of balance\n*   Weakness or numbness in the face\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing acoustic neuroma typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans, and auditory testing. A diagnosis is usually made when a tumor is detected on an imaging test.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for acoustic neuroma depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment options include:\n\n*   Watching the tumor without treatment (for small, slow-growing tumors)\n*   Radiation therapy to stop the growth of the tumor\n*   Surgery to remove the tumor\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook for acoustic neuroma is generally good, especially if the tumor is small and slow-growing. In most cases, brain surgery can completely remove the tumor. However, there is a risk of nerve damage, which may cause loss of hearing or weakness in the face muscles.\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n*   Hearing loss that is sudden or getting worse\n*   Ringing in one ear\n*   Dizziness (vertigo)\n\nEarly detection and treatment can help improve outcomes for people with acoustic neuroma.\n\n---\n\n**Acoustic Neuroma**\n\n**Contact Your Provider If You Have:**\n\n*   Hearing loss that is sudden or getting worse\n*   Ringing in one ear\n*   Dizziness (vertigo)\n\n**Alternative Names:**\n\n*   Vestibular schwannoma\n*   Tumor - acoustic\n*   Cerebellopontine angle tumor\n*   Angle tumor\n*   Hearing loss - acoustic\n*   Tinnitus - acoustic\n\n**Patient Instructions:**\n\n*   Brain surgery - discharge\n*   Stereotactic radiosurgery - discharge\n\n**Images:**\n\n*   Central nervous system and peripheral nervous system\n\n**References:**\n\n*   Arriaga MA, Brackmann DE.

    "content": "**Acrocallosal Syndrome**\n\n_A rare condition characterized by a brain abnormality, extra fingers and toes, and distinctive facial features._\n\n**Description**\n\nAcrocallosal syndrome is a rare condition that presents at birth. Its severity varies widely among affected individuals.\n\n*   **Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum**: The corpus callosum fails to form normally during early development.\n*   **Brain Abnormalities**: Large cysts in brain tissue have been reported in people with acrocallosal syndrome.\n*   **Delayed Development and Intellectual Disability**: Moderate to severe intellectual disability is common, along with delayed development.\n*   **Seizures**: Some affected individuals experience seizures.\n\n**Polydactyly**\n\nExtra fingers and toes are common in people with acrocallosal syndrome. The extra digits can be:\n\n*   **Postaxial Polydactyly**: On the same side of the hand or foot as the pinky or little toe.\n*   **Preaxial Polydactyly**: On the same side as the thumb or great toe.\n*   **Syndactyly**: Webbed or fused skin between the fingers or toes.\n\n**Distinctive Facial Features**\n\nAffected individuals may have:\n\n*   **Hypertelorism**: Widely spaced eyes\n*   **High, Prominent Forehead**\n*   **Macrocephaly**: Unusually large head size\n\n---\n\n**Acrocallosal Syndrome**\n\n**What is Acrocallosal Syndrome?**\n\nAcrocallosal syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a brain abnormality called agenesis of the corpus callosum, the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), and distinctive facial features. The signs and symptoms of this disorder are present at birth, and their severity varies widely among affected individuals.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Agenesis of the corpus callosum: a brain abnormality where the tissue that connects the left and right halves of the brain fails to form normally during development before birth.\n* Polydactyly: extra fingers and toes, which can be on the same side as the pinky or little toe (postaxial polydactyly) or on the same side as the thumb or great toe (preaxial polydactyly).\n* Distinctive facial features:\n\t+ Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)\n\t+ High, prominent forehead\n\t+ Unusually large head size (macrocephaly)\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the KIF7 gene have been found to cause acrocallosal syndrome. Mutations in another gene, GLI3, can also cause features of this disorder. However, the signs and symptoms overlap significantly with those of a similar disorder called Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (which is also caused by GLI3 gene mutations), so acrocallosal syndrome resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is sometimes considered a severe form of that condition.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nWhen acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations, and the parents typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nAcrocallosal syndrome resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant. This means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThis condition appears to be rare, with only a few dozen cases reported in the medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**Acrocallosal Syndrome**\n\n**What is Acrocallosal Syndrome?**\n\nAcrocallosal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of polydactyly (extra fingers or toes) and an abnormality in the corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres.\n\n**Causes of Acrocallosal Syndrome**\n\nThe causes of acrocallosal syndrome are genetic mutations that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nWhen acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\nAcrocallosal syndrome resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.\n\n**Other Names for Acrocallosal Syndrome**\n\n* ACLS Hallux duplication, postaxial polydactyly, and absence of corpus callosum\n* Schinzel acrocallosal syndrome\n* Schinzel syndrome 1\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Acrocallosal syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Acrocallosal syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ACROCALLOSAL SYNDROME; ACLS\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Courtens W, Vamos E, Christophe C, Schinzel A.

It is caused when the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces too much GH.\n\n**Causes of Acromegaly**\n\nThe causes of acromegaly are as follows:\n\n*   A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH.\n*   In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited.\n*   In children, excessive GH production leads to gigantism rather than acromegaly.\n\n**Symptoms of Acromegaly**\n\nThe symptoms of acromegaly may include:\n\n*   Body odor\n*   Blood in the stool\n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome\n*   Decreased muscle strength (weakness)\n*   Decreased peripheral vision\n*   Dental problems, gaps between the teeth\n*   Easy fatigue\n*   Enlarged tongue\n*   Excessive height (when excess GH production begins in childhood)\n*   Excessive sweating\n*   Headache\n*   Heart enlargement, which can cause fainting or shortness of breath\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Jaw pain\n*   Joint pain, limited joint movement, swelling of the bony areas around a joint\n*   Large bones of the face, large jaw and tongue, widely spaced teeth\n*   Large feet (change in shoe size), large hands (change in ring or glove size)\n*   Large glands in the skin (sebaceous glands) causing oily skin, thickening of the skin, skin tags (growths)\n*   Sleep apnea\n*   Widened fingers or toes, with swelling, redness, and pain\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose acromegaly, your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly and check for complications:\n\n*   Blood glucose\n*   Growth hormone\n*   Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)\n*   Prolactin\n*   Spine x-ray\n*   MRI of the brain, including the pituitary gland\n*   Echocardiogram\n*   Colonoscopy\n*   Sleep study\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nAcromegaly cannot be prevented. Early treatment may prevent the disease from getting worse and help avoid complications. Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, medicines that block GH production or its effects in the body, and radiation therapy (radiotherapy). After treatment, regular evaluations with your healthcare provider are necessary to ensure the pituitary gland is working normally and acromegaly does not return.\n\n---\n\n**Acromegaly**\n\n**What is Acromegaly?**\n\nAcromegaly is a rare disorder that occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH). This excess of GH leads to an overgrowth of bones and tissues, causing various symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms of Acromegaly**\n\nThe symptoms of acromegaly can vary from person to person but may include:\n\n* Enlarged hands and feet\n* Joint pain and stiffness\n* Sleep apnea\n* High blood pressure\n* Diabetes\n* Heart disease\n\n**Diagnosing Acromegaly**\n\nTo diagnose acromegaly, your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. They may also order the following tests:\n\n* Spine x-ray\n* MRI of the brain, including the pituitary gland\n* Echocardiogram\n* Colonoscopy\n* Sleep study\n\nOther tests may be ordered to check whether the rest of the pituitary gland is working normally.\n\n**Treatment of Acromegaly**\n\nThe treatment of acromegaly depends on the size and type of the tumor. Surgery to remove the pituitary tumor that is causing this condition often corrects the abnormal GH. Sometimes, the tumor is too large to be removed completely and acromegaly is not cured. In this case, medicines and radiation (radiotherapy) may be used to treat acromegaly.\n\nSome people with tumors that are too complicated to remove by surgery are treated with medicines instead of surgery. These medicines may block the production of GH from the pituitary gland or prevent the action of GH in other parts of the body.\n\nAfter treatment, you will need to see your provider regularly to make sure that the pituitary gland is working normally and that acromegaly does not come back. Yearly evaluations are usually recommended.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with acromegaly and their families can be found at:\n\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/acromegaly\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/acromegaly/\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPituitary surgery is successful in most people, depending on the size of the tumor and the experience of the neurosurgeon with pituitary tumors.\n\nWithout treatment, the symptoms will get worse. Conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease may result.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have symptoms of acromegaly\n* Your symptoms do not improve with treatment\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAcromegaly cannot be prevented. Early treatment may prevent the disease from getting worse and help to avoid complications.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSomatotroph adenoma; Growth hormone excess; Growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma; Pituitary giant (in childhood)\n\n**References**\n\nBiondi B.

These facial differences become less apparent in adulthood.\n\n**Skeletal and Joint Problems**\n\nNewborns with acromicric dysplasia are of normal size, but slow growth over time results in short stature. The average height of adults with this disorder is about 4 feet, 2 inches for women and 4 feet, 5 inches for men. The long bones of the arms and legs, and the bones in the hands and feet, are shorter than would be expected for the individual's height. Other skeletal features that occur in this disorder include slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age), abnormally shaped bones of the spine (vertebrae), and constrained movement of joints.\n\n**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**\n\nAffected individuals often develop carpal tunnel syndrome, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers.\n\n**Hip Dysplasia**\n\nA misalignment of the hip joints (hip dysplasia) can also occur in this disorder. These skeletal and joint problems may require treatment, but most affected individuals have few limitations in their activities.\n\n**Intelligence and Life Expectancy**\n\nIntelligence is unaffected in this disorder, and life expectancy is generally normal.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAcromicric dysplasia is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAcromicric dysplasia is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a large protein called fibrillin-1. This protein is transported out of cells into the extracellular matrix, where it forms threadlike filaments called microfibrils. The microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissues.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nAcromicric dysplasia is an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n\n---\n\n**Acromicric Dysplasia**\n\n**What is Acromicric Dysplasia?**\n\nAcromicric dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, joint problems, and other skeletal abnormalities.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/actin-accumulation-myopathy/",
    "content": "**Actin-accumulation myopathy**\n\nActin-accumulation myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with actin-accumulation myopathy have severe muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nSigns and symptoms of this condition are apparent in infancy and include:\n\n*   Feeding and swallowing difficulties\n*   A weak cry\n*   Difficulty with controlling head movements\n\nAffected babies are sometimes described as \"floppy\" and may be unable to move on their own.\n\nThe severe muscle weakness that occurs in actin-accumulation myopathy also affects the muscles used for breathing. Individuals with this disorder may take shallow breaths (hypoventilate), especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. Frequent respiratory infections and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur.\n\nBecause of the respiratory problems, most affected individuals do not survive past infancy. Those who do survive have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, standing, and walking.\n\n**Name origin**\n\nThe name actin-accumulation myopathy derives from characteristic accumulations in muscle cells of filaments composed of a protein called actin. These filaments can be seen when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nActin-accumulation myopathy is a rare disorder that has been identified in only a small number of individuals. Its exact prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nActin-accumulation myopathy is caused by a mutation in the ACTA1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha (α)-actin, which is a member of the actin protein family found in skeletal muscles. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction).\n\n---\n\n**Actin-accumulation myopathy**\n\n**Causes**\n\nActin-accumulation myopathy is caused by a mutation in the ACTA1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha (α)-actin, which is a member of the actin protein family found in skeletal muscles.\n\n**How it works**\n\nThin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction. Attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nACTA1 gene mutations that cause actin-accumulation myopathy may affect the way the skeletal α-actin protein binds to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities, and is important in the formation of thin filaments from individual actin molecules. Dysfunctional actin-ATP binding may result in abnormal thin filament formation and impair muscle contraction, leading to muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of actin-accumulation myopathy.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nActin-accumulation myopathy is an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases are not inherited; they result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other names**\n\nActin filament aggregate myopathy\nActin myopathy\nCongenital myopathy with excess of thin filaments\nNemaline myopathy 3\n\n**Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Actin accumulation myopathy\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CONGENITAL MYOPATHY 2A, TYPICAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; CMYO2A\n\n---\n\n**Actin-accumulation myopathy**\n\n**National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   CONGENITAL MYOPATHY 2A, TYPICAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; CMYO2A\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   Genetic Testing Information\n        +   Genetic Testing Registry: Actin accumulation myopathy\n    *   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n        +   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n    *   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n        +   CONGENITAL MYOPATHY 2A, TYPICAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; CMYO2A\n    *   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n        +   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bornemann A, Petersen MB, Schmalbruch H.

    "content": "**Action Myoclonus–Renal Failure Syndrome**\n\n**What is Action Myoclonus–Renal Failure Syndrome?**\n\nAction myoclonus–renal failure syndrome causes episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) and, often, kidney (renal) disease. Although the condition name refers to kidney disease, not everyone with the condition has problems with kidney function.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe movement problems associated with AMRF syndrome typically begin with involuntary rhythmic shaking (tremor) in the fingers and hands that occurs at rest and is most noticeable when trying to make small movements, such as writing. Over time, tremors can affect other parts of the body, such as the head, torso, legs, and tongue.\n\nEventually, the tremors worsen to become myoclonic jerks, which can be triggered by voluntary movements or the intention to move (action myoclonus). These myoclonic jerks typically occur in the torso; upper and lower limbs; and face, particularly the muscles around the mouth and the eyelids.\n\nAnxiety, excitement, stress, or extreme tiredness (fatigue) can worsen the myoclonus. Some affected individuals develop seizures, a loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), or hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). Severe seizures or myoclonus can be life-threatening.\n\n**Kidney Problems**\n\nWhen kidney problems occur, an early sign is excess protein in the urine (proteinuria). Kidney function worsens over time, until the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively (end-stage renal disease).\n\n**Age of Onset and Course of the Condition**\n\nAMRF syndrome typically begins causing symptoms between ages 15 and 25, but it can appear at younger or older ages. The age of onset and the course of the condition vary, even among members of the same family. Either the movement problems or kidney disease can occur first, or they can begin at the same time.\n\nMost people survive 7 to 15 years after the symptoms appear.\n\n---\n\n**Action Myoclonus–Renal Failure Syndrome**\n\n**What is Action Myoclonus–Renal Failure Syndrome?**\n\nAction myoclonus–renal failure (AMRF) syndrome causes episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) and, often, kidney (renal) disease.

Most people survive 7 to 15 years after the symptoms appear.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAMRF syndrome is a rare condition that has been found worldwide. Its exact prevalence is unknown. At least 38 individuals with the condition have been described in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAMRF syndrome is caused by mutations in the SCARB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the LIMP-2 protein, which transports an enzyme called beta-glucocerebrosidase to cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are specialized compartments that digest and recycle materials. In these compartments, beta-glucocerebrosidase breaks down a fatty substance called glucocerebroside.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Action Myoclonus-Renal Failure Syndrome**\n\nThis rare genetic disorder is characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy, renal failure, and other systemic features.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAction myoclonus-renal failure syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

There is little evidence for other uses.\n\nCharcoal is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum. Activated charcoal is made by heating charcoal in the presence of a gas. This process causes the charcoal to develop lots of internal spaces or pores. These pores help activated charcoal trap chemicals.\n\nActivated charcoal is commonly used to treat poisoning. It is also used for high cholesterol, hangovers, and upset stomach, but there is no strong scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for ACTIVATED CHARCOAL are as follows:\n\nPossibly effective for...\n\n* Poisoning. Taking activated charcoal by mouth is useful for trapping drugs and other types of chemicals to stop poisoning. It should be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider along with standard treatments for poisoning.\n* There is interest in using activated charcoal for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Activated charcoal is likely safe when used short-term. Taking activated charcoal long-term is possibly safe. Common side effects include constipation and black stools.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Activated charcoal is likely safe for most adults when applied to wounds.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Activated charcoal is possibly safe when used short-term when pregnant or breast-feeding. Consult with your healthcare provider before using it.\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) blockage or slow movement of food through the intestine: Don't use activated charcoal if you have any kind of intestinal blockage. Also, if you have a condition that slows the passage of food through the intestine, speak with a healthcare professional before using activated charcoal.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nModerate\n\n* Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Alcohol (Ethanol): Taking alcohol with activated charcoal might decrease how well activated charcoal works to prevent poison absorption.\n\t+ Birth control pills (Contraceptive drugs): Activated charcoal reduces absorption of substances in the stomach and intestines. Taking activated charcoal along with birth control pills can decrease how much of the birth control pills the body absorbs. This can decrease the effects of birth control pills. To prevent this interaction, take activated charcoal at least 3 hours after or 12 hours before birth control pills.\n\t+ Medications taken by mouth (Oral drugs): Activated charcoal reduces absorption of drugs and other chemicals in the stomach and intestines. Taking activated charcoal along with medications taken by mouth can decrease how much medicine the body absorbs. This can decrease the effects of your medication. To prevent this interaction, take activated charcoal at least one hour after medications you take by mouth.\n\t+ Syrup of ipecac: Activated charcoal can bind syrup of ipecac in the stomach. This decreases the effects of syrup of ipecac.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with herbs and supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nDrinking alcohol might make activated charcoal less effective in trapping poisons and other chemicals.\n\n---\n\n**Activated Charcoal: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nDrinking alcohol might make activated charcoal less effective in trapping poisons and other chemicals. Also, keep in mind that activated charcoal can make it more difficult for the body to absorb micronutrients.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nIn foods, activated charcoal is increasingly used as a black food coloring.\n\nAs medicine, activated charcoal has most often been used under the supervision of a healthcare professional in a single dose of 100 grams by mouth.

    "content": "**Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome (also known as APDS) is a disorder that impairs the immune system. Individuals with this condition often have low numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), particularly B cells and T cells.\n\n**Description**\n\nNormally, these cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The severity of activated PI3K-delta syndrome varies widely. Some people may have multiple, severe infections while others show mild symptoms to none at all.\n\nMost commonly, people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome develop recurrent infections that begin in childhood, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Over time, recurrent respiratory tract infections can lead to a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi) and can cause breathing problems.\n\nPeople with activated PI3K-delta syndrome may also have chronic active viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, or cytomegalovirus infections. Another possible feature of activated PI3K-delta syndrome is abnormal clumping of white blood cells. These clumps can lead to enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly).\n\nThe white blood cells can also build up to form solid masses (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia), usually in the moist lining of the airways or intestines. While nodular lymphoid hyperplasia is not cancerous (benign), activated PI3K-delta syndrome increases the risk of developing forms of blood cancer called Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nSome people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome develop autoimmunity, which occurs when the body attacks its own tissues and organs by mistake.\n\n---\n\n**Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\n**What is Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome?**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome is a rare disorder that impairs the immune system. Individuals with this condition often have low numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), particularly B cells and T cells.\n\n**Causes of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the PIK3CD gene and the PIK3R1 gene. There are two types of activated PI3K-delta syndrome, each with different genetic causes:\n\n*   **Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome Type 1**: Caused by variants in the PIK3CD gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called p110 delta (p110δ).\n*   **Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome Type 2**: Caused by variants in the PIK3R1 gene, which provides instructions for making slightly different versions of another protein; the most common version is called p85 alpha (p85α).\n\n**Symptoms of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nMost commonly, people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome develop recurrent infections that begin in childhood, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Over time, recurrent respiratory tract infections can lead to a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi) and can cause breathing problems.\n\n**Complications of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nSome people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome develop autoimmunity, which occurs when the body attacks its own tissues and organs by mistake. There are two types of activated PI3K-delta syndrome, each with different genetic causes.\n\n**Frequency of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome is considered a rare disorder, but its exact prevalence is unknown.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nThere is no cure for activated PI3K-delta syndrome, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include antibiotics to prevent infections, antiviral medications to treat chronic viral infections, and immunoglobulin therapy to replace missing antibodies.\n\n**Prognosis of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with activated PI3K-delta syndrome varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with this condition can lead normal lives, but recurrent infections and other complications can significantly impact quality of life.\n\n---\n\n**Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome**\n\n**What is Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome?**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes. These mutations lead to the production of an altered p110δ protein, resulting in overactive PI3K-delta signaling.\n\n**How Does Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome Affect the Body?**\n\nOveractive PI3K-delta signaling alters the differentiation of B cells and T cells, producing cells that cannot respond to infections and die earlier than usual. This makes it difficult for people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome to fight off bacterial and viral infections.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome?**\n\nSymptoms may include recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. In some cases, an increase in B cell proliferation may contribute to the development of lymphoma.\n\n**How Is Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome Inherited?**\n\nActivated PI3K-delta syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAPDS Immunodeficiency 14 Immunodeficiency 36 P110δ-activating mutation causing senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy, and immunodeficiency PASLI\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Immunodeficiency 14 Genetic Testing Registry: Immunodeficiency 36 Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Activated PI3K-delta syndrome Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: IMMUNODEFICIENCY 36 WITH LYMPHOPROLIFERATION; IMD36 IMMUNODEFICIENCY 14A WITH LYMPHOPROLIFERATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; IMD14A Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAngulo I, Vadas O, Garcon F, et al.

    "content": "**Acute Bronchitis**\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness.\n\nThere are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.\n\nThe same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nTreatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Bronchitis**\n\n**Symptoms and Treatment**\n\nIf you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe medication such as cough syrup containing **codeine** or **hydrocodone** for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose acute bronchitis, your doctor may perform an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test or a Chest X-ray. These tests can help determine the severity of the condition and rule out other underlying conditions.\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nAcute bronchitis is contagious, so it's essential to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently, especially during cold and flu season. You can also take steps to reduce your risk of developing acute bronchitis by avoiding smoking, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest.\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nIn addition to medication, there are several treatments and therapies that may help alleviate symptoms of acute bronchitis. These include:\n\n*   **Bronchodilators**: Medications that help open up the airways and make it easier to breathe.\n*   **Expectorants**: Medications that help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs.\n*   **Humidifiers**: Devices that add moisture to the air, which can help soothe a sore throat and cough.\n*   **Steam inhalation**: Breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam inhaler can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nThere are ongoing clinical trials studying various treatments for acute bronchitis. Some examples include:\n\n*   **Bronchodilators**: Researchers are investigating the effectiveness of different bronchodilator medications in relieving symptoms of acute bronchitis.\n*   **Antibiotics**: Scientists are exploring the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial acute bronchitis.\n*   **Vaccines**: Researchers are working on developing vaccines to prevent respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent journal articles have shed light on various aspects of acute bronchitis. Some examples include:\n\n*   **Long-term pulmonary sequelae 5-14 years after protracted bacterial bronchitis in early childhood**: A study examining the long-term effects of bacterial acute bronchitis in children.\n*   **Clinical features and risk factors of adenovirus-related plastic bronchitis in children**: Research on the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with adenovirus-related plastic bronchitis in children.\n*   **Clinical research on modified postural drainage for secretion clearance in infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection**: A study investigating the effectiveness of modified postural drainage in clearing secretions from infants with RSV infection.\n\n**Reference Desk**\n\nTo better understand acute bronchitis, it's helpful to know some basic anatomy and physiology. Here are a few key concepts:\n\n*   **Bronchi**: The airways that lead to the lungs.\n*   **Lungs**: The organs responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide through respiration.\n*   **Respiratory system**: The network of organs and tissues involved in breathing.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nIf you're seeking expert advice on acute bronchitis, consider consulting with a healthcare professional or a pulmonologist. They can provide personalized guidance and treatment recommendations based on your specific needs.\n\n**Children**\n\nAcute bronchitis can affect children as well as adults.

They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\n\n**What is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?**\n\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of acute leukemia. It's also called ALL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \"Acute\" means that it usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults.\n\nIn ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. These cells normally help your body fight infection. But in ALL, they are abnormal and cannot fight infection very well. They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord.\n\n**What causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?**\n\nALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells.

It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\n**What is leukemia?**\n\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. It starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\n\n* White blood cells help your body fight infection\n* Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\n* Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding\n\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells.\n\n**What is acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of acute leukemia. \"Acute\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. In AML, the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.\n\n**What causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?**\n\nAML happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\n\n**Who is at risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?**\n\nThe factors that raise your risk of AML include:\n\n* Being male\n* Smoking, especially after age 60\n* Having had chemotherapy or radiation therapy\n* Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a child\n* Exposure to the chemical benzene\n* A history of another blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome\n\n**What are the symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of AML include:\n\n* Fever\n* Shortness of breath\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\n* Weakness or feeling tired\n* Weight loss or loss of appetite\n* Bone or joint pain, if the abnormal cells build up near or inside the bones\n\n**How is acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose AML and figure out which subtype you have:\n\n* A physical exam\n* A medical history\n* Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear\n* Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone.\n* Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\n\nIf you are diagnosed with AML, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread.\n\n**What are the treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?**\n\nTreatments for AML include:\n\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\n* Other anticancer medicines\n\nWhich treatment you get often depends on which subtype of AML you have.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose AML, doctors perform a physical exam, take a complete medical history, and order various tests, including:\n\n* Blood count tests to check for abnormal white blood cells\n* Bone marrow biopsy to examine the bone marrow for cancer cells\n* Lumbar puncture to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\n\n**Treatments and Therapies**\n\nTreatment for AML usually involves two phases: induction therapy, which aims to kill leukemia cells in the bone marrow and blood; and consolidation therapy, which aims to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells.\n\nSome common treatments for AML include:\n\n* Blood transfusions to increase red blood cell count\n* Bone marrow transplantation to replace damaged bone marrow with healthy functioning bone marrow\n* Immunotherapy to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells\n* Integrative medicine and complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and meditation, to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life\n\n**Genetics**\n\nResearch has identified several genetic mutations associated with AML, including:\n\n* 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome: a rare genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing AML\n* Acute promyelocytic leukemia: a type of AML caused by a specific genetic mutation\n* Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia: a subtype of AML characterized by a specific genetic mutation\n* Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: a subtype of AML without any visible chromosomal abnormalities\n* Familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA: a rare genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing AML\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, AML is a relatively rare type of cancer, accounting for about 1.5% of all new cancer cases in the United States.\n\nThe American Cancer Society reports that the five-year survival rate for patients with AML is approximately 27%.\n\nResearchers are continually working to improve our understanding of AML and develop more effective treatments. Some recent studies have explored the use of PD-1 inhibitors, molecular monitoring, and safety profiles of new medications.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nFor patients with AML, clinical trials offer a chance to participate in cutting-edge research and potentially access new, experimental treatments.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains a database of ongoing clinical trials for AML, which can be searched by location or specific treatment.\n\nPatients considering participation in a clinical trial should discuss the potential benefits and risks with their healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\n**What is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells, which crowd out healthy cells in the bone marrow.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of AML is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain risk factors may increase the likelihood of developing AML, including:\n\n* Age: AML is more common among older adults\n* Exposure to radiation or chemicals\n* Family history of AML\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of AML can vary depending on the individual, but may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n* Loss of appetite\n* Pale skin\n* Easy bruising or bleeding\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing AML typically involves a combination of the following tests:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Flow cytometry\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for AML usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or bone marrow transplantation. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer cells and restore healthy blood cell production.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with AML varies depending on factors such as age, overall health, and response to treatment. In general, the outlook for AML patients is poor, but advances in treatment have improved survival rates.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\n* Childhood Leukemia\n* Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n* Chronic Myeloid Leukemia\n* Leukemia\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Acute Myeloid Leukemia is the National Cancer Institute.",

    "content": "**Acute Adrenal Crisis**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThe adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion called the cortex, and an inner portion called the medulla.\n\nThe cortex produces 3 hormones:\n\n*   **Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol)**: maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress.\n*   **Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone)**: regulate sodium, water and potassium balance.\n*   **Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female)**: affect sexual development and sex drive.\n\nThe medulla produces the hormone adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Both cortisol and adrenaline are released in response to stress.\n\nCortisol production is regulated by the pituitary. This is a small gland just underneath the brain. The pituitary releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol.\n\nAdrenal crisis can occur from any of the following:\n\n*   **The adrenal gland is damaged** due to, for example, Addison disease or other adrenal gland disease, or surgery\n*   **The pituitary is injured and cannot release ACTH (hypopituitarism)**\n*   **Adrenal insufficiency is not properly treated**\n*   **You've been taking glucocorticoid medicines for a long time, and suddenly stop**\n*   **You've become very dehydrated**\n*   **Infection or other physical stress**\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms and signs of adrenal crisis can include any of the following:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain or flank pain**\n*   **Confusion, loss of consciousness, or coma**\n*   **Dehydration**\n*   **Dizziness or lightheadedness**\n*   **Fatigue, severe weakness**\n*   **Headache**\n*   **High fever**\n*   **Loss of appetite**\n*   **Low blood pressure**\n*   **Low blood sugar**\n*   **Nausea, vomiting**\n*   **Rapid heart rate**\n*   **Rapid respiratory rate**\n*   **Slow, sluggish movement**\n*   **Unusual and excessive sweating on face or palms**\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be ordered to help diagnose acute adrenal crisis include:\n\n*   **ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test**\n*   **Cortisol level**\n*   **Blood sugar**\n*   **Potassium level**\n*   **Sodium level**\n*   **Blood pH level**\n*   **Thyroid hormone level**\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nAdrenal crisis is a medical emergency.

    "content": "**Acute Arterial Occlusion - Kidney**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe kidneys need a good blood supply. The main artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Reduced blood flow through the renal artery can hurt kidney function. A complete blockage of blood flow to the kidney can often result in permanent kidney failure.\n\nAcute arterial occlusion of the renal artery can occur after injury or trauma to the abdomen, side, or back. Blood clots that travel through the bloodstream (emboli) can lodge in the renal artery. Pieces of plaque from the walls of the arteries can come loose (on their own or during a medical procedure that affects an artery). This debris can block the main kidney artery or one of the smaller vessels.\n\nThe risk of renal artery blockages increases in people who have certain heart disorders, which make them likely to form blood clots. These include mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation.\n\nA narrowing of the renal artery is called renal artery stenosis. This condition increases the risk of a sudden blockage.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not have symptoms when one kidney does not function because the second kidney can filter the blood. However, high blood pressure (hypertension) may come on suddenly and be difficult to control.\n\nIf your other kidney is not working fully, blockage of the renal artery may cause symptoms of acute kidney failure. Other symptoms of acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery include:\n\n* Abdominal pain\n* Abrupt decrease in urine output\n* Back pain\n* Blood in the urine\n* Flank pain or pain in the side\n* Symptoms of high blood pressure such as headache, change in vision, and swelling\n\nNote: There may be no pain. Pain, if it is present, most often develops suddenly.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will not be able to identify the problem with just an exam unless you have developed kidney failure.\n\nTests you may need include:\n\n* Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of the renal arteries to test blood flow\n* MRI of the kidney arteries, which can show a lack of blood flow to the affected kidney\n* Renal arteriography shows the exact location of the blockage\n* Ultrasound of the kidney to check kidney size\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome people do not need treatment. Blood clots may get better on their own over time.\n\nYou may have treatment to open the artery if the blockage is discovered quickly or it is affecting your only working kidney. Treatment to open the artery may include:\n\n* Clot-dissolving medicines (thrombolytics)\n* Medicines that prevent the blood from clotting (anticoagulants), such as warfarin (Coumadin)\n* Surgical repair of the renal artery\n* Insertion of a tube (catheter) into the renal artery to open the blockage\n\nYou may need temporary dialysis to treat acute kidney failure. Medicines to lower cholesterol may be needed if the blockage is due to clots from plaque buildup in the arteries.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDamage caused by arterial occlusion may go away. However, in most cases, it is permanent.\n\nIf only one kidney is affected, the healthy kidney may take over filtering the blood and producing urine. If you have only one working kidney, arterial occlusion leads to acute kidney failure. This can develop into chronic kidney disease or failure.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Acute kidney failure\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* High blood pressure\n* Malignant hypertension\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You stop producing urine\n* You feel sudden, severe pain in the back, flank, or abdomen\n\nGet emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of arterial occlusion and have only one working kidney.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIn many cases, the disorder is not preventable. The most important way to reduce your risk is to stop smoking.\n\nPeople at risk for developing blood clots may need to take anti-clotting medicines.

This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n**Symptoms of Acute Bronchitis**\n\nSome symptoms of acute bronchitis are:\n\n* Chest discomfort\n* Cough that produces mucus - the mucus may be clear or yellow-green\n* Fatigue\n* Fever - usually low-grade\n* Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity\n* Wheezing, in people with asthma\n\nEven after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lasts for 1 to 4 weeks.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will listen to the breathing sounds in your lungs with a stethoscope. Your breathing may sound abnormal or rough.\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Chest x-ray, if your provider suspects pneumonia\n* Pulse oximetry, a painless test that helps determine the amount of oxygen in your blood by using a device placed on the end of your finger\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week, though a mild cough may persist for up to 3 weeks. Doing these things may help you feel better:\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids.\n* If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler.\n* Get plenty of rest.\n* Take aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a fever. DO NOT give aspirin to people under age 18.\n* Breathe moist air by using a humidifier or steaming up the bathroom.\n\nCertain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word \"guaifenesin\" on the label. If needed, ask the pharmacist for help finding it.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Bronchitis**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost people do not need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus.

The condition can occur in people of all ages, but it is more common in children and young adults.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia can vary from person to person, but they typically include:\n\n* Sudden onset of unsteadiness or loss of balance\n* Difficulty with coordination and movement\n* Slurred speech\n* Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)\n* Headache\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia is based on a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The condition can be challenging to diagnose, as the symptoms may resemble those of other neurological disorders.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for acute cerebellar ataxia, but supportive care such as rest, hydration, and pain management may help alleviate symptoms. In some cases, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the cerebellum.\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for people with acute cerebellar ataxia is generally good, with most individuals recovering fully within a few weeks to months. However, some people may experience residual symptoms or complications, such as ataxia or cognitive impairment.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\nKuo SH, Lin CC, Ashizawa T. Cerebellar ataxia.

Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, cells, and other substances.\n\nPlaque can block blood flow in two ways:\n\n*   It can cause an artery to become so narrow over time that it becomes blocked enough to cause symptoms.\n*   The plaque tears suddenly and a blood clot forms around it, severely narrowing or blocking the artery.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of ACS is chest pain. The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest. Other symptoms can include:\n\n*   Pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, back, or belly area\n*   Discomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching\n*   Discomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Anxiety\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n*   Fast or irregular heartbeat\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do an exam, listen to your chest with a stethoscope, and ask about your medical history.\n\nTests for ACS include:\n\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG) -- An ECG is usually the first test your provider will run. It measures your heart's electrical activity. During the test, you will have small pads taped to your chest and other areas of your body.\n*   Blood test -- Some blood tests help show the cause of chest pain and see if you are at a high risk for a heart attack. A troponin blood test can show if the cells in your heart have been damaged. This test can confirm you are having a heart attack.\n*   Echocardiogram -- This test uses sound waves to look at your heart. It shows if your heart has been damaged and can find some types of heart problems.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider may use medicines, surgery, or other procedures to treat your symptoms and restore blood flow to your heart. Your treatment depends on your condition and the amount of blockage in your arteries. Your treatment may include:\n\n*   Medicine -- Your provider may give you one or more types of medicine, including aspirin, beta blockers, statins, blood thinners, clot dissolving medicines (thrombolytics), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or nitroglycerin. These medicines may help prevent or break up a blood clot, treat high blood pressure or angina, relieve chest pain, and stabilize your heart.\n*   Angioplasty -- This procedure opens the clogged artery using a long, thin tube called a catheter. The tube is placed in the artery and the provider inserts a small deflated balloon. The balloon is inflated inside the artery to open it up. Your doctor (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) may insert a wire tube, called a stent, to keep the artery open.\n*   Bypass surgery -- This is surgery to route the blood around the artery that is blocked.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do after an ACS depends on:\n\n*   How quickly you get treated\n*   The number of arteries that are blocked and how bad the blockage is\n*   Whether or not your heart has been damaged, as well as the extent and location of the damage, and where the damage is\n\nIn general, the quicker your artery gets unblocked, the less damage you will have to your heart. People tend to do best when the blocked artery is opened within a few hours from the time symptoms start.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn some cases, ACS can lead to other health problems including:\n\n*   Abnormal heart rhythms\n*   Death\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart failure, which happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood\n*   Rupture of part of the heart muscle causing tamponade or severe valve leakage\n*   Stroke\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nAn ACS is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of an ACS, call 911 or the local emergency number quickly.\n\nDo not:\n\n*   Try to drive yourself to the hospital.\n*   Wait - If you are having a heart attack, you are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is a lot you can do to help prevent ACS.\n\nEat a heart-healthy diet. Have plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean meats. Try to limit foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats, since too much of these substances can clog your arteries.\n\nGet exercise. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.\n\nLose weight, if you are overweight.\n\nQuit smoking. Smoking can damage your heart. Ask your doctor if you need help quitting.\n\nGet preventive health screenings. You should see your doctor for regular cholesterol and blood pressure tests and learn how to keep your numbers in check.\n\nManage health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n\n_Acute coronary syndrome_ is a term for a group of conditions that suddenly stop or severely reduce blood from flowing to the heart muscle.

You should see your doctor for regular cholesterol and blood pressure tests and learn how to keep your numbers in check.\n\nManage health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nA fatty substance called plaque can build up in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, cells, and other substances.\n\nPlaque can block blood flow in two ways:\n\n*   It can cause an artery to become so narrow over time that it becomes blocked enough to cause symptoms.\n*   The plaque tears suddenly and a blood clot forms around it, severely narrowing or blocking the artery.\n\nMany risk factors for heart disease may lead to an ACS.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of ACS is chest pain. The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest. Other symptoms can include:\n\n*   Pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, back, or belly area\n*   Discomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching\n*   Discomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Anxiety\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n*   Fast or irregular heartbeat\n\nWomen and older people often experience these other symptoms, although chest pain is common for them as well.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do an exam, listen to your chest with a stethoscope, and ask about your medical history.\n\nTests for ACS include:\n\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG) -- An ECG is usually the first test your provider will run. It measures your heart's electrical activity.\n*   Blood test -- Some blood tests help show the cause of chest pain and see if you are at a high risk for a heart attack.\n*   Echocardiogram -- This test uses sound waves to look at your heart.\n*   Coronary angiography may be done right away or when you are more stable. This test:\n    *   Uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through your heart\n    *   Can help your provider decide which treatments you need next\n\nOther tests to look at your heart that may be done while you are in the hospital include:\n\n*   Exercise stress test\n*   Nuclear stress test\n*   Stress echocardiography\n\n---\n\n**Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour treatment depends on your condition and the amount of blockage in your arteries. Your treatment may include:\n\n*   Medicine -- Your provider may give you one or more types of medicine, including aspirin, beta blockers, statins, blood thinners, clot dissolving medicines (thrombolytics), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or nitroglycerin.\n*   Angioplasty -- This procedure opens the clogged artery using a long, thin tube called a catheter. The tube is placed in the artery and the provider inserts a small deflated balloon. The balloon is inflated inside the artery to open it up.\n*   Bypass surgery -- This is surgery to route the blood around the artery that is blocked.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well you do after an ACS depends on:\n\n*   How quickly you get treated\n*   The number of arteries that are blocked and how bad the blockage is\n*   Whether or not your heart has been damaged, as well as the extent and location of the damage, and where the damage is\n\nIn general, the quicker your artery gets unblocked, the less damage you will have to your heart. People tend to do best when the blocked artery is opened within a few hours from the time symptoms start.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn some cases, ACS can lead to other health problems including:\n\n*   Abnormal heart rhythms\n*   Death\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart failure, which happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood\n*   Rupture of part of the heart muscle causing tamponade or severe valve leakage\n*   Stroke\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nAn ACS is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of an ACS, call 911 or the local emergency number quickly.\n\nDo not:\n\n*   Try to drive yourself to the hospital.\n*   Wait - If you are having a heart attack, you are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is a lot you can do to help prevent ACS.\n\nEat a heart-healthy diet. Have plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean meats. Try to limit foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats, since too much of these substances can clog your arteries.\n\nGet exercise. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.\n\nLose weight, if you are overweight.\n\nQuit smoking. Smoking can damage your heart. Ask your doctor if you need help quitting.\n\nGet preventive health screenings. You should see your doctor for regular cholesterol and blood pressure tests and learn how to keep your numbers in check.\n\nManage health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n\n**What is Acute Coronary Syndrome?**\n\nAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a condition where the blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. It can range from mild to severe and is often caused by a combination of factors such as high cholesterol, smoking, and family history.\n\n**Types of Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n\nThere are two main types of ACS:\n\n*   **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)**: This is the most severe form of ACS, where the blood flow to the heart is completely blocked.\n*   **Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes**: This type of ACS is less severe than STEMI and is characterized by a partial blockage of the blood flow to the heart.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nACS can be caused by a combination of factors such as:\n\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Smoking\n*   Family history\n*   Age\n*   Sex (men are more likely to develop ACS than women)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ACS can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   Chest pain or discomfort\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Pain or discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nACS is typically diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test to check for cardiac biomarkers. Treatment for ACS usually involves:\n\n*   **Medications**: Such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and beta blockers\n*   **Angioplasty**: A procedure where a balloon is inserted into the blocked artery to restore blood flow\n*   **Bypass surgery**: A surgical procedure where a healthy artery or vein is used to bypass the blocked area\n\n**Prevention**\n\nACS can be prevented by:\n\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Eating a balanced diet\n*   Quitting smoking\n*   Managing stress\n\n**References**\n\n*   Amsterdam EA, Wenger NK, Brindis RG, et al. 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

    "content": "**Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**\n\n**What is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)?**\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes.\n\n**Causes of ALL**\n\nMost of the time, no clear cause can be found for ALL. However, certain factors may play a role in the development of all types of leukemia:\n\n* Certain chromosome problems\n* Exposure to radiation\n* Past treatment with chemotherapy medicines\n* Receiving a bone marrow transplant\n* Toxins, such as benzene\n\nThe following factors are known to increase the risk for ALL:\n\n* Down syndrome or some other genetic conditions\n* A brother or sister with leukemia\n\n**Symptoms of ALL**\n\nALL makes a person more likely to bleed and develop infections. Symptoms include:\n\n* Bone and joint pain\n* Easy bruising and bleeding (such as bleeding gums, skin bleeding, nosebleeds, abnormal periods)\n* Feeling weak or tired\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite and weight loss\n* Paleness\n* Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs from an enlarged liver or spleen\n* Pinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae)\n* Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under arms, and groin\n* Night sweats\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) count and cell differential\n* Platelet count\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid\n\n**Treatment of ALL**\n\nThe first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal. If this occurs and the bone marrow looks healthy under the microscope, the cancer is said to be in remission.\n\nChemotherapy is the first treatment tried with the goal of achieving a remission. The person may need to stay in the hospital for chemotherapy or it may be given at a clinic and the person goes home afterward.\n\nAfter a remission is achieved, more treatment is given to achieve a cure. This treatment can include more IV chemotherapy or radiation to the brain. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant from another person may also be done.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThose who respond to treatment right away tend to do better. Most children with ALL can be cured. Children often have a better outcome than adults.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBoth leukemia itself and its treatment can lead to many problems such as bleeding, weight loss, and infections.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of ALL.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe risk for developing ALL may be reduced by avoiding contact with certain toxins, radiation, and chemicals.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**\n\n**What is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)?**\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes.\n\n**Causes of ALL**\n\nMost of the time, no clear cause can be found for ALL. However, certain factors may play a role in the development of all types of leukemia:\n\n* Certain chromosome problems\n* Exposure to radiation\n* Past treatment with chemotherapy medicines\n* Receiving a bone marrow transplant\n* Toxins, such as benzene\n\nThe following factors are known to increase the risk for ALL:\n\n* Down syndrome or some other genetic conditions\n* A brother or sister with leukemia\n\n**This type of leukemia usually affects children ages 3 to 7. ALL is the most common childhood cancer, but it can also occur in adults.**\n\n**Symptoms of ALL**\n\nALL makes a person more likely to bleed and develop infections. Symptoms include:\n\n* Bone and joint pain\n* Easy bruising and bleeding (such as bleeding gums, skin bleeding, nosebleeds, abnormal periods)\n* Feeling weak or tired\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite and weight loss\n* Paleness\n* Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs from an enlarged liver or spleen\n* Pinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae)\n* Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under arms, and groin\n* Night sweats\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\n\nBlood tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) count and cell differential\n* Platelet count\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid\n\n**Treatment of ALL**\n\nThe first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal. If this occurs and the bone marrow looks healthy under the microscope, the cancer is said to be in remission.\n\nChemotherapy is the first treatment tried with the goal of achieving a remission.\n\nThe person may need to stay in the hospital for chemotherapy. Or it may be given at a clinic and the person goes home afterward.\nChemotherapy is given into the veins (by IV) and sometimes into the fluid around the brain (the spinal fluid). Oral chemotherapy may be given after a remission to maintain it.\nThere are also multiple new agents approved for ALL including CAR-T-cell therapy and certain targeted agents, such as Blinatumomab and Inotuzumab ozogamicin, that have improved the outcomes.\n\nAfter a remission is achieved, more treatment is given to achieve a cure. This treatment can include more IV chemotherapy or radiation to the brain. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant from another person may also be done. Further treatment depends on:\n\n* Age and health of the person\n* Genetic changes in the leukemia cells\n* How many courses of chemotherapy it took to achieve remission\n* If abnormal cell DNA is detected in the bone marrow after remission\n* Availability of donors for stem cell or bone marrow transplant\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThose who respond to treatment right away tend to do better. Most children with ALL can be cured. Children often have a better outcome than adults.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nBoth leukemia itself and its treatment can lead to many problems such as bleeding, weight loss, and infections.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of ALL.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe risk for developing ALL may be reduced by avoiding contact with certain toxins, radiation, and chemicals.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**\n\n**What is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia?**\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by an overproduction of immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts or leukemic blasts.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ALL can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n* Bone and joint pain\n* Easy bruising and bleeding (such as bleeding gums, skin bleeding, nosebleeds, abnormal periods)\n* Feeling weak or tired\n* Fever\n* Loss of appetite and weight loss\n* Paleness\n* Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs from an enlarged liver or spleen\n* Pinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae)\n* Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under arms, and groin\n* Night sweats\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose ALL, your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) count and cell differential\n* Platelet count\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal.

The faster you climb to a high altitude, the more likely you will get acute mountain sickness.\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best way to prevent altitude illness is to ascend gradually. It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters). Above this point ascend very slowly so that the elevation at which you sleep does not increase more than 990 feet to 1640 feet (300m to 500m) per night.\n\n\\n\\n**Risk Factors**\n\nYou are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if:\n\n* You live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude.\n* You have had the illness before.\n* You ascend quickly.\n* You have not acclimatized appropriately to the altitude.\n* Alcohol or other substances have interfered with acclimatization.\n* You have medical problems involving the heart, nervous system, or lungs.\n* If you have anemia\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nYour symptoms will also depend on the speed of your climb and how hard you push (exert) yourself. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. They can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart.\n\nIn most cases, symptoms are mild. Symptoms of mild to moderate acute mountain sickness may include:\n\n* Difficulty sleeping\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Loss of appetite\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Rapid pulse (heart rate)\n* Shortness of breath with exertion\n\nSymptoms that may occur with more severe acute mountain sickness include the following and may progress to high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema:\n\n* Blue color to the skin (cyanosis)\n* Chest tightness or congestion\n* Confusion\n* Cough\n* Coughing up blood\n* Decreased consciousness or withdrawal from social interaction\n* Gray or pale complexion\n* Inability to walk in a straight line, or walk at all\n* Shortness of breath at rest\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will examine you and listen to your chest with a stethoscope. This may reveal sounds called crackles (rales) in the lung. Rales may be a sign of fluid in the lungs.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Blood tests\n* Brain CT scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nEarly diagnosis is important. Acute mountain sickness is easier to treat in the early stages.\n\nThe main treatment for all forms of mountain sickness is to climb down (descend) to a lower altitude as rapidly and safely as possible. You should not continue climbing up if you develop symptoms.\n\nExtra oxygen should be given, if available.\n\nPeople with severe mountain sickness may need to be admitted to a hospital.\n\nA medicine called acetazolamide (Diamox) may be given to help you breathe better. It can help reduce symptoms. This medicine can make you urinate more often. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol when taking this medicine. This medicine works best when taken before reaching a high altitude.\n\nIf you have fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema), treatment may include:\n\n* Oxygen\n* A high blood pressure medicine called nifedipine\n* Beta agonist inhalers to open the airways\n* Breathing machine in severe cases\n* Medicine to increase blood flow to the lungs called phosphodiesterase inhibitor (such as sildenafil)\n\nDexamethasone (Decadron) may help reduce acute mountain sickness symptoms and swelling in the brain (cerebral edema).\n\nPortable hyperbaric chambers allow hikers to simulate conditions at lower altitudes without actually moving from their location on the mountain. These devices are very helpful if bad weather or other factors make climbing down the mountain impossible.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Mountain Sickness**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you have fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema), treatment may include:\n\n*   Oxygen\n*   A high blood pressure medicine called nifedipine\n*   Beta agonist inhalers to open the airways\n*   Breathing machine in severe cases\n*   Medicine to increase blood flow to the lungs called phosphodiesterase inhibitor (such as sildenafil)\n\nDexamethasone (Decadron) may help reduce acute mountain sickness symptoms and swelling in the brain (cerebral edema).\n\nPortable hyperbaric chambers allow hikers to simulate conditions at lower altitudes without actually moving from their location on the mountain.

Symptoms improve quickly when you climb down the mountain to a lower altitude.\n\nSevere cases may result in death due to lung problems (pulmonary edema) or brain swelling (cerebral edema).\n\nIn remote locations, emergency evacuation may not be possible, or treatment may be delayed. This can have a negative effect on the outcome.\n\nThe outlook depends on how quickly the affected person can get to a lower altitude once symptoms begin. Some people are more prone to developing altitude-related sickness and may not respond as well as others.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Coma (unresponsiveness)\n*   Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)\n*   Swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), which can lead to seizures, mental changes, or permanent damage to the nervous system\n*   Death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have or had symptoms of acute mountain sickness, even if you felt better when you returned to a lower altitude.\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you or another climber have any of the following symptoms:\n\n*   Altered level of alertness\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Severe breathing problems\n\nClimb down the mountain right away and as safely as possible.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Mountain Sickness**\n\n**What is Acute Mountain Sickness?**\n\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a condition that occurs when the body cannot adapt to high altitudes, leading to symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and fatigue.\n\n**Who is at Risk?**\n\n*   People who climb to high altitudes quickly\n*   Those with heart or lung disease\n*   Individuals with low red blood cell count (anemia)\n\n**Prevention Tips**\n\nWhile climbing:\n\n*   Do not drink alcohol\n*   Drink plenty of fluids\n*   Eat regular meals that are high in carbohydrates\n\nYou should avoid high altitudes if you have heart or lung disease.\n\nKeys to preventing acute mountain sickness include:\n\n*   If you are traveling above 9840 feet (3000 meters), you should carry enough oxygen for several days.\n*   If you plan on climbing quickly, or climbing to a high altitude, ask your provider about medicines that may help prevent acute mountain sickness, such as acetazolamide or dexamethasone.\n*   If you are at risk for a low red blood cell count (anemia), ask your provider if your planned trip is safe.

AML develops quickly, and \"myeloid\" refers to the type of white blood cells that become cancerous.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn children, AML is rare. The cause of AML is often unknown, but some factors can increase the risk of developing AML:\n\n* Exposure to alcohol or tobacco smoke before birth\n* A history of certain diseases, such as aplastic anemia\n* Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and other rare syndromes\n* Previous use of certain chemotherapy medicines, such as cyclophosphamide\n* Past treatment with radiation therapy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChildren with AML may experience:\n\n* Feeling weak or tired\n* Bone or joint pain\n* Frequent infections\n* Easy bleeding or bruising\n* Fever with or without an infection\n* Night sweats\n* Painless lumps in the neck, armpits, stomach, groin, or other parts of the body that may be blue or purple\n* Pinpoint red spots (petechiae) under the skin caused by bleeding\n* Shortness of breath\n* Loss of appetite and eating less food\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour child's health care provider will perform the following exams and tests:\n\n* Physical exam and health history\n* Complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation assay\n* Blood chemistry study, including kidney function tests, and uric acid level\n* Chest x-ray\n* Lumbar puncture to look for leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid\n* Biopsies of the bone marrow or lymph node\n* A test to look for changes in the chromosomes in blood or bone marrow\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for children with AML may include:\n\n* Anticancer medicines (chemotherapy)\n* Certain types of targeted therapy\n\nBone marrow transplant is used if the leukemia returns after treatment or doesn't respond well to initial therapy with chemotherapy. This process uses high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy to treat the leukemia, followed by transfusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nHaving a child with cancer can make you feel very alone.

Joining a support group where other parents or families share common experiences may help ease your stress.\n\n* Leukemia and Lymphoma Society -- www.lls.org\n* The National Children’s Cancer Society -- thenccs.org/\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCancer can come back at any time. But for most children, AML doesn't come back after being gone for 5 years. However, there is a wide range in outcomes for different subtypes of AML, and the disease might return.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe leukemia cells can affect various organs in the body including:\n\n* Brain\n* Kidneys\n* Lungs\n* Skin\n* Intestines\n\nAs a result of the treatment, it's common to experience:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Hair loss\n* Weight loss\n* Mouth sores\n* Need for transfusions\n* Infections requiring hospitalization\n* Infertility\n* Severe organ damage (very rarely)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider for an appointment right away if your child develops these symptoms:\n\n* Persistent fever\n* Easy bruising\n* Shortness of breath\n* Viral infection that doesn't resolve\n* Prolonged fatigue\n* Any other symptoms of AML\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMany childhood cancers can't be prevented. Most children who develop leukemia have no risk factors.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAcute myelogenous leukemia - children; AML - children; Acute granulocytic leukemia - children; Acute myeloblastic leukemia - children; Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) - children\n\n---\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Children**\n\n**What is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is also known as acute granulocytic leukemia or acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells, which crowd out healthy cells in the bone marrow.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of AML is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some risk factors for developing AML include:\n\n*   Exposure to radiation\n*   Certain chemicals, such as benzene\n*   Family history of AML or other blood disorders\n*   Previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of AML can vary depending on the individual and the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Weight loss\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Fever\n*   Infections\n*   Bleeding or bruising easily\n*   Pale skin\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing AML typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Bone marrow biopsy\n*   Flow cytometry\n*   Cytogenetic analysis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of AML in children depends on the stage and severity of the disease. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   Chemotherapy\n*   Radiation therapy\n*   Stem cell transplant\n*   Targeted therapy\n*   Supportive care, such as blood transfusions and antibiotics\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for children with AML varies depending on the stage and severity of the disease. In general, the 5-year survival rate for children with AML is around 60-70%. However, some children may experience a relapse or develop secondary cancers.\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Cancer Society website.

    "content": "**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\n**What is AML?**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cancer that starts inside bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   AML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults.\n*   AML is more common in men than women.\n*   Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances, such as benzene, radiation, or weak immune system due to an organ transplant may also cause AML to develop.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of AML are mainly due to the effects on blood elements. Symptoms of AML may include:\n\n*   Bleeding from the nose\n*   Bleeding and swelling (rare) in the gums\n*   Bruising\n*   Bone pain or tenderness\n*   Fever and fatigue\n*   Heavy menstrual periods\n*   Pale skin\n*   Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise)\n*   Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam. There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. Tests done include:\n\n*   A complete blood count (CBC) may show anemia and a low number of platelets.\n*   A white blood cell count (WBC) can be high, low, or normal.\n*   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will show if there are any leukemia cells.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment involves using medicines (chemotherapy) to kill the cancer cells. Most types of AML are treated with more than one chemotherapy medicine. Drugs that are targeted to specific mutations in the leukemic cells are also often used.\n\nChemotherapy kills normal cells, too. This may cause side effects such as:\n\n*   Increased risk of bleeding\n*   Increased risk for infection (your doctor may want you to keep away from other people to prevent infection)\n*   Weight loss (you will need to eat extra calories)\n*   Mouth sores\n\nOther supportive treatments for AML may include:\n\n*   Antibiotics to treat infection\n*   Red blood cell transfusions to fight anemia\n*   Platelet transfusions to control bleeding\n\nA bone marrow (stem cell) transplant may be tried. This decision is decided by several factors, including your age and overall health, certain genetic changes in the leukemia cells, the availability of donors, and support groups.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWhen a bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of AML, you are said to be in remission. How well you do depends on your overall health and the genetic subtype of the AML cells.\n\nRemission is not the same as a cure. More therapy is usually needed, either in the form of more chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.\n\nWith treatment, younger people with AML tend to do better than those who develop the disease at an older age. The 5-year survival rate is much lower in older adults than in younger people. Experts say this is partly due to the fact that younger people are better able to tolerate strong chemotherapy medicines. Also, leukemia in older people tends to be more resistant to current treatments.\n\nIf the cancer does not come back (relapse) within 5 years of the diagnosis, you are likely cured.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider to schedule an appointment if you:\n\n*   Develop symptoms of AML\n*   Have AML and have a fever that will not go away or other signs of infection\n\n---\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\n**What is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?**\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that starts inside bone marrow. The bone marrow helps form all blood cells, and in AML, the cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells.\n\n**Causes of AML**\n\nAML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults. It is more common in men than women. The bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow, which grow very quickly and replace healthy blood cells.\n\nMost of the time, a healthcare provider cannot tell you what caused AML. However, certain things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML:\n\n* Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelodysplasia\n* Certain chemicals, like benzene\n* Certain chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide and alkylating agents\n* Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances\n* Radiation\n* Weak immune system due to an organ transplant\n\nProblems with your genes may also cause AML to develop.\n\n**Symptoms of AML**\n\nSymptoms of AML are mainly due to the effects on blood elements. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Bleeding from the nose\n* Bleeding and swelling (rare) in the gums\n* Bruising\n* Bone pain or tenderness\n* Fever and fatigue\n* Heavy menstrual periods\n* Pale skin\n* Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise)\n* Weight loss\n\n**Treatment of AML**\n\nTreatment involves using medicines (chemotherapy) to kill the cancer cells.

    "content": "**Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\n**What is Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1?**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, also known as susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 or IIAE3, is a rare type of brain disease (encephalopathy) that occurs following a viral infection such as the flu.\n\n**Symptoms and Progression**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 typically appears in infancy or early childhood, although some people do not develop the condition until adolescence or adulthood. People with this condition usually show typical symptoms of an infection, such as fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea, for a few days. Following these flu-like symptoms, affected individuals develop neurological problems, such as seizures, hallucinations, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or abnormal muscle tone. Eventually, most affected individuals go into a coma, which usually lasts for a number of weeks.\n\n**Brain Damage and Tissue Loss**\n\nPeople with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 develop areas of damage (lesions) in certain regions of the brain. As the condition progresses, these brain regions develop swelling (edema), bleeding (hemorrhage), and then tissue death (necrosis). The progressive brain damage and tissue loss results in encephalopathy.\n\n**Outcome and Prognosis**\n\nApproximately one-third of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not survive their illness and subsequent neurological decline. Of those who do survive, about half have permanent brain damage due to tissue necrosis, resulting in impairments in walking, speech, and other basic functions. Over time, many of these skills may be regained, but the loss of brain tissue is permanent. Other individuals who survive their illness appear to recover completely.\n\n**Recurrent Episodes**\n\nIt is estimated that half of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 are susceptible to recurrent episodes and will have another infection that results in neurological decline; some people may have numerous episodes throughout their lives. Neurological function worsens following each episode as more brain tissue is damaged.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Typically appears in infancy or early childhood\n* Some people do not develop the condition until adolescence or adulthood\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Viral infections such as the flu\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Unknown inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 (IIAE3)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n**References**\n\n* MedlinePlus Genetics\n* National Library of Medicine\n\n---\n\n**Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\n**What is Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1?**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is a rare and severe brain disease that occurs following a viral infection, such as the flu. It typically appears in infancy or early childhood, although some people may not develop the condition until adolescence or adulthood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 usually show typical symptoms of an infection, such as fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea, for a few days. Following these flu-like symptoms, affected individuals develop neurological problems, such as seizures, hallucinations, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or abnormal muscle tone.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the RANBP2 gene have been found to increase the risk of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1. The RANBP2 protein helps regulate the transport of proteins and other molecules through the nuclear pore and plays multiple roles during cell division. Influenza is the most common virus found in people with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, although other viruses and a bacterium may also be involved.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is likely a very rare condition, although its incidence is unknown. At least 59 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nApproximately one-third of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not survive their illness and subsequent neurological decline. Of those who do survive, about half have permanent brain damage due to tissue necrosis, resulting in impairments in walking, speech, and other basic functions.

Neurological function worsens following each episode as more brain tissue is damaged.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\n**What is Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1?**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is a rare disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation in response to viral infections, which can lead to neurological problems.\n\n**Causes of Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the RANBP2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with a protein complex known as the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore is a channel that allows transport of molecules in and out of the cell's nucleus.\n\n**Symptoms of Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\nThe symptoms of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not vary significantly among the different infections, which suggests that the type of infection is less important than the occurrence of an infection to trigger the condition. Some people with signs and symptoms of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not have an identified mutation in the RANBP2 gene.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing the disorder following an infection. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from a parent.\n\n**Reduced Penetrance**\n\nSome people who have the altered RANBP2 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance. It is estimated that an individual with a RANBP2 gene mutation has a 40 percent chance of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 during his or her lifetime.\n\n**Common Viruses Associated with Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\nInfluenza is the most common virus found in people with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1; other viruses that are known to trigger this condition include human herpesvirus 6, coxsackie virus, and enteroviruses. In rare cases, the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved.\n\n**Gene Associated with Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\nThe RANBP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with a protein complex known as the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore is a channel that allows transport of molecules in and out of the cell's nucleus.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing the disorder following an infection.\n\n**Risk of Developing the Condition**\n\nAn individual with a RANBP2 gene mutation has a 40 percent chance of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 during his or her lifetime. Additional genetic or environmental factors likely play a role in whether an infection triggers the signs and symptoms of this condition. The health history of the individual, such as nutritional status and number of prior infections, may also influence risk.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Acute necrotizing encephalitis\n* ADANE (Autosomal Dominant Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy)\n* ANE1 (Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1)\n* IIAE3 (Postinfectious acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy)\n* Susceptibility to acute necrotizing encephalopathy\n* Susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy\n* Susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3\n\n**References**\n\n* Bloch C, Suter B, Fischmann A, Gensicke H, Ruegg S, Weisser M.

Gene variants can affect health and development in many ways, such as by causing birth defects, affecting organ function, or increasing the risk of certain diseases.\n\nIf a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component. Genetic conditions can be inherited in different ways, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance patterns.\n\nGenetic conditions are typically treated or managed through a combination of medical interventions, lifestyle modifications, and supportive care. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance on managing a genetic condition.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

This results in blood and protein appearing in the urine, and excess fluid building up in the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe inflammation affects the function of the glomerulus. As a result, blood and protein appear in the urine, and excess fluid builds up in the body. The causes of acute nephritic syndrome include:\n\n*   An immune response triggered by an infection or other disease\n*   Common causes in children and adolescents:\n    *   Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)\n    *   Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)\n    *   Infections such as strep throat, pneumonia, or meningitis\n*   Common causes in adults:\n    *   Lupus\n    *   Vasculitis (ANCA)\n    *   Diabetes\n    *   High blood pressure\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe common symptoms of nephritic syndrome are:\n\n*   Blood in the urine (urine appears dark, tea-colored, or cloudy)\n*   Decreased urine output (little or no urine may be produced)\n*   Swelling of the face, eye socket, legs, arms, hands, feet, abdomen, or other areas\n*   High blood pressure\n\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\n\n*   Blurred vision, usually from burst blood vessels in the retina of the eye\n*   Cough containing mucus or pink, frothy material from fluid buildup in the lungs\n*   Shortness of breath, from fluid buildup in the lungs\n*   General ill feeling (malaise), drowsiness, confusion, aches and pains, headache\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring an examination, your health care provider may find the following signs:\n\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Abnormal heart and lung sounds\n*   Signs of excess fluid (edema) such as swelling in the legs, arms, face, and belly\n*   Enlarged liver\n*   Enlarged veins in the neck\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Blood electrolytes\n*   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n*   Creatinine\n*   Creatinine clearance\n*   Urine protein\n*   Urinalysis\n\nA kidney biopsy will show inflammation of the glomeruli, which may indicate the cause of the condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation in the kidney and control high blood pressure. You may need to stay in a hospital to be diagnosed and treated.\n\nYour provider may recommend:\n\n*   Bedrest until you feel better with treatment\n*   A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium\n*   Medicines to control high blood pressure, reduce inflammation, or to remove fluid from your body\n*   Kidney dialysis, if needed\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the disease that is causing the nephritis. When the condition improves, symptoms of fluid retention (such as swelling and cough) and high blood pressure may go away in 1 or 2 weeks. Urine tests may take months to return to normal.\n\nChildren tend to do better than adults and usually recover completely. Only rarely do they develop complications or progress to chronic glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease.\n\nAdults do not recover as well or as quickly as children. Although it is unusual for the disease to return, in some adults, the disease does return and they will develop end-stage kidney disease and may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Nephritic Syndrome**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nOften, the disorder cannot be prevented, although treatment of illness and infection may help to reduce the risk.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Glomerulonephritis - acute\n* Acute glomerulonephritis\n* Nephritis syndrome - acute\n\n**Images**\n\n* Glomerulus and nephron\n* Kidney anatomy\n\n**References**\n\n* Radhakrishnan J, Stokes MB.

It occurs when the digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas become active inside the organ, causing damage to its tissue and blood vessels.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of acute pancreatitis can be divided into several categories:\n\n*   **Alcohol Use**: Up to 70% of cases in the United States are caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking 5-8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas.\n*   **Gallstones**: Gallstones that travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes, causing swelling in the pancreas.\n*   **Genetics**: Some cases may be linked to genetic factors.\n*   **Unknown Cause**: In some cases, the cause is not known.\n\n**Other Conditions Linked to Pancreatitis**\n\nCertain conditions have been linked to an increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis:\n\n*   **Autoimmune Problems**: When the immune system attacks the body\n*   **Damage to the Bile Ducts or Pancreas During Surgery**\n*   **High Blood Levels of Triglycerides** (above 1,000 mg/dL)\n*   **Injury to the Pancreas from an Accident**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of pancreatitis is pain felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. The pain:\n\n*   May be worse within minutes after eating or drinking at first, more commonly if foods have a high fat content\n*   Becomes constant and more severe, lasting for several days\n*   May be worse when lying flat on the back\n*   May spread (radiate) to the back or below the left shoulder blade\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam, which may show:\n\n*   Abdominal tenderness or lump (mass)\n*   Fever\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Rapid heart rate\n*   Rapid breathing (respiratory) rate\n\nLab tests that show the release of pancreatic enzymes will be done. These include:\n\n*   Increased serum amylase level\n*   Increased serum lipase level (a more specific indicator of pancreatitis than amylase levels)\n*   Increased urine amylase level\n\n---\n\n**Acute Pancreatitis**\n\n**What is Acute Pancreatitis?**\n\nThe pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. It also produces chemicals called enzymes needed to digest food.\n\nMost of the time, the enzymes are active only after they reach the small intestine.\n\nIf these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they can digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding, and damage to the organ and its blood vessels.\nThis problem is called acute pancreatitis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAcute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition.\n\nAlcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. About 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas.\nGallstones are the next most common cause. When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes. The bile and enzymes \"back up\" into the pancreas and cause swelling.\nGenetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known.\n\nOther conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are:\n\n* Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body)\n* Damage to the bile ducts or pancreas during surgery\n* High blood levels of a fat called triglycerides -- most often above 1,000 mg/dL\n* Injury to the pancreas from an accident\n\nOther causes include:\n\n* After certain procedures used to diagnose gallbladder and pancreas problems (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, ERCP) or ultrasound guided biopsy\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* Overactive parathyroid gland\n* Reye syndrome\n* Use of certain medicines (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine)\n* Certain infections, such as mumps, that involve the pancreas\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of pancreatitis is pain felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. The pain:\n\nMay be worse within minutes after eating or drinking at first, more commonly if foods have a high fat content\nBecomes constant and more severe, lasting for several days\nMay be worse when lying flat on the back\nMay spread (radiate) to the back or below the left shoulder blade\n\nPeople with acute pancreatitis often look ill and have a fever, nausea, vomiting, and sweating.\n\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease include:\n\n* Clay-colored stools\n* Bloating and fullness\n* Hiccups\n* Indigestion\n* Mild yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n* Swollen abdomen\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam, which may show:\n\nAbdominal tenderness or lump (mass)\nFever\nLow blood pressure\nRapid heart rate\nRapid breathing (respiratory) rate\n\nLab tests that show the release of pancreatic enzymes will be done. These include:\n\nIncreased serum amylase level\nIncreased serum lipase level (a more specific indicator of pancreatitis than amylase levels)\nIncreased urine amylase level\n\nOther blood tests that can help diagnose pancreatitis or its complications include:\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n\nThe following imaging tests that can show swelling of the pancreas may be done, but are not always needed to make a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis:\n\nCT scan of the abdomen\nMRI of the abdomen\nUltrasound of the abdomen\n\n---\n\n**Acute Pancreatitis**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment often requires a stay in the hospital. It may involve:\n\n*   **Pain medicines**\n*   **Fluids given through a vein (IV)**\n*   **Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas**. In the past, patients did not get food for many days. However, feeding the digestive tract is an important treatment for pancreatitis, therefore a feeding tube may be put into the stomach or intestine until you can eat by mouth again.\n\nA tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach. This may be done if vomiting and severe pain do not improve. The tube will stay in for 1 to 2 days to 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nTreating the condition that caused the problem can prevent repeated attacks.\n\nIn some cases, therapy is needed to:\n\n*   **Drain fluid that has collected in or around the pancreas**\n*   **Remove gallstones**\n*   **Relieve blockages of the pancreatic duct**\n\nIn the most severe cases, surgery is needed to remove damaged, dead or infected pancreatic tissue.\n\nAvoid smoking, alcoholic drinks, and fatty foods after the attack has improved.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost cases go away in a week or less. However, some cases develop into a life-threatening illness.\n\nThe death rate is high when:\n\n*   **Bleeding in the pancreas has occurred**\n*   **Liver, heart, or kidney problems are also present**\n*   **An abscess forms the pancreas**\n*   **There is death or necrosis of larger amounts of tissue in the pancreas**\n\nSometimes the swelling and infection do not fully heal. Repeat episodes of pancreatitis may also occur. Either of these can lead to long-term damage of the pancreas (called chronic pancreatitis).\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPancreatitis can return. The chances of it returning depend on the cause, and how well it can be treated. Complications of acute pancreatitis may include:\n\n*   **Acute kidney failure**\n*   **Long-term lung damage (due to adult respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS)**\n*   **Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites)**\n*   **Fluid collections in the pancreas (pancreatic pseudocysts)** that may become infected (pancreatic abscess)\n*   **Heart failure**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have intense, constant abdominal pain.\n*   You develop other symptoms of acute pancreatitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou may lower your risk of new or repeat episodes of pancreatitis by taking steps to prevent the medical conditions that can lead to the disease:\n\n*   **DO NOT drink alcohol** if it is the likely cause of the acute attack.\n*   **DO NOT smoke**. Tobacco smoking can worsen acute and chronic pancreatitis.\n*   Make sure children receive vaccines to protect them against mumps and other childhood illnesses.\n*   Treat medical problems that lead to high blood levels of triglycerides.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nGallstone pancreatitis; Pancreas - inflammation\n\n---\n\n**Acute Pancreatitis**\n\n**Guidelines and Recommendations**\n\n*   American Gastroenterological Association Institute Guideline on initial management of acute pancreatitis.

    "content": "**Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\n**What is Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia?**\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow). In normal bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells produce red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from infection, and platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood clotting. In APL, immature white blood cells called promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow.\n\n**Causes of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nThe overgrowth of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body, which causes many of the signs and symptoms of the condition. The abnormal bleeding and bruising occur in part because of the low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) and also because the cancerous cells release substances that cause excessive bleeding.\n\n**Symptoms of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nPeople with APL are especially susceptible to developing:\n\n* Bruises\n* Small red dots under the skin (petechiae)\n* Nosebleeds\n* Bleeding from the gums\n* Blood in the urine (hematuria)\n* Excessive menstrual bleeding\n\nThe low number of red blood cells (anemia) can cause people with APL to have pale skin (pallor) or excessive tiredness (fatigue). Affected individuals may also heal slowly from injuries or have frequent infections due to the loss of normal white blood cells that fight infection.\n\n**Diagnosis and Age**\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia is most often diagnosed around age 40, although it can be diagnosed at any age.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\n**What is Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia?**\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood-forming tissue in the bone marrow. It is characterized by an overgrowth of immature white blood cells called promyelocytes, which accumulate in the bone marrow and prevent the formation of normal white and red blood cells.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nPeople with APL may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Abnormal bleeding and bruising\n* Pale skin (pallor) or excessive tiredness (fatigue)\n* Slow healing from injuries\n* Frequent infections\n* Pain in the bones and joints\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe mutation that causes APL involves two genes: the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RARA gene on chromosome 17. A rearrangement of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17 fuses part of the PML gene with part of the RARA gene, producing a protein called PML-RARα. This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAPL accounts for about 10 percent of acute myeloid leukemia cases and occurs in approximately 1 in 250,000 people in the United States.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for APL, treatment options are available to manage symptoms and prevent complications. These may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and supportive care to address related health issues.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nThe PML-RARA gene fusion accounts for up to 98 percent of cases of APL. Translocations involving the RARA gene and other genes have been identified in a few cases of APL.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n* The PML-RARα protein functions differently than the protein products of the normal PML and RARA genes.\n* The PML-RARα protein interferes with the normal function of both the PML and the RARα proteins, leading to abnormal cell growth and differentiation.\n* APL is most often diagnosed around age 40, although it can be diagnosed at any age.\n\n---\n\n**Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\n**What is Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia?**\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of immature white blood cells called promyelocytes in the bone marrow.\n\n**Causes of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nThe PML-RARα protein plays a crucial role in the development of APL. This protein interferes with the normal function of both the PML and RARα proteins, leading to abnormal proliferation of promyelocytes. The PML-RARA gene fusion accounts for up to 98 percent of cases of APL.\n\n**Symptoms of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nThe symptoms of APL may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n* Loss of appetite\n* Fever\n* Bleeding or bruising easily\n\n**Diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nA diagnosis of APL is typically made through a combination of the following tests:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Genetic testing to identify the PML-RARA gene fusion\n\n**Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nThe treatment of APL usually involves a combination of the following therapies:\n\n* Chemotherapy\n* Radiation therapy\n* Targeted therapy with retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide\n* Bone marrow transplantation in some cases\n\n**Prognosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\nThe prognosis of APL has improved significantly over the years, especially with the introduction of targeted therapies. With proper treatment, most patients with APL can achieve complete remission.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Collins SJ. The role of retinoids and retinoic acid receptors in normal hematopoiesis.

    "content": "**Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung condition that prevents enough oxygen from getting to the lungs and into the blood. Infants can also have respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n**Causes**\n\nARDS can be caused by any major direct or indirect injury to the lung. Common causes include:\n\n*   Breathing vomit into the lungs (aspiration)\n*   Inhaling chemicals\n*   Lung transplant\n*   Pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection\n*   Septic shock (infection throughout the body)\n*   Transfusions (multiple)\n*   Trauma\n\nDepending on the amount of oxygen in the blood and during breathing, the severity of ARDS is classified as:\n\n*   Mild\n*   Moderate\n*   Severe\n\nARDS leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs (alveoli). This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they cannot report symptoms. Symptoms can include any of the following:\n\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fast heartbeat\n*   Low blood pressure and organ failure\n*   Rapid breathing\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nListening to the chest with a stethoscope (auscultation) reveals abnormal breath sounds, such as crackles, which may be signs of fluid in the lungs. Often, blood pressure is low. Blue skin, lips, and nails caused by lack of oxygen to the tissues (cyanosis) is often seen.\n\nTests used to diagnose ARDS include:\n\n*   Arterial blood gas\n*   Blood tests, including CBC (complete blood count) and blood chemistries\n*   Blood and urine cultures\n*   Bronchoscopy in some people\n*   Chest x-ray or CT scan\n*   Sputum cultures and analysis\n*   Tests for possible infections\n\n---\n\n**Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nARDS can be caused by any major direct or indirect injury to the lung.

This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.\n\nThe fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff. This decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine (ventilator) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube).\n\nARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the heart, liver or kidneys. Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors for its development.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they cannot report symptoms.

The goal of treatment is to provide breathing support and treat the cause of ARDS. This may involve medicines to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs.\n\nA ventilator is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and positive pressure to the damaged lungs. People often need to be deeply sedated with medicines. During treatment, your health care providers make every effort to protect your lungs from further damage. Certain ways of using the ventilator can protect your lungs better and improve chances of recovery. Treatment is mainly supportive until the lungs recover.\n\nSometimes, a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is done. During ECMO, blood is filtered through a machine to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.\n\n**What are the possible complications of ARDS?**\n\nProblems that may result from ARDS or its treatment include:\n\n*   Failure of many organ systems\n*   Lung damage, such as a collapsed lung (also called pneumothorax) due to injury from the breathing machine needed to treat the disease\n*   Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung)\n*   Ventilator-associated pneumonia\n\n---\n\n**Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that occurs when the lungs become inflamed and damaged, making it difficult to breathe. It can be caused by various factors, including pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, and burns.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ARDS include:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Rapid heartbeat\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Confusion or altered mental state\n\n**Causes**\n\nARDS can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Sepsis\n*   Trauma\n*   Burns\n*   Aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs\n*   Near-drowning\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for ARDS depends on the underlying cause and may include:\n\n*   Mechanical ventilation to support breathing\n*   Oxygen therapy to help improve oxygen levels in the blood\n*   Medications to reduce inflammation and improve lung function\n*   Fluid replacement to prevent dehydration\n*   Nutritional support to help the body recover\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of ARDS, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the emergency room.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nARDS is also known by other names, including:\n\n*   Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema\n*   Increased-permeability pulmonary edema\n*   Acute lung injury\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you are diagnosed with ARDS, your healthcare provider may provide you with instructions on how to manage your symptoms and recover. These may include:\n\n*   Following a treatment plan to improve lung function and reduce inflammation\n*   Receiving oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation as needed\n*   Participating in physical therapy to help strengthen the lungs and improve breathing\n\n**Images**\n\nThe following images may be helpful in understanding ARDS:\n\n*   Lungs: A diagram of the lungs showing how they become inflamed and damaged in ARDS.\n*   Respiratory system: An illustration of the respiratory system, including the lungs, trachea, bronchi, and diaphragm.\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references may be helpful in learning more about ARDS:\n\n*   Binnie A, Herridge MS, Lee WL.

    "content": "**Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**\n\n**What is ATN?**\n\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney failure. The tubules are tiny ducts in the kidneys that help filter the blood when it passes through the kidneys.\n\n**Causes of ATN**\n\nATN is often caused by a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the kidney tissues (ischemia of the kidneys). It may also occur if the kidney cells are damaged by a poison or harmful substance. Risks for ATN include:\n\n*   Blood transfusion reaction\n*   Injury or trauma that damages the muscles\n*   Low blood pressure (hypotension) that lasts longer than 30 minutes\n*   Recent major surgery\n*   Septic shock (serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure)\n*   Liver disease and kidney damage caused by diabetes (diabetic nephropathy)\n\n**Symptoms of ATN**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Decreased consciousness, coma, delirium or confusion, drowsiness, and lethargy\n*   Decreased urine output or no urine output\n*   General swelling, fluid retention\n*   Nausea, vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Your provider may hear abnormal sounds when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. This is due to too much fluid in the body.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine\n*   Fractional excretion of sodium\n*   Kidney biopsy\n*   Urinalysis\n*   Urine sodium\n*   Urine specific gravity and urine osmolarity\n\n**Treatment of ATN**\n\nIn most people, ATN is reversible. The goal of treatment is to prevent life-threatening complications of acute kidney failure.\n\nTreatment focuses on preventing the buildup of fluids and wastes, while allowing the kidneys to heal.\n\nTreatment may include any of the following:\n\n*   Identifying and treating the underlying cause of the problem\n*   Restricting fluid intake\n*   Taking medicines to help control the potassium level in the blood\n*   Medicines taken by mouth or through an IV to help remove fluid from the body\n\nTemporary dialysis can remove excess waste and fluids. This can help improve your symptoms so that you feel better. It may also make kidney failure easier to control. Dialysis may not be necessary for all people, but is often lifesaving, especially if potassium is dangerously high.\n\nDialysis may be needed in the following cases:\n\n*   Decreased mental status\n*   Fluid overload\n*   Increased potassium level\n*   Pericarditis (inflammation of the sac-like covering around the heart)\n*   Removal of toxins that are dangerous to the kidneys\n*   Total lack of urine production\n*   Uncontrolled buildup of nitrogen waste products\n\n---\n\n**Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**\n\n**What is ATN?**\n\nATN is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney failure.\n\n**Causes of ATN**\n\n*   Lack of blood flow and oxygen to the kidney tissues (ischemia of the kidneys)\n*   Damage to the kidney cells by a poison or harmful substance\n*   Blood transfusion reaction\n*   Injury or trauma that damages the muscles\n*   Low blood pressure (hypotension) that lasts longer than 30 minutes\n*   Recent major surgery\n*   Septic shock (serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure)\n*   Liver disease and kidney damage caused by diabetes (diabetic nephropathy)\n*   Medicines that are toxic to the kidneys, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and the antifungal drug amphotericin\n\n**Symptoms of ATN**\n\n*   Decreased consciousness, coma, delirium or confusion, drowsiness, and lethargy\n*   Decreased urine output or no urine output\n*   General swelling, fluid retention\n*   Nausea, vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests for ATN**\n\n*   Physical exam to check for abnormal sounds when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope\n*   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine tests\n*   Fractional excretion of sodium test\n*   Kidney biopsy\n*   Urinalysis\n*   Urine sodium\n*   Urine specific gravity and urine osmolarity\n\n**Treatment for ATN**\n\n*   Identifying and treating the underlying cause of the problem\n*   Restricting fluid intake\n*   Taking medicines to help control the potassium level in the blood\n*   Medicines taken by mouth or through an IV to help remove fluid from the body\n\n---\n\n**Acute Tubular Necrosis**\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a serious condition that occurs when the kidneys are damaged due to decreased blood flow or oxygen. This can lead to the death of kidney cells, resulting in acute kidney failure.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe underlying cause of ATN may be related to various factors such as:\n\n*   **Decreased blood flow**: Conditions like shock, heart attack, or severe dehydration can reduce blood flow to the kidneys.\n*   **Medications**: Certain medications, especially those used in hospitals, can damage kidney cells.\n*   **Infections**: Severe infections, such as sepsis, can cause ATN.\n*   **Trauma**: Severe injuries, like car accidents or falls, can lead to ATN.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of ATN may include:\n\n*   **Decreased urine output**: A decrease in the amount of urine produced by the kidneys.\n*   **Fluid overload**: The accumulation of excess fluids in the body due to impaired kidney function.\n*   **Increased potassium levels**: Elevated levels of potassium in the blood, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to prevent life-threatening complications of acute kidney failure. Treatment may include:\n\n*   **Identifying and treating the underlying cause**: Addressing the underlying condition that led to ATN.\n*   **Restricting fluid intake**: Limiting fluid consumption to prevent further strain on the kidneys.\n*   **Medications**: Administering medications to help control potassium levels, remove excess fluids, and support kidney function.\n*   **Temporary dialysis**: Using dialysis to remove excess waste and fluids from the body, which can help improve symptoms and make kidney failure easier to manage.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPromptly treating conditions that can lead to decreased blood flow or oxygen to the kidneys can reduce the risk of ATN. Additionally:\n\n*   **Blood transfusions**: Crossmatching blood transfusions to prevent incompatibility reactions.\n*   **Managing underlying conditions**: Effectively managing diabetes, liver disorders, and heart problems to reduce the risk of ATN.\n*   **Monitoring medication levels**: Regularly checking blood levels of medications that can injure kidney cells.\n*   **Drinking plenty of fluids**: Consuming adequate fluids after receiving contrast dyes to prevent kidney damage.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nATN is also known as:\n\n*   Necrosis - renal tubular\n*   ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis)\n*   Necrosis - acute tubular\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on ATN, refer to the following sources:\n\n*   Gunning S, Koyner JL.

    "content": "**Acyclovir Buccal**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAcyclovir buccal is used to treat herpes labialis (cold sores or fever blisters; blisters that are caused by a virus called herpes simplex) on the face or lips. Acyclovir is in a class of antiviral medications called synthetic nucleoside analogues. It works by stopping the spread of the herpes virus in the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAcyclovir buccal comes as a delayed-release buccal tablet to apply to the upper gum in the mouth. The delayed-release buccal tablet is usually applied with a dry-finger within 1 hour after cold sore symptoms (itching, redness, burning or tingling) begin, but before the cold sore appears. It is usually taken as a single (one-time) dose.\n\nTo use buccal acyclovir, follow these steps:\n\n*   Find the area on the upper gum above your left or right incisor teeth (the teeth just to the left and right of your two front teeth) on the side of your mouth with the cold sore.\n*   With dry hands, remove one delayed-release tablet from the container.\n*   Place the flat side of the tablet on your fingertip. Gently apply the rounded side of the tablet to the upper gum area as high as it will go on your gum above one of your incisor teeth on the side of your mouth with the cold sore. Do not apply it to the inside of the lip or cheek.\n*   Hold the tablet in place for 30 seconds.\n*   If the tablet does not stick to your gum or if it sticks to your cheek or the inside of your lip, reposition it to stick to your gum. Leave the tablet in place until it dissolves.\n\nDo not interfere with the placement of the tablet. Check to see if the tablet is still in place after eating, drinking, or rinsing your mouth.\n\nIf the delayed-release buccal tablet comes off within the first 6 hours of application, reapply the same tablet. If it still will not stick, then apply a new tablet. If you accidentally swallow the tablet within the first 6 hours after application, drink a glass of water and place a new tablet on your gum. If the tablet falls off or is swallowed 6 or more hours after application, do not apply a new tablet.\n\nAvoid the following while you are using acyclovir buccal delayed-release tablet:\n\n*   Do not touch, or press the buccal tablet after it has been applied.\n*   Do not chew gum.\n*   Do not wear upper dentures.\n*   Do not brush your teeth until it dissolves. If your teeth need to be cleaned while the tablet is in place, rinse the mouth gently.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDo not use more or less of acyclovir buccal delayed-release tablets than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Acyclovir Buccal: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n    Before using acyclovir buccal, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acyclovir, valacyclovir (Valtrex), any other medications, milk proteins, or any of the ingredients in acyclovir products.

Acyclovir is also sometimes used to prevent outbreaks of genital herpes in people who are infected with the virus. Acyclovir will not cure genital herpes and may not stop the spread of genital herpes to other people.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAcyclovir comes as a tablet, a capsule, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.

Leave the tablet in place until it dissolves.\n\nDo not interfere with the placement of the tablet. Check to see if the tablet is still in place after eating, drinking, or rinsing your mouth.\n\nIf the delayed-release buccal tablet comes off within the first 6 hours of application, reapply the same tablet. If it still will not stick, then apply a new tablet. If you accidentally swallow the tablet within the first 6 hours of application, drink a glass of water and place a new tablet on your gum. If the tablet falls off or is swallowed 6 or more hours after application, do not apply a new tablet until your next regular time.\n\nAvoid the following while you are using acyclovir buccal delayed-release tablet:\n\nDo not chew gum, touch, or press the buccal tablet after it has been applied.\n\nDo not wear upper dentures.\n\nDo not brush your teeth until it dissolves.

Adagrasib is also used in combination with cetuximab (Erbitux) to treat a certain type of colon cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after other treatment(s).
