It involves inserting a long flexible tube with a balloon and a camera attached into the small intestine to visualize its inner lining.\n\n**Types of Enteroscopy**\n\nThere are several types of enteroscopy, including:\n\n*   **Single-balloon enteroscopy**: In this procedure, balloons attached to the endoscope are inflated to allow the doctor to view a section of the small intestine.\n*   **Double-balloon enteroscopy**: This is similar to single-balloon enteroscopy but uses two balloons instead of one.\n*   **Capsule endoscopy**: A disposable capsule containing a camera and transmitter is swallowed, allowing pictures to be taken of the small intestine as it passes through.\n\n**How is Enteroscopy Performed?**\n\nThe procedure typically involves inserting the flexible tube into the mouth for upper enteroscopy or through the rectum for lower enteroscopy. The doctor may also use a colonoscope to examine the colon and reach further into the small intestine.\n\n**Preparation for Enteroscopy**\n\nBefore the procedure, patients are advised not to eat any solid foods or milk products after midnight on the day of the exam. They may have clear liquids until 4 hours before the exam. Occasionally, a laxative is given before the enteroscopy. Patients must also sign a consent form.\n\n**Risks and Complications**\n\nWhile rare, complications from enteroscopy may include excessive bleeding from the biopsy site, hole in the bowel (bowel perforation), infection of the biopsy site leading to bacteremia, vomiting followed by aspiration into the lungs, and blockage in a narrowed intestine. Factors that prohibit use of this test may include uncooperative or confused individuals, untreated blood clotting disorders, and use of medicines that prevent the blood from clotting normally (anticoagulants).\n\n---\n\n**Enteroscopy**\n\n**What is Enteroscopy?**\n\nEnteroscopy is a medical procedure used to diagnose diseases of the small intestine. It involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end into the small intestine through the mouth or rectum.\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, you will be asked to have clear liquids until 4 hours before your exam. Occasionally, a laxative is given before the enteroscopy. Follow your specific instructions.\n\nYou must sign a consent form.\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nYou will be given calming and sedating medicine for the procedure and will not feel any discomfort.

It may be done if you have:\n\n* Abnormal x-ray results\n* Tumors in the small intestine\n* Unexplained diarrhea\n* Unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nIn a normal test result, the doctor will not find sources of bleeding in the small bowel, and will not find any tumors or other abnormal tissue.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal signs during an enteroscopy may include:\n\n* Abnormalities of the tissue lining the small intestine (mucosa) or the tiny, finger-like projections on the surface of the small intestine (villi)\n* Abnormal lengthening of blood vessels (angioectasia) in the intestinal lining\n* Immune cells called PAS-positive macrophages\n* Polyps or cancer\n* Radiation enteritis\n* Swollen or enlarged lymph nodes or lymphatic vessels\n* Ulcers\n\nChanges found on enteroscopy may be signs of disorders and conditions, including:\n\n* Amyloidosis\n* Celiac disease\n* Crohn disease\n* Folate or vitamin B12 deficiency\n* Giardiasis\n* Infectious gastroenteritis\n* Lymphangiectasia\n* Lymphoma\n* Small intestinal angioectasia\n* Small intestinal cancer\n\nTropical sprue\nWhipple disease\n\n**Risks**\n\nComplications are rare but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding from the biopsy site\n* Hole in the bowel (bowel perforation)\n* Infection of the biopsy site leading to bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream)\n* Vomiting, followed by aspiration into the lungs\n* The capsule endoscope can cause a blockage in a narrowed intestine with symptoms of abdominal pain and bloating\n\n**Considerations**\n\nFactors that prohibit use of this test may include:\n\n* Uncooperative or confused person\n* Untreated blood clotting (coagulation) disorders\n* Use of medicines that prevent the blood from clotting normally (anticoagulants)\n\nThe greatest risk is bleeding. Signs of bleeding include:\n\n* Abdominal pain\n* Blood in the stools\n* Vomiting blood\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPush enteroscopy; Double-balloon enteroscopy; Single-balloon enteroscopy; Spiral enteroscopy; Capsule enteroscopy\n\n---\n\n**Enteroscopy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Enteroscopy?**\n\nEnteroscopy is a medical procedure used to examine the small intestine, which is a part of the digestive system. The small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food into the bloodstream.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Enteroscopy**\n\nThere are two main types of enteroscopy:\n\n*   **Capsule Endoscopy**: This involves swallowing a small capsule that contains a camera and a light source. The capsule takes pictures of the inside of the small intestine as it passes through.\n*   **Wireless Capsule Endoscopy**: Similar to capsule endoscopy, but the capsule is equipped with a wireless transmitter that sends images directly to a receiver worn by the patient.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparation for Enteroscopy**\n\nBefore undergoing enteroscopy, patients typically need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Fasting**: Patients are usually required to fast for at least 6 hours before the procedure.\n2.  **Medication**: Certain medications may need to be stopped before the procedure.\n3.  **Clearing the Bowel**: Patients may be given a bowel preparation to clear their bowels of any contents.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks and Complications**\n\nWhile enteroscopy is generally a safe procedure, there are some risks and complications to be aware of:\n\n*   **Allergic Reactions**: Some patients may experience an allergic reaction to the contrast material used during the procedure.\n*   **Bleeding**: There is a small risk of bleeding during or after the procedure.\n*   **Intestinal Perforation**: A rare but serious complication that can occur if the intestine is punctured during the procedure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Images**\n\nHere are some images related to enteroscopy:\n\n*   Small intestine biopsy\n*   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)\n*   Capsule endoscopy",

    "content": "**Entropion**\n\nEntropion is the turning in of an edge of an eyelid. This causes the lashes to rub against the eye. It most often is seen on the lower eyelid.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEntropion can be present at birth (congenital). In babies, it rarely causes problems because the lashes are very soft and do not easily damage the eye. In older people, the condition is most often caused by a spasm or weakening of the muscles surrounding the lower part of the eye.\n\nAnother cause can be trachoma infection, which can lead to scarring of the inner side of the lid. This is rare in North America and Europe. However, trachoma scarring is one of the three leading causes of blindness in the world.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n* Aging\n* Chemical burn\n* Infection with trachoma\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Decreased vision if the cornea is damaged\n* Excessive tearing\n* Eye discomfort or pain\n* Eye irritation\n* Redness\n\n---\n\n**Entropion**\n\nIn most cases, your health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at your eyelids. Special tests are not often necessary.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Artificial tears can keep the eye from becoming dry and may help you feel better.\n*   Surgery to correct the position of the eyelids works well in most cases.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook is most often good if the condition is treated before eye damage occurs.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nDry eye and irritation may increase the risk for:\n\n*   Corneal abrasions\n*   Corneal ulcers\n*   Eye infections\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   Your eyelids turn inward.\n*   You constantly feel as though there is something in your eye.\n\nIf you have entropion, the following should be considered an emergency:\n\n*   Decreasing vision\n*   Light sensitivity\n*   Pain\n*   Eye redness that increases rapidly\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost cases cannot be prevented. Treatment reduces the risk of complications.\n\nSee your provider if you have red eyes after visiting an area where there is trachoma (such as North Africa or South Asia).\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEyelid - entropion; Eye pain - entropion; Tearing - entropion",

    "content": "**Eosinophilic Esophagitis (Part 1/3)**\n\n**What is Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?**\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease of the esophagus. Your esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. If you have EoE, white blood cells called eosinophils build up in your esophagus. This causes damage and inflammation, which can cause pain, trouble swallowing, and food getting stuck in your throat.\n\n**What Causes Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?**\n\nResearchers are not certain about the exact cause of EoE. They think that it is an immune system/allergic reaction to foods or to substances in your environment, such as dust mites, animal dander, pollen, and molds. Certain genes may also play a role in EoE.\n\n**Who Is at Risk for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?**\n\nEoE can affect anyone, but it is more common in people who:\n\n* Are male\n* Have other allergic diseases, such as hay fever, eczema, asthma and food allergies\n* Have family members with EoE\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?**\n\nThe most common symptoms of EoE can depend on your age.\n\n* In infants and toddlers:\n\t+ Feeding problems\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Poor weight gain and growth\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n* In older children:\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Abdominal pain\n\t+ Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n\t+ Poor appetite\n* In adults:\n\t+ Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\n\t+ Food getting stuck in the esophagus\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n\t+ Heartburn\n\t+ Chest pain\n\n---\n\n**Eosinophilic Esophagitis (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Common Symptoms of EoE**\n\nThe most common symptoms of EoE can depend on your age.\n\n* **In infants and toddlers:** \n\t+ Feeding problems\n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Poor weight gain and growth\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n* **In older children:** \n\t+ Vomiting\n\t+ Abdominal pain\n\t+ Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n\t+ Poor appetite\n* **In adults:** \n\t+ Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\n\t+ Food getting stuck in the esophagus\n\t+ Reflux that does not get better with medicines\n\t+ Heartburn\n\t+ Chest pain\n\n**Diagnosing EoE**\n\nTo find out if you have EoE, your doctor will likely:\n\n* Ask about your symptoms and medical history. Since other conditions can have the same symptoms of EoE, it is important for your doctor to take a thorough history.\n* Do an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. An endoscope is a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. Your doctor will run the endoscope down your esophagus and look at it. Some signs that you might have EoE include white spots, rings, narrowing, and inflammation in the esophagus.\n* Do a biopsy. During the endoscopy, the doctor will take small tissue samples from your esophagus. The samples will be checked for a high number of eosinophils. This is the only way to make a diagnosis of EoE.\n* Do other tests as needed. You may have blood tests to check for other conditions. If you do have EoE, you may have blood or other types of tests to check for specific allergies.\n\n**Treatments for EoE**\n\nThere is no cure for EoE. Treatments can manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. The two main types of treatments are medicines and diet.\n\n* **Medicines used to treat EoE:** \n\t+ Steroids, which can help control inflammation.\n\t+ Acid suppressors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which may help with reflux symptoms and decrease inflammation.\n\t+ Monoclonal antibodies, which can reduce inflammation and may help with swallowing. They can be used in adults and children over age 12.\n* **Dietary changes for EoE:** \n\t+ Elimination diet. If you are on an elimination diet, you stop eating and drinking certain foods and beverages for several weeks. If you are feeling better, you add the foods back to your diet one at a time. You have repeat endoscopies to see whether or not you are tolerating those foods.\n\t+ Elemental diet. With this diet, you stop eating and drinking all proteins.

The condition affects the skin on the arms, legs, neck, abdomen, or feet, causing it to swell quickly.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of EF is unknown, but rare cases have occurred after taking L-tryptophan supplements. In people with this condition, white blood cells called eosinophils build up in the muscles and tissues. Eosinophils are linked to allergic reactions, and the syndrome is more common in people aged 30 to 60.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Tenderness and swelling of the skin on the arms, legs, or sometimes the joints (most often on both sides of the body)\n*   Arthritis\n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Thickened skin that looks puckered\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   CBC with differential\n*   Gamma globulins (a type of immune system protein)\n*   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)\n*   MRI\n*   Muscle biopsy\n*   Skin biopsy (the biopsy needs to include the deep tissue of the fascia)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCorticosteroids and other immune-suppressing medicines are used to relieve symptoms.

The cause of epidermoid cysts is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Unknown\n*   Formed when elements of the surface skin get under the skin surface\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptom of an epidermoid cyst is a small, non-painful lump beneath the skin. The lump is usually found on the face, neck, and trunk. It will often have a tiny hole or pit in the center.\n\n*   Small, non-painful lump under the skin\n*   Lump on the face, neck, and trunk\n*   Tiny hole or pit in the center\n\nIf the lump becomes infected or inflamed, other symptoms may include:\n\n*   Skin redness\n*   Tender or sore skin\n*   Warm skin in the affected area\n*   Grayish-white, cheesy, foul-smelling material that drains from the cyst\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nIn most cases, your health care provider can make a diagnosis by examining your skin. Sometimes, a biopsy may be needed to check for other conditions.\n\n*   Examination of the skin\n*   Biopsy (if necessary)\n\nIf infection is suspected, you may need to have a skin culture.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nEpidermoid cysts are not dangerous and do not need to be treated unless they cause symptoms or show signs of inflammation (redness or tenderness). If this occurs, your provider may suggest home care by placing a warm moist cloth (compress) over the area to help the cyst drain and heal.\n\nA cyst may need further treatment if it becomes:\n\n*   Inflamed and swollen -- the provider may inject the cyst with steroid medicine\n*   Swollen, tender, or large -- the provider may drain the cyst or do surgery to remove it\n*   Infected -- you may be prescribed antibiotics to take by mouth\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nEpidermoid cysts may become infected and form painful abscesses. They may return if they are not completely removed by surgery.\n\n*   Infection and formation of painful abscesses\n*   Return of the cyst if not completely removed by surgery\n\n---\n\n**Epidermoid Cyst**\n\n\\n\\n* **Definition**: A benign skin tumor that forms a cyst on the skin.\n* **Causes**: The exact cause of epidermoid cysts is unknown, but they are thought to occur when cells from the skin's surface become trapped beneath the skin.\n\n\\n\\n* **Symptoms**: Epidermoid cysts typically appear as small, rounded bumps under the skin. They may be filled with a thick, cheesy material and can range in color from pink to dark brown.\n* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is usually made by physical examination and medical history.\n\n\\n\\n* **Treatment**: Treatment for epidermoid cysts usually involves surgical removal of the cyst. In some cases, the cyst may be left alone if it is not causing any symptoms or problems.\n\n\\n\\n* **Prevention**: There is no known way to prevent epidermoid cysts from forming.\n\n\\n\\n* **Prognosis**: The prognosis for individuals with epidermoid cysts is generally good, as the condition is benign and can be treated effectively with surgery.\n\n\\n\\n**References**\n\n* Dinulos JGH.

    "content": "**Epidermolysis Bullosa**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThere are 3 main types of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). They are:\n\n*   **Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa**\n*   **Epidermolysis bullosa simplex**\n*   **Junctional epidermolysis bullosa**\n\nEB can vary from minor to fatal. The minor forms cause blistering of the skin. The fatal forms affect other organs. Most types of this condition start at birth or soon after. It can be hard to identify the exact type of EB a person has, although specific genetic markers are now available for most.\n\nFamily history is a risk factor. The risk is higher if a parent has this condition.\n\nAnother rare type of EB is called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. This form develops after birth. It is an autoimmune disorder, which means the body attacks itself.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDepending on the form of EB, symptoms can include:\n\n*   **Alopecia (hair loss)**\n*   **Blisters around the eyes and nose**\n*   **Blisters in or around the mouth and throat, causing feeding problems or swallowing difficulty**\n*   **Blisters on the skin as a result of minor injury or temperature change, especially of the feet**\n*   **Blistering that is present at birth**\n*   **Dental problems, such as tooth decay**\n*   **Hoarse cry, cough, or other breathing problems**\n*   **Tiny white bumps on previously injured skin**\n*   **Nail loss or deformed nails**\n*   **Mitten-like hands or feet**\n*   **Thickening of skin on hands and feet**\n*   **Muscle, heart, brain, gastrointestinal, bone, or kidney issues**\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose EB.\n\nTests that are used to confirm the diagnosis include:\n\n*   **Genetic testing**\n*   **Skin biopsy**\n*   **Special tests of skin samples under a microscope**\n\nSkin tests may be used to identify the form of EB.\n\nOther tests that may be done include:\n\n*   **Blood test for anemia**\n*   **Culture to check for bacterial infection if wounds are healing poorly**\n*   **Imaging studies to look at other organs**\n\nGrowth rate will be checked often for a baby who has or may have EB.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to prevent blisters from forming and avoiding complications. Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is.\n\nHOME CARE\n\nFollow these guidelines at home:\n\n*   **Take good care of your skin to prevent infections.**\n*   **Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use.**\n*   **You may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have swallowing problems. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat.**\n*   **Take good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB.**\n*   **Eat a healthy diet. When you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal. Choose soft foods and avoid nuts, chips, and other crunchy foods if you have sores in your mouth. A nutritionist can help you with your diet.**\n*   **Do exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile.**\n\nSURGERY\n\nSurgery to treat this condition may include:\n\n*   **Skin grafting in places where sores are deep**\n*   **Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing**\n*   **Repair of hand deformities**\n*   **Removal of any squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that develops**\n\nOTHER TREATMENTS\n\nOther treatments for this condition may include:\n\n*   **Medicines that suppress the immune system may be used for the autoimmune form of this condition.**\n*   **Protein and gene therapy and the use of the drug interferon are being studied.**\n\n---\n\n**Epidermolysis Bullosa**\n\n**What is Epidermolysis Bullosa?**\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters form after a minor injury. It is passed down in families.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are 3 main types of EB:\n\n*   Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa\n*   Epidermolysis bullosa simplex\n*   Junctional epidermolysis bullosa\n\nEB can vary from minor to fatal. The minor forms cause blistering of the skin, while the fatal forms affect other organs. Most types of this condition start at birth or soon after.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nFamily history is a risk factor. The risk is higher if a parent has this condition.\n\n**Rare Type of EB**\n\nAnother rare type of EB is called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. This form develops after birth and is an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body attacks itself.\n\n---\n\n**Epidermolysis Bullosa**\n\n**What is Epidermolysis Bullosa?**\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the skin and other organs. It is characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin, which can be caused by minor injury or temperature changes.\n\n**Types of EB**\n\nThere are three main types of EB:\n\n* **Inherited forms**: These forms are inherited from parents and can be severe.\n* **Acquired form**: This form develops after birth and is an autoimmune disorder.\n* **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: A rare type of EB that develops after birth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of EB vary depending on the form and severity of the condition. They may include:\n\n* Alopecia (hair loss)\n* Blisters around the eyes and nose\n* Blisters in or around the mouth and throat, causing feeding problems or swallowing difficulty\n* Blisters on the skin as a result of minor injury or temperature change, especially of the feet\n* Blistering that is present at birth\n* Dental problems, such as tooth decay\n* Hoarse cry, cough, or other breathing problems\n* Tiny white bumps on previously injured skin\n* Nail loss or deformed nails\n* Mitten-like hands or feet\n* Thickening of skin on hands and feet\n* Muscle, heart, brain, gastrointestinal, bone, or kidney issues\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose EB, your healthcare provider will look at your skin. The following tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n* Genetic testing\n* Skin biopsy\n* Special tests of skin samples under a microscope\n* Blood test for anemia\n* Culture to check for bacterial infection if wounds are healing poorly\n* Imaging studies to look at other organs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to prevent blisters from forming and avoiding complications. Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is.\n\nHOME CARE:\n\n* Take good care of your skin to prevent infections.\n* Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw.\n* You may need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas.\n* Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use.\n\nSURGERY:\n\n* Skin grafting in places where sores are deep\n* Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing\n* Repair of hand deformities\n* Removal of any squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that develops\n\nOTHER TREATMENTS:\n\n* Medicines that suppress the immune system may be used for the autoimmune form of this condition.\n* Protein and gene therapy and the use of the drug interferon are being studied.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the severity of the illness. Infection of the blistered areas is common. Mild forms of EB improve with age, while very serious forms have a high death rate. Scarring after blisters form may cause contracture deformities, swallowing problems, fused fingers and toes, and limited mobility from scarring.\n\n---\n\n**Epidermolysis Bullosa**\n\n**What is Epidermolysis Bullosa?**\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the skin and other tissues. It is characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin, which can be caused by minor trauma.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of EB vary depending on the severity of the condition. In general, people with EB experience:\n\n* Blisters on the skin that can range in size from small to large\n* Scarring after blisters form\n* Limited mobility due to scarring and contracture deformities\n* Fused fingers and toes in severe cases\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook for people with EB depends on the severity of the condition. Mild forms of EB may improve with age, while very serious forms have a high death rate. In severe cases, scarring can cause:\n\n* Contracture deformities\n* Swallowing problems if the mouth and esophagus are affected\n* Fused fingers and toes\n* Limited mobility from scarring\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nPeople with EB may experience various complications, including:\n\n* Anemia\n* Reduced life span for severe forms of the condition\n* Esophageal narrowing\n* Eye problems, including blindness\n* Infection, including sepsis (infection in the blood or tissues)\n* Loss of function in the hands and feet\n* Muscular dystrophy\n* Periodontal disease\n* Cardiac problems\n* Kidney failure\n* Severe malnutrition caused by feeding difficulty, leading to failure to thrive\n* Squamous cell skin cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf your infant has any blistering shortly after birth, contact your provider. If you have a family history of EB and plan to have children, you may want to have genetic counseling.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents who have a family history of any form of epidermolysis bullosa. During pregnancy, a test called chorionic villus sampling may be used to test the baby. For couples at high risk of having a child with EB, the test can be done as early as week 8 to 10 of pregnancy.\n\nTo prevent skin damage and blistering, wear padding around injury-prone areas such as the elbows, knees, ankles, and buttocks. Avoid contact sports. If you have EB acquisita and are on steroids for longer than 1 month, you may need calcium and vitamin D supplements to help prevent osteoporosis.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEB; Junctional epidermolysis bullosa; Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa; Hemidesmosomal epidermolysis bullosa; Weber-Cockayne syndrome; Epidermolysis bullosa simplex\n\n**Images**\n\n* Epidermolysis bullosa, dominant dystrophic\n* Epidermolysis bullosa, dystrophic\n\n**References**\n\nDenyer J, Pillay E, Clapham J.

    "content": "**Epidural Abscess**\n\nAn epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by an infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEpidural abscess is usually caused by bacteria, but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found.\n\nAn abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following:\n\n* Chronic ear infections\n* Chronic sinusitis\n* Head injury\n* Mastoiditis\n* Recent neurosurgery\n\nAn abscess in the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess.

    "content": "**Epidural Block - Pregnancy**\n\nAn epidural block is a numbing medicine given by injection (shot) in a specific place in the back. It numbs or causes a loss of feeling in the lower half of your body. This lessens the pain of contractions during childbirth. An epidural block may also be used to reduce pain during surgery on the lower extremities.\n\n**How is the Epidural Given?**\n\nThe block or shot is given into a specific area in your lower back directly over your spine. You may be asked to lie on your side, or you may sit up. Either way, you will be asked to pull your stomach inward and hunch your back outward. Your health care provider (usually an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist) will wash the area of your back and inject a little medicine to numb the spot where the epidural needle is placed:\n\n*   The provider inserts a needle into your lower back.\n*   The needle is placed into a small space outside your spinal cord.\n*   A small soft tube (catheter) is placed into your back, next to your spine.\n*   The needle is removed.\n\nThe numbing medicine is given through the tube for as long as it is needed. In most cases, you will receive a low dose because it is safer for you and baby. Once the medicine takes effect (10 to 20 minutes), you should have less pain due to labor. You may still feel some back or rectal pressure during contractions.\n\nYou may shiver after an epidural, but this is common. Many women shiver during labor even without an epidural.\n\n**Is an Epidural Safe?**\n\nMany studies have shown that an epidural is a safe way to manage pain during childbirth. While rare, there are some risks:\n\n*   Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby's heart rate to slow down.\n*   To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable.\n*   If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body.\n*   Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure.\n\nAn epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery. If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal. Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your provider can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.\n\nOther rare side effects are:\n\n*   You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare.\n*   Medicine could enter your spinal fluid. For a short while, it could make you feel dizzy, or you might have a hard time breathing. You could also have a seizure. This is also rare.\n\n**What Types of Epidurals are There?**\n\nThere are 2 types:\n\n*   \"Walking\" epidural block. This type of epidural will lessen your pain, but you will still be able to move your legs. Most women are not really able to walk around, but they can move their legs.\n*   Combined spinal and epidural block. This combines both a spinal and epidural block. It provides pain relief much faster. The combined block is used when women are in very active labor and want relief right away.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDelivery - epidural; Labor - epidural\n\n---\n\n**Epidural Block - Pregnancy**\n\n**How is the Epidural Given?**\n\nAn epidural block is a numbing medicine given by injection (shot) in a specific place in the back.

Therefore, this type of bleeding is more common in young people.\n*   An EDH can also occur due to rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery.\n*   The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nContact your health care provider for any head injury that results in even a brief loss of consciousness, or if there are any other symptoms after a head injury (even without loss of consciousness).\n\nThe typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an EDH is a loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may not appear in all people.\n\nThe most important symptoms of an EDH are:\n\n*   Confusion\n*   Dizziness\n*   Drowsiness or altered level of alertness\n*   Enlarged pupil in one eye\n*   Headache (severe)\n*   Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Weakness in part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAn EDH is an emergency condition. Treatment goals include:\n\n*   Taking measures to save the person's life\n*   Regulating symptoms\n*   Minimizing or preventing permanent damage to the brain\n\nLife support measures may be required. Emergency surgery is often necessary to reduce pressure within the brain. This may include drilling a small hole in the skull to relieve pressure and allow blood to drain outside the skull.\n\nLarge hematomas or solid blood clots may need to be removed through a larger opening in the skull (craniotomy).\n\nMedicines used in addition to surgery will vary according to the type and severity of symptoms and brain damage that occurs.\n\nAntiseizure medicines may be used to regulate or, ideally, completely prevent seizures. Some medicines called hyperosmotic agents may be used to reduce brain swelling.\n\nFor people on blood thinners or with bleeding disorders, treatments to prevent further bleeding might be needed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAn EDH has a high risk of death without prompt surgical intervention. Even with prompt medical attention, a significant risk of death and disability remains.\n\nPossible Complications\n\nThere is a risk of permanent brain injury, even if EDH is treated quickly. Symptoms (such as seizures) may persist for several months, even after treatment. In time they may become less frequent or disappear. Seizures may begin up to 2 years after the injury.\n\nIn adults, most recovery occurs in the first 6 months. Usually there is some improvement over 2 years.\n\nIf there is brain damage, full recovery isn't likely. Other complications include permanent symptoms, such as:\n\n*   Herniation of the brain resulting in death or permanent coma\n*   Normal pressure hydrocephalus, which can lead to weakness, headaches, incontinence, and difficulty walking\n*   Paralysis or loss of sensation (which began at the time of the injury)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if symptoms of EDH occur.\n\nSpinal injuries often occur with head injuries. If you must move the person before help arrives, try to keep his or her neck and spine still.\n\nContact your provider if these symptoms persist after treatment:\n\n*   Memory loss or problems focusing\n*   Dizziness\n*   Headache\n*   Anxiety\n*   Speech problems\n*   Loss of movement in part of the body\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if these symptoms develop after treatment:\n\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Seizures\n*   Enlarged pupils of the eyes or the pupils are not same size\n*   Decreased responsiveness\n*   Loss of consciousness\n\n---\n\n**Epidural Hematoma**\n\nAn epidural hematoma (EDH) is bleeding between the inside of the skull and the outer covering of the brain (called the dura mater).\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   An EDH is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence.\n*   The membrane covering the brain is not as closely attached to the skull as it is in older people and children younger than 2 years.

It occurs when there is rapid bleeding in the space between the dura and the skull, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and further brain injury.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEDH can be caused by:\n\n*   Severe head injuries, such as those sustained in motorcycle, bicycle, skateboard, snowboarding, or automobile accidents\n*   Less severe blunt trauma, such as getting hit by a baseball\n\nThe affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures. The fractures are most often the result of a severe head injury.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of an EDH typically occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and include:\n\n*   Confusion\n*   Dizziness\n*   Drowsiness or altered level of alertness\n*   Enlarged pupil in one eye\n*   Headache (severe)\n*   Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Weakness in part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe brain and nervous system (neurological) exam may show that a specific part of the brain is not working well. The exam may also show signs of increased ICP, such as:\n\n*   Headaches\n*   Somnolence\n*   Confusion\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\nA non-contrast head CT scan will confirm the diagnosis of EDH and pinpoint the exact location of the hematoma and any associated skull fracture.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007485.htm",
    "content": "**Epidural Injections for Back Pain**\n\nAn epidural steroid injection (ESI) is the delivery of powerful anti-inflammatory medicine directly into the space outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This area is called the epidural space.\n\nESI is not the same as epidural anesthesia given just before childbirth or certain types of surgery.\n\n**Description**\n\nESI is done in a hospital or outpatient clinic. The procedure is done in the following way:\n\n*   You change into a gown.\n*   You then lie face down on an x-ray table. If this position causes pain, you either sit up or lie on your side in a curled position.\n*   The health care provider cleans the area of your back where the needle will be inserted. Medicine may be used to numb the area. You may be given medicine to help you relax.\n*   The provider inserts a needle into your back. The provider likely uses an x-ray machine that produces real-time images to help guide the needle to the correct spot in your lower back.\n*   A mixture of steroid and numbing medicine is injected into the area. This medicine decreases swelling and pressure on the larger nerves around your spine and helps relieve pain. The numbing medicine can also identify the painful nerve.\n*   You may feel some pressure during the injection. Most of the time, the procedure is not painful. It is important not to move during the procedure because the injection needs to be very precise.\n*   You are watched for 15 to 20 minutes after the injection before going home.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nYour provider may recommend ESI if you have pain that spreads from the lower spine to the hips or down the leg. This pain is caused by pressure on a nerve as it leaves the spine, most often due to a bulging disk.\n\nESI is used only when your pain has not improved with medicines, physical therapy, or other nonsurgical treatments.\n\n**Risks**\n\nESI is generally safe. Complications may include:\n\n*   Dizziness, headache, or feeling sick to your stomach. Most of the time these are mild.\n*   Nerve root damage with increased pain down your leg.\n*   Infection in or around your spine (meningitis or abscess).\n*   Allergic reaction to the medicine used.\n*   Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma).\n*   Possible rare brain and nervous system problems.\n*   Difficulty breathing if the injection is in your neck.\n\nTalk to your provider about your risk for complications.\n\nHaving these injections too often may weaken the bones of your spine or nearby muscles. Receiving higher doses of the steroids in the injections may also cause these problems. Because of this, most providers limit people to two or three injections per year.\n\nYour provider will most likely have ordered x-rays, MRI, or CT scan of the back before this procedure. This helps your provider determine the area to be treated.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your provider:\n\n*   If you are pregnant or might be pregnant\n*   What medicines you are taking, including herbs, supplements, and other drugs you bought without a prescription\n\nYou may be told to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. This includes aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and heparin.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may feel some discomfort in the area where the needle was inserted. This should last only a few hours.\n\nYou may be told to take it easy for the rest of the day.\n\nYour pain may become worse for 2 to 3 days after the injection before it begins to improve. The steroid usually takes 2 to 3 days to work.\n\nIf you receive medicines to make you sleepy during the procedure, you must arrange for someone to drive you home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nESI provides short-term pain relief in at least one half of the people who receive it. Symptoms may remain better for weeks to months, but rarely up to a year.\n\nThe procedure does not cure the cause of your back pain. You will need to continue back exercises and other treatments.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   ESI\n*   Spinal injection for back pain\n*   Back pain injection\n*   Steroid injection - epidural\n*   Steroid injection - back\n\n---\n\n**Epidural Injections for Back Pain**\n\n**What is an Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI)?**\n\nAn epidural steroid injection (ESI) is a procedure that delivers powerful anti-inflammatory medicine directly into the space outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord, called the epidural space.\n\n**How is ESI Performed?**\n\nThe procedure is done in the following way:\n\n*   You change into a gown.\n*   You then lie face down on an x-ray table. If this position causes pain, you either sit up or lie on your side in a curled position.\n*   The health care provider cleans the area of your back where the needle will be inserted. Medicine may be used to numb the area. You may be given medicine to help you relax.\n*   The provider inserts a needle into your back. The provider likely uses an x-ray machine that produces real-time images to help guide the needle to the correct spot in your lower back.\n*   A mixture of steroid and numbing medicine is injected into the area. This medicine decreases swelling and pressure on the larger nerves around your spine and helps relieve pain.\n\n**Why is ESI Performed?**\n\nYour provider may recommend ESI if you have pain that spreads from the lower spine to the hips or down the leg. This pain is caused by pressure on a nerve as it leaves the spine, most often due to a bulging disk. ESI is used only when your pain has not improved with medicines, physical therapy, or other nonsurgical treatments.\n\n**Risks of ESI**\n\nESI is generally safe. Complications may include:\n\n*   Dizziness, headache, or feeling sick to your stomach. Most of the time these are mild.\n*   Nerve root damage with increased pain down your leg.\n*   Infection in or around your spine (meningitis or abscess).\n*   Allergic reaction to the medicine used.\n*   Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma).\n*   Possible rare brain and nervous system problems.\n*   Difficulty breathing if the injection is in your neck.\n\nTalk to your provider about your risk for complications. Having these injections too often may weaken the bones of your spine or nearby muscles. Receiving higher doses of the steroids in the injections may also cause these problems. Because of this, most providers limit people to two or three injections per year.\n\n---\n\n**Epidural Injections for Back Pain**\n\n**What is ESI?**\n\nEpidural steroid injection (ESI) is a procedure used to treat back pain caused by inflammation in the epidural space, which is the area around your spinal cord. The injection delivers steroids directly into this space.\n\n**How Does ESI Work?**\n\nThe steroids in the injection help reduce swelling and inflammation in the epidural space, which can cause back pain. By reducing inflammation, the procedure can provide short-term pain relief.\n\n**What to Expect During the Procedure**\n\nBefore the procedure:\n\n*   Tell your provider if you are pregnant or might be pregnant\n*   Inform them about any medicines you are taking, including herbs, supplements, and other drugs you bought without a prescription\n\nYou may be told to temporarily stop taking blood thinners, which includes aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and heparin.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may feel some discomfort in the area where the needle was inserted, which should last only a few hours. You may be told to take it easy for the rest of the day. Your pain may become worse for 2 to 3 days after the injection before it begins to improve. The steroid usually takes 2 to 3 days to work.\n\nIf you receive medicines to make you sleepy during the procedure, you must arrange for someone to drive you home.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nESI provides short-term pain relief in at least one half of the people who receive it. Symptoms may remain better for weeks to months, but rarely up to a year. The procedure does not cure the cause of your back pain. You will need to continue back exercises and other treatments.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   ESI\n*   Spinal injection for back pain\n*   Back pain injection\n*   Steroid injection - epidural\n*   Steroid injection - back",

    "content": "**Epiglottitis**\n\nEpiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, a tissue-lined cartilage that covers the trachea (windpipe) while swallowing. This condition can be life-threatening.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe epiglottis is a stiff, yet flexible tissue at the back of the tongue. It closes the windpipe when you swallow to prevent food from entering the airway.\n\nIn children, epiglottitis is usually caused by Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) type B bacteria. In adults, it's often due to other bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or viruses such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster.\n\nEpiglottitis is now rare in children due to the routine Hib vaccine. It was once most common in kids aged 2-6. Rare cases occur in adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEpiglottitis starts with a high fever and sore throat, followed by:\n\n* Abnormal breathing sounds (stridor)\n* Fever\n* Blue skin color (cyanosis)\n* Drooling\n* Difficulty breathing (requiring an upright position)\n* Difficulty swallowing\n* Voice changes (hoarseness)\n\nThe airways can become totally blocked, leading to cardiac arrest and death.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nEpiglottitis is a medical emergency. Seek help immediately. Don't press the tongue down to examine the throat at home, as this may worsen the condition.\n\nA healthcare provider may use a small mirror or laryngoscope to examine the voice box (larynx). This should be done in an operating room or similar setting where breathing problems can be handled.\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Blood culture or throat culture\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Neck x-ray\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA hospital stay, usually in the ICU, is necessary. Treatment involves methods to help breathe, such as:\n\n* Breathing tube (intubation)\n* Moistened oxygen\n* Surgical airway (tracheostomy) if other measures fail\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n* Antibiotics to treat the infection\n* Anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids) to decrease throat swelling\n* Fluids given through a vein (by IV)\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEpiglottitis can be life-threatening, but with proper treatment, the outcome is usually good.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek immediate medical attention or call 911 if someone has breathing trouble. Difficulty breathing is a late sign that may indicate sudden airway closure or total blockage, which could result in death.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe Hib vaccine protects most children from epiglottitis. If someone in your family is sick with this bacteria, other family members should be tested and treated.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSupraglottitis\n\n---\n\n**Epiglottitis**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nThe epiglottis is a stiff, yet flexible tissue (called cartilage) at the back of the tongue. It closes your windpipe (trachea) when you swallow so food does not enter your airway. This helps prevent coughing or choking after swallowing.\n\nIn children, epiglottitis is usually caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) type B. In adults, it is often due to other bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, or viruses such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster.\n\nEpiglottitis is now very uncommon because the H influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine is given routinely to all children. The disease was once most often seen in children ages 2 through 6. In rare cases, epiglottitis can occur in adults.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nEpiglottitis begins with a high fever and sore throat. Other symptoms may include:\n\n*   Abnormal breathing sounds (stridor)\n*   Fever\n*   Blue skin color (cyanosis)\n*   Drooling\n*   Difficulty breathing (the person may need to sit upright and lean slightly forward to breathe)\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Voice changes (hoarseness)\n\nThe airways can become totally blocked, which can result in cardiac arrest and death.\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nEpiglottitis can be a medical emergency. Seek medical help right away. Do not use anything to press the tongue down to try to look at the throat at home. Doing so may make the condition worse.\n\nThe health care provider may examine the voice box (larynx) using a small mirror held against the back of the throat. Or a viewing tube called a laryngoscope may be used. This examination is best done in the operating room or a similar setting where sudden breathing problems can be more easily handled.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Blood culture or throat culture\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Neck x-ray\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nA hospital stay is needed, usually in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nTreatment involves methods to help the person breathe, including:\n\n*   Breathing tube (intubation)\n*   Moistened (humidified) oxygen\n*   A surgical airway, called tracheostomy, as a last resort if other measures fail\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\n*   Antibiotics to treat the infection\n*   Anti-inflammatory medicines, called corticosteroids, to decrease throat swelling\n*   Fluids given through a vein (by IV)\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nEpiglottitis can be a life-threatening emergency. With proper treatment, the outcome is usually good.\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek immediate medical attention or call 911 or the local emergency number if a person has breathing trouble.\n\nDifficulty breathing is a late, but important sign.

    "content": "**Epilepsy in Children - Discharge**\n\nYour child has epilepsy. People with epilepsy have seizures. A seizure is a sudden brief change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain.\n\n**When Your Child Was in the Hospital**\n\nIn the hospital, the provider gave your child a physical and nervous system exam and did some tests to find out the cause of your child's seizures.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nIf your provider sent your child home with medicines, it is to help prevent more seizures occurring in your child. The medicine can help your child avoid having seizures, but it does not guarantee that seizures will not occur. Your provider may need to change the dosage of your child's seizure medicines or use different medicines if seizures persist despite your child taking the medicines, or because your child is having side effects.\n\n**Activity and Lifestyle**\n\nYour child should get plenty of sleep and try to have as regular schedule as possible. Try to avoid too much stress. You should still set rules and limits, along with consequences, for a child with epilepsy.\n\nMake sure your home is safe to help prevent injuries when a seizure takes place:\n\n*   Keep bathroom and bedroom doors unlocked.\n*   Keep these doors from being blocked.\n*   Make sure your child stays safe in the bathroom. Younger children should not take a bath without someone present. Do not leave the bathroom without taking your child with you. Older children should only take showers.\n*   Put pads on sharp corners of furniture.\n*   Place a screen in front of the fireplace.\n*   Use nonslip flooring or cushioned floor covers.\n*   Do not use freestanding heaters.\n*   Avoid letting a child with epilepsy sleep on the top bunk.\n*   Replace all glass doors and any windows near the ground with either safety glass or plastic.\n*   Plastic cups should be used instead of glassware.\n*   Supervise the use of knives and scissors.\n*   Supervise your child in the kitchen.\n\nMost children with seizures can lead an active lifestyle. You should still plan ahead for the possible dangers of certain activities. These activities should be avoided if a loss of consciousness or control would result in an injury.\n\nSafe activities include jogging, aerobics, moderate cross-country skiing, dancing, tennis, golf, hiking, and bowling. Games and playing in gym class or on the playground are generally OK.\nSupervise your child when swimming.\nTo prevent head injury, your child should wear a helmet during bike riding, skateboarding, downhill skiing, and similar activities.\nChildren should have someone to help them climb on a jungle gym or perform gymnastics.\nAsk your child's provider about your child participating in contact sports.\nAlso ask if your child should avoid places or situations that expose your child to flashing lights or contrasting patterns such as checks or stripes. In some people with epilepsy, seizures can be triggered by flashing lights or patterns.\n\nHave your child carry and take seizure medicines at school. Teachers and others at schools should know about your child's seizures and seizure medicines.\n\nYour child should wear a medical alert bracelet. Tell family members, friends, teachers, school nurses, babysitters, swimming instructors, lifeguards, and coaches about your child's seizure disorder.\n\n**Seizure Medicines**\n\nDo not stop giving your child seizure medicines without talking with your child's provider.\n\nDo not stop giving your child seizure medicines just because the seizures have stopped.\n\nTips for taking seizure medicines:\n\n*   Do not skip a dose.\n*   Get refills before the medicine runs out.\n*   Keep seizure medicines in a safe place, away from young children.\n*   Store medicines in a dry place, in the bottle that they came in.\n*   Dispose of expired medicines properly. Check with your pharmacy or online for a medicine take-back location near you.\n\nIf your child misses a dose:\n\n*   Have them take it as soon as you remember.\n*   If it is already time for the next dose, skip the dose that you forgot to give your child and go back to the schedule. Do not give a double dose.\n*   If your child misses more than one dose, talk with the child's provider.\n\nDrinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs can change the way seizure medicines work. It is never too early to warn your child of this possible problem.\n\nYour provider may need to check your child's blood level of the seizure medicine on a regular basis.\n\nSeizure medicines have side effects. If your child started taking a new medicine recently, or your provider changed your child's dose, these side effects may go away. Always ask your child's provider about any possible side effects. Also, talk to your child's provider about foods or other medicines that can change the blood level of an anti-seizure medicine.\n\n**How to Respond to a Seizure**\n\nOnce a seizure starts, family members and caregivers can help make sure the child is safe from further injury and call for help, if needed. Your child's provider may have prescribed a medicine that can be given during a prolonged seizure to make it stop sooner. Follow instructions on how to give the medicine to the child.\n\nWhen a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the child from injury and make sure the child can breathe well. Try to prevent a fall. Help the child to the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. Turn the child on their side to make sure the child's airway does not get obstructed during the seizure.\n\nCushion the child's head.\nLoosen tight clothing, particularly around the child's neck.\nTurn the child on their side. If vomiting occurs, turning the child on their side helps make sure that they do not inhale vomit into their lungs.\nStay with the child until they recover, or medical help arrives. Meanwhile, monitor the child's pulse and rate of breathing (vital signs).\n\nThings to avoid:\n\n*   Do not restrain (try to hold down) the child.\n*   Do not place anything between the child's teeth during a seizure (including your fingers).\n*   Do not move the child unless they are in danger or near something hazardous.\n*   Do not try to make the child stop convulsing. They have no control over the seizure and are not aware of what is happening at the time.\n*   Do not give the child anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and the child is fully awake and alert.\n*   Do not start CPR unless the child has clearly stopped having the seizure and is still not breathing and has no pulse.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your child's provider if your child has:\n\nSeizures that have been happening more often\nSide effects from medicines\nUnusual behavior that was not present before\nWeakness, problems with seeing, or balance problems that are new\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\nA seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes.\nYour child does not wake up or have normal behavior within a reasonable time after a seizure.\nAnother seizure starts before your child returns to awareness after a seizure ends.\nYour child had a seizure in water or appears to have inhaled vomit or any other substance.\nThe person is injured or has diabetes.\nThere is anything different about this seizure compared to the child's usual seizures.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy in Children - Discharge**\n\nYou've been discharged from the hospital, and your child has been diagnosed with epilepsy. This guide will help you understand what to expect at home and how to care for your child.\n\n**When Your Child Was in the Hospital**\n\nIn the hospital, our team performed a physical and nervous system exam to determine the cause of your child's seizures. We also conducted some tests to identify the underlying issue.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nIf we prescribed medication for your child, it's to prevent future seizures. The medicine can help reduce the frequency of seizures, but it's not a guarantee that they won't occur. We may need to adjust the dosage or switch to different medications if the seizures persist or cause side effects.\n\n**Activity and Lifestyle**\n\nEncourage your child to get plenty of sleep and maintain a regular schedule. Try to minimize stress, and establish clear rules and consequences for your child's behavior.\n\n**Home Safety**\n\nTo prevent injuries during a seizure:\n\n*   Keep bathroom and bedroom doors unlocked.\n*   Ensure young children don't take baths without supervision.\n*   Place pads on sharp furniture corners.\n*   Install screens in front of fireplaces.\n*   Use nonslip flooring or cushioned floor covers.\n*   Avoid freestanding heaters.\n*   Prohibit sleeping on the top bunk.\n*   Replace glass doors and windows with safety glass or plastic.\n*   Use plastic cups instead of glassware.\n*   Supervise knife and scissors use.\n*   Monitor your child in the kitchen.\n\n**Safe Activities**\n\nMost children with epilepsy can lead active lifestyles. However, plan ahead for potential dangers:\n\n*   Jogging\n*   Aerobics\n*   Moderate cross-country skiing\n*   Dancing\n*   Tennis\n*   Golf\n*   Hiking\n*   Bowling\n\nSupervise your child when swimming and wear a helmet during bike riding, skateboarding, downhill skiing, or similar activities. Children should have assistance climbing jungle gyms or performing gymnastics.\n\n**School and Social Activities**\n\nHave your child carry seizure medicines to school. Inform teachers, school nurses, babysitters, swimming instructors, lifeguards, coaches, and family members about their seizure disorder.\n\n**Seizure Medicines**\n\nDon't stop giving your child seizure medicines without consulting their provider.\n\n*   Don't skip doses.\n*   Get refills before the medicine runs out.\n*   Store medicines safely, away from young children.\n*   Dispose of expired medicines properly.\n\nIf your child misses a dose:\n\n*   Have them take it as soon as you remember.\n*   If it's already time for the next dose, skip the missed one and resume the schedule. Don't give a double dose.\n*   If they miss more than one dose, consult their provider.\n\n**Drinking Alcohol and Illegal Drugs**\n\nWarn your child about the potential risks of drinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs, as they can interact with seizure medicines.\n\n**Monitoring Seizure Medicines**\n\nYour provider may need to check your child's blood level of the seizure medicine regularly.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nSeizure medicines can have side effects. If your child experiences new or unusual symptoms, consult their provider. Always ask about possible side effects and discuss foods or other medications that may interact with their anti-seizure medication.\n\n**Responding to a Seizure**\n\nWhen a seizure occurs:\n\n*   Help the child to the ground in a safe area.\n*   Clear the space of furniture or sharp objects.\n*   Cushion the child's head.\n*   Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck.\n*   Turn the child on their side to prevent airway obstruction.\n*   Stay with the child until they recover or medical help arrives.\n\n**Things to Avoid**\n\nDon't:\n\n*   Restrict the child (try to hold them down).\n*   Place objects between their teeth during a seizure.\n*   Move the child unless they're in danger or near hazardous items.\n*   Attempt to stop convulsions; they have no control over the seizure.\n*   Give the child anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and they're fully awake.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your child's provider if:\n\n*   Seizures become more frequent\n*   Side effects from medicines occur\n*   Unusual behavior is present\n*   Weakness, vision problems, or balance issues arise\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes.\n*   The child doesn't wake up or return to normal behavior within a reasonable time after a seizure.\n*   Another seizure occurs before they regain awareness.\n*   The child had a seizure in water or ingested something during the seizure.\n*   Injuries are present, especially if your child has diabetes.\n*   This seizure differs from their usual seizures.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy in Children - Discharge**\n\n**After Your Child Goes Home from the Hospital**\n\nYour child has epilepsy. People with epilepsy have seizures.

These activities should be avoided if a loss of consciousness or control would result in an injury.\n\n* Safe activities include jogging, aerobics, moderate cross-country skiing, dancing, tennis, golf, hiking, and bowling.\n* Games and playing in gym class or on the playground are generally OK.\n* Supervise your child when swimming.\n* To prevent head injury, your child should wear a helmet during bike riding, skateboarding, downhill skiing, and similar activities.\n* Children should have someone to help them climb on a jungle gym or perform gymnastics.\n\n\\n\\n**Participating in Sports**\n\nAsk your child's provider about your child participating in contact sports. Also ask if your child should avoid places or situations that expose your child to flashing lights or contrasting patterns such as checks or stripes. In some people with epilepsy, seizures can be triggered by flashing lights or patterns.\n\n\\n\\n**Medicine and Safety Precautions**\n\nHave your child carry and take seizure medicines at school. Teachers and others at schools should know about your child's seizures and seizure medicines.\n\nYour child should wear a medical alert bracelet. Tell family members, friends, teachers, school nurses, babysitters, swimming instructors, lifeguards, and coaches about your child's seizure disorder.\n\n\\n\\n**Seizure Medicines**\n\nDo not stop giving your child seizure medicines without talking with your child's provider.\n\nDo not stop giving your child seizure medicines just because the seizures have stopped.\n\nTips for taking seizure medicines:\n\n* Do not skip a dose.\n* Get refills before the medicine runs out.\n* Keep seizure medicines in a safe place, away from young children.\n* Store medicines in a dry place, in the bottle that they came in.\n* Dispose of expired medicines properly. Check with your pharmacy or online for a medicine take-back location near you.\n\nIf your child misses a dose:\n\n* Have them take it as soon as you remember.\n* If it is already time for the next dose, skip the dose that you forgot to give your child and go back to the schedule. Do not give a double dose.\n* If your child misses more than one dose, talk with the child's provider.\n\nDrinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs can change the way seizure medicines work. It is never too early to warn your child of this possible problem.\n\nYour provider may need to check your child's blood level of the seizure medicine on a regular basis.\n\nSeizure medicines have side effects. If your child started taking a new medicine recently, or your provider changed your child's dose, these side effects may go away. Always ask your child's provider about any possible side effects. Also, talk to your child's provider about foods or other medicines that can change the blood level of an anti-seizure medicine.\n\n\\n\\n**How to Respond to a Seizure**\n\nOnce a seizure starts, family members and caregivers can help make sure the child is safe from further injury and call for help, if needed. Your child's provider may have prescribed a medicine that can be given during a prolonged seizure to make it stop sooner. Follow instructions on how to give the medicine to the child.\n\nWhen a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the child from injury and make sure the child can breathe well. Try to prevent a fall. Help the child to the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. Turn the child on their side to make sure the child's airway does not get obstructed during the seizure.\n\n* Cushion the child's head.\n* Loosen tight clothing, particularly around the child's neck.\n* Turn the child on their side. If vomiting occurs, turning the child on their side helps make sure that they do not inhale vomit into their lungs.\n* Stay with the child until they recover, or medical help arrives. Meanwhile, monitor the child's pulse and rate of breathing (vital signs).\n\nThings to avoid:\n\n* Do not leave your child unattended during a seizure.\n* Do not try to restrain your child during a seizure.\n* Do not give your child anything to eat or drink during a seizure.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help keep your child safe during a seizure and ensure they receive the proper care.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy in Children - Discharge**\n\n**Protecting Your Child During a Seizure**\n\nWhen a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect your child from injury and make sure they can breathe well. Try to prevent a fall by helping your child to the ground in a safe area. Clear the space of furniture or other sharp objects.\n\n*   Cushion your child's head.\n*   Loosen tight clothing, particularly around their neck.\n*   Turn your child on their side. If vomiting occurs, this position helps ensure they don't inhale vomit into their lungs.\n\n**Things to Avoid**\n\nDon't:\n\n*   Restrict or restrain your child\n*   Place anything between their teeth during a seizure (including your fingers)\n*   Move your child unless they're in danger or near something hazardous\n*   Try to make them stop convulsing; they have no control over the seizure and aren't aware of what's happening\n*   Give them anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and they're fully awake and alert\n*   Start CPR unless they've clearly stopped having the seizure and are still not breathing with no pulse\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your child's provider if:\n\n*   Seizures happen more often\n*   Side effects from medicines occur\n*   Unusual behavior appears that wasn't present before\n*   Weakness, seeing problems, or balance issues arise that weren't there before\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes\n*   Your child doesn't wake up or have normal behavior within a reasonable time after a seizure\n*   Another seizure starts before they return to awareness after a seizure ends\n*   They had a seizure in water or appear to have inhaled vomit or another substance\n*   The person is injured or has diabetes\n*   There's anything different about this seizure compared to their usual seizures\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy in Children - Discharge**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nIf your child is diagnosed with epilepsy, be sure to ask your doctor the following questions:\n\n*   What type of epilepsy does my child have?\n*   What are the best treatment options for my child's specific condition?\n*   How can I help manage my child's seizures and prevent future episodes?\n*   Are there any lifestyle changes or dietary modifications that can help alleviate symptoms?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preventing Head Injuries in Children**\n\nHead injuries can trigger seizures in some children, so it's essential to take precautions to prevent them.

    "content": "**Epilepsy in Children**\n\nEpilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.\n\n**Causes of Epilepsy**\n\nEpilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown. Common causes of epilepsy include:\n\n*   Traumatic brain injury\n*   Damage or scarring after infections of the brain\n*   Birth defects that involve the brain\n*   Brain injury that occurs during or near birth\n*   Metabolic disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria)\n*   Benign or malignant brain tumor, often very small\n*   Abnormal blood vessels in the brain\n*   Stroke\n*   Hereditary conditions (run in families)\n*   Other illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue\n\n**Symptoms of Epilepsy**\n\nSymptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected.\n\nYour child's health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may have:\n\n*   Absence (petit mal) seizure: Staring spells\n*   Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure: Involves the entire body, including aura (specific warning symptoms), rigid muscles, and loss of alertness\n*   Partial (focal) seizure: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts\n\nSome children can have more than one type of seizure. Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it, although that may change over time. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of déjà vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider will:\n\n*   Ask about your child's medical and family history in detail\n*   Ask about the seizure episode\n*   Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system\n\nYour child's provider may order an electroencephalogram (EEG) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.\n\nTo diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to:\n\n*   Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities\n*   Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG)\n\nYour child's provider also may order other tests, including:\n\n*   Blood chemistry\n*   Blood sugar\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Kidney function tests\n*   Liver function tests\n*   Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)\n*   Tests for infectious or metabolic diseases\n\nHead CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for epilepsy includes:\n\n*   Medicines\n*   Lifestyle changes\n*   Surgery\n\nIf your child's epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed.\n\nMedicines to prevent seizures are called antiseizure medicines. They are also known as anticonvulsants or antiepileptic medicines. These may reduce the number of future seizures.\n\nThese medicines are taken by mouth, but some can be given by feeding tube, or intravenously (IV). The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has.\nThe dosage may need to be changed from time to time. Your provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects.\nAlways make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do not stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to your child's provider first.\n\nOther medicines are used to stop a seizure that doesn't stop on its own. These can be given under the tongue or by an injection into the muscle. They are called rescue medicines.\n\nMany antiseizure medicines may affect your child's bone health. Talk to your child's provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements.\n\nEpilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure medicines is called medically refractory epilepsy. In this case, your child's provider may recommend surgery to:\n\n*   Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.\n*   Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.\n\nSome children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child's provider before trying them.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nEpilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include:\n\n*   Taking medicines\n*   Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and avoiding activities that could lead to a fall\n*   Managing stress and sleep\n*   Avoiding alcohol and medicine or illegal drug abuse\n*   Keeping up in school\n*   Managing other illnesses\n\nManaging these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. Be sure to talk with your child's provider if you have concerns.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, your provider may suggest stopping their medicines.\n\nFor many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued.\n\nChildren who have developmental disorders in addition to epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life.\n\nKnowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child's epilepsy.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Difficulty learning\n*   Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia\n*   Irregular heartbeat\n*   Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure\n*   Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)\n*   Side effects of medicines\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\nThis is the first time your child has a seizure\nA seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do)\n\nIf your child has had seizures before, call 911 or the local emergency number for any of these emergency situations:\n\n*   The seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures\n*   The child has repeated seizures over a few minutes\n*   The child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus)\n*   The child gets injured during the seizure\n*   The child has difficulty breathing\n\nContact your child's provider if your child has new symptoms:\n\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Rash\n*   Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion\n*   Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination\n\nContact your child's provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent epilepsy.

Be sure to discuss these options with your child's provider before trying them.\n\n\\n\\n**Managing Epilepsy**\n\nEpilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include:\n\n* Taking medicines\n* Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and avoiding activities that could lead to a fall\n* Managing stress and sleep\n* Avoiding alcohol and medicine or illegal drug abuse\n* Keeping up in school\n* Managing other illnesses\n\nManaging these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. Be sure to talk with your child's provider if you have concerns.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment for Epilepsy**\n\nIf your child's epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed.\n\nMedicines to prevent seizures are called antiseizure medicines. They are also known as anticonvulsants or antiepileptic medicines. These may reduce the number of future seizures.\n\nOther medicines are used to stop a seizure that doesn't stop on its own. These can be given under the tongue or by an injection into the muscle. They are called rescue medicines.\n\nMany antiseizure medicines may affect your child's bone health. Talk to your child's provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements.\n\nEpilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure medicines is called medically refractory epilepsy. In this case, your child's provider may recommend surgery to:\n\n* Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.\n* Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.\n\nSome children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures.

Be sure to talk with your child's provider if you have concerns.\n\n\\n\\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, your provider may suggest stopping their medicines.\n\nFor many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued.\n\nChildren who have developmental disorders in addition to epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life.\n\nKnowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child's epilepsy.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Difficulty learning\n* Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia\n* Irregular heartbeat\n* Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure\n* Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)\n* Side effects of medicines\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\nThis is the first time your child has a seizure\nA seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do)\n\nIf your child has had seizures before, call 911 or the local emergency number for any of these emergency situations:\n\nThe seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures\nThe child has repeated seizures over a few minutes\nThe child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus)\nThe child gets injured during the seizure\nThe child has difficulty breathing\n\nContact your child's provider if your child has new symptoms:\n\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Rash\n* Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion\n* Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination\n\nContact your child's provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy in Children**\n\nIf your child has had seizures before, call 911 or the local emergency number for any of these emergency situations:\n\n*   **Loss of consciousness**: The child becomes unresponsive and cannot regain consciousness between seizures (status epilepticus).\n*   **Injury during seizure**: The child gets injured during the seizure.\n*   **Difficulty breathing**: The child has difficulty breathing.\n\nContact your child's provider if your child has new symptoms:\n\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Rash\n*   Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion\n*   Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination\n\nContact your child's provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy.\n\nReduce the risk of head injury during risky activities by wearing a helmet. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Seizure disorder - children\n*   Convulsion - childhood epilepsy\n*   Medically refractory childhood epilepsy\n*   Anticonvulsant - childhood epilepsy\n*   Antiepileptic drug - childhood epilepsy\n*   AED - childhood epilepsy\n\n**References**\n\n*   Ghatan S.

    "content": "**Epilepsy or Seizures - Discharge**\n\nYou have epilepsy. People with epilepsy have seizures. A seizure is a sudden brief change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nIn the hospital, your provider gave you a physical and a nervous system exam and did some tests to find out the cause of your seizures.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYour provider sent you home with medicines to help keep you from having more seizures. This is because your provider concluded you were at risk of having more seizures. After you get home, your provider may still need to change the dosage of your seizure medicines or add new medicines. This may be because your seizures are not regulated, or you are having side effects.\n\n**Activity and Lifestyle**\n\nYou should get plenty of sleep and try to keep as regular a schedule as possible. Try to avoid too much stress. Avoid alcohol as well as recreational drug use.\n\nMake sure your home is safe to help prevent injuries if a seizure takes place:\n\n* Keep your bathroom and bedroom doors unlocked.\n* Keep these doors from being blocked.\n* Take showers only. Do not take baths because of the risk of drowning during a seizure.\n* When cooking, turn pot and pan handles toward the back of the stove.\n* Fill your plate or bowl near the stove instead of taking all of the food to the table.\n* If possible, replace all glass doors either with safety glass or plastic.\n\nMost people with seizures can have a very active lifestyle. You should still plan ahead for the possible dangers of a certain activity. Do not do any activity during which loss of consciousness would be dangerous. Wait until it is clear that seizures are unlikely to occur. Safe activities include:\n\n* Jogging\n* Aerobics\n* Cross-country skiing\n* Tennis\n* Golf\n* Hiking\n* Bowling\n\nThere should always be a lifeguard or buddy present when you go swimming. Wear a helmet during bike riding, skiing, and similar activities. Ask your provider if it is OK for you to play contact sports. Avoid activities during which having a seizure would put you or someone else in danger.\n\nAlso ask if you should avoid places or situations that expose you to flashing lights or contrasting patterns such as checks or stripes. In some people with epilepsy, seizures can be triggered by flashing lights or patterns.\n\nWear a medical alert bracelet. Tell family, friends, and the people you work with about your seizure disorder.\n\nDriving your own car is generally safe and legal once the seizures are regulated. State laws vary. You can get information about your state law from your provider and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).\n\n**Seizure Medicines**\n\nNever stop taking seizure medicines without talking with your provider. Do not stop taking your seizure medicines just because your seizures have stopped.\n\nTips for taking your seizure medicines:\n\n* Do not skip a dose.\n* Get refills before you run out.\n* Keep seizure medicines in a safe place, away from children.\n* Store medicines in a dry place, in the bottle that they came in.\n* Dispose of expired medicines properly. Check with your pharmacy or online for a medicine take-back location near you.\n\nIf you miss a dose:\n\n* Take it as soon as you remember.\n* Check with your provider about what to do if you miss a dose for more than a few hours. There are many seizure medicines with different dosing schedules.\n* If you miss more than one dose, talk with your provider. Mistakes are very common, and you may miss several doses at some point. So, it may be useful to have this discussion ahead of time rather than when it happens.\n\n**Drinking Alcohol or Doing Illegal Drugs**\n\nDo not drink alcohol if you take seizure medicines. Using alcohol or illegal drugs will change the way your seizure medicines work in your body. This may increase the risk of seizures or side effects.\n\nYour provider may need to do a blood test to measure the level of your seizure medicine. Seizure medicines have side effects. If you started taking a new medicine recently, or your provider changed the dosage of your seizure medicine, these side effects may go away. Always ask your provider about the side effects you may have and how to manage them.\n\nSome seizure medicines can weaken the strength of your bones (osteoporosis). Ask your provider about how to reduce the risk of osteoporosis through exercise and vitamin and mineral supplements.\n\nFor women during childbearing years:\n\n* If you are planning on becoming pregnant, talk to your provider about your seizure medicines beforehand. Some medicines for seizures can interfere with the efficacy of birth control pills.\n* Most women of child bearing potential should take folic acid even if they don't plan on pregnancy. Ask your provider if you should take folic acid.\n* If you get pregnant while taking seizure medicines, talk to your provider right away. Ask your provider if there are certain vitamins and supplements you should take in addition to your prenatal vitamin to prevent birth defects.\n\n**How to Respond to a Seizure**\n\nOnce a seizure starts, there is no way to stop it. Family members and caregivers can only help make sure you are safe from further injury. They can also call for help, if needed.\n\nYour provider may have prescribed a medicine that can be given during a prolonged seizure to make it stop sooner. Tell your family about this medicine and how to give the medicine to you when needed.\n\nWhen a seizure starts, family members or caregivers should try to keep you from falling. They should help you to the ground, in a safe area. They should clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. Caregivers should also:\n\n* Cushion your head.\n* Loosen tight clothing, particularly around your neck.\n* Turn you on your side. If vomiting occurs, turning you on your side helps make sure you do not inhale vomit into your lungs.\n* Stay with you until you recover or medical help arrives. Meanwhile, caregivers should monitor your pulse and rate of breathing (vital signs).\n\nThings your friends and family members should not do:\n\n* Do not restrain you (try to hold you down).\n* Do not place anything between your teeth or in your mouth during a seizure (including their fingers).\n* Do not move you unless you are in danger or near something hazardous.\n* Do not try to make you stop convulsing. You have no control over your seizures and are not aware of what is happening at the time.\n* Do not give you anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and you are fully awake and alert.\n* Do not start CPR unless the seizure has clearly stopped and you are not breathing or have no pulse.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* More frequent seizures than usual, or seizures starting again after being well controlled for a long period.\n* Side effects from medicines.\n* Unusual behavior that was not present before.\n* Weakness, problems with seeing, or balance problems that are new.\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n* This is the first time the person has had a seizure.\n* A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes.\n* The person does not wake up or have normal behavior after a seizure.\n* Another seizure starts before the person has fully returned to a state of awareness, after a previous seizure.\n* The person had a seizure in water.\n* The person is pregnant, injured, or has diabetes.\n* The person does not have a medical ID bracelet (instructions explaining what to do).\n* There is anything different about this seizure compared to the person's usual seizures.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy or Seizures - Discharge**\n\nYou have epilepsy.

    "content": "**Epilepsy**\n\n_Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals._\n\n* People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely.\n* They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness.\n\n**Causes of Epilepsy**\n\nEpilepsy has many possible causes, including:\n\n* Illness\n* Brain injury\n* Abnormal brain development\n\nIn many cases, the cause is unknown.\n\n**Diagnosing Epilepsy**\n\nDoctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy.

    "content": "**Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\nThe epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms. A key feature of these conditions is impairment of language skills (aphasia). The language problems can affect speaking, reading, and writing.\n\n**Conditions in the Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\n*   Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS)\n*   Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS)\n*   Autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD)\n*   Intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD)\n*   Atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS)\n*   Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS)\n\n**Characteristics of LKS and ECSWS**\n\nLKS and ECSWS are at the severe end of the spectrum. Both usually feature a characteristic abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS). This pattern occurs while the affected child is sleeping, specifically during deep (slow-wave) sleep.\n\n**Language Skills in LKS**\n\nMost children with LKS develop normally in early childhood, although some speak later than their peers. However, affected children lose language skills beginning around age 5. This loss typically begins with verbal agnosia, which is the inability to understand speech. As LKS develops, the ability to express speech is also impaired.\n\n**Seizures in LKS**\n\nApproximately 70 percent of children with LKS have seizures, typically of a type described as focal (or partial) because the seizure activity occurs in specific regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain.\n\n**Characteristics of CECTS**\n\nCECTS is at the mild end of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Affected children have rolandic seizures; these seizures are triggered by abnormal activity in an area of the brain called the rolandic region, which is part of the cerebrum. The seizures, which usually occur during sleep, cause twitching, numbness, or tingling of the face or tongue, often causing drooling and impairing speech.\n\n**Other Conditions in the Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\nThe other conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum are less common and fall in the middle of the spectrum. Children with IEAD usually have delayed development or regression of language skills. Some have seizures and most have abnormal electrical activity in their brains during sleep, although it is not prominent enough to be classified as CSWS.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n*   LKS: 1 in 100,000\n*   ECSWS: 1 in 50,000\n*   CECTS: 1 in 10,000\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum are not yet fully understood. However, research suggests that genetic mutations may play a role in the development of these conditions.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nSome forms of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, such as ADRESD, are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS)\n*   Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS)\n*   Autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD)\n*   Intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD)\n*   Atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS)\n*   Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, please consult a healthcare professional or visit reputable health resources such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) or the Epilepsy Foundation.\n\n---\n\n**The Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum?**\n\nThe epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms. A key feature of these conditions is impairment of language skills (aphasia). The language problems can affect speaking, reading, and writing. Another feature of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders is certain patterns of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which are detected by a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Conditions within the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum**\n\nThe conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, which all begin in childhood, include:\n\n*   **Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS)**: LKS and ECSWS are at the severe end of the spectrum. Both usually feature a characteristic abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS). This pattern occurs while the affected child is sleeping, specifically during deep (slow-wave) sleep.\n*   **Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS)**: About half of children with ECSWS develop normally in early childhood, while others have delayed development of speech and motor skills. Although children with ECSWS typically lose a range of previously acquired skills, including those involved in language, movement, learning, or behavior, not everyone with ECSWS has aphasia.\n*   **Autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD)**: ADRESD is characterized by focal seizures, speech difficulties due to dyspraxia, and learning disability.\n*   **Intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD)**: Children with IEAD usually have delayed development or regression of language skills. Some have seizures and most have abnormal electrical activity in their brains during sleep, although it is not prominent enough to be classified as CSWS.\n*   **Atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS)**: ACECTS features seizures and developmental regression that can affect movement, language, and attention. Children with ACECTS have abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is sometimes classified as CSWS.\n*   **Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS)**: CECTS is at the mild end of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Affected children have rolandic seizures; these seizures are triggered by abnormal activity in an area of the brain called the rolandic region, which is part of the cerebrum.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Key features and symptoms**\n\n*   Impairment of language skills (aphasia)\n*   Certain patterns of abnormal electrical activity in the brain\n*   Recurrent seizures (epilepsy)\n*   Mild to severe intellectual disability\n*   Delayed development or regression of language skills\n*   Focal seizures\n*   Speech difficulties due to dyspraxia\n*   Learning disability\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\nThe epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms. A key feature of these conditions is impairment of language skills (aphasia). The language problems can affect speaking, reading, and writing.\n\n* **Patterns of abnormal electrical activity in the brain**: Many people with conditions in this spectrum develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and some have mild to severe intellectual disability.\n* **Conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum**:\n\t+ Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS)\n\t+ Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS)\n\t+ Autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD)\n\t+ Intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD)\n\t+ Atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS)\n\t+ Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS)\n\n**LKS and ECSWS**\n\n* **Severe end of the spectrum**: Both usually feature a characteristic abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS).\n* **Language skills impairment**: Most children with LKS develop normally in early childhood, although some speak later than their peers.

Some have seizures and most have abnormal electrical activity in their brains during sleep.\n* **Developmental regression**: ACECTS features seizures and developmental regression that can affect movement, language, and attention.\n* **Focal seizures**: ADRESD is characterized by focal seizures, speech difficulties due to dyspraxia, and learning disability.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is unknown. Most of the conditions in the spectrum are rare; however, CECTS is one of the most common forms of epilepsy in children, accounting for 8 to 25 percent of cases. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 5,000 children younger than 16.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the GRIN2A gene can cause conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. These variants are more common in the more severe conditions; they are found in up to 20 percent of people with LKS or ECSWS and about 5 percent of people with CECTS. In affected people without a GRIN2A gene variant, the cause of the condition is unknown. Some affected individuals have a brain abnormality that may contribute to the condition. Researchers suspect that changes in other, unidentified genes may also be associated with epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders.\n\n**GRIN2A Gene**\n\nThe GRIN2A gene provides instructions for making the GluN2A protein, which is one component (subunit) of a subset of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors transmit signals that turn on nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Signaling through these receptors is involved in normal brain development, changes in the brain in response to experience (synaptic plasticity), learning, and memory.\n\n**Variants in GRIN2A Gene**\n\nVariants in the GRIN2A gene lead to altered NMDA receptor signaling in the brain. As a result, neurons may be abnormally turned on, which can cause seizures and other abnormal brain activity and may lead to death of the neurons.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\n**Causes of the Condition**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the GRIN2A gene can cause conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum.

Changes in GluN2A appear to particularly affect signaling in regions of the brain involved in speech and language and disrupt brain activity during slow-wave sleep.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nConditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum that are caused by GRIN2A gene variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Individuals with an epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorder may have family members with a condition in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum or a related disorder such as isolated seizures or speech and language problems.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Acquired aphasia with epilepsy\n* DEE/EE-SWAS\n* Developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in Sleep\n* Epilepsy with continuous spike-wave in sleep\n* Epilepsy with electrographic status epilepticus in sleep\n* FESD\n* Focal epilepsies with speech and language disorders\n* Focal epilepsy with speech disorder and with or without mental retardation\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\nThe epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a group of disorders characterized by seizures, language difficulties, and varying degrees of intellectual disability.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nResearch has identified several genetic variants associated with the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, including mutations in the GRIN2A gene. These mutations can cause idiopathic focal epilepsy with rolandic spikes, acquired epileptic aphasia, and related childhood focal epilepsies and encephalopathies with speech and language dysfunction.\n\n**Clinical Features**\n\nThe clinical features of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum vary widely among individuals but often include:\n\n*   Seizures\n*   Language difficulties\n*   Varying degrees of intellectual disability\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis of a genetic condition depends on various factors, including the specific disorder, its severity, and the presence of any associated medical conditions. In some cases, early intervention and treatment can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nGenetic disorders can be inherited in different ways, including:\n\n*   Autosomal dominant: One copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n*   Autosomal recessive: Two copies of the mutated gene are needed to develop the condition.\n*   X-linked: The condition is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome and typically affects males.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThe treatment and management of genetic conditions depend on the specific disorder, its severity, and the presence of any associated medical conditions. In some cases, early intervention and treatment can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nGenetic variants can affect health and development in various ways, including:\n\n*   Altering the function of proteins\n*   Affecting the structure of cells\n*   Influencing the risk of developing certain disorders\n\nBy understanding genetics, individuals can better appreciate the complexities of genetic inheritance and make informed decisions about their health.\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Aphasia**\n* **Epilepsy**\n* **Genetic Disorders**\n* **Speech and Communication Disorders**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n* How can gene variants affect health and development?\n* What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n* What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n* How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum**\n\nThis spectrum refers to a group of disorders characterized by epilepsy, aphasia, and varying degrees of intellectual disability.

    "content": "**Epilepsy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nEpilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.)\n\nEpilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic).\n\n* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n* Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease\n* Traumatic brain injury\n* Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS\n* Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect)\n* Brain injury that occurs during or near birth\n* Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria)\n* Brain tumor\n* Abnormal blood vessels in the brain\n* Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue\n* Seizure disorders that run in families (hereditary epilepsy)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nEpileptic seizures can happen to anyone at any age. However, they're more common in young children and people age 65 years and older. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.\n\n* Symptoms vary from person to person.\n* Some people may have simple staring spells.\n* Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness (convulsion).\n* The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at brain and nervous system function.\n\n* An electroencephalogram (EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain.\n* People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test.\n* In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start.\n* The brain's electrical activity may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for epilepsy includes taking medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery.\n\n* If epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery to treat these disorders may make the seizures stop.\n* Medicines to prevent seizures, called anticonvulsants (or antiepileptic medicines), may reduce the number of future seizures:\n\t+ These medicines are taken by mouth. Which type you are prescribed depends on the type of seizures you have.\n\t+ Your dosage may need to be changed from time to time. You may need regular blood tests to check for side effects.\n\t+ Always take your medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause you to have a seizure. Do not stop taking or change medicines on your own. Talk to your provider first.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nMany epilepsy medicines may affect the health of your bones. Talk to your provider about whether you need vitamins and other supplements.\n\n* Lifestyle or medical changes can increase the risk for a seizure in adults and children with epilepsy. Talk with your provider about:\n\t+ New prescribed medicines, vitamins, or supplements\n\t+ Emotional stress\n\t+ Illness, especially infection\n\t+ Lack of sleep\n\t+ Pregnancy\n\t+ Skipping doses of epilepsy medicines\n\t+ Use of alcohol or other recreational drugs\n\t+ Exposure to flickering lights or stimuli\n\t+ Hyperventilation\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of having epilepsy or being a caretaker of someone with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSome people with epilepsy may be able to reduce or even stop their anti-seizure medicines after having no seizures for several years. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s.\n\nFor many people, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, anti-seizure medicines need to be continued. There is a very low risk for sudden death with epilepsy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Difficulty learning\n* Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia\n* Injury from falls, bumps, self-inflicted bites, driving or operating machinery during a seizure\n* Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)\n* Side effects of medicines\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\nThis is the first time a person has a seizure.\nA seizure occurs in someone who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do).\n\nIn the case of someone who has had seizures before, call 911 or the local emergency number for any of these emergency situations:\n\nThis is a longer seizure than the person normally has, or an unusual number of seizures for the person.\nRepeated seizures over a few minutes.\nRepeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus).\n\nContact your provider if any new symptoms occur:\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy**\n\nEpilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal electrical activity of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior such as bodily movements.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEpilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic).\n\nCommon causes of epilepsy include:\n\n* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n* Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease\n* Traumatic brain injury\n* Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS\n* Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect)\n* Brain injury that occurs during or near birth\n* Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria)\n* Brain tumor\n* Abnormal blood vessels in the brain\n* Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue\n* Seizure disorders that run in families (hereditary epilepsy)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness (convulsion). The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected.\n\nMost of the time, for people with epilepsy, their seizures are similar to ones before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura.\n\nYour health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have:\n\n* Absence seizures (also called non-motor seizures) include seizures involving a change in behavior but without changes in motor movement (such as staring spells). They may occur along with generalized seizures.\n* Focal onset seizures may occur with no change in awareness. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected. These seizures may spread to the whole brain.\n* Generalized seizures involve both sides of the brain and cause impaired awareness. Abnormal movements involving the whole body are often present. Clenching of the jaw and losing control of the urine or bowels may occur.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at brain and nervous system function.\n\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain.

Check your state's law about which people with a history of seizures are allowed to drive.\n\nDo not use machinery or do activities that require constant awareness, such as climbing to high places, biking, and swimming alone. Having a seizure during these activities can result in serious injury and death.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of having epilepsy or being a caretaker of someone with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nSome people with epilepsy may be able to reduce or even stop their anti-seizure medicines after having no seizures for several years. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s.\n\nFor many people, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, anti-seizure medicines need to be continued. There is a very low risk for sudden death with epilepsy.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Difficulty learning\n*   Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia\n*   Injury from falls, bumps, self-inflicted bites, driving or operating machinery during a seizure\n*   Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)\n*   Side effects of medicines\n\n---\n\n**Epilepsy**\n\n**What is Epilepsy?**\n\nEpilepsy is a group of brain disorders characterized by recurrent seizures.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nRepeated seizures over a few minutes.\nRepeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus).\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n* This is the first time a person has a seizure.\n* A seizure occurs in someone who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do).\n* In the case of someone who has had seizures before, call 911 or the local emergency number for any of these emergency situations:\n\t+ This is a longer seizure than the person normally has, or an unusual number of seizures for the person.\n\t+ Repeated seizures over a few minutes.\n\t+ Repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus).\n\nContact your provider if any new symptoms occur:\n\n* Loss of hair\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Rash\n* Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, sedation\n* Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep, and staying away from alcohol and illegal drugs may decrease the likelihood of triggering seizures in people with epilepsy.\n\nReduce the risk for head injury by wearing a helmet during risky activities. This can lessen the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSeizure disorder; Epileptic - epilepsy\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* Brain surgery - discharge\n* Epilepsy in adults - what to ask your doctor\n* Epilepsy in children - discharge\n* Epilepsy in children - what to ask your doctor\n* Epilepsy or seizures - discharge \n* Febrile seizures - what to ask your doctor\n* Stereotactic radiosurgery - discharge\n\n**Images**\n\n* Brain structures\n* Limbic system\n* Role of the vagus nerve in epilepsy\n* Central nervous system and peripheral nervous system\n* Convulsions - first aid - series\n\n**References**\n\nAbou-Khalil BW, Gallagher MJ, Macdonald RL.

The causes of epilepsy are varied and can include genetic predisposition, head trauma, infections, tumors, and stroke.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Seizures**\n\nThere are several types of seizures, including:\n\n*   **Tonic-clonic seizures**: These are the most common type of seizure and involve both muscle stiffening (tonic) and convulsions (clonic).\n*   **Absence seizures**: These seizures are characterized by a brief loss of consciousness and can cause the person to appear \"daydreaming\" or \"spacey.\"\n*   **Myoclonic seizures**: These seizures cause sudden, brief muscle contractions.\n*   **Partial seizures**: These seizures affect only one part of the brain and can cause a range of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, or weakness in specific areas of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosing Epilepsy**\n\nTo diagnose epilepsy, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and order imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan to rule out other possible causes of seizures. In some cases, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be ordered to measure the electrical activity in the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment for epilepsy depends on the underlying cause of the seizures and can include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Anticonvulsant medications are commonly used to treat epilepsy.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a tumor or other abnormality in the brain that is causing the seizures.\n*   **Vagus nerve stimulation**: This treatment involves implanting a device that stimulates the vagus nerve, which can help reduce seizure frequency.\n*   **Dietary changes**: Some people with epilepsy find that making specific dietary changes, such as following the ketogenic diet, helps reduce their seizure frequency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Living with Epilepsy**\n\nWhile living with epilepsy can present challenges, many people are able to manage their condition and lead active, fulfilling lives. By working closely with a healthcare provider and making informed treatment decisions, individuals with epilepsy can effectively manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.",

    "content": "**Epinastine Ophthalmic**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOphthalmic epinastine is used to prevent itching of the eyes caused by allergic conjunctivitis (a condition in which the eyes become itchy, swollen, red, and teary when they are exposed to certain substances in the air). Epinastine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by preventing the release of natural substances which cause allergic reactions in the eyes.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nOphthalmic epinastine comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually instilled twice a day. Use epinastine eye drops at around the same times every day, usually morning and evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use epinastine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nEpinastine eye drops are only for use in the eyes. Do not swallow this medication.\n\nEpinastine eye drops control the itching of allergic conjunctivitis only when they are used regularly. Epinastine eye drops will not work if you use them only when you experience symptoms. Continue to use epinastine eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using epinastine eye drops without talking to your doctor.\n\nWhen you apply epinastine eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nTo instill the eye drops, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n*   Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.\n*   Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.\n*   While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.\n*   Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.\n*   Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.\n*   While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.\n*   Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.\n*   Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.\n*   Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.\n*   If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.\n*   Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.\n*   Wash your hands to remove any medication.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nWhen you apply epinastine eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to use epinastine eye drops at around the same times every day, use them as soon as you remember.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a603002.html",
    "content": "**Epinephrine Injection**\n\n**What is Epinephrine Injection?**\n\nEpinephrine injection is used along with emergency medical treatment to treat life-threatening allergic reactions caused by insect bites or stings, foods, medications, latex, and other causes. It is also used to treat life-threatening low blood pressure associated with septic shock (a serious condition caused by a body-wide infection that can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure) in hospitalized adults.\n\n**How Should I Use Epinephrine Injection?**\n\nEpinephrine injection comes as a prefilled automatic injection device containing a solution (liquid) and in vials to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle) to treat life-threatening allergic reactions. It is usually injected as needed at the first sign of a serious allergic reaction.\n\nUse epinephrine injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nYou should always keep 2 automatic injection devices with you or available at all times because one dose of epinephrine may not be enough to treat a serious allergic reaction. Keep your automatic injection devices with you or available at all times so that you will be able to inject epinephrine quickly when an allergic reaction begins.\n\nBe aware of the expiration date stamped on the device and replace the devices when this date passes. Look at the solution in the devices from time to time. If the solution is discolored or contains particles, call your doctor to get a new injection device.\n\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\nEpinephrine injection helps to treat serious allergic reactions but does not take the place of medical treatment. Get emergency medical treatment immediately after you inject epinephrine. Rest quietly while you wait for emergency medical treatment.\n\nSome common side effects of epinephrine injection include:\n\n*   Closing of the airways\n*   Wheezing\n*   Sneezing\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Rash\n*   Hives\n*   Itching\n*   Swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, hands; skin redness; fast heartbeat; weak pulse; anxiety; confusion; stomach pain; vomiting; diarrhea; losing control of urine or bowel movements; faintness; seizures; or loss of consciousness.\n\n**What Should I Know About Storage and Disposal of This Medication?**\n\nMost automatic injection devices contain enough solution for one dose of epinephrine. If your symptoms continue or return after the first injection, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose of epinephrine injection with a new injection device.\n\nBe sure that you know how to inject the second dose and how to tell whether you should inject a second dose. Only a healthcare provider should give more than 2 injections for a single allergic episode.\n\nAfter you inject a dose of epinephrine injection, some solution will remain in the injection device. This is normal and does not mean that you did not receive the full dose. Do not use the extra liquid; dispose of the remaining liquid and device properly. Take the used device with you to the emergency room or ask your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider how to dispose of used injection devices safely.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**Epinephrine Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n*   **Use and Administration**\n    *   Use epinephrine injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.\n    *   Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you and any of your caregivers who could be injecting the medication how to use the prefilled automatic injection device. Training devices are available to practice how to use the automatic injection device during an emergency.\n    *   Before you use epinephrine injection for the first time, read the patient information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use the prefilled automatic injection device. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you or your caregivers have any questions about how to inject this medication.\n\n**Recognizing and Treating Serious Allergic Reactions**\n\n*   You should inject epinephrine injection as soon as you suspect that you may be experiencing a serious allergic reaction.\n*   Signs of a serious allergic reaction include closing of the airways; wheezing; sneezing; hoarseness; rash; hives; itching; swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, hands; skin redness; fast heartbeat; weak pulse; anxiety; confusion; stomach pain; vomiting; diarrhea; losing control of urine or bowel movements; faintness; seizures; or loss of consciousness.\n*   Talk to your doctor about these symptoms and be sure you understand how to tell when you are having a serious allergic reaction and should inject epinephrine.\n\n**Using Epinephrine Injection Devices**\n\n*   You should always keep 2 automatic injection devices with you or available at all times because one dose of epinephrine may not be enough to treat a serious allergic reaction.\n*   Keep your automatic injection devices with you or available at all times so that you will be able to inject epinephrine quickly when an allergic reaction begins.\n*   Be aware of the expiration date stamped on the device and replace the devices when this date passes. Look at the solution in the devices from time to time. If the solution is discolored or contains particles, call your doctor to get a new injection device.\n\n**Additional Instructions**\n\n*   Most automatic injection devices contain enough solution for one dose of epinephrine.\n*   If your symptoms continue or return after the first injection, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose of epinephrine injection with a new injection device. Be sure that you know how to inject the second dose and how to tell whether you should inject a second dose. Only a healthcare provider should give more than 2 injections for a single allergic episode.\n*   Epinephrine injection helps to treat serious allergic reactions but does not take the place of medical treatment. Get emergency medical treatment immediately after you inject epinephrine. Rest quietly while you wait for emergency medical treatment.\n\n**Proper Injection Technique**\n\n*   Epinephrine should be injected only in the middle of the outer side of the thigh, and can be injected through clothing if necessary in an emergency.\n*   If you are injecting epinephrine to a young child who may move during the injection, hold their leg firmly in place and limit the child's movement before and during the injection. Do not inject epinephrine into the buttocks or any other part of your body such as fingers, hands, or feet or into a vein.\n*   Do not put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the needle area of the automatic injection device.

    "content": "**Episiotomy - Aftercare**\n\nAn episiotomy is a minor incision made during childbirth to widen the opening of the vagina. A perineal tear or laceration often forms on its own during a vaginal birth. Rarely, this tear will also involve the muscle around the anus or the rectum.\n\nBoth episiotomies and perineal lacerations require stitches to repair and ensure the best healing. Both are similar in recovery time and discomfort during healing.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nMost women heal after an episiotomy without problems, although it may take many weeks. Your stitches do not need to be removed. Your body will absorb them. You can return to normal activities when you feel ready, such as light office work or house cleaning. Wait 6 weeks before you:\n\n* Use tampons\n* Have sexual intercourse\n* Do any other activity that might rupture (break) the stitches\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTo relieve pain or discomfort:\n\n* Ask your nurse to apply ice packs right after the birth. Using ice packs in the first 24 hours after birth decreases the swelling and helps with pain.\n* Take warm baths but wait until 24 hours after you have given birth. Make sure that the bathtub is cleaned with a disinfectant before every bath.\n* Take medicine like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve pain.\n\nYou can do many other things to help speed up the healing process, such as:\n\n* Use sitz baths (sit in water that covers your vulvar area) a few times a day. Wait until 24 hours after you have given birth to take a sitz bath as well.\n* Change your pads every 2 to 4 hours.\n* Keep the area around the stitches clean and dry. Pat the area dry with a clean towel after you bathe.\n* After you urinate or have a bowel movement, spray warm water over the area and pat dry with a clean towel or baby wipe. Do not use toilet paper.\n\nTake stool softeners and drink lots of water. This will prevent constipation. Eating lots of fiber will also help. Your health care provider can suggest foods with plenty of fiber.\n\nDo Kegel exercises. Squeeze the muscles that you use to hold in urine for 5 minutes. Do this 10 times a day throughout the day.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Your pain gets worse.\n* You go for 4 or more days without a bowel movement.\n* You pass a blood clot larger than a walnut.\n* You have a discharge with a bad odor.\n* The wound seems to break open.\n\n---\n\n**Episiotomy - Aftercare**\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nMost women heal after an episiotomy without problems, although it may take many weeks.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nTo relieve pain or discomfort:\n\n* Ask your nurse to apply ice packs right after the birth.

If you prefer, you can sit in this kind of tub instead of climbing into the bathtub.\n* Change your pads every 2 to 4 hours.\n* Keep the area around the stitches clean and dry. Pat the area dry with a clean towel after you bathe.\n* After you urinate or have a bowel movement, spray warm water over the area and pat dry with a clean towel or baby wipe.

Here are some general tips:\n\n*   **Rest**: Take it easy for a few days after delivery. Avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities.\n*   **Pain management**: Your healthcare provider may prescribe pain medication to help manage any discomfort or pain.\n*   **Wound care**: Keep the episiotomy site clean and dry. You can use a warm compress or a sitz bath to help soothe the area.\n*   **Hygiene**: Practice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:\n\n*   Increased redness, swelling, or discharge from the episiotomy site\n*   Fever over 101.5°F (38.6°C)\n*   Severe pain that is not relieved by medication\n*   Difficulty urinating or passing stools\n\n**Postpartum Care**\n\nAfter delivery, you will need to take care of yourself and your newborn. Here are some general tips:\n\n*   **Breastfeeding**: If you plan to breastfeed, start expressing milk within 30 minutes after delivery.\n*   **Newborn care**: Learn how to change diapers, bathe, and dress your baby.\n*   **Emotional support**: Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're feeling overwhelmed or need emotional support.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Childbirth\n*   Postpartum Care",

It is a cut to the perineum -- the skin and muscles between the vaginal opening and anus.\n\n**What are the Risks?**\n\nThere are some risks to having an episiotomy. Because of the risks, episiotomies are not as common as they used to be. The risks include:\n\n*   The cut may tear and become larger during the delivery. The tear may reach into the muscle around the rectum, or even into the rectum itself.\n*   There may be more blood loss.\n*   The cut and the stitches may get infected.\n*   Sex may be painful for the first few months after birth.\n\n**Will I Need an Episiotomy?**\n\nMany women get through childbirth without tearing the tissue around the vagina on their own, and without needing an episiotomy. In fact, recent studies show that not having an episiotomy is best for most women in labor.\n\nEpisiotomies don't heal better than tears. They often take longer to heal since the cut is often deeper than a natural tear. In both cases, the cut or tear must be stitched and properly cared for after childbirth. At times, an episiotomy may be needed to ensure the best outcome for you and your baby such as when:\n\n*   Labor is stressful for the baby and the pushing phase needs to be shortened to decrease problems for the baby.\n*   The baby's head or shoulders are too big for the mother's vaginal opening.\n*   The baby is in a breech position (feet or buttocks coming first) and there is a problem during delivery.\n*   Instruments (forceps or vacuum extractor) are needed to help get the baby out.\n*   You are pushing as the baby's head is close to coming out, and a tear forms toward the urethral area.\n\n**What Happens if I Need an Episiotomy?**\n\nJust before your baby is born and as the head is about to crown, your doctor or midwife will give you a shot to numb the area (if you have not already had an epidural).\n\nNext, a small incision (cut) is made. There are 2 types of cuts: median and mediolateral.\n\n*   A median incision is the most common type. It is a straight cut in the middle of the area between the vagina and anus (perineum).\n*   The mediolateral incision is made at an angle. It is less likely to tear through to the anus, but it takes longer to heal than the median cut.\n\nYour doctor or midwife will then deliver the baby through the enlarged opening.\n\nNext, your doctor or midwife will deliver the placenta (afterbirth). Then the cut will be stitched closed.\n\n**How can I Avoid an Episiotomy?**\n\nYou can do things to strengthen your body for labor that may lower your chances of needing an episiotomy.\n\n*   Practice Kegel exercises.\n*   Perform perineal massage during the 4 to 6 weeks before birth.\n*   Practice the techniques you learned in childbirth class to control your breathing and your urge to push.\n\nKeep in mind, even if you do these things, you may still need an episiotomy.

The incision is usually made at the back of the vaginal opening and extends downward towards the anus.\n\n**Recovery After an Episiotomy**\n\nAfter an episiotomy, the mother may experience some discomfort, swelling, and bleeding in the perineal area.

    "content": "**Epithelial Cells in Urine**\n\n**What is an Epithelial Cells in Urine Test?**\n\nAn epithelial cells in urine test looks at a sample of your urine under a microscope to count the number of epithelial cells. It's normal to have a small number of certain types of epithelial cells in urine, but a large number may be a sign of a urinary tract infection, kidney disease, or other serious medical condition.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nAn epithelial cells in urine test is part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different substances in your urine. It may be part of a routine checkup, or your health care provider may order the test if you have signs of a urinary tract problem.\n\n**Why Do I Need an Epithelial Cells in Urine Test?**\n\nYour provider may have ordered an epithelial cells in urine test as part of your routine checkup or if your visual or chemical urine test results weren't normal. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of a urinary or kidney disorder, such as:\n\n* Frequent and/or painful urination\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Back pain\n* Blood in your urine\n\n**What Happens During an Epithelial Cells in Urine Test?**\n\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample.\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n* Open the container without touching the inside.\n* Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n\t+ For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n\t+ For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n* Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n* Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n* Finish urinating into the toilet.\n* Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nIf your provider has ordered other urine or blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. You may also need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having the test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults are often reported as a general amount, such as \"few,\" moderate,\" or \"many\" cells. A normal result is typically \"few\" cells. \"Moderate\" or \"many\" cells may be a sign of a medical condition, such as:\n\n* Urinary tract infection\n* Yeast infection\n* Kidney disease\n* Liver disease\n* Certain types of cancer\n\nIf your results are not normal, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. You may need more tests before your provider can make a diagnosis.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About an Epithelial Cells in Urine Test?**\n\nThree types of epithelial cells line the urinary tract: transitional cells, renal (kidney) tubular cells, and squamous cells.

They come from the lining of the kidneys, bladder, and ureters. In a healthy person, there are usually no or only a few epithelial cells present in the urine.\n\n**Why are epithelial cells important?**\n\nThe presence of epithelial cells in urine can indicate various health issues, such as:\n\n* **Kidney stones**: Epithelial cells may be present in the urine when kidney stones are forming.\n* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Bacteria can cause epithelial cells to become infected and inflamed, leading to UTIs.\n* **Bladder cancer**: In some cases, epithelial cells in urine may indicate bladder cancer.\n\n**How are epithelial cells detected?**\n\nEpithelial cells can be detected through a urinalysis test, which involves examining a urine sample under a microscope. The presence of epithelial cells can help diagnose various health issues related to the kidneys and urinary tract.\n\n**What should I do if I have questions about my health?**\n\nIf you have questions about your health or are concerned about the presence of epithelial cells in your urine, contact a healthcare provider for professional advice and care.",

    "content": "**Benign Positional Vertigo: The Epley Maneuver**\n\nBenign positional vertigo, also known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), is a problem in the inner ear that causes vertigo. Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you.\n\n**What Causes BPPV?**\n\nBPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium, called canaliths, break free and float inside small canals in your inner ear. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position, which causes vertigo.\n\n**The Epley Maneuver: A Series of Head Movements**\n\nThe Epley maneuver is a series of head movements used to relieve symptoms of BPPV. The maneuver involves the following steps:\n\n*   Turn your head toward the side that causes vertigo.\n*   Quickly lay you down on your back with your head in the same position just off the edge of the table. You will likely feel more intense vertigo symptoms at this point.\n*   Slowly move your head to the opposite side.\n*   Turn your body so that it is in line with your head. You will be lying on your side with your head and body facing to the side.\n*   Sit you upright.\n\nYour provider may need to repeat these steps a few times.\n\n**Why the Epley Maneuver is Performed**\n\nThe Epley maneuver is used to reposition the canaliths to treat BPPV. By moving the canaliths out of the canals, the symptoms of vertigo are relieved.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Epley Maneuver**\n\nDuring the procedure, you may experience:\n\n*   Intense vertigo symptoms\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting (less common)\n\nIn a few people, the canaliths may move into another canal in the inner ear and continue to cause vertigo.\n\n**Before the Epley Maneuver**\n\nTell your provider about any medical conditions that you may have. The procedure may not be a good choice if you have had recent neck or spine problems or a detached retina.\n\nFor severe vertigo, your provider may give you medicines to reduce nausea or anxiety before starting the procedure.\n\n**After the Epley Maneuver**\n\nThe Epley maneuver often works quickly. For the rest of the day, avoid bending over. For several days after treatment, avoid sleeping on the side that triggers symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, treatment will cure BPPV. Sometimes, vertigo may return after a few weeks. About half the time, BPPV will come back. If this happens, you'll need to be treated again. Your provider may teach you how to perform the maneuver at home.\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations.

Epoprostenol may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH. Epoprostenol is in a class of medications called vasodilators and platelet-aggregation inhibitors. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, including those in the lungs, and improving blood flow.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nEpoprostenol comes as a powder in a vial to be mixed with a liquid to be given as an intravenous (into a vein) infusion. Epoprostenol is usually given as a continuous intravenous infusion (injected slowly).
