    "content": "**Clomipramine**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nClomipramine is used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. It belongs to a class of medications called tricyclic antidepressants.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nTake clomipramine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more or less of it than prescribed, and do not take it for longer than recommended.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking clomipramine, tell your doctor if you have any medical conditions, especially heart disease, glaucoma, or prostate problems. Also, inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking, including prescription and nonprescription drugs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of clomipramine include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, and changes in appetite. In rare cases, it may cause more serious side effects such as suicidal thoughts, especially in children and young adults.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of overdose, such as difficulty breathing, confusion, or loss of consciousness, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore clomipramine at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Dispose of unused or expired medication properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Important Warning:**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as clomipramine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take clomipramine, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that clomipramine is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take clomipramine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\nYour healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking clomipramine, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\n\nThe doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with clomipramine. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/UCM096273.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nBefore taking clomipramine, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also discuss the risks and benefits of not treating your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Clomipramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Warning: Antidepressants and Suicidal Thoughts**\n\nNo matter your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition.\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts in Children and Young Adults**\n\nA small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as clomipramine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions.\n\n**Using Clomipramine Safely**\n\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take clomipramine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.\n\n**Signs of Suicidal Thoughts**\n\nBe sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own:\n\n*   new or worsening depression\n*   thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so\n*   extreme worry\n*   agitation\n*   panic attacks\n*   difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n*   aggressive behavior\n*   irritability\n*   acting without thinking\n*   severe restlessness\n*   and frenzied abnormal excitement\n\n**Taking Clomipramine Correctly**\n\nClomipramine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. At the beginning of treatment, clomipramine is usually taken three times a day with meals as the body adjusts to the medication. After several weeks of treatment, clomipramine is usually taken once a day at bedtime.\n\n**Important: Do Not Stop Taking Clomipramine Without Talking to Your Doctor**\n\nIf you suddenly stop taking clomipramine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness, sleep problems, fever, and irritability. Your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nClomipramine is used to treat people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (a condition that causes repeated unwanted thoughts and the need to perform certain behaviors over and over). Clomipramine is in a group of medications called tricyclic antidepressants. It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that is needed to maintain mental balance.\n\n---\n\n**Clomipramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking clomipramine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to clomipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil), amoxapine (Asendin), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil); any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in clomipramine capsules.

Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with clomipramine. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting clomipramine with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking clomipramine, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nThe following nonprescription product may interact with clomipramine: cimetidine (Tagamet).

Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.\n\n**Eye Examination**\n\nYou should know that clomipramine may cause angle-closure glaucoma (a condition where the fluid is suddenly blocked and unable to flow out of the eye causing a quick, severe increase in eye pressure which may lead to a loss of vision). Talk to your doctor about having an eye examination before you start taking this medication. If you have nausea, eye pain, changes in vision, such as seeing colored rings around lights, and swelling or redness in or around the eye, call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment right away.\n\n**Dietary Instructions**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your usual diet.\n\n**Missing a Dose**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of clonazepam include drowsiness, fatigue, and changes in mental health.

Clonidine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha-agonist hypotensive agents. It works by decreasing your heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nTransdermal clonidine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied to the skin every 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use the clonidine patch exactly as directed. Do not apply it more or less often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nApply clonidine patches to clean, dry skin on a hairless area on the upper, outer arm or upper chest. Choose an area where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not apply patches to skin that has wrinkles or folds or to skin that is cut, scraped, irritated, scarred or recently shaved. You may bathe, swim, or shower while you are wearing a clonidine patch.\n\nIf the clonidine patch loosens while wearing it, apply the adhesive cover that comes with the patch. The adhesive cover will help to keep the clonidine patch on until it is time for the patch to be replaced. If the clonidine patch significantly loosens or falls off, replace it with a new one in a different area. Replace the new patch on your next scheduled patch change day.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of clonidine patch and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.\n\nClonidine patch controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take 2-3 days before the full benefit of clonidine patch is seen in your blood pressure readings. Continue to use clonidine patch even if you feel well. Do not stop using clonidine patch without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using clonidine patch, it can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure and symptoms such as nervousness, headache, and confusion.

If you become pregnant while using clonidine patch, call your doctor.\n\n    talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using clonidine patch if you are 65 years of age or older.

    "content": "**Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\n_Clopidogrel resistance is a condition in which the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it._\n\n**Description**\n\nClopidogrel (also known as Plavix) is an antiplatelet drug that prevents blood cells called platelets from sticking together and forming blood clots. This drug is typically given to prevent blood clot formation in individuals with a history of stroke, heart attack, deep vein thrombosis, or plaque buildup in the blood vessels leading from the heart.\n\nPeople with clopidogrel resistance who receive clopidogrel are at risk of serious, sometimes fatal, complications. These individuals may have another heart attack or stroke caused by abnormal blood clot formation; those with stents can develop blood clots (thromboses) within the stents, impeding blood flow.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* 1 in 5 people who take clopidogrel have some degree of resistance\n\n**Causes**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is caused by a genetic variation that affects the metabolism of the drug. People with this variation are unable to process the drug effectively, making it less effective for them.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that if one parent has the condition, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Poor clopidogrel metabolizer\n* Intermediate clopidogrel metabolizer\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on clopidogrel resistance, please consult with your healthcare provider or a genetic counselor.\n\n---\n\n**Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is a condition where the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it. Clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) is an antiplatelet drug that prevents blood cells called platelets from sticking together and forming blood clots.\n\n**What is Clopidogrel?**\n\nClopidogrel is a medication used to prevent blood clot formation in individuals with a history of stroke, heart attack, deep vein thrombosis, or plaque buildup (atherosclerosis) in the blood vessels leading from the heart. It is typically given to people who have had a stent placed.\n\n**Who is at Risk?**\n\nPeople with clopidogrel resistance who receive clopidogrel are at risk of serious, sometimes fatal, complications. These individuals may have another heart attack or stroke caused by abnormal blood clot formation; those with stents can develop blood clots (thromboses) within the stents, impeding blood flow.\n\n**Types of Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\nPeople with clopidogrel resistance can be divided into two categories: intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers. Intermediate metabolizers are able to process some clopidogrel, so they receive partial benefit from the treatment but are not protected from developing a harmful blood clot. Poor metabolizers process little or no clopidogrel, so they receive very limited benefit from the treatment and are at risk of forming a harmful blood clot.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is a common condition, and its incidence can vary depending on ancestry. About half of individuals with Asian ancestry have clopidogrel resistance, with 10 percent of these individuals classified as poor metabolizers. Among people from western countries, nearly 30 percent are estimated to have clopidogrel resistance, with about 3 percent classified as poor metabolizers.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany genes are involved in converting clopidogrel to its active form and in determining the drug's effects in the body. The CYP2C19 gene is particularly important for the activation of clopidogrel, and certain common variations (polymorphisms) in this gene have been associated with clopidogrel resistance. CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms account for most of the variation in clopidogrel activation due to genetic factors.\n\n**The Role of the CYP2C19 Gene**\n\nThe CYP2C19 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found primarily in liver cells. It is active in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. The CYP2C19 enzyme plays a role in the processing of many drugs, including clopidogrel. The CYP2C19 enzyme helps to convert clopidogrel to its active form, which is necessary for the drug to function in the body.\n\n**Polymorphisms Associated with Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\nThe two most common CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance (known as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) result in the production of a nonfunctional CYP2C19 enzyme that cannot convert clopidogrel to its active form. Without active clopidogrel to interfere, the P2RY12 receptor continues to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot formation, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and thromboses in individuals with a history of these conditions.\n\n**Other Factors Affecting Clopidogrel Response**\n\nIn addition to changes in specific genes, many other factors, including sex, age, weight, diet, and other medications, play a role in how the body reacts to clopidogrel.\n\n---\n\n**Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\n**What is Clopidogrel Resistance?**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is a condition where the body does not respond properly to the medication clopidogrel. This can lead to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deep vein thrombosis.\n\n**The CYP2C19 Gene**\n\nVariations (polymorphisms) in the CYP2C19 gene have been associated with clopidogrel resistance. The CYP2C19 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found primarily in liver cells. It plays a role in the processing of many drugs, including clopidogrel.\n\n**How Does Clopidogrel Work?**\n\nClopidogrel prevents (inhibits) the function of a receptor protein known as P2RY12 that is found on the surface of platelets. During clot formation, the P2RY12 receptor helps platelets cluster together to form a clot to seal off damaged blood vessels and prevent blood loss.\n\n**The Two Most Common CYP2C19 Gene Polymorphisms**\n\nThe two most common CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance are known as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3. These result in the production of a nonfunctional CYP2C19 enzyme that cannot convert clopidogrel to its active form.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nClopidogrel resistance is inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern. This means that two different versions of the gene are active (expressed), and both versions influence the genetic trait.\n\n**Intermediate Metabolizers and Poor Metabolizers**\n\nSome people with clopidogrel resistance have a reduced ability to convert the drug to its active form because of a polymorphism in one copy of the CYP2C19 gene. These individuals are described as intermediate metabolizers. Others convert very little or none of the drug to its active form because of polymorphisms in both copies of the CYP2C19 gene, resulting in a lack of enzyme activity. These individuals are described as poor metabolizers.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* CYP2C19-related poor drug metabolism\n* Poor metabolism of clopidogrel\n* Resistance to clopidogrel\n\n---\n\n**Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\n**What is Clopidogrel Resistance?**\n\nClopidogrel resistance refers to the phenomenon where patients do not respond adequately to clopidogrel, a commonly used antiplatelet medication. This can lead to reduced efficacy of the drug and increased risk of cardiovascular events.\n\n**Causes of Clopidogrel Resistance**\n\nOne of the main causes of clopidogrel resistance is genetic variation in the CYP2C19 gene. Research has shown that individuals with certain variants of this gene are less likely to respond to clopidogrel.\n\n**Impact on Cardiovascular Health**\n\nClopidogrel resistance can have significant implications for cardiovascular health. Studies have demonstrated that patients with clopidogrel resistance are at increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular events.\n\n**Genetic Testing and Pharmacogenetics**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on genetic testing and pharmacogenetics in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. By identifying individuals who may be resistant to clopidogrel due to genetic variation, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions about alternative treatments.\n\n**Clinical Trials and Research**\n\nNumerous clinical trials and research studies have investigated the relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and response to clopidogrel. These studies have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying clopidogrel resistance and have informed guidelines for its use in clinical practice.\n\n**References**\n\n* Hirota T, Eguchi S, Ieiri I.

This includes people who have percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; angioplasty; a type of heart surgery) that may involve inserting coronary stents (metal tubes surgically placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow) or who have coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; a type of heart surgery). Clopidogrel is also used to prevent serious or life-threatening problems with the heart and blood vessels in people who have peripheral arterial disease (poor circulation in the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs). Clopidogrel is in a class of medications called antiplatelet medications. It works by preventing platelets (a type of blood cell) from collecting and forming clots that may cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nClopidogrel comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take clopidogrel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clopidogrel exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\n*   Prevent serious or life-threatening problems with the heart and blood vessels in people who have had a stroke, heart attack, or severe chest pain.\n*   Prevent serious or life-threatening problems with the heart and blood vessels in people who have peripheral arterial disease (poor circulation in the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nClopidogrel must be changed to an active form in your body so that it can treat your condition. Some people do not change clopidogrel to its active form in the body as well as other people. Because the medication does not work as well in these people, they may be at a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke. There are tests available to identify people who have trouble changing clopidogrel to an active form. Talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested. If you are found to have difficulty converting clopidogrel to its active form, your doctor may change your dose of clopidogrel or tell you not to take clopidogrel.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nNo special dietary instructions are provided for this medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take only your regular scheduled dose. Do not take extra doses to make up for the missed one.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\n*   Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)\n*   Bleeding in the stomach or intestines\n*   Easy bruising or bleeding\n*   Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet\n*   Pale skin\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore clopidogrel at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nClopidogrel is available under several brand names, including Plavix.\n\n---\n\n**Clopidogrel: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Continue to Take Clopidogrel**\n\nClopidogrel will help prevent serious problems with your heart and blood vessels only as long as you take the medication. Continue to take clopidogrel even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clopidogrel without talking to your doctor.\n\nIf you stop taking clopidogrel, there is a higher risk that you may have a heart attack or stroke. If you have a stent, there is also a higher risk that you could develop a blood clot in the stent if you stop taking clopidogrel too soon.\n\n**How to Take Clopidogrel**\n\nClopidogrel comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Closed Reduction of a Fractured Bone**\n\nClosed reduction is a procedure to set (reduce) a broken bone without cutting the skin open. The broken bone is put back in place, which allows it to grow back together in better alignment. It works best when it is done as soon as possible after the bone breaks.\n\n**Who Can Perform a Closed Reduction?**\n\nA closed reduction can be done by an orthopedic surgeon (bone doctor), emergency room physician, or a primary care provider who has training and experience doing this procedure.\n\n**Benefits of a Closed Reduction**\n\nA closed reduction can:\n\n* Reduce tension on the skin and reduce swelling\n* Improve the chances that your limb will function normally and you will be able to use it normally when it heals\n* Decrease pain\n* Help your bone heal quickly and be strong when it heals\n* Lower the risk of an infection in the bone\n* Allow you to avoid surgery to fix the fracture\n\n**Possible Risks During a Closed Reduction**\n\nYour health care provider will talk with you about the possible risks of a closed reduction. Some are:\n\n* The nerves, blood vessels, and other soft tissues near your bone may be injured.\n* A blood clot could form, and it could travel to your lungs or another part of your body.\n* You could have an allergic reaction to the pain medicine you receive.\n* There may be new fractures that occur with the reduction.\n* If the reduction does not work, you may need surgery.\n\nYour risk of any of these problems is greater if you:\n\n* Smoke\n* Take steroids (such as cortisone), birth control pills, or other hormones (such as insulin)\n* Are older\n* Have other health conditions such as diabetes and hypothyroidism\n\n**About the Procedure**\n\nThe procedure is often painful. You will receive medicine to block the pain during the procedure. You might receive:\n\n* A local anesthetic or nerve block to numb the area (usually given as a shot)\n* A sedative to make you relaxed but not asleep (usually given through an IV, or intravenous line)\n* General anesthesia to make you sleep during the procedure\n\nAfter you receive pain medicine, your provider will set the bone in the right position by pushing or pulling the bone. This is called traction.\n\nAfter the bone is set:\n\n* You will have an x-ray to make sure the bone is in the right position.\n* A cast or splint will be put on your limb to keep the bone in the right position and protect it while it heals.\n\n**After Your Procedure**\n\nIf you do not have other injuries or problems, you will be able to go home a few hours after the procedure.\n\nUntil your provider advises, do not:\n\n* Place rings on your fingers or toes over your injured arm or leg\n* Bear weight on the injured leg or arm\n\n---\n\n**Closed Reduction of a Fractured Bone**\n\n**What is a Closed Reduction?**\n\nA closed reduction is a medical procedure where a healthcare provider sets a fractured bone back into its correct position without making an incision. This procedure can be performed by an orthopedic surgeon, emergency room physician, or a primary care provider who has training and experience doing this procedure.\n\n**Benefits of a Closed Reduction**\n\nA closed reduction can:\n\n* Reduce tension on the skin and reduce swelling\n* Improve the chances that your limb will function normally and you will be able to use it normally when it heals\n* Decrease pain\n* Help your bone heal quickly and be strong when it heals\n* Lower the risk of an infection in the bone\n* Allow you to avoid surgery to fix the fracture\n\n**Possible Risks During a Closed Reduction**\n\nYour healthcare provider will talk with you about the possible risks of a closed reduction.

It involves manually manipulating the fractured bone back into its correct position, without the need for surgery.\n\n**How is closed reduction performed?**\n\nThe process typically begins with the patient being given anesthesia to minimize discomfort. The doctor then uses their hands or other instruments to gently manipulate the fractured bone, often using a combination of force and leverage to realign it correctly.\n\n**What are the benefits of closed reduction?**\n\nClosed reduction offers several advantages over surgical intervention, including:\n\n*   Reduced risk of complications\n*   Lower cost compared to surgery\n*   Faster recovery time for the patient\n\nHowever, not all fractures can be treated with closed reduction. The decision to use this method depends on the specific type and severity of the fracture, as well as the individual patient's overall health and medical history.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Dislocated Shoulder\n*   Fractures",

    "content": "**Closed Suction Drain with Bulb**\n\nA closed suction drain is placed under your skin during surgery. This drain removes any blood or other fluids that might build up in this area.\n\n**Why You Need This**\n\nA closed suction drain is used to remove fluids that build up in areas of your body after surgery or when you have an infection. Although there is more than one brand of closed suction drains, this drain is often called a Jackson-Pratt, or JP, drain.\n\nThe drain is made up of two parts:\n\n* A thin rubber tube\n* A soft, round squeeze bulb that looks like a grenade\n\nOne end of the rubber tube is placed in the area of your body where fluid may build up. The other end comes out through a small incision (cut). A squeeze bulb is attached to this outer end.\n\n**Using Your Drain**\n\nAsk your health care provider when you may take a shower while you have this drain. You may be asked to take a sponge bath until the drain is removed.\n\nThere are many ways to wear the drain depending on where the drain comes out of your body.\n\n* The squeeze bulb has a plastic loop that can be used to pin the bulb to your clothes.\n* If the drain is in your upper body, you can tie a cloth tape around your neck like a necklace and hang the bulb from the tape.\n* There are special garments, such as camisoles, belts, or shorts that have pockets or Velcro loops for the bulbs and openings for the tubes. Ask your provider what might be best for you. Health insurance may cover the cost of these garments, if you get a prescription from your provider.\n\n**Emptying Your Drain**\n\nItems you will need are:\n\n* A measuring cup\n* A pen or pencil and a piece of paper\n\nEmpty the drain before it gets full. You may need to empty your drain every few hours at first. As the amount of drainage decreases, you may be able to empty it once or twice a day:\n\n**Changing Your Dressing**\n\nIf you do have a dressing around the drain, you will need the following items:\n\n* Two pairs of clean, unused, sterile medical gloves\n* Five or six cotton swabs\n* Gauze pads\n* Clean soapy water\n* Plastic trash bag\n* Surgical tape\n* Waterproof pad or bath towel\n\nTo change your dressing:\n\n1. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Dry your hands.\n2. Put on clean gloves.\n3. Loosen the tape carefully and take off the old bandage. Throw the old bandage into the trash bag.\n4. Look for any new redness, swelling, bad odor, or pus on the skin around the drain.\n5. Use a cotton swab dipped in the soapy water to clean the skin around the drain. Do this 3 or 4 times, using a new swab each time.\n6. Take off the first pair of gloves and throw them in the trash bag. Put on the second pair of gloves.\n7. Put a new bandage around the drain tube site. Use surgical tape to hold it down against your skin.\n8. Throw all used supplies in the trash bag.\n9. Wash your hands again.\n\n**Clogged Drain**\n\nIf there is no fluid draining into the bulb, there may be a clot or other material blocking the fluid. If you notice this:\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry your hands.\n2. Gently squeeze the tubing where the clot is, to loosen it.\n3. Grip the drain with the fingers of one hand, close to where it comes out of your body.\n4. With the fingers of your other hand, squeeze down the length of the tube. Start where it comes out of your body and move toward the drainage bulb. This is called stripping the drain.\n5. Release your fingers from the end of the drain where it comes out of your body and then release the end near the bulb.\n6. You might find it easier to strip the drain if you put lotion or hand cleanser on your hands.\n7. Do this several times until fluid is draining into the bulb.\n8. Wash your hands again.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Stitches that hold the drain to your skin are coming loose or are missing.\n* The tube falls out.\n* Your temperature is 100.5°F (38.0°C) or higher.\n* Your skin is very red where the tube comes out (a small amount of redness is normal).\n* There is drainage from the skin around the tube site.\n* There is more tenderness and swelling at the drain site.\n* The drainage is cloudy or has a bad odor.\n* Drainage from the bulb increases for more than 2 days in a row.\n* The squeeze bulb will not stay collapsed.\n* The drainage stops suddenly when the drain has been steadily putting out fluid.\n\n---\n\n\\n\\n**Why You Need This**\n\nA closed suction drain is used to remove fluids that build up in areas of your body after surgery or when you have an infection.

All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n* Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was inhaled)\n* Chest x-ray\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n* Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n* Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n* Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\n* Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed\n* Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nIf the poisoning involved a corrosive alkali, extensive damage may occur to the:\n\n* Esophagus\n* Kidneys\n* Mouth\n* Stomach\n* Throat\n\nThe outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Poisoning from dye containing an alkali may result in continuing injury to these tissues for weeks or months.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed.

Your doctor will order lab tests during your treatment to check the number of white blood cells in your blood. A decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body may increase the risk that you will develop a serious infection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* extreme tiredness\n* weakness\n* fever, sore throat, chills, or other signs of flu or infection\n* unusual vaginal discharge or itching\n* sores in your mouth or throat\n* wounds that take a long time to heal\n* pain or burning while urinating\n* sores or pain in or around your rectal area\n* abdominal pain\n\nClozapine may cause seizures. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, a head injury, or if you drink large amounts of alcohol. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, swim, or climb while taking clozapine, because if you suddenly lose consciousness, you could harm yourself or others. If you experience a seizure, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment.\n\nClozapine may cause serious or life-threatening heart inflammation or swelling. Clozapine may also cause your heart to enlarge or harden. This may cause the heart to be unable to pump blood normally.

Tell your doctor if you have or have had a heart attack, heart failure, or a slow, irregular heartbeat or are taking medications for high blood pressure. Also tell your doctor if you have severe vomiting or diarrhea or signs of dehydration now, or if you develop these symptoms at any time during your treatment. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clozapine and gradually increase your dose. This will give your body time to adjust to the medication and decrease the chance that you will experience this side effect. Talk to your doctor if you do not take clozapine for 2 days or longer. Your doctor will probably tell you to restart your treatment with a low dose of clozapine. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* fainting or slow or irregular heartbeat\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Use in Older Adults**\n\nOlder adults with dementia (loss of memory and brain function) who take certain medications for mental illness such as clozapine have an increased chance of death during treatment.\n\nClozapine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia.

Clozapine is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nClozapine comes as a tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily. Take clozapine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clozapine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Taking Clozapine Tablets**\n\nDo not try to push the orally disintegrating tablet through the foil packaging. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.\n\n**Measuring Clozapine Oral Suspension**\n\nTo measure clozapine oral suspension, follow these steps:\n\n* Make sure the cap is tight on the oral suspension container by turning the cap clockwise (to the right). Shake the bottle up and down for 10 seconds before use.\n* Remove the bottle cap by pushing down on the cap, then turn it counterclockwise (to the left). The first time you open a new bottle, push the adaptor into the bottle until the top of the adaptor is lined up with the top of the bottle.\n* If your dose is 1 mL or less, use the smaller (1 mL) oral syringe. If your dose is more than 1 mL, use the larger (9 mL) oral syringe.\n* Fill the oral syringe with by air by drawing back the plunger. Then insert the open tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor. Push all the air from the oral syringe into the bottle by pushing down on the plunger.\n* While holding the oral syringe in place, carefully turn the bottle upside down. Draw some of the medication out of the bottle into the oral syringe by pulling back on the plunger. Be careful not to pull the plunger all the way out.\n* You will see a small amount of air near the end of the plunger in the oral syringe. Push on the plunger so the medication goes back into the bottle and the air disappears. Pull back on the plunger to draw your correct medication dose into the oral syringe.\n* While still holding the oral syringe in the bottle, carefully turn the bottle upwards so the syringe is on top. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle neck adaptor without pushing on the plunger. Take the medication right after you draw it into the oral syringe. Do not prepare a dose and store it in the syringe for later use.\n* Place the open tip of the oral syringe into one side of your mouth. Tightly close your lips around the oral syringe and push on the plunger slowly as the liquid goes into your mouth. Swallow the medication slowly as it goes into your mouth.\n\n**Cleaning and Disposing of the Oral Syringe**\n\nLeave the adaptor in the bottle. Place the cap back on the bottle and turn it clockwise (to the right) to tighten it.\nRinse the oral syringe with warm tap water after each use. Fill a cup with water and place the tip of the oral syringe into the water in the cup. Pull back on the plunger and draw the water into the oral syringe. Push on the plunger to squirt the water into a sink or a separate container until the oral syringe is clean. Allow the oral syringe air dry and dispose of any leftover rinse water.\n\n---\n\n**Clozapine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nClozapine comes as a tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.

It can be caused by various underlying conditions, including lung disease, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Clubbing**\n\nThe causes of clubbing are diverse and can include:\n\n*   **Lung disease**: Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis can lead to clubbing.\n*   **Heart disease**: Certain heart conditions, like congenital heart disease, can cause clubbing.\n*   **Cancer**: Some types of cancer, including lung and breast cancer, can result in clubbing.\n*   **Infections**: Severe infections, such as tuberculosis, can also cause clubbing.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Clubbing**\n\nThe symptoms of clubbing may include:\n\n*   **Enlarged fingertips and toes**: The most noticeable symptom is the enlargement of the fingers and toes due to increased blood flow.\n*   **Nail changes**: Clubbing can lead to changes in the nails, such as thickening or curvature.\n*   **Fingertip pain**: Some people may experience pain in the fingertips.\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosing Clubbing**\n\nClubbing is typically diagnosed through a physical examination. A healthcare provider will look for signs of clubbing, including enlarged fingertips and toes, nail changes, and fingertip pain. In some cases, imaging tests or laboratory tests may be ordered to rule out underlying conditions.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment of Clubbing**\n\nThe treatment of clubbing depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is caused by a lung disease, for example, treating the underlying disease may help alleviate symptoms. In some cases, medications may be prescribed to manage pain and inflammation.",

The Achilles tendon at the back of the foot is almost always cut or lengthened.\nOlder children or more severe cases may need some bone cuts. Sometimes, pins, screws or plates are placed in the foot.\nA cast is placed on the foot after surgery to keep it in position while it heals.

Ask which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\n\n**On the Day of the Surgery**\n\nIn most cases, your child will not be able to drink or eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the surgery. Only give your child a small sip of water with any medicine your doctor told you to give your child. You will be told when to arrive for the surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nDepending on the surgery that is done, your child may go home on the same day or stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days right after the surgery. The hospital stay may be longer if surgery was also done on the bones.\n\nThe child's foot should be kept in a raised position. Medicines may be prescribed to help control the pain. The skin around your child's cast will be checked often to make sure it stays pink and healthy. Your child's toes also will be checked to make sure they are pink and your child can move and feel them.\n\nThese are signs of proper blood flow. Your child will have a cast on for 6 to 12 weeks. It may be changed several times. Before your child leaves the hospital, you will be taught how to take care of the cast.\n\nWhen the last cast is taken off, your child will probably be prescribed a brace, and may be referred for physical therapy. The therapist will teach you exercises to do with your child to strengthen the foot and make sure it stays flexible.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter recovering from surgery, your child's foot will be in a much better position. Your child should be able to have a normal, active life, including playing sports. But the foot may be stiffer than a foot that has not been treated with surgery.\n\nIn most cases of clubfoot, if only one side is affected, the child's foot and calf will be smaller than normal for the rest of the child's life. Children who have had clubfoot surgery may need another surgery later in life.\n\n---\n\n**Clubfoot Repair**\n\n**What is Clubfoot?**\n\nClubfoot is a birth defect where one foot is turned inward or downward.

It can range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of clubfoot is not known. Most often, it occurs by itself. However, the condition may be passed down through families in some cases. Risk factors include a family history of the disorder and being male. Clubfoot can also occur as part of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as trisomy 18.\n\n**Related problem**\n\nA related problem, called positional clubfoot, is not true clubfoot. It results from a normal foot positioned abnormally while the baby is in the womb. This problem is easily corrected after birth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe physical appearance of the foot may vary. One or both feet may be affected.\n\n* The foot turns inward and downward at birth and is difficult to place in the correct position.\n* The calf muscle and foot may be slightly smaller than normal.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe disorder is identified during a physical examination.\n\n* A foot x-ray may be done.\n* Ultrasound during the first 6 months of pregnancy can also help to identify the disorder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This is often done by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment should be started as early as possible, ideally shortly after birth, when it is easiest to reshape the foot.\n\n* Gentle stretching and recasting will be done every week to improve the position of the foot.\n* Generally, 5 to 10 casts are needed.\n* The final cast will stay in place for 3 weeks.\n* After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months.

However, treatment can improve the appearance and function of the foot. Treatment may be less successful if the clubfoot is linked to other birth disorders.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf your child is being treated for clubfoot, contact your provider if:\n\n* The toes swell, bleed, or change color under the cast\n* The cast appears to be causing significant pain\n* The toes disappear into the cast\n* The cast slides off\n* The foot begins to turn in again after treatment\n\n---\n\n**Clubfoot: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Clubfoot?**\n\nClubfoot, also known as talipes equinovarus, is a congenital deformity of the foot. It occurs when the tendons and ligaments that connect the bones in the foot are improperly formed during fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of clubfoot is unknown, but it is thought to be related to genetic and environmental factors. Some studies suggest that clubfoot may be more common in families with a history of the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nClubfoot can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* A twisted or turned foot\n* Limited mobility in the foot\n* Pain or discomfort in the foot or ankle\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for clubfoot typically involves a series of casts and manipulations to correct the deformity.

No other nervous system changes will be seen.\n\nTests, such as an MRI of the head, may be needed to check for other causes of the headaches.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for cluster headaches involves:\n\n* Medicines to treat the pain when it happens\n* Medicines to prevent the headaches\n\nTREATING CLUSTER HEADACHES WHEN THEY OCCUR\n\nYour provider may recommend the following treatments for when the headaches occur:\n\n* Triptan medicines, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex)\n* Anti-inflammatory (steroid) medicines such as prednisone\n* Breathing in 100% (pure) oxygen\n* Injections of dihydroergotamine (DHE)\n\nYou may need more than one of these treatments to control your headache. Your provider may have you try several medicines before deciding which works best for you.\n\nPain medicines and narcotics do not usually relieve cluster headache pain because they take too long to work.\n\n---\n\n**Cluster Headache: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**TREATING CLUSTER HEADACHES WHEN THEY OCCUR**\n\nYour provider may recommend the following treatments for when the headaches occur:\n\n*   Triptan medicines, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex).\n*   Anti-inflammatory (steroid) medicines such as prednisone. Starting with a high dose, then slowly decreasing it over 2 to 3 weeks.\n*   Breathing in 100% (pure) oxygen.\n*   Injections of dihydroergotamine (DHE), which can stop cluster attacks within 5 minutes (Warning: this drug can be dangerous if taken with sumatriptan or some other medicines).\n\nYou may need more than one of these treatments to control your headache. Your provider may have you try several medicines before deciding which works best for you.\n\nPain medicines and narcotics do not usually relieve cluster headache pain because they take too long to work.\n\nSurgical treatment may be recommended for you when all other treatments have failed. One such treatment is a neurostimulator. This device delivers tiny electrical signals to certain nerves such as the occipital nerve in the scalp. Your provider can tell you more about surgery.\n\n**PREVENTING CLUSTER HEADACHES**\n\nAvoid smoking, alcohol use, certain foods, and other things that trigger your headaches. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When you get a headache, write down the following:\n\n*   Day and time the pain began\n*   What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours\n*   How much you slept\n*   What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started\n*   How long the headache lasted and what made it stop\n\nReview your diary with your provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them.\n\nThe headaches may go away on their own or you may need treatment to prevent them. The following medicines may also be used to treat or prevent headache symptoms:\n\n*   Steroid injections\n*   Allergy medicines\n*   Antidepressants\n*   Blood pressure medicines\n*   Seizure medicine\n*   Medicines that block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a protein associated with headaches\n\n**OUTLOOK (PROGNOSIS)**\n\nCluster headaches are not life threatening. They usually do not cause permanent changes to the brain. But they are long-term (chronic), and often painful enough to interfere with work and life. However, they can occur less frequently with age.\n\n**WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\n\n*   You are experiencing \"the worst headache of your life.\"\n*   You have speech, vision, or movement problems or loss of balance, especially if you have not had these symptoms with a headache before.\n*   A headache starts suddenly.\n*   The headache occurs with repeated vomiting.\n*   You have a high fever or stiff neck with your headache.\n\nSchedule an appointment or contact your provider if:\n\n*   Your headache pattern or pain changes.\n*   Treatments that once worked no longer help.\n*   You have side effects from your medicine.\n*   You are pregnant or could become pregnant. Some medicines should not be taken during pregnancy.\n*   You need to take pain medicines more than 3 days a week.\n*   Your headaches are more severe when lying down.\n\n---\n\n**Cluster Headache: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\n*   Your headaches are more severe when lying down.\n*   You take pain medicines more than 3 days a week.\n\n**When to Call a Doctor**\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Sudden, severe headache\n*   Confusion or loss of consciousness\n\nSchedule an appointment or contact your provider if you experience any of the following:\n\n*   Frequent headaches\n*   Headaches that worsen over time\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf you smoke, now is a good time to stop. Alcohol use and any foods that trigger a cluster headache may need to be avoided. Medicines may prevent cluster headaches in some cases.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHistamine headache; Headache - histamine; Migrainous neuralgia; Headache - cluster; Horton's headache; Vascular headache - cluster; Episodic cluster headache; Chronic cluster headache\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n*   Keep a headache diary to track your symptoms\n*   Avoid triggers such as certain foods or alcohol\n*   Consider preventive medications if recommended by your doctor\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Brain: Cluster headaches are thought to be caused by abnormal activity in the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the brain.\n*   Hypothalamus: The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and emotional behavior.\n*   Cause of headaches: Cluster headaches are believed to result from an abnormality in the nerve that supplies the eye, leading to inflammation and pain.\n*   Pain of cluster headache: Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, one-sided pain that can last for 15 minutes to three hours.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Digre KB.

    "content": "**Coagulation Factor Tests**\n\n**What are coagulation factor tests?**\n\nCoagulation factors are proteins in your blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding when you have an injury. These proteins are also called clotting factors. You have several different types of clotting factors that are all important for making blood clots.\n\nCoagulation factor tests are blood tests that check one or more of your clotting factors to see if you:\n\n* Have too much or too little of a clotting factor\n* Are missing a clotting factor\n* Have a clotting factor that isn't working right\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA coagulation factor test is used to find out if you have a problem with any of your clotting factors that may cause too little or too much blood clotting.\n\nCoagulation factor tests are also used to check on people who have a known problem with clotting factors or who take medicine called blood thinners to lower the risk of blood clots.\n\n**Why do I need a coagulation factor test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have:\n\n* An abnormal result on a blood test that checks how long it takes your blood to clot. These tests include a prothrombin time test and INR (PT/INR) and/or a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test.\n* A family health history of problems with clotting factors. Some conditions that affect clotting factors, such as hemophilia (a rare bleeding disorder where the blood doesn't clot properly), are inherited. That means that your parents passed the gene for the disease to you. These conditions are not common.\n* A health condition that may affect clotting factors in your blood:\n\t+ Conditions that may cause a bleeding disorder include:\n\t\t- Severe liver disease\n\t\t- A lack of vitamin K, a vitamin that makes proteins for healthy bones and tissues\n\t\t- Blood transfusions, a procedure where blood is transferred from a donor to you\n\t\t- Cancer\n\t\t- Immune disorders\n\t+ Conditions that may cause a problem with blood clots include:\n\t\t- Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, where your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues\n\t\t- Cancer\n\t\t- Obesity\n\t\t- Certain infections, such as sepsis and COVID-19\n\t\t- Not moving for long periods of time, such as after surgery\n\t\t- Lack of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, vitamins that help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat\n\n**What happens during a coagulation factor test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a coagulation factor test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour provider may need to order other tests to find the cause of a problem with your clotting factors.\n\nLower than normal levels of one or more clotting factors or a missing clotting factor may mean you have a bleeding disorder. Depending on which clotting factors were tested, your results may show the type of bleeding disorder you have and how serious it is.\n\nBleeding disorders that you inherit usually involve only one clotting factor. There is no cure for inherited bleeding disorders, but treatment can help manage your condition.\nBleeding disorders caused by other conditions usually involve low levels of two or more clotting factors. Treatment depends on the cause of your bleeding disorder.\n\nHigher than normal levels of one or more clotting factors may mean you have a disorder that makes your blood clot more than it should. Your provider may recommend medicine and heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help prevent clots. You may also need to avoid hormone replacement therapy for menopause and birth control pills with estrogen, because they may increase the risk of blood clots.\n\nTalk with your provider to find out what your tests results mean and what treatment is best for you.\n\n---\n\n**Coagulation Factor Tests**\n\n**What are coagulation factor tests?**\n\nCoagulation factor tests are blood tests that check one or more of your clotting factors to see if you have a problem with too little or too much blood clotting.\n\n**Why do I need a coagulation factor test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have:\n\n* An abnormal result on a blood test that checks how long it takes your blood to clot.\n* A family health history of problems with clotting factors.\n* A health condition that may affect clotting factors in your blood, such as severe liver disease, a lack of vitamin K, or certain infections.\n\n**What happens during a coagulation factor test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.

Clotting is important when you get hurt, as it helps stop the bleeding. But sometimes, people have problems with their clotting, and that's what these tests are looking for.\n\n**What do the test results mean?**\n\nYour healthcare provider will look at your test results to see if your coagulation factors are within normal limits or if they're too high or too low. If your levels are off, it could be a sign of a bleeding disorder or excessive blood clotting.\n\n**How do I understand my lab results?**\n\nTo understand your lab results, you need to know what the numbers mean. That's why we've put together some resources to help you make sense of your test results. Check out our article on how to understand your lab results for more information.\n\n**What are bleeding disorders?**\n\nBleeding disorders are conditions that affect the blood's ability to clot. They can be caused by genetic mutations or other factors, and they can lead to excessive bleeding or bruising. If you're concerned about bleeding disorders, talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested.\n\n**How does blood clot?**\n\nBlood clots when platelets in your blood stick together to form a plug. This process is important for stopping bleeding when you get hurt.

    "content": "**Coarctation of the Aorta**\n\nThe aorta is a larger artery that carries blood from the heart to the vessels that supply the rest of the body with blood. If part of the aorta is narrowed, it is hard for blood to pass through the artery. This is called coarctation of the aorta. It is a type of birth defect.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of coarctation of the aorta is unknown. It results from abnormalities in development of the aorta prior to birth.\n\nAortic coarctation is more common in people with certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome.\n\nAortic coarctation is one of the more common heart conditions that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). This abnormality accounts for about 5% of all congenital heart defects. It is most often diagnosed in children or adults under age 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms depend on how much blood can flow through the artery. Other heart defects may also play a role.\n\nAbout half of newborns with this problem will have symptoms in the first few days of life. These can include breathing fast, problems eating, increased irritability, and increased sleepiness or becoming poorly responsive. In severe cases, the infant may develop heart failure and shock.\n\nIn milder cases, symptoms may not develop until the child has reached adolescence. Symptoms can include:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Cold feet or legs\n* Dizziness or fainting\n* Decreased ability to exercise\n* Failure to thrive\n* Leg cramps with exercise\n* Nosebleed\n* Poor growth\n* Pounding headache\n* Shortness of breath\n\nThere may also be no symptoms.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and check the blood pressure and pulse in the arms and legs.\n\nThe pulse in the groin (femoral) area or feet will be weaker than the pulse in the arms or neck (carotid). Sometimes, the femoral pulse may not be able to be felt at all.\nThe blood pressure in the legs is usually less than in the arms. Blood pressure is usually higher in the arms after infancy.\n\nThe provider will use a stethoscope to listen to the heart and check for murmurs. People with aortic coarctation often have a harsh-sounding murmur that can be heard underneath the left collar bone or from the back. Other types of murmurs may also be present.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost newborns with symptoms will have surgery either right after birth or soon afterward. They will first receive medicines to stabilize them.\n\nChildren who are diagnosed when they are older will also need surgery. In most cases, the symptoms are not as severe, so more time can be taken to plan for surgery.\n\nDuring surgery, the narrowed part of the aorta will be removed or opened.\n\nIf the problem area is small, the two free ends of the aorta may be reconnected. This is called an end-to-end anastomosis.\nIf a large part of the aorta is removed, a graft or one of the patient's own arteries may be used to fill the gap. The graft may be man-made or be taken from a cadaver.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCoarctation of the aorta can be cured with surgery. Symptoms quickly get better after surgery.\n\nHowever, there is an increased risk for death due to heart problems among those who have had their aorta repaired. Lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist is recommended.\n\nWithout treatment, most people die before age 40. For this reason, doctors most often recommend that the person has surgery before age 10. Most of the time, surgery to fix the coarctation is done during infancy.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may occur before, during, or soon after surgery include:\n\n* An area of the aorta becomes very large or balloons out\n* Tear in the wall of the aorta\n* Rupture of the aorta\n* Bleeding in the brain\n* Early development of coronary artery disease (CAD)\n* Endocarditis (infection in the heart)\n* Heart failure\n* Hoarseness\n* Kidney problems\n* Paralysis of the lower half of the body (a rare complication of surgery to repair coarctation)\n* Severe high blood pressure\n* Stroke\n\nLong-term complications include:\n\n* Continued or repeated narrowing of the aorta\n* Endocarditis\n* High blood pressure\n\n---\n\n**Coarctation of the Aorta**\n\n**What is Coarctation of the Aorta?**\n\nCoarctation of the aorta is a type of birth defect where part of the aorta, a larger artery that carries blood from the heart to the vessels that supply the rest of the body with blood, is narrowed.

This narrowing can occur anywhere along the length of the aorta, but it most commonly occurs near the junction with the ductus arteriosus.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and risk factors**\n\nThe exact cause of coarctation of the aorta is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the development of the heart. Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta include:\n\n*   Family history: Coarctation of the aorta can run in families.\n*   Genetic disorders: Certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome, increase the risk of coarctation of the aorta.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of coarctation of the aorta can vary depending on the severity of the narrowing and the presence of any associated heart defects. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   High blood pressure: Coarctation of the aorta can cause high blood pressure in the arms, which can lead to headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath.\n*   Fatigue: The body may have to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed aorta, leading to fatigue.\n*   Shortness of breath: In severe cases, coarctation of the aorta can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCoarctation of the aorta is typically diagnosed using imaging tests such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans. These tests can help identify the location and severity of the narrowing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for coarctation of the aorta depends on the severity of the narrowing and the presence of any associated heart defects. Common treatments include:\n\n*   Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the narrowed section of the aorta.\n*   Angioplasty: A less invasive procedure where a balloon is inserted into the narrowed area to widen it.\n*   Medications: High blood pressure medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for coarctation of the aorta varies depending on the severity of the narrowing and the presence of any associated heart defects. With proper treatment, most people with coarctation of the aorta can lead normal lives. However, some may experience long-term complications such as high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no known way to prevent coarctation of the aorta, being aware of family history and genetic disorders that increase the risk can help identify potential cases early on. Regular check-ups with a pediatrician or cardiologist can also help detect any underlying issues before they become severe.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects\n*   Pediatric heart surgery - discharge",

    "content": "**Cobalt Poisoning**\n\n_Cobalt is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust. It is a very small part of our environment. Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, which supports the production of red blood cells. Very small amounts are needed for animals and humans to stay healthy._\n\n_Cobalt poisoning can occur when you are exposed to large amounts of it. There are three ways that cobalt can cause poisoning: swallowing it, breathing it into your lungs, or having it come in prolonged contact with your skin._\n\n_Cobalt poisoning can also occur from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants. This type of implant is an artificial hip socket that is created by fitting a metal ball into a metal cup. Sometimes, metal particles (cobalt) are released as the metal ball grinds against the metal cup when you walk._\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_Usually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms. However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at one time._\n\n_The most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe it into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air._\n\n_Breathing in this cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis, such as shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance._\n\n_Cobalt poisoning that occurs from prolonged contact with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly._\n\n_Swallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous. It may cause nausea and vomiting. However, absorbing a large amount of cobalt over longer periods of time can lead to serious health problems, such as:_\n\n_Cardiomyopathy (a problem where your heart becomes big and floppy and has problems pumping blood)_\n_Deafness_\n_Nerve problems_\n_Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)_\n_Thickening of the blood_\n_Thyroid problems_\n_Vision problems_\n\n**Treatment**\n\n_If you or someone you know has been exposed to cobalt, the first step is to leave the area and get fresh air. If cobalt came in contact with the skin, wash the area thoroughly._\n\n_Before calling emergency, determine the following information:_\n\n_Person's age, weight, and condition_\n_Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)_\n_Time it was swallowed_\n_Amount swallowed_\n\n_However, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available._\n\n_Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions._\n\n**Outlook**\n\n_People who get sick from being exposed to large amounts of cobalt on one single occasion usually recover and have no long-term complications._\n\n_The symptoms and problems associated with long-term cobalt poisoning are rarely reversible. People who have such poisoning will likely have to take medicine for the rest of their life to control the symptoms._\n\n---\n\n**Cobalt Poisoning**\n\n**What is Cobalt?**\n\nCobalt is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust. It is a very small part of our environment.\n\n**Where is Cobalt Found?**\n\n* Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, an essential vitamin.\n* Alloys\n* Batteries\n* Chemistry/crystal sets\n* Drill bits, saw blades, and other machine tools\n* Dyes and pigments (cobalt blue)\n* Magnets\n* Some metal-on-metal hip implants\n* Tires\n\n**How Can Cobalt Cause Poisoning?**\n\nThere are three ways that cobalt can cause poisoning:\n\n1. **Swallowing**: You can swallow cobalt, which can lead to serious health problems.\n2. **Breathing**: Breathing in cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems.\n3. **Skin Contact**: Having cobalt come into prolonged contact with your skin can cause irritation and rashes.\n\n**Cobalt Poisoning from Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants**\n\nCobalt poisoning can also occur from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants. This type of implant is an artificial hip socket that is created by fitting a metal ball into a metal cup. Sometimes, metal particles (cobalt) are released as the metal ball grinds against the metal cup when you walk.\n\n**Symptoms of Cobalt Poisoning**\n\nThe symptoms of cobalt poisoning can vary depending on how you were exposed to it. However, some common symptoms include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Irritation and rashes on the skin\n* Breathing problems (similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis)\n* Cardiomyopathy (a problem where your heart becomes big and floppy and has problems pumping blood)\n* Deafness\n* Nerve problems\n* Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\n* Thickening of the blood\n* Thyroid problems\n* Vision problems\n\n**Treatment for Cobalt Poisoning**\n\nIf you or someone you know has been exposed to cobalt, the first step is to leave the area and get fresh air. If cobalt came into contact with the skin, wash the area thoroughly.\n\nBefore calling emergency services, try to determine the following information:\n\n* Person's age, weight, and condition (for example, is the person awake or alert?)\n* Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n* Time it was swallowed\n* Amount swallowed\n\nHowever, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.\n\nYou can call the local poison center directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning who will give you further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nIf you swallowed a large amount of cobalt, or you are starting to feel sick from long-term exposure, you should go to an emergency room.\n\nTreatment for skin contact: Since these rashes are rarely serious, very little will be done. The area may be washed and a skin cream may be prescribed.\n\nTreatment for lung involvement: Breathing problems will be treated based on your symptoms. Breathing treatments and medications to treat swelling and inflammation in your lungs may be prescribed. Blood and urine tests, x-rays and ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) may be done.\n\nTreatment for swallowed cobalt: The health care team will treat your symptoms and order some blood tests. Blood and urine tests, x-rays and ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) may be performed. In the rare case that you have a high level of cobalt in your blood, you may need hemodialysis (kidney machine) and get medicines (antidotes) to reverse the effects of the poison.\n\nTreatment for signs of cobalt toxicity from a metal-on-metal hip implant may include removing the implant and replacing it with a traditional hip implant.\n\n---\n\n**Cobalt Poisoning**\n\n**Where Found**\n\n* Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, an essential vitamin.\n* Cobalt is also found in:\n\t+ Alloys\n\t+ Batteries\n\t+ Chemistry/crystal sets\n\t+ Drill bits, saw blades, and other machine tools\n\t+ Dyes and pigments (cobalt blue)\n\t+ Magnets\n\t+ Some metal-on-metal hip implants\n\t+ Tires\n\n**Cobalt was once used as a stabilizer in beer foam. It caused a condition called \"beer-drinker's heart,\" which resulted in heart muscle weakness.**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Usually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms.\n* However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at one time.\n* The most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe it into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air.\n* Breathing in this cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis, such as shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance.\n* Cobalt poisoning that occurs from prolonged contact with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly.\n* Swallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous. It may cause nausea and vomiting. However, absorbing a large amount of cobalt over longer periods of time can lead to serious health problems, such as:\n\t+ Cardiomyopathy (a problem where your heart becomes big and floppy and has problems pumping blood)\n\t+ Deafness\n\t+ Nerve problems\n\t+ Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\n\t+ Thickening of the blood\n\t+ Thyroid problems\n\t+ Vision problems\n\n**Home Care**\n\n* If you or someone you know has been exposed to cobalt, the first step is to leave the area and get fresh air.\n* If cobalt came in contact with the skin, wash the area thoroughly.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\n* If possible, determine the following information:\n\t+ Person's age, weight, and condition (for example, is the person awake or alert?)\n\t+ Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n\t+ Time it was swallowed\n\t+ Amount swallowed\n\n**However, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.**\n\n**Poison Control**\n\n* Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n* This hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n* This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n---\n\n**Cobalt Poisoning**\n\nIf you suspect cobalt poisoning, call the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline will connect you with experts in poisoning who can provide further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention, even if it's not an emergency. You can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nIf you've swallowed a large amount of cobalt or are experiencing symptoms from long-term exposure, go to an emergency room.\n\n*   **Treatment for skin contact:** Since these rashes are rarely serious, very little will be done. The area may be washed and a skin cream may be prescribed.\n*   **Treatment for lung involvement:** Breathing problems will be treated based on your symptoms. Breathing treatments and medications to treat swelling and inflammation in your lungs may be prescribed. Blood and urine tests, x-rays, and ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing) may be done.\n*   **Treatment for swallowed cobalt:** The health care team will treat your symptoms and order some blood tests. Blood and urine tests, x-rays, and ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing) may be performed. In the rare case that you have a high level of cobalt in your blood, you may need hemodialysis (kidney machine) and get medicines (antidotes) to reverse the effects of the poison.\n*   **Treatment for signs of cobalt toxicity from a metal-on-metal hip implant:** Removing the implant and replacing it with a traditional hip implant may be necessary.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople who get sick from being exposed to large amounts of cobalt on one single occasion usually recover and have no long-term complications. However, the symptoms and problems associated with long-term cobalt poisoning are rarely reversible. People who have such poisoning will likely have to take medicine for the rest of their life to control the symptoms.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCobalt chloride; Cobalt oxide; Cobalt sulfate\n\n**References**\n\nAronson JK.

The severity of the symptoms can vary depending on the amount and method of use, as well as the individual's sensitivity to the drug.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Cocaine Intoxication**\n\nThe symptoms of cocaine intoxication can range from mild to severe and may include:\n\n*   *Increased energy and alertness*\n*   *Euphoria or a feeling of intense happiness*\n*   *Paranoia or anxiety*\n*   *Agitation or restlessness*\n*   *Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)*\n*   *Rapid heartbeat and increased blood pressure*\n*   *Narrowed pupils*\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment for Cocaine Intoxication**\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of cocaine intoxication, it's essential to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Treatment may involve:\n\n*   *Monitoring vital signs and symptoms*\n*   *Providing a safe environment to reduce the risk of harm*\n*   *Administering medications to manage severe symptoms, such as agitation or hallucinations*\n*   *Supporting the individual in overcoming their addiction*\n\n\\n\\n**Prevention is Key**\n\nThe best way to prevent cocaine intoxication is to avoid using the drug altogether. If you're struggling with addiction, consider seeking help from a healthcare professional or a support group. Remember, recovery is possible with the right resources and support.",

    "content": "**Cocaine**\n\nAlso called: Blow, Coca, Coke, Crack, Flake, Snow, Soda Cot\n\n**What is Cocaine?**\n\nCocaine is a very addictive drug made from leaves of the coca plant found in South America. It's mostly available as an illegal drug that some people use to get high. In rare cases, it's used as a prescription drug for anesthesia during certain surgeries.\n\n**Forms of Cocaine**\n\nAs a street (illegal) drug, cocaine is usually a fine, white, crystal powder. Street dealers sometimes mix it with cornstarch, talcum powder, or flour to make it look like they have more cocaine. They may also mix it with other illegal drugs. Another form of the drug is crack cocaine, which has been heated to make it into a rock crystal.\n\n**How Do People Use Cocaine?**\n\nPeople snort cocaine powder through the nose or rub it into their gums. Others dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Some people inject a combination of cocaine and heroin, called a \"speedball.\" Crack cocaine is smoked.\n\n**Short-Term Effects of Cocaine**\n\nCocaine is a stimulant that can make people feel like they have more energy and are extra alert. But it can also make people feel restless, irritable, anxious, and paranoid. Large amounts of cocaine can lead to bizarre, unpredictable, and violent behavior.\n\n**Long-Term Effects of Cocaine**\n\nPeople who use cocaine over the long term may develop health problems. These include:\n\n*   Snorting: loss of sense of smell, nosebleeds, nasal damage, trouble swallowing\n*   Smoking: cough, asthma, trouble breathing, higher risk of infections like pneumonia\n*   Injecting: skin or soft tissue infections, scarring, collapsed veins, higher risk of diseases like HIV and hepatitis C\n\n**Treatments for Cocaine Use Disorder**\n\nThe treatments for cocaine use disorder are different types of behavioral therapies. There are no medicines that can treat it.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nCocaine and Pregnancy (March of Dimes Foundation)\nCocaine (Drug Enforcement Administration)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nCocaine  (National Institute on Drug Abuse)\nClinicalTrials.gov: Cocaine-Related Disorders  (National Institutes of Health)\nClinicalTrials.gov: Crack Cocaine  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n---\n\n**Cocaine: MedlinePlus (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What are the long-term effects of cocaine?**\n\nPeople who use cocaine over the long term may develop health problems. Which problems they have will depend on how they used the cocaine:\n\n* Snorting it can lead to a loss of sense of smell, nosebleeds, nasal damage, and trouble swallowing.\n* Smoking it can cause a cough, asthma, trouble breathing, and a higher risk of infections like pneumonia.\n* Injecting it with a needle can lead to skin or soft tissue infections, as well as scarring. It can cause collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Injecting cocaine also puts a person at higher risk of getting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOther long-term effects of cocaine use may include malnutrition and movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease.\n\n**What are the withdrawal symptoms when someone stops using cocaine?**\n\nRepeated use of cocaine can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on cocaine. If someone who is dependent on cocaine stops using it, they will have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include:\n\n* Depression\n* Restlessness\n* Fatigue\n* Increased appetite\n* Bad dreams and insomnia\n* Slowed thinking\n\n**Can a person overdose on cocaine?**\n\nIt's possible to overdose on cocaine. This happens when a person uses so much cocaine that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. Some people use cocaine along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose.\n\nA cocaine overdose can cause health problems such as:\n\n* Stroke\n* Seizures\n* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n* Heart attack\n\nThere is no specific medicine to treat an overdose. Health care providers will focus on treating the specific health problems caused by the overdose.\n\n**What are the treatments for cocaine use disorder?**\n\nThe treatments for cocaine use disorder are different types of behavioral therapies. There are no medicines which can treat it.\n\n---\n\n**Cocaine: MedlinePlus (Part 3/3)**\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* Article: Impact of coca leaf flour candy consumption on cocaine and benzoylecgonine pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers\n* Article: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for stimulant use disorders (STIMULUS): protocol for a randomized controlled trial\n* Article: Brain connectomics markers for response prediction to transcranial magnetic stimulation in individuals with cocaine use disorder\n\n**Cocaine -- see more articles**\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n* Drug Enforcement Administration\n* FindTreatment.gov (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration)\n* Also in Spanish\n* National Institute on Drug Abuse\n* Also in Spanish\n* Partnership to End Addiction\n* Find an Expert\n\n**Teenagers**\n\n* Mind Matters: The Body's Response to Cocaine  (National Institute on Drug Abuse)\n* Also in Spanish\n* What Are Cocaine and Crack?

There, it is examined for bands called precipitin that form when specific antibodies are present.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe precipitin test is one of several tests that can be done to determine if you are infected with Coccidioides, which causes the disease coccidioidomycosis.\n\nAntibodies are specialized proteins that defend the body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These and other foreign substances are called antigens. When you are exposed to antigens, your body produces antibodies.\n\nThe precipitin test helps check if the body has produced antibodies to a specific antigen, in this case, the Coccidioides fungus.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result is when no precipitins are formed. This means the blood test did not detect the antibody to Coccidioides.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal (positive) result means the antibody to Coccidioides has been detected.\n\nIn this case, another test is done to confirm that you have an infection. Your health care provider can tell you more.\n\nDuring the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other.

    "content": "**Cochlear Implant**\n\nA cochlear implant is a small electronic device that helps people hear. It can be used for people who are deaf or very hard of hearing.\n\n**Information**\n\nA cochlear implant is not the same thing as a hearing aid. It is implanted using surgery and works in a different way.\n\nThere are many different types of cochlear implants. However, they are most often made up of several similar parts.\n\nOne part of the device is surgically implanted into the bone surrounding the ear (temporal bone). It is made up of a receiver-stimulator, which accepts, decodes, and then sends an electrical signal to the brain.\nThe second part of the cochlear implant is an outside device. This is made up of a microphone/receiver, a speech processor, and an antenna. This part of the implant receives the sound, converts the sound into an electrical signal, and sends it to the inside part of the cochlear implant.\n\n**WHO USES A COCHLEAR IMPLANT?**\n\nCochlear implants allow deaf people to receive and process sounds and speech. However, these devices do not restore normal hearing. They are tools that allow sound and speech to be processed and sent to the brain.\n\nA cochlear implant is not right for everyone. The way a person is selected for cochlear implants is changing as the understanding of the brain's hearing (auditory) pathways improves and the technology changes.\n\nBoth children and adults can be candidates for cochlear implants. People who are candidates for this device may have been born deaf or become deaf after learning to speak. Children as young as 1 year old are now candidates for this surgery. Although criteria are slightly different for adults and children, they are based on similar guidelines:\n\n* The person should be completely or almost completely deaf in both ears and get almost no improvement with hearing aids.\n* Anyone who can hear well enough with hearing aids is not a good candidate for cochlear implants.\n* The person needs to be highly motivated. After the cochlear implant is placed, they must learn how to properly use the device.\n* The person needs to have reasonable expectations for what will occur after surgery. The device does not restore or create \"normal\" hearing.\n* Children need to be enrolled in programs that help them learn how to process sound.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nSounds are transmitted through the air. In a normal ear, sound waves cause the eardrum and then the middle ear bones to vibrate. This sends a wave of vibrations into the inner ear (cochlea). These waves are then converted by the cochlea into electrical signals, which are sent along the auditory nerve to the brain.\n\nA deaf person does not have a functioning inner ear. A cochlear implant tries to replace the function of the inner ear by turning sound into electrical energy. This energy can then be used to stimulate the cochlear nerve (the nerve for hearing), sending \"sound\" signals to the brain.\n\nSound is picked up by a microphone worn near the ear. This sound is sent to a speech processor, which is most often connected to the microphone and worn behind the ear.\nThe sound is analyzed and converted into electrical signals, which are sent to a surgically implanted receiver behind the ear. This receiver sends the signal through a wire into the inner ear.\nFrom there, the electrical impulses are sent to the brain.\n\n**HOW IT IS IMPLANTED**\n\nTo have the surgery:\n\n* You will receive general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain free.\n* A surgical cut is made behind the ear, sometimes after shaving part of the hair behind the ear.\n* A microscope and bone drill are used to open the bone behind the ear (mastoid bone) to allow the inside part of the implant to be inserted.\n* The electrode array is passed into the inner ear (cochlea).\n* The receiver is placed into a pocket created behind the ear. The pocket helps keep it in place and makes sure it is close enough to the skin to allow electrical information to be sent from the device. A well may be drilled into the bone behind the ear so the implant is less likely to move under the skin.\n\nAfter surgery:\n\n* There will be stitches behind the ear.\n* You may be able to feel the receiver as a bump behind the ear.\n* Any shaved hair should grow back.\n* The outside part of the device will be placed 1 to 4 weeks after surgery to give the opening time to heal.\n\n**RISKS OF SURGERY**\n\nA cochlear implant is a relatively safe surgery. However, all surgeries pose some risks. Risks are less common now that the surgery is performed through a small surgical cut, but may include:\n\n* Wound healing problems\n* Skin breakdown over the implanted device\n* Infection near the implant site\n\nLess common complications include:\n\n* Damage to the nerve that moves the face on the side of the operation\n* Leakage of the fluid around the brain (cerebrospinal fluid)\n* Infection of the fluid around the brain (meningitis)\n* Temporary dizziness (vertigo)\n* Failure of the device to work\n* Abnormal taste\n\n**RECOVERY AFTER SURGERY**\n\nYou may be admitted to the hospital overnight for observation. However, many hospitals now allow people to go home the day of surgery. Your surgeon will give you pain medicines and sometimes antibiotics to prevent infection. Many surgeons place a large dressing over the operated ear. The dressing is removed the day after surgery.\n\nA week or more after surgery, the outside part of the cochlear implant is secured to the receiver-stimulator that was implanted behind the ear. At this point, you will be able to use the device.\n\nOnce the surgery site is well healed, and the implant is attached to the outside processor, you will begin to work with specialists to learn to \"hear\" and process sound using the cochlear implant. These specialists may include:\n\n* Audiologists\n* Speech therapists\n* ENT doctors\n\nThis is a very important part of the process. You will need to work closely with your team of specialists to get the most benefit from the implant.\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nResults with cochlear implants vary widely. How well you do depends on:\n\n* The condition of your hearing nerve before surgery\n* Your mental abilities\n* The device being used\n* The length of time you were deaf\n* The surgery\n\nSome people can learn to communicate on the telephone. Others can only recognize sound. Getting the maximum results can take up to several years, and you need to be motivated. Many people are enrolled in hearing and speech rehabilitation programs.\n\n**LIVING WITH AN IMPLANT**\n\nOnce you have healed, there are few restrictions. Most activities are allowed. However, your provider may tell you to avoid contact sports to lessen the chance of injury to the implanted device.\n\nMost people with cochlear implants cannot get MRI scans, because the implant is made of metal.\n\n---\n\n**Cochlear Implant**\n\nA cochlear implant is a small electronic device that helps people hear.

    "content": "**Coconut Oil**\n\n**What is it?**\nCoconut oil comes from the nut (fruit) of the coconut palm. It contains medium-chain fatty acids, including capric acid, caprylic acid, and lauric acid.\n\nAbout 52% to 85% of coconut oil is made up of specific saturated fats, called medium-chain fatty acids. It has a moisturizing effect when applied to the skin.\n\nPeople commonly use coconut oil for eczema and growth in premature infants. It's also used for psoriasis, obesity, breast cancer, heart disease, MS, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Applying coconut oil to the skin can reduce eczema symptoms in children more than applying mineral oil.\n\t+ Growth and development in premature infants. Applying coconut oil to the skin of premature infants might improve body temperature, breathing, skin health, and overall growth.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* When taken by mouth: Coconut oil is commonly consumed in foods. But coconut oil contains a type of fat (saturated fat) that can increase cholesterol levels. Like all saturated fats, it should be consumed in moderation. Coconut oil is possibly safe when used as a medicine short-term.\n* When applied to the skin: Coconut oil is likely safe when applied to the skin.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Coconut oil is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut oil is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.\n* Children: Coconut oil is possibly safe when applied to the skin for about one month. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut oil is safe for children when taken by mouth as a medicine.\n* High cholesterol: Coconut oil contains a type of fat that can increase cholesterol levels. Regularly eating meals containing coconut oil can increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nIt is not known if this product interacts with any medicines. Before taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n* Blond psyllium: Psyllium might reduce the amount of fat that the body absorbs from coconut oil.\n* Chlorogenic acid: Coconut oil might increase the amount of chlorogenic acid that the body absorbs from supplements.\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nCoconut oil has most often been used by adults in doses of 20-60 mL by mouth daily for up to 4 months. Coconut oil is also used as a topical oil or moisturizer and is found in some cosmetics. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n---\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\nSome coconut oil products are referred to as \"virgin\" coconut oil, which usually means they haven't been bleached, deodorized, or refined. But there aren't any specific industry standards. \"Cold pressed\" coconut oil means that it's been pressed without a heat source.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nCoconut oil has most often been used by adults in doses of 20-60 mL by mouth daily for up to 4 months. Coconut oil is also used as a topical oil or moisturizer and is found in some cosmetics.

    "content": "**Coconut Water**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\nCoconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts (Cocos nucifera). As the coconut matures, the water is replaced by coconut meat.\n\nCoconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Because of these electrolytes, there’s a lot of interest in using coconut water to treat and prevent dehydration. Coconut water is sometimes called green coconut water because the immature coconuts are green.\n\nPeople commonly use coconut water as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. It’s also used for high blood pressure and athletic performance, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\nDon’t confuse coconut water with coconut or coconut oil. These are not the same. Also, coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is made from a mixture of the grated meat of a mature coconut.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using coconut water for a number of purposes, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and is likely safe. It’s usually well-tolerated.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut water is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\nChildren: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and seems to be safe for children. As medicine, it’s possibly safe when used appropriately.\n\nCystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis can lower salt levels in the body. Some people with cystic fibrosis need to take fluids or pills to increase salt (sodium) levels. Coconut water doesn’t contain enough salt to increase salt levels in people with cystic fibrosis. Also, it might contain too much potassium. Don't drink coconut water as way to increase salt levels if you have cystic fibrosis.\n\nHigh levels of potassium in the blood: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Don't drink coconut water if you have high levels of potassium in the blood.\n\nKidney problems: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Normally, potassium is excreted in the urine if blood levels get too high. But this doesn’t happen if the kidneys aren’t working normally. If you have kidney problems, talk to your healthcare provider before taking coconut water.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\nCoconut water is also known as green coconut water.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Methodology**\nThe information in this article was compiled from various sources, including scientific studies and expert opinions. The effectiveness of coconut water for treating dehydration and other conditions has not been extensively studied, so the available evidence is limited.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\nFor a list of references used to compile this article, please see the MedlinePlus Supplements reference list.\n\n---\n\n**Coconut Water: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Interactions**\n\n*   **Medications for high blood pressure**: Coconut water might lower blood pressure. Taking coconut water along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low.\n*   **Medications for diabetes**: Coconut water might lower blood sugar levels.

It is a source of vitamins A and D and a fat called omega-3.\n\nCod liver oil contains certain \"fatty acids\" that prevent the blood from clotting easily. These fatty acids also reduce pain and swelling.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\n* Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n* The effectiveness ratings for COD LIVER OIL are as follows:\n\t+ Possibly ineffective for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Taking cod liver oil by mouth does not seem to help prevent COVID-19.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\n* When taken by mouth: Cod liver oil is likely safe for most adults. It can cause side effects including heartburn, stomach upset, and nausea. High doses of cod liver oil are possibly unsafe.\n* When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if cod liver oil is safe or what the side effects might be.\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Cod liver oil is possibly safe when used in amounts that provide no more than the recommended daily intakes of vitamin A and vitamin D. Cod liver oil is possibly unsafe when taken in larger amounts.\n* Children: Cod liver oil is likely safe for most children when taken by mouth in amounts that provide no more than the recommended daily intakes of vitamin A and vitamin D. Cod liver oil is possibly unsafe when taken in larger amounts.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\n* Moderate\n\t+ Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs): Cod liver oil might lower blood sugar levels.\n\t+ Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs): Cod liver oil might lower blood pressure.\n\t+ Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs): Cod liver oil might slow blood clotting.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\n* Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure: Cod liver oil might lower blood pressure. Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much.\n* Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar: Cod liver oil might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much.\n\nNote: The above text has been formatted for better readability, with bold headings and bullet points added for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Cod Liver Oil**\n\n**Herbs and Supplements that Might Lower Blood Sugar**\n\n* Cod liver oil might lower blood sugar.\n* Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might lower blood sugar too much.\n* Examples of supplements with this effect include:\n\t+ Aloe\n\t+ Bitter melon\n\t+ Cassia cinnamon\n\t+ Chromium\n\t+ Prickly pear cactus\n\n**Herbs and Supplements that Might Slow Blood Clotting**\n\n* Cod liver oil might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding.\n* Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people.\n* Examples of supplements with this effect include:\n\t+ Garlic\n\t+ Ginger\n\t+ Ginkgo\n\t+ Nattokinase\n\t+ Panax ginseng\n\n**Herbs and Supplements that Might Lower Blood Pressure**\n\n* Cod liver oil might lower blood pressure.\n* Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much.\n* Examples of supplements with this effect include:\n\t+ Andrographis\n\t+ Casein peptides\n\t+ L-arginine\n\t+ Niacin\n\t+ Stinging nettle\n\n**How is it Typically Used?**\n\n* Cod liver oil has most often been used by adults in doses of 15-20 mL by mouth daily for up to 4 months.\n* Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* Aceite de Higado de Bacalao\n* Acides Gras Oméga 3\n* Acides Gras N-3\n* Acides Gras Polyinsaturés\n* Cod Oil\n* Fish Liver Oil\n* Fish Oil\n* Halibut Liver Oil\n* Huile de Foie\n* Huile de Foie de Flétan\n* Huile de Foie de Morue\n* Huile de Foie de Poisson\n* Huile de Morue\n* Huile de Poisson\n* Liver Oil\n* N-3 Fatty Acids\n* Omega 3\n* Oméga 3\n* Omega 3 Fatty Acids\n* Omega-3\n* Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n* Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids\n\n**References**\n\n* Brunvoll SH, Nygaard AB, Ellingjord-Dale M, et al.

    "content": "**Codeine: A Prescription Medication for Pain Relief**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\nCodeine is a prescription medication used to relieve pain and cough. It belongs to a class of medications called opioids.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\nTake codeine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, take it more often, take it for a longer period of time, or take it in a different way than directed.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\nCodeine is also used to treat coughs and colds. However, its use in children younger than 18 years of age is generally not recommended due to the risk of serious breathing problems.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\nTell your doctor if you have a history of slowed breathing, asthma, lung disease, head injury, brain tumor, or any condition that increases pressure in your brain. Codeine may cause serious breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment and when the dose is increased.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\nThere are no specific dietary instructions for codeine.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\nCodeine may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\nStore codeine in a safe place where no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets or solution are left so you will know if any medication is missing.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\nCodeine may interact with other medications, increasing the risk of serious side effects. Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medications you are taking. Additionally, drinking alcohol or using street drugs during codeine treatment increases the risk of serious side effects.\n\n---\n\n**Codeine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Serious Breathing Problems**\n    If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n        *   Slowed breathing\n        *   Long pauses between breaths\n        *   Shortness of breath\n    When codeine was used in children, serious and life-threatening breathing problems such as slow or difficulty breathing and deaths were reported. Codeine is generally not used to treat pain or a cough in children younger than 18 years of age. If your child is currently prescribed a cough and cold medicine containing codeine, talk to your child's doctor about other treatments.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Do Not Share Your Medication**\n    Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Codeine may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Store codeine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep codeine out of the reach of children. Keep track of how many tablets or how much solution are left so you will know if any medication is missing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Interactions with Other Medications**\n    Taking certain medications during your treatment with codeine may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take codeine with other medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care:\n        *   Unusual dizziness\n        *   Lightheadedness\n        *   Extreme sleepiness\n        *   Slowed or difficult breathing\n        *   Unresponsiveness\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Alcohol and Street Drugs**\n    Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with codeine also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol, take prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or use street drugs during your treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**\n    Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take codeine regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms:\n        *   Irritability\n        *   Hyperactivity\n        *   Abnormal sleep\n        *   High-pitched cry\n        *   Uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body\n        *   Vomiting\n        *   Diarrhea\n        *   Failure to gain weight\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Medication Guide**\n    Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with codeine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Habit Forming**\n    Codeine may be habit forming, especially with prolonged use. Take codeine exactly as directed. Do not take more of it, take it more often, take it for a longer period of time, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor. While taking codeine, discuss with your healthcare provider your pain treatment goals, length of treatment, and other ways to manage your pain. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse codeine if you have or have ever had any of these conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Breathing Problems**\n    Codeine may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take codeine. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, brain tumor, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain.

    "content": "**Cognitive Testing**\n\n_Cognitive testing checks for problems with certain brain functions called \"cognition.\" Cognition includes thinking, learning, remembering, and using judgment and language. Problems with cognition are called \"cognitive impairment.\"_\n\n_There are many different cognitive tests that check for cognitive impairment. They generally involve answering questions and doing simple tasks, such as repeating lists of words or spelling words backwards. The most commonly used tests usually take 15 minutes or less._\n\n_Cognitive impairment is more common among older people, but it's not a normal part of aging. It can be caused by many medical and mental health conditions. Some of these conditions may be treatable, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), depression, and side effects from medicine._\n\n_Treating these conditions may improve cognitive impairment or cure it completely. But cognitive impairment caused by dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, has no cure and gets worse over time._\n\n_Cognitive testing alone can't diagnose dementia or any other cause of cognitive impairment. But the test results can show whether you have a problem with how your brain is functioning that needs more testing. That helps your health care provider order the right tests to learn more about your cognitive impairment and whether it can be treated. Even if the cause of cognitive impairment can't be treated, the information you gain from cognitive testing can help you and your family plan for your future care._\n\n**What Is It Used For?**\n\n_Cognitive testing is used if a person shows signs of a problem with memory, thinking, or other brain functions. The test show if a person has a problem that requires more testing._\n\n_Cognitive testing is often used to screen older adults for a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI may notice that they have more trouble with memory than other people their age. They may lose things more often or have more trouble coming up with words for what they want to say. But they're still able to do their usual daily activities._\n\n**Why Do I Need Cognitive Testing?**\n\n_You may need cognitive testing if you show signs of cognitive impairment.

They all involve answering questions and usually doing some simple tasks._\n\n_Commonly used tests include:_\n\n_* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. This test takes about 15 minutes. It includes memorizing a short list of words, copying a drawing of a shape or object, and looking at pictures of animals and saying which animals you see._\n_* Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). This test takes about 10 minutes. It includes knowing what date it is, counting backward, and identifying everyday objects, such as a pencil or watch_\n_* Mini-Cog.

Colchicine is also used to relieve the pain of gout attacks when they occur. Colchicine is also used to treat familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; an inborn condition that causes episodes of fever, pain, and swelling of the stomach area, lungs, and joints) in adults and children 4 years of age and older. Colchicine (Lodoco®) is used to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death, and needing certain types of heart procedures such as angioplasty (a type of heart surgery to widen a blocked artery) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; a type of heart surgery) in patients who have atherosclerosis (narrowing of the blood vessels from fatty deposits) or who have multiple risk factors for developing heart and blood vessel disease. Colchicine is not a pain reliever and cannot be used to treat pain that is not caused by gout or FMF.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nColchicine comes as a capsule, tablet and solution (liquid; Gloperba®) to take by mouth with or without food. When colchicine is used to prevent gout attacks or to treat FMF, it is usually taken once or twice a day. When colchicine is used to relieve the pain of a gout attack, 2 tablets are usually taken at the first sign of pain and one tablet is usually taken one hour later. If you do not experience relief or have another attack within several days after treatment, talk to your doctor before taking additional doses of medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take colchicine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you will be taking colchicine oral solution (Gloperba®), use an oral syringe, dosing spoon, or dosing cup (measuring device) to accurately measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose; do not use a household spoon. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you need help getting or using a measuring device.\n\nIf you are taking colchicine to treat FMF, your doctor may start you on a low dose and gradually increase your dose. Your doctor may decrease your dose if you experience side effects.\n\nIf you are taking colchicine to prevent gout attacks, call your doctor right away if you experience a gout attack during your treatment. Your doctor may tell you to take an extra dose of colchicine, followed by a smaller dose one hour later. If you take extra doses of colchicine to treat a gout attack, you should not take your next scheduled dose of colchicine until at least 12 hours have passed since you took the extra doses.\n\nColchicine can prevent attacks of gout and control FMF only as long as you take the medication. Continue to take colchicine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking colchicine without talking to your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Colchicine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**How should I take colchicine?**\n\nContinue to take colchicine even if you feel well.

Continue to take colchicine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking colchicine without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What special precautions should I follow when taking colchicine?**\n\nBefore taking colchicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to colchicine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in colchicine tablets, capsules, or solution. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or check the medication guide for a list of ingredients.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with colchicine. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting colchicine with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking colchicine, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking colchicine. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease or if you have blood problems. Your doctor may tell you not to take colchicine.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking colchicine, call your doctor.\n\nColchicine may decrease fertility in men. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking colchicine.\n\n\\n\\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow when taking colchicine?**\n\nDo not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice during your treatment with colchicine.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose of colchicine?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If you are taking colchicine on a regular basis and it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\nIf you are taking colchicine (Colcrys) to treat an attack of gout that happened while you were taking colchicine to prevent gout attacks and you forget to take the second dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. Then wait at least 12 hours before taking your next scheduled dose of colchicine.\n\n---\n\n**Colchicine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Taking Colchicine**\n\nIf you are taking colchicine on a regular basis and it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule.

Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nIt is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community.

    "content": "**Cold Stimulation Test**\n\n\\n\\nA cold stimulation test involves placing your fingers in ice water and checking to see how long it takes your skin to return to a normal temperature. This test is used to find out if you have Raynaud phenomenon.\n\n**What is Raynaud Phenomenon?**\n\nRaynaud phenomenon, also known as Raynaud disease or Raynaud syndrome, is a condition that causes brief episodes or \"attacks\" where your blood vessels (the tubes that your blood flows through) narrow. This decreases the blood flow to certain parts of your body.\n\n**Types of Raynaud Phenomenon**\n\nThere are two types of Raynaud phenomenon:\n\n*   **Primary Raynaud Phenomenon**: Is the more common type and is often milder. Has no known cause. A family history of the disease and being a woman may increase your risk for this type. Symptoms usually start before age 30, often during the teenage years.\n*   **Secondary Raynaud Phenomenon**: Is usually caused by another health condition, such as a rheumatic disease like lupus or scleroderma, carpal tunnel syndrome, or disorders of the immune system, connective tissue, or arteries.\n\n**What Happens During a Cold Stimulation Test?**\n\nA small device that measures temperature will be taped to your fingers. Your provider will record the temperature. You will then place your hands into an ice water bath for 20 seconds. You will remove your hands from the ice water. Your provider will record your finger temperature every five minutes for up to 20 minutes, or until your temperature returns to the same as it was before the ice water bath.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a cold stimulation test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nYou may feel some discomfort while your hands are in the ice water.\n\n---\n\n**Cold Stimulation Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA cold stimulation test involves placing your fingers in ice water and checking to see how long it takes your skin to return to a normal temperature. This test is used to find out if you have Raynaud phenomenon.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why do I need a cold stimulation test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon. Its symptoms usually show up after exposure to cold or emotional stress. You may also have them after smoking cigarettes or vaping. These symptoms mostly affect fingers and toes and can include:\n\n*   Skin that turns white or blue (although this can be harder to see if you have darker skin)\n*   Skin that is numb, painful, or stinging once it starts to warm up\n*   Skin that takes a long time to warm up after exposure\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What happens during a cold stimulation test?**\n\nA small device that measures temperature will be taped to your fingers. Your provider will record the temperature. You will then place your hands into an ice water bath for 20 seconds. You will remove your hands from the ice water. Your provider will record your finger temperature every five minutes for up to 20 minutes, or until your temperature returns to the same as it was before the ice water bath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a cold stimulation test.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nYou may feel some discomfort while your hands are in the ice water.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nIf it takes 20 minutes or more for your finger temperature to return to normal after the ice water bath, it probably means you have Raynaud phenomenon. If your symptoms are severe and/or you are age 35 or older, you may have secondary Raynaud phenomenon.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about a cold stimulation test?**\n\nThere are steps you can take that may help you avoid or reduce the symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon, including:\n\n*   Dressing extra warmly for cold weather. This includes wearing a hat, mittens, scarf, and heavy socks.\n*   Wearing gloves when you are holding cold items.\n*   Using battery- or chemical-operated hand and/or foot warmers.\n*   Turning down air conditioning and wearing a sweater or jacket when in an air-conditioned space.\n*   Getting regular exercise, which increases blood flow.\n*   Limiting caffeine and alcohol.\n*   Avoiding stress.\n*   Quitting smoking (if you smoke). Nicotine in cigarettes can cause your blood vessels to narrow, increasing the chance of an episode.\n*   Talking to your provider about the medicines you take, since some medicines can bring on episodes.\n\n---\n\n**Managing Raynaud Phenomenon**\n\nIf you have primary Raynaud phenomenon, making some lifestyle changes may help manage your symptoms. These include:\n\n*   Quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke\n*   Avoiding cold temperatures\n*   Dressing warmly in cold weather\n*   Avoiding stress\n*   Getting regular exercise\n\nYou should also talk to your provider about the medicines you take, since some medicines can bring on episodes.\n\nIf your symptoms are causing too much discomfort, or if you have secondary Raynaud phenomenon, your provider may also prescribe medicines that can help open your blood vessels. For severe cases, your provider may recommend a procedure to destroy the nerves that trigger blood vessel narrowing in the affected areas of your body.\n\n**References**\n\nAleksiev T, Ivanova Z, Dobrev H.
